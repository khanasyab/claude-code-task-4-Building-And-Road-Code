GUIDELINEs ON FLOOD DISASTER MITIGATION FOR HIGHWAY ENGINEERS
INTRODUCTION
The scope of the Guidelines on Flood Disaster Mitigation for Highway Engineers is limited to planning, 
design, construction and maintenance of roads and related infrastructure works in flood prone 
areas. It provides a general understanding of design-led approach to flood disaster mitigation with 
understanding of the associated hazards, vulnerabilities and risks. Pre and post disaster-responses 
and emergency works as related to the construction and maintenance of roads and road infrastructure 
in flood affected areas are covered. 
The guidelines  was under the consideration of Disaster Management Committee (G-6) since January 
2015. The draft was discussed by G-6 Committee in a number of meetings. The G-6 Committee also 
constituted a Sub-Committee under the Chairmanship of Mrs. Minimol Korulla to draft / modify the 
chapters of Guidelines on Flood Disaster Mitigation for Highway Engineers for consideration of the 
G-6 Committee. 
The Disaster Management Committee (list of personnel given below) in its meeting held on 
20th June, 2017 finalized the Guidelines and recommended its submission to General Specifications 
and Standards Committee (GSS) for their consideration

PROLOGUE
Need for Guidelines
There was a time when highway engineers were chiefly concerned with Storm Water Drainage 
(SWD) to ensure efficient drainage of roads and highways to deal with floods in the monsoon 
season. With the growing urbanization, land scarcity and population pressure, especially in 
the riverine, hilly and coastal areas, floods began to pose a major threat to the highways and 
the associated infrastructure in large parts of India. Gradually the threats of flood disasters 
have become so severe that integration of flood disaster mitigation with development planning 
is now a part of the stated policy of the Government of India. Flooding occurrences because 
of the factors such as urbanization, Extreme Weather Events, landslides, cyclones, storm 
surges and tsunamis are now receiving exceptional attention.
As our development plans get rolled out, we will have more and more of townships, roads, 
railway lines, tunnels, bridges, water resources projects including irrigation and hydroelectric 
projects and associated multi-purpose infrastructure in these very flood and flood-induced 
landslide prone areas. The challenges of planning and design of flood safe roads become 
even more daunting when earthquakes and landslides in turn add to the fury of floods on hill 
roads causing death and destruction, and hampering rescue and relief operations1. 
National Disaster Management Guidelines-Management of Floods
India has the weight of history and richness of experience in dealing with flood disasters 
but flood disaster mitigation issues related to highway engineering have yet to receive a 
focused attention. Even in the National Disaster Management Guidelines on Management 
of Floods, published by National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in January 2008 
after years of hard work involving 10 experts in the Core Group; 35 experts in the Extended 
Group and 162 other experts and stakeholders, the hardcore highway engineering related 
issues fell out of its scope. On the brighter side, the national vision articulated by the 
NDMA is “to minimize the vulnerability to floods and the consequent loss of lives, livelihood 
systems, property and damage to infrastructure and public utilities and build a safer India 
by developing holistic, pro-active, multi-disaster and technology driven strategy for Disaster 
Management”. The recommendations made in the Guidelines, also  underscored the need for 
tightening of the techno-legal regime, enaction of legislation to  curb unauthorized crossings 
and encroachments over drains, promotion of remote sensing techniques operated through 
artificial satellites, hazard mapping of areas affected by drainage congestion, recognition 
of embankment induced flooding and recourse to improved  forecasting and early warning 
systems.
National Disaster Management Plan-Management of Floods
Upon release of the National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP) by the Prime Minister of 
India in June 2016, the national expectation is that “Every Ministry and every Department 
1	
The Kashmir earthquake of 2005 and the Sikkim earthquake of 18 September, 2011 triggered 
landslides causing floods on the roads which hampered the rescue and relief operations.

should mainstream disaster preparedness and mitigation as a part of their development 
Plans”. Naturally, the flood disaster mitigation has become one of the major concerns in 
highway engineering particularly because the national plan does not emphasize that the 
flood disasters we face are more human-induced than natural. It is, therefore, essential 
that factors such as disorderly urbanization, non-engineered and ill-legal constructions, 
unchecked quarrying and mining, and human violence against nature all begin to matter in 
highway planning, design and construction.
Ministry of Urban Development is the nodal agency for urban floods and Ministry of Water 
Resources as the nodal ministry for riverine floods, but very little attention is currently being 
paid to floods affecting roads because of factors such as for example, Glacial Lake Outburst 
Floods which are of a major concern in design of high altitude roads.
In the real life situations, one type of hazard can trigger another type of hazard and many of 
our roads get affected by, for instance, flood induced landslides or landslide induced floods. 
Many of our roads are threatened by multiple hazards (floods included).It is our engineering 
obligation that all roads get certified as safe not only against floods, but against multiple 
hazards.
Findings of the Flooding related Task Forces and Committees
It is also the time that highway engineers benefit from the reports of flood-disasters driven Task 
Forces and Committees constituted by the Government of India from time to time. The NDMA 
Guidelines on Floods, inter alia, refers to a number of documents including the Flood Policy 
Statement of 1954; Revised Policy Statement of 1964 and National Water Policy of 1987; 
and the reports of the Ministers Committee of 1964; National Commission of 1999; Working 
Group on Flood Control Programme of X Five Year Plan of 2001, B.K. Mittal Committee of 
2002 and the Rangachari and the C.B. Vashistha Committees of 2003. 
Recently, in August 2016, the National Disaster Management Authority once again constituted 
an Expert Committee2 to visit the flood affected regions of Bihar in order to carry out assessment 
of flooding in many parts of the state due to the siltation problem. The Forum on Engineering 
Interventions for Disaster Mitigation of the Indian National Academy of Engineering, likewise, 
deliberated intensively on urban flood disaster mitigation in 2016 after massive floods of 
2015 in Chennai. The scope of these studies did not cover the field of highway engineering.
IS 13739:1993- provides Guidelines for Estimation of Flood Damages. Inter alia, it suggests 
methods to quantify losses.
Flood Vulnerability of the vast expanse of the Indian Road Network
At its independence, India inherited a poor network of roads, most of which were single lane, 
until about 1988. At that time India was without Express ways. All it had was about a couple of 
hundred kilometers of 4-lane highways. The year 1989 turned out to be a game changer with

the establishment of NHAI on 15 June 1989 as an autonomous body by an Act of Parliament. 
Today, India’s road network is the second largest road network in the world which will soon 
approach 0.7 km of roads per square kilometer of land. Many of these roads pass through 
areas prone to cyclones, floods, landslides and earthquakes. Naturally, the flood-safety of 
our roads deserves the highest priority.
The Challenges facing the Indian Highway Engineers
There are several factors which makes India’s roads different from those of the rest of world. 
Our roads are an unholy mix of most modern, all season, 4-lane-highways on the one hand 
to the unpaved roads and narrow track roads on the other hand. Most of our roads in different 
geo-climatic settings are vulnerable to hazards of different types, including flood hazards. 
Although at the project formulation stage, the national plan directs us to integrate road 
planning and development with disaster management, yet in the current engineering practice 
that seldom happens. Also, once a highway project gets completed, the considerations of 
flood hazard mitigation get relegated to the back-burner. There are hardly any investments 
in prevention and mitigation of flood disasters which is why our roads and road infrastructure 
suffer hugely because of flood disasters.
Implications of Rapid Pace of Development
The flood hazard mitigation strategies are significantly influenced by the rapid pace of 
development. There are several factors which makes India’s roads different from those of the 
rest of world. Our roads are an unholy mix of most modern, all season, 4-lane-highways on 
the one hand to the unpaved roads and narrow track roads on the other hand. In different geo-
climatic settings, they are vulnerable to hazards of different types, including flood hazards. In 
response, at the project formulation stage, we must integrate road planning and development 
with disaster management. Once the project gets completed, then also, considerations of road 
safety against multiple hazards must receive attention of the project authorities. Currently, 
there are hardly any investments in prevention and mitigation of flood disasters which is why 
our roads and road infrastructure suffer hugely and the recovery is painfully slow.
Flood Vulnerability of Roads in Urban Areas
If the present trends are any indicator, urban areas in India are rapidly expanding and the 
associated road network is becoming even more vulnerable to urban flooding. Since highway 
engineering planning, design and construction practices have not improved fast enough to 
match with the growing vulnerability of roads to urban floods, it is imperative that the present 
Acts related to Town planning, Industrial zone planning, Land reforms and Transportation 
corridors are expeditiously reviewed and amended. Preservation of water bodies, efficient 
disposal of urban wastes, total ban on encroachments, revamping of existing drainage 
systems, augmentation of surface and sub-surface drainage all need exception attention.

Roads and Road Infrastructure in Hilly Areas
Besides facing poor drainage and flood induced damages, the roads in the hilly areas pose 
a grave threat to safety because of their poor alignments, non-engineered construction, 
extreme weather events, and land sliding. We built Leh-Manali Highway, which ranks among 
the highest in the world, for development and defense needs, but not without taking away a 
part of safety back by creating a fresh set of flood and landslide problems and threats. 
The Chenab Bridge across deep Chenab, between Bakkal and Kauri in Jammu and Kashmir, 
ranks among the tallest rail bridges in the world, and would no doubt enhance mobility , but 
only time will tell, whether the design and construction ensures efficacy of flood and landslide 
risk reduction measures built in the design.
Besides above, attention must also be paid to the growing threat of floods to the numerous 
scary landslide prone mountain roads such as the Kollmalai Ghat Road (46.7 km) on the 
eastern coast of Tamil Nadu with nearly 70 continuous hairpin bends;  Keylong-Kishtwar road 
(233 km) in Himachal Pradesh and the road to Zozi La in the Western Himalayan mountain 
range. All of these are also prone to flooding which may in turn trigger landslides. 
Roads and Road Infrastructure in Coastal Areas
India has very long coast lines and coastal roads are vulnerable to flooding due to sea 
level rise, tidal fluctuations, cyclonic storm surges, extreme weather events and tsunamis. 
Road designs and flood protection measures have to recognize the fact that the boundary 
dividing land mass from the seawater is hard to demarcate as it varies with the tide, wind 
direction, wind flow, wave height and the variations in coastal slope. The engineering practice 
of protection of coastal roads against flooding must necessarily account for uniqueness of 
the geological and anthropogenic environments and dynamics of physical processes over 
short and long periods of time.
Lessons in Road Safety against Floods 
The recommendations made by a large number of  Committees in their reports submitted to 
the Government of India from time to time need revisiting in the light of widespread devastation 
caused to the roads, by flood disasters of the past decade , especially in the States of Assam, 
Bihar, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Gujarat. As recently as July 2017, Army and Air Force 
had to be called in to take care of the deluge caused by flooding in many districts of Gujarat. 
More than 100 internal roads and at least 19 State Highways were blocked because of heavy 
water logging3. Road network in many parts of Bihar is in shambles only because no serious 
effort has been made to prevent flood disasters.
By hind sight, it is obvious that we could have learned much more from the road failures 
and used those very lessons in designing safer roads. In 2014, flood disasters in Kashmir, 
Himachal, Bihar, West Bengal and Uttarakhand delivered the message yet again that post 
disaster relief and rescue operations get badly affected by road failures. During the Kashmir

floods of 2014, roads in many areas like Indira Nagar and Shiv Pura were submerged under 
several meters of water bringing the life to a grinding halt.
With dozens of major development projects in the pipeline, like the Smart City flagship 
project of the Government of India, lessons must be learnt from the past experience. Take for 
example the city of Chennai which ranks 18 in the list of Smart cities. The roads of Chennai 
are vulnerable to floods, tsunamis, tidal surges, and coastal erosion. The city was severely 
affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami of December, 2004 and the flood disasters of 2005 and 
2015. Severe flooding of roads in the area surrounding Perumbakkam occurred because of 
the construction of the IT Corridor on the filled-up lake. The flooding of Mudichur, Velachery, 
and several other areas was due to encroachment of the wetlands and the river basins. 
Transportation system got paralysed when the major bus terminal Koyambedu got flooded. 
The Chennai airport was also affected by flooding because it is built on the floodplains of 
the River Adyar. Why should we be surprised by the impact of floods on the Mass Rapid 
Transit System and the related road network over the Buckingham Canal, built after ignoring 
the adverse engineering implications of impaired drainage due to filling the erstwhile water 
bodies? It is a fact that the filling of about 300 water bodies and 16 tanks of the Vyasarpadi 
chain downstream of Rettai Eri has altered the hydrology and drainage of the area and yet 
this fact that was more or less ignored in the design of roads and highway infrastructure. 
Technological Interventions in Flood Management- The Future Trends
In future, Highway Engineers will necessarily have to fight flood disasters on many fronts over 
a range of issues connected with planning, design, construction, maintenance, protection 
and safety of road and road infrastructure. Our attention must therefore go to judicious use of 
smart construction materials and technologies, conscientious implementation of projects and 
programs and zero tolerance for non-engineered constructions. Some of the technologies 
and ideas which are not covered in the Guidelines may prove game changers. The following 
are a few examples:
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or Drones and Hot air balloons are finding sensational 
applications in flood disaster management and India can immensely benefit from their 
effective use, especially for real-time flood hazard and inundation mapping, video-filming, 
damage assessment and monitoring of the progress of rescue, relief and remedial works. 
Remote controlled and Programmed Drones have been effectively used for pre and post 
disaster investigations, surveys of flood prone areas, delivery of supplies, reaching out to 
inaccessible areas and for providing surveillance.
Exploiting the Potential of Space Technologies
Space technologies Landsat-TM and SPOT images are a big boon in flood hazard and 
inundation mapping. Landsat-TM and SPOT images have been used to study geo-hydrology of 
landmasses. Earth Observation Satellites provide comprehensive coverage of flood affected

infrastructure across large areas in real time. High resolution images are now our best hope 
to produce large scale credible flood hazard maps. The volume, veracity, velocity and variety 
of big data on extreme weather events and flood prone areas can now be analyzed in the 
times of peace for easy retrieval and use in the times of crisis. Next time when floods destroy 
bridges and roads in different parts of our country, it should be possible to instantly recall 
all the related information on previous events for improved decision making. For managing 
satellite based big data to improve planning and design of roads and road infrastructure, we 
have to grow and harness artificial intelligence.
Technologies for Monitoring Flood Induced Scouring of Bridge Piers 
Scouring of bridge piers because of excessive flooding often result in bridge failures. We 
need technologies to inspect and track scouring of bridge foundations in real time for timely 
corrective action. Physical inspection of the foundations of such bridges, especially if unsafe, 
is neither feasible nor a good idea. Highway engineers in the USA have already developed 
technologies which can facilitate condition monitoring of pier foundations threatened by 
scouring. Also, automated instrumentation systems mounted on driverless vehicles hold 
promise for relatively risk free condition monitoring and robot managed repair work.
Intelligent Transportation Systems in Flood Management
Intelligent transportation systems, well tested telecommunication and Vehicular Ad hoc 
Networks (VANETs) are finding increasing demand in flood disaster management. By 
introducing community based traffic applications, the drivers will be able to share real time 
data on traffic flow, road accidents, flooding related information, and locate the nearest safe 
parking. Also, by field instrumentation and monitoring of floods, it is now possible to pro-actively 
ensure the safety of evacuation areas, police and fire stations and hospitals. The concept 
of Intelligent Streets promises emergency alerts, digital warnings, and display of evacuation 
routes and recording of rising water level by lamp-posts. In the event of unacceptable levels 
of flooding, public transportation system will be automatically shut. In the event of a road 
accidents and flood trapped vehicles, there will be no need to call police or ambulance as the 
vehicle itself will do the reporting.
Intelligent River Information Systems are already benefiting National Waterway 1 on River 
Ganges; Farakka to Patna-Phase 2 and Patna to Varanasi-Phase 3. The IRIS should be 
integrated with flood-disaster risk reduction strategies.
Smart Materials for Flood Prone Areas
Impervious road surfaces and clogged storm water drains often lead to a situation where 
flooding becomes inescapable, especially in the urban areas. It has been amply demonstrated 
that the roads paved with permeable concrete product called Top mix can absorb 880 gallons 
of water in one minute to counter inundation effect and make driveways, pavements, walkways 
and parking areas flood-safe. Similarly holistic drainage solutions making efficient use of 
different variants of Geo-synthetics can significantly reduce flood proneness of urban areas

by augmenting drainage. Central and State Governments should launch projects aimed at 
upgrading, supplementing or replacing non-functional Storm Water Drainage Systems by 
promoting large scale applications of smart materials and technologies. Can we develop 
such technologies and make them cost effective in routine highway engineering practice? In 
areas of high risks due to flooding, use of such technologies leading to more efficient drainage 
systems seem inescapable. One highly significant application area is to make use of smart 
materials to make our parking lots in strategic areas free from flooding. In the patented 
process, the Top mix Permeable is applied over a base layer of gravel and the flood water is 
allowed to either permeate into the ground below or is diverted elsewhere, over a period of 
time, through a series of pipes
Technologies for Swift Responses to Flood-Induced Road Failures
Technologies for dealing flood emergencies have captured global imagination. It is unfortunate 
that the tetra pod technology though time-tested for decade is yet to influence the Indian 
engineering practice, likewise, there are a number of technologies which can facilitate quick 
restoration of roads destroyed by floods and landslides. These need to be developed and 
made accessible to the first responders.
Technologies for Management of Potholes to Reduce Flood Risks
Every year, dozens of people die because of the invisible pot holes in the flooded roads. 
Why not think of innovative solutions deploying smart, easy to implement and possibly self-
healing technologies capable of quick -repair of roads and road infra-structure. The School 
of Engineering at the University of Cardiff, in Wales are already studying (1) shape-memory 
polymers activated by electrical current (2) healing agents made from organic and inorganic 
compounds and (3) capsules containing bacteria and healing agents. We need to develop 
our own technologies to meet our situation specific diverse requirements.
Synergistic Action in Securing Protection against Floods
Success of project implementation chiefly depends on well timed, coordinated action by the 
concerned implementation agencies. The principle of Synergism underlines that cooperative 
pro-active action of discrete agencies can yield total effect greater than sum of two or more 
activities taken independently.  Take the example of unprecedented floods in 1968 and 1972 
at mile 9 on the Siliguri Gangtok road. Each time a good length of the road was destroyed, and 
consequently the corrective measures were taken to restore the road in a piecemeal manner, 
without much of a relief.  It was only in 1974 that a conscientious effort was made by the 
various field authorities to implement all important works including drainage in a coordinated 
fashion, in a single working season.  The measures included lined catch water drains, a 
vented causeway and side drains, formation cutting and filling, restraining structures like 
retaining walls and check walls, buttressed toe wall with stone pitched apron, terracing and 
turfing of slopes.  The road failure could thus be prevented.

The Main Thrust of the Disaster Management Committee (G-6) of IRC
The scope of the flood disaster mitigation is huge and the associated challenges are daunting 
as stated above. The added challenges because of the ambitious plans and rapid rate of 
construction underscore the need to ensure that our roads are resilient against all types 
of hazards, including floods. Naturally, the scope of the agenda on disaster risk resilience 
before the highway engineers goes way beyond the scope of these Guidelines restricted to 
some aspects of flood disaster mitigation. Since the scope of coverage on the subject could 
be huge in the expanding world of knowledge, the document in your hands is to be regarded 
as the work in progress- the first step- in the long journey ahead.
In the light of the foregoing, the Disaster Management Committee (G-6) strongly recommends 
that IRC should take suo moto cognizance of the entire sweep of problems related to the 
flood vulnerability of roads and road-infrastructure outlined above and undertake projects 
and programmes with pro-active engagement of all the stakeholders.

CHAPTER 1
general
1.1	
The Indian Flood Hazard Scenario
India’s about 12% of the land area is estimated to be flood prone but the current trends leave 
one in no doubt that the figure needs upward revision. In 1998, the floods affected nearly 
37% of India’s land area and the picture has not improved since. Of the nearly 40 million 
hectares  prone to floods, on an annual average, 7.5 million hectares gets affected causing 
loss of human and animal lives, damaging agriculture crops, destroying houses, roads and 
public utilities, and costing thousands of crores to the Nation4.
There is hardly any part of India which is not flood prone and without history of catastrophic 
flood disasters. Of the India’s 62 major rivers, 18 are highly flood prone and drain an area of 
150 Mha often flooding the roads on their banks. Roads along India’s 5700 km long coastline 
-made of 2700km of the east-coast bordering the Bay of Bengal and 3000 km of the west-
coast bordering the Arabian sea - suffers annually from the damaging meteorological events 
such as tropical cyclones, storm surges, high winds, flooding and coastal erosion. The Bay of 
Bengal and the Arabian Sea together generate about 5-6 tropical cyclone annually, of which 
2-3 could be quite severe. And these often throw the road network in to disarray, slowing 
down the pace of development. This is a matter of serious concern particularly because the 
construction of highways has already reached an all-time high of 6,029 km during FY 2015-
16. The faster pace of road construction in flood prone areas is, therefore, a matter of newly 
emerging challenge.
The vital question to ask is how the highway engineering profession, which has so far not 
succeeded in reducing flood vulnerability of roads, can now do things differently to ensure 
that the ongoing road development, in itself, does not become a disaster? An intensive 
effort is required to counter uncontrolled urbanization, recurring flooding, extremely poor 
road drainage and dysfunctional storm water drainage systems. If we fail to counter flood 
disasters, not only the advantage of high speed corridors will be lost but traffic jams will 
hamper the rescue, evacuation and relief operations in the times of crisis.
It is not always easy to prevent flooding of a poorly designed and hurriedly completed road 
but a lot can be achieved to support the new road projects which are still on the drawing 
table .For instance NHAI plans to take-up 82 highway development projects to connect ports 
under the Bharatmala project. Of the 35000 km of roads to be developed across India at the 
cost of Rs 3 trillion, 21000 km will be economic corridors and 15000 km will be feeder routes. 
Moreover, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways plans to build five more Greenfield 
expressways across the country, which are expected to reduce travel time with improved 
road safety. It is time to convince the nation that all the new road constructions will be free 
from the menace of flooding and other hazards.

1.2	
Classification of Flood Prone Areas
Flood prone areas of India can be broadly fall in (a) Ganga Basin (b) Brahmaputra and Barak 
Basin and (c) Central India and Deccan River Basins.
The Ganga Basin gets flooded by its northern tributaries mostly in the northern parts. The 
worst affected States of the Ganga basin are the States of West Bengal, Bihar and Uttar 
Pradesh, the eastern part of it is also affected by flood in rivers like Sarada, Rapti, Gandak 
and Ghaghra. Floods in river Yamuna affects the states of Haryana and Delhi; and tidal 
surges and insufficient river channels are some of the causes of flooding of rivers Mahanadi, 
Bhagirathi and Damodar in West Bengal.
The banks of rivers Brahmaputra and Barak Basins get frequently flooded due to the rapidly 
changing hydrology and altered landscape of the Brahmaputra and the Barak basins. These 
rivers and their tributaries flood the northeastern states like West Bengal, Assam and Sikkim. 
Jaldakha, Teesta and Torsa rivers in northern West Bengal and rivers in Manipur are also 
known to overflow their banks.
Central India and Deccan Rivers Basins are also greatly affected by floods. Rivers Mahanadi, 
Baitarni and Brahmani play havoc due to flooding in the state of Odisha. The delta region 
formed by these three rivers is highly vulnerable because it is thickly populated. Even some 
small rivers of Kerala and mud streams from the nearby hills add to the fury of floods. Cyclonic 
storms in the deltaic regions of Godavari, Mahanadi and Krishna floods the coastal regions 
of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Tamil Nadu occasionally. Narmada, Godavari, Tapti, Krishna 
and Mahanadi flood Southern and Central India due to heavy rainfall.
1.3	
Types of Floods
Broadly speaking, the floods may be classified as :(a) riverine floods (b) urban area floods 
(c) flash floods, and (d) coastal floods.
Riverine Floods occurs when rivers overtops its banks while in spate due to a variety of 
reasons including heavy rainfall.
Urban Area Floods result from the interplay of a multitude of factors. Encroachment of water 
bodies, blocking and fouling of natural drainage, casual approach to solid waste disposal, 
heavy rainfall, poor drainage system and its neglect are some of the well-known causes. 
Urban areas along the river banks and coastal belts. Urban areas get flooded because of a 
multitude of factors. River floods, Coastal floods, Extreme Weather Events and Dam bursts 
in upstream regions are often the cause of urban flooding. Blocking of Drainage system due 
to silting, dumping of waste material at the inlets of drainage, encroachment over natural 
drainage and water bodies are known to aggravate urban flooding.
Flash floods are rapid occurring events which generally follow very high intensity short duration 
rainfalls, especially in poorly drained areas. This type of flooding give almost no notice as 
flooding usually begins within a few minutes or hours of the extreme weather events. The 
rapidly rising water can reach heights of 10 m or more and gains power to roll boulders, rip

======================================================================

12
trees from the ground, and destroy roads and bridges. The damages caused by flash floods 
can be more severe than the ordinary riverine floods because of the high speed with which 
the flooding occurs, loaded with the charge of debris. Channel velocities of 3 m/s, typically 
realized in flash floods, can move a rock weighing 40 kg. 
Coastal flooding takes place when normally dry, low-lying lands get inundated by sea water. 
The extent of coastal flooding is a function of the elevation of inland flood waters penetration 
which is chiefly controlled by the topography of the coastal land exposed to flooding. The 
sea water can invade the land areas in different ways. Coastal flooding affects not only 
coastal areas but may extend along estuaries and coastal lakes and rivers some distance 
from the ocean. The flooding because of the cyclonic storm surges and tidal phenomenon 
is common. The leading edge of the incoming tide forms a wave (or waves) of water and 
the waves travel up a river or narrow bay against the direction of the river or bay’s current. 
In exceptional cases, an undersea earthquake can trigger a tsunami which usually carry the 
power to ravage the coast. The Indian Ocean tsunami of 24 January 2003 is an example of 
widespread devastation caused by a tsunami. 
1.4	
Sources of Flooding
There are many major sources of flooding. Some of these are (a) tidal flooding (b) fluvial 
flooding (c) ground water flooding (d) pluvial flooding, and (e) flooding from sewers. In the 
hilly areas, roads are also affected by events such as bursting of glacial lakes and landslide 
dams.
Peak high tides and low pressure weather systems may combine to challenge and overtop 
the sea and river defense structures to cause tidal flooding of the sea coasts. The onset of 
flooding from the sea and tidal rivers is rapid and the extreme forces driving it pose significant 
danger to life and property. 
Fluvial Flooding occurs in the floodplains of rivers when the capacity of water courses is 
exceeded as a result of rainfall or snow and ice melts within catchment areas further upstream. 
Blockages of water courses and flood channels or tide locking may also lead to ponding and 
rising water levels. River defenses may then be overtopped due to increased water levels, or 
may get breached by large objects of debris carried at high water velocities. 
Low lying areas located over unconfined aquifers may periodically flood as ground water 
levels rise. This type of flooding is often seasonal, driven by monsoon rains, and therefore 
can be anticipated with good accuracy. It is often slow in its onset.
Pluvial Flooding: Surface water flooding is caused by rainwater run-off from urban and rural 
lands with low ground absorption. Increased pace of high density  development in urban 
areas has given rise to land with a larger proportion of non-permeable surfaces, a problem 
often exacerbated by overloaded and outdated drainage infrastructure. These circumstances, 
combined with intense rainfall, can give rise to localized flooding. This sort of flooding often 
occurs outside of recognized floodplains. Further, since it is caused by quite localized weather 
conditions, it is very difficult to forecast. Its onset can also be very rapid, and the level of 
flooding very severe.



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 122
======================================================================
IRC:SP:113-2018
13
Flooding from Sewers: A sewerage system conveys sewage and surface water runoff using 
sewers. It includes drains, manholes, pumping stations, storm overflows, and screening 
chambers of the combined sewer or foul sewer. Flooding from sewers can occur where their 
capacity is exceeded due to large amounts of surface water run-off in a short time. Poor 
cleaning and maintenance can lead to blockages that can also cause local flooding. This type 
of flooding is hard to predict, has significant sanitary consequences for those affected, and 
can occur very rapidly.
1.5	
The Flood Inflicted Damages on Roads
Events of the recent years bear testimony to the fact that every major flood disaster invariably 
affects roads and bridges. 
The Bihar floods of 20175 affected 10 National Highways, 203 State Highways and in fact 
the entire road network in north Bihar. Six bridges also suffered extensive damages. The 
total estimated damages were to the tune of Rs 1000 crore. As anticipated, the maximum 
damages to roads were recorded in as many as 20 districts including Purnea, Katihar, Araria, 
Kishanganj, East Champaran and West Champaran. Submergence of roads and erosion 
of approach roads to bridges was wide spread. Submergence of parts of the 3300 km-long 
east-west corridor stretching from Porbandar in Gujarat to Silchar in Assam and damages 
to approach embankments on NH 31 became matters of grave concern and these would 
cost several hundred crores of rupees of repair, restoration and reconstruction. The repeat 
of such damages can be prevented by taking course to implementation of a well-designed 
package of mitigation measures, some of which are discussed in succeeding chapters.
Jammu and Kashmir floods of 20146 provides yet another example with great lessons in 
flood disaster mitigation. Unchecked urbanization, heavy monsoon rains and extremely poor 
drainage combined to burst the banks of rivers Jhelum, Chenab and Tawi, among others. The 
worst affected districts were Srinagar, Anantnag, Baramulla, Pulwama, Ganderbal, Kulgam, 
Budgam, Rajouri, Poonch and Reasi. Links of Kashmir Valley were disrupted and the 
300 km- long National Highway was closed to vehicular traffic for days as a result of landslides 
and floods. As many as 60 major and minor roads were cut off and over 30 bridges got 
washed away, hampering the relief and rescue operations. Except for connectivity between 
Srinagar and North Kashmir’s Ganderbal district, all other districts of the valley including 
Anantnag, Pulwama, Kulgam, Shopian, Badgam, Baramulla and Bandipora were cut off.
Over the years, several expert Committees have studied the problems caused by floods and 
suggested various measures for flood disaster risk reduction to the Government. However, 
despite the various initiatives taken and interventions made over the last five decades, 
the flood disasters have only increased in frequency, spread and magnitude of damage 
and devastation, posing unprecedented challenge to the highway engineers. Besides the 
increasing levels of hazard, the vulnerability is also on the increase due to a multitude of

factors such as higher degree of exposure to floods, uncontrolled urbanization and Extreme 
Weather Events.
1.6	
Flood as a Component of Multiple Hazards
The flooding as hazard can occur in isolation or conjointly with other hazards. For example 
Glacial Lake Outburst Floods can trigger landslides which may in turn lead to flooding of the 
associated water streams. Similarly, when flooding in a river causes toe erosion of a slope, 
its instability may result in a landslide. Such massive landslides are known to block the river 
and form a landslide dam, bursting of which may trigger more landslides. The large boulders 
or debris which are carried by a river can damage roads and infrastructure along the river 
banks.

CHAPTER 2
FLOOD HAZARD, VULNERABILITY AND RISK ASSESSMENT
2.1	
Flood Hazard and its Zonation
Hazard is defined as probability of occurrence of a hazardous event within a specified time 
frame in a given area of potentially damaging phenomena. The areas which have the greatest 
danger of flooding are usually the flood plains, the lower river terraces, the coastal plains, 
poorly drained hilly areas and unplanned, poorly drained urban areas. The zones of flooding 
and inundation are ranked in terms of their degree of severity after careful study and analysis 
of all the various causative factors and their interplay. The flooding depends in a big way 
on the geomorphology and hydro-geology of the area, river characteristics, rainfall and the 
catchment attributes defined in terms of size, shape, relative relief, topography, hydrogeology, 
drainage density, stream order, land uses. These factors form the basis of thematic maps 
which to be are prepared at an appropriate scale based on the weights assigned to the 
individual features according to their relative importance in flood occurrence. Different flood 
hazard zones get labeled as ‘high’, ‘moderate’ and ‘low’. The thematic layers are finally 
integrated using Auto Desk MAP and MapInfo GIS software to flood hazard zonation map of 
the study area. The detailed analysis flood hazard zonation is described in Annex II.
Modern techniques are assets for proper understanding, utilization and management of 
precious natural resources, especially water. Of the many efficient techniques for flood 
hazard zonation, the most significant is Geoinformatics comprising RS (Remote Sensing), 
GIS (Geographic Information System) and GPS (Global Positioning System).
Geographic Information system (GIS) is a computer-based system that provides the 
capabilities for input, data management (data storage and retrieval), manipulation and 
analysis, and output to handle geo-referenced data. It provides a broad range of tools for 
determining area affected by floods and for forecasting areas that are likely to be flooded 
due to high water level in a river. GIS is also being extensively used to assemble information 
from different maps, aerial photographs, satellite images and digital elevation models (DEM). 
For determination of risk, it is important to know the elements at risk and their levels of 
exposure. By preparing an infrastructure map at the scale of the flood hazard map, the 
elements at risk can easily be identified on a GIS platform. 
2.2	
Infrastructure Mapping for Identification of Elements at Risk 
For determination of risk, alongside flood hazard mapping, it is essential to carry out mapping 
of all the objects at risk to prepare the corresponding infrastructure map at the scale. The 
infrastructure map generally includes items such as human settlements, road infrastructure, 
heritage structures, public utilities, hospitals, school buildings, police and fire stations. Special 
attention must be paid to structures situated within a flood plain, mud or masonry buildings 
with water-soluble mortar, buildings with shallow foundations or weak resistance to lateral 



======================================================================

16
loads or impact, roads and bridges in strategic areas, basements or underground buildings; 
public utilities in congested areas, industries in low-lying areas, food stocks , cultural artifacts, 
confined livestock , coastal infrastructure. The study of flood hazard and the corresponding 
infrastructure map on a GIS platform will lead to identification of elements at risk. 
2.3	
Vulnerability of Elements at Risk
For risk assessment, it is not enough to have the flood hazard and Infrastructure maps. By 
these two, we can only identify what all is at risk. For quantification of risk, we must assess 
the degree of vulnerability of the all the elements at risk. The vulnerability of an element at risk 
could vary from zero to one. For instance, a well-engineered road with functionally efficient 
drainage system will have zero vulnerability to flooding. The vulnerability of the same road, 
if badly built and with poor drainage may be 100%. In other words, vulnerability depends on 
level of exposure, susceptibility and degree of preparedness.
There are different types of vulnerability. For instance, people living in the flood plains and 
low-lying areas are physically vulnerable. Those from the economically weaker sections 
of the society who have no means of escaping floods are also economically vulnerable. 
Then there could be attitudinal vulnerability if the communities at risk are without behavioral 
training, education and awareness. The decision for preparation of vulnerability maps will 
therefore require considerable analysis of data and value judgment. 
It is common to assess vulnerability based on maps of historic floods, past experience on 
performance of roads and infrastructure facilities exposed to previous flooding events and 
inundation maps based on predictive modeling.
The types of maps prepared must closely relate to site-specific situation. For instance, if 
there is the perceived risk of a levee breach due to flooding , we can map the area in the 
hinterland of a river levee with the distribution of the time after which different land parcels 
would be inundated in case of a levee breach. Similarly, it is often helpful to map the worst-
case flood scenario and the damage potential showing the assets that are flood-prone. One 
can also think of mapping  particularly susceptible elements within the 100-year inundation 
area, that need special consideration in case of floods, e.g. kindergartens, hospitals, nursing 
homes etc.
2.4	
Flood Risk Assessment (FRA)
A flood risk assessment (FRA) is normally undertaken either over a large area or for a 
particular site to answer certain basic questions. Whether flood risk is an issue? It is the first 
question that comes to one’s mind. If the answer is in the affirmative, then one gets to study 
flood hazard map, identified flood zones, elements at risk and their respective degrees of 
vulnerabilities   to answer the next question-How serious is the threat of flooding? All this 
leads to an informed decision making essential for development of appropriate flood risk 
mitigation and management measures for sustainable development.

There are two components of flood risk that must be considered in applying this guidance in 
a consistent manner: 
Likelihood of flooding is normally defined as the percentage probability of a flood of a given 
magnitude or severity occurring or being exceeded in any given year. It is done by Frequency 
analysis of the annual flood values of adequate length. Sometimes when the flood data is 
inadequate, frequency analysis recorded storm data is made and the storm of a particular 
frequency applied to the unit hydrograph to derive the design flood. This flood usually has a 
return period greater than the storm
Consequences of flooding which depends on the hazards associated with the flooding (e.g. 
depth of water, speed of flow, rate of onset, duration, wave action effects, water quality), 
and the vulnerability of people, property and the environment potentially affected by a flood 
(e.g. the age profile of the population, the type of development, presence and reliability of 
mitigation measures etc).
The assessment of flood risk requires an understanding of where the water comes from (i.e. 
the source), how and where it flows (i.e. the pathways) and the people and assets affected 
by it (i.e. the receptors) (Fig. 2.1)7.
Fig. 2.1 Source-Pathway-Receptor Model
The principal sources of flooding are rainfall or higher than normal sea levels. The principal 
pathways are rivers, drains, sewers, overland ﬂows, ﬂood plains and their defense assets. 
The receptors include people, their property and the environment. Vulnerability and exposure 
of receptors to quantify its potential consequences should also be examined as a part of flood 
risk assessment. Risks to people, property and the environment should be assessed over the 
full range of probabilities, including extreme events. The ﬂood risk assessment should cover 
all sources of ﬂooding, including the effects of run-off from a development on ﬂood risk both 
locally and beyond the development site.
The appraisal and assessment of flood risk is normally in the following well defined stages 
with focus on finding apt answers to all the questions for the purposes of decision-making at 
the regional, sub-regional, local area and site specific levels.

Stage 1 Flood Risk Identification : Identification of flooding or surface water management 
issues at all levels that may warrant further investigation, mapping and data analysis. 
Stage 2 Initial Flood Risk Assessment : Pinpoint sources of flooding that may affect a plan 
area or the proposed development site and appraise the adequacy or otherwise of existing 
information and knowledge base for reliable assessment of the risk of flooding leading to 
the first order flood zone maps. Validated hydraulic models aids assessment of the potential 
impact of a development on flooding elsewhere and help outline the scope of possible 
mitigation measures as well as the requirements of the detailed assessment. 
Stage 3 Detailed Flood Risk Assessment : Analysis and understanding of all issues related 
to assessment of flood risk  in sufficient detail leading to a quantitative appraisal of potential 
flood risk to a proposed or an existing development and of its potential impact on flood risk 
elsewhere. Given the detailed flood risk assessment, identification and engineering of the 
mitigation measures logically follow to reduce the impact on people and communities.

characteristics for assessing impact of floods in plains, hilly regions and coastal areas and 
flood investigation details.

3.4	
Road Development in Flood Plains
Construction of roads is essential to develop regions and ensure hassle-free access to the 
different places they connect. For a number of reasons, road development in a floodplain 
system requires a different approach to planning and technical design, compared to road 
development in areas that are not (regularly) inundated.   



======================================================================

20
The main objectives of road development projects in flood plains are to 
	
u	
Enhance Regional Transportation and contribute in infrastructure, social, 
economic and environmental development of region 
	
u	
Minimize flood vulnerability 
	
u	
Maintain flood plain hydraulics and ecology 
3.5	
Road Development in Hilly Areas 
In hilly regions, river training is an important component in controlling of flash floods and 
general flood control, as well as in other activities such as ensuring the safe passage of a 
flood under a bridge. Hill roads along the river may also be in danger due to different problems 
created by it. Some of the problems created by river which create damage of hill roads are:
	
u	
Frequent changes in river course.
	
u	
Avulsion of one river into another.
	
u	
Development of natural cut-off.
	
u	
Landslides in catchment -rise in silt load.
	
u	
Aggradations of river bed -high flood levels -Flooding
	
u	
Degradation of river bed downstream of a dam or a barrage.
	
u	
Effects of flood embankment on the regime of rivers.
	
u	
Effects of extraction of sand and boulders.
	
u	
Effects of heavy urbanization along the river banks.
Gullies are a highly visible form of soil erosion, with steep-sided, incised, drainage lines 
greater than 30 cm deep. In lay terms, the word ‘gully’ is often used to describe any drainage 
line flowing towards a stream. These drainage lines may pass through hill roads and often 
damage them
Roads, fences, and firebreaks should be situated in locations that do not readily divert overland 
runoff and concentrate it to areas that lead to gully erosion. The best place for a road is to 
follow a ridge line. An examination of satellite imagery in seriously eroded paddocks in the 
Burdekin catchment shows that graziers being aware of this consistently use ridge lines for 
access. Roads that run directly up and down the slope will divert or concentrate less runoff 
than those diagonal to the slope.
Roads should have a profile that does not concentrate overland runoff. Roads that are below 
normal ground level through constant use or inappropriate maintenance should be re-profiled 
to a form that does not concentrate overland runoff; alternatively, they should have drainage 
works incorporated to ensure runoff is dispersed onto stable areas. Associated table drains 
and mitre drains should have a trapezoidal shape with a flat bottom and not a triangular 
shape that is more conducive to eroding.

Gully control chutes are formed by battering gully heads to an acceptable slope depending 
on the method used to stabilize them. As well as for controlling gullies, chutes are used as by-
washes in farm dams. They are also used to convey water over steep road batters, to control 
bed erosion in streams, and for urban developments such as sports fields.
Chutes require some form of energy dissipation at the outlet to help dissipate the energy 
gained when runoff flows down the chute. Chute failure often occurs when runoff fails to enter 
the chute properly. It is critical to control potential leaks and flow bypassing, especially at the 
chute entrance, and also to ensure suitable side walls contain the flows within the chute.
3.6	
Road Development in Coastal Areas
As the sea level rises, the water depth increases and the wave base becomes deeper; 
waves reaching the coast have more energy and therefore can erode and transport greater 
quantities of sediment. Thus, the coast starts to adjust to the new sea level to maintain a 
dynamic equilibrium. The key physical parameters that need to be understood to identify 
coastal roads erosion as a problem in the coastal zone are:
	
l	
Coastal Geomorphology: Coastline type and sensitivity to coastal 
processes.
	
l	
Wind: The main force in wave generation; under the right environmental 
conditions, wind may transfer sediment from the beach environment landward 
on all open coastlines.
	
l	
Waves: They are the most important forces for sediment erosion and 
transport to the coastal zone. They introduce energy to the coast and also 
a series of currents that move sediment along the shore (Long shore drift) 
and normal to the shore (cross-shore transport). It is important to understand 
the movement of wave forms as well as water particles and their interaction 
with seabed material; also how the waves determine whether the coasts are 
erosive or accretional.
	
l	
Tides: They are influential in beach roads morph dynamics. They modulate 
wave action, controlling energy arriving on the coast and drive groundwater 
fluctuation and tidal currents. The interaction of groundwater with tides in 
the coastal forest environment is crucial in understanding why coastal forest 
clearance causes intensive coastal erosion in particular environments.
	
l	
Vegetation: Important for improving slope stability, consolidating sediments 
and providing some shoreline protection along the coastal roads.
Equally significant human activities that must be considered over the range of spatial and 
time scales are:
	
l	
Activities along the coastal roads: Building infrastructure via land 
reclamation or within sand dune areas and port/harbour development has a 
long-term impact on shoreline change; protective seawalls lead to erosion at 
the end of the structures, generate beach scouring at the toe of seawall and 
shorten the beach face. This can occur in the short term (less than five years) 



======================================================================
PAGE 33 of 122
======================================================================
IRC:SP:113-2018
22
or the long term (more than five years). Other structures such as groynes 
and jetties typically cause erosion down-drift of the structure within a short 
period of time (between five and ten years). Removal of dune vegetation 
and mangroves will expose low energy shorelines to increased energy and 
reduced sediment stability, causing erosion within five to ten years
	
l	
Activities within river catchments/watersheds: Dam construction and river 
diversion cause reduction of sediment supply to the coast that contributes 
to coastal erosion. The effects of dam and river diversion in terms of coastal 
erosion are not straightforward, but there are mid-to long-term impacts (20 
to 100 years) with spatial scales approximately from one to 100 kilometers.
	
l	
Onshore and offshore activities: Sand and coral mining and dredging may 
affect coastal processes in various ways such as contributing to sediment 
deficit in the coastal system and modifying water depth that leads to altered 
wave refraction and longshore drift. The impact of these activities will be 
obvious within a short period of time (one to ten years).
Understanding the key processes of coastal dynamics and how the coasts function both in 
spatial and temporal time scales (short and long term), as well as human activities along 
the coast, within the river watershed and offshore is essential for managing coastal erosion 
because it may occur without reason. A quantitative understanding of changes in spatial and 
short- and long-term time scales is indispensable for the development of coastal roads.
3.7	
Damage Mapping
Damage mapping of Flood prone area can be done by following methods. However any 
advance technology which provides the desired outputs can be adopted based on the 
requirement.
3.7.1	
Technology-Satellite Based Radar Imaging Systems
Technology-Satellite Based Radar Imaging Systems- mapping and damage assessment
Radar (Radio Detection and Ranging) remote sensing is used to support a wide variety of 
science investigations including flood mapping, damage assessment, polar ice research, 
land use mapping, vegetation, biomass measurements, and soil moisture mapping etc. In 
addition, it is used to measure ground surface deformation caused by earthquakes, volcanic 
activities, floods, land subsidence, and slow landslides. These radar based applications are 
especially useful in assisting mitigation efforts following major natural disasters.
3.7.2	
Drone and Hot Air Balloon Surveys
Inexpensive drones are capable of making sophisticated maps. Small, portable drones are 
quickly deployable. They carry lightweight digital cameras that can capture good quality 
images. These cameras can be set to take pictures at regular intervals, and digital memory 
is plentiful at low cost.

Chapter 4
FLOOD MANAGEMENT WORKS
4.1	
Introduction 
The frequency and intensity of floods have grown in India over the years primarily because 
of the increased encroachment in flood plains. These trends demand better preparedness 
at national, provincial and local levels to make sure that appropriate and effective response 
measures are taken during flood emergency to minimize the loss of life and property. This 
chapter discusses several measures aiming to reduce the risk of flooding by managing land, 
rivers, coastal systems and flood defenses. While we do everything to reduce the chance 
of flooding, one should always be cautious that it is a natural process and can never be 
completely eliminated. 
Flood management activities can be broadly classified into four major groups:
 
l	
Attempts to modify the flood 
 
l	
Attempts to modify the susceptibility to flood damage 
 
l	
Attempts to modify the loss burden 
 
l	
Bearing the loss 
The flood protection systems can be briefly classified as (Fig. 4.1):
 Fig. 4.1 Classification of Flood Protection Systems
Broadly, all measures taken up under the activity of “Modifying the flood” which are in the 
nature of physical measures are “Structural measures”, while the others which are taken 
up as management tools without major construction activity are grouped as “Non-structural 
measures”.

4.2	
Pre Flood Measures
Pre flood mode is determined by the aim of reducing flood risks in the long term. It can be 
characterized by the availability of time and resources. Depending on river morphology, river 
hydrology and characteristics, decision on the type of pre-response measure needs to be 
finalized. It could be a single measure or a combined measure which needs to be selected 
based on its suitability.
	
a.	
Flood conveyance structures designed to route flood waters away from areas 
of flooding risk via natural or artificial channels. 
	
b.	
Flood storage structures that reduce the peak flood flows- Dams, reservoirs, 
check dams etc.
	
c.	
Flood defense and mitigation structures- levees, flood embankments, 
gryones, spurs, check dams etc.
	
d.	
Urban drainage system that  increase infiltration
	
e.	
Ecosystem management includes utilizing wet lands, creating environmental 
buffers
4.2.1	
Structural Protection measures
The general approach to tackle the problem of floods in the past has been in the form of 
physical measures with a view to prevent the flood waters from reaching potential damage 
centres. This approach had been extensively adopted in the Godavari, Krishna and Cauvery 
Deltas in South India and also in some areas of Indo-Gangetic plain.
The main thrust of the flood protection programme undertaken in India so far has been in the 
nature of taking structural measures like:
	
a.	
Embankments, flood walls and sea walls 
	
b.	
Dams and reservoirs
	
c.	
Natural detention basin
	
d.	
Channel improvement
	
e	
Drainage improvement
	
f.	
Diversion of flood waters 
4.2.1.1	
Embankments/Levees/Dykes
A levee is a natural or artificial embankment or dike (Figs. 4.2, 4.3 & 4.4), usually earthen, 
extending parallel to the river channel aligned on high ridge of natural banks of river. Retired 
embankments or bunds are type of embankment built behind the existing flood embankment 
as second line of defence or replacement of damaged bund/ embankment. These can also 
be built to contain river spill generated by rising of water level at barrage or bridge.
Planning, design, construction and maintenance details shall be made according to 
IS 12094, IS 11532. The core of the structures may be made of earth material, boulders or

using geosystems like geotextile tubes, geotextile bags, and geocomposite bags. Existing 
embankments made of soil or earthen material can be reinforced in many ways to prevent 
them from breaching. One popular method is to strengthen the inner slope and crest with 
bio engineering measures using biodegradable and geo-synthetic mats, geo-synthetic wire 
mesh or an open concrete-block system.

4.2.1.2	
Guide Bunds (IS 10751-1994)
Rivers in flood plains submerge very large areas during flood periods. Naturally when some 
structures (for example, bridge, weir, etc.) are to be constructed across a river, it is very 
expensive to construct the work spanning whole width of the river and it is necessary to 
restrict its course to remain flowing centrally through the barrage, weir or a bridge placed 
across that river. Some training works such as guide bunds (Fig. 4.5) may be constructed to 
confine the flow of water within a waterway for economical purposes. There shall be no spurs 
projecting from the guide bund as the spurs produce swirls.
The guide banks guide the river flow past a bridge or any other hydraulic structure without 
causing damage to the work and its approaches. They extend both upstream and downstream 
of the abutments of the hydraulic structure. The guide banks may be provided on either side 
of the hydraulic structure or on one side as required. For details on planning and design of 
guide bunds IS 10751 shall be referred.

4.2.1.3	
Transverse Structures – Groynes/Spurs
Groyne is a rigid hydraulic structure built from an ocean shore or from a bank (rivers) that 
interrupts water flow and limits the movement of sediment (Figs. 4.6 & 4.7).
Groynes are constructed transverse to the direction of river flow extending from the bank 
into the river. This form of river training works perform one or more functions such as training 
the river along the desired course to reduce the concentration of flow at the point of attack, 
creating a slack flow for silting up the area in the vicinity and protecting the bank by keeping 
the flow away from it. 
It is most common method of countering lateral erosion on outer bank, extending into the 
streams, which are keyed into or supported by the bank preventing or minimizing erosion.

4.2.1.4	
Flood Protection Wall
A flood wall is a primarily vertical artificial barrier designed to temporarily contain the waters 
of a river or other waterway which may rise to unusual levels during seasonal or extreme 
weather events. Flood walls are mainly used on locations where space is scarce, such as 
cities or where building levees or dikes (dykes) would interfere with other interests, such as 
existing roads, historical architecture or commercial use of embankments. For more details, 
refer National Disaster Management Guidelines; Management of floods. Flood protection 
walls can be built with rigid steel sheets (Fig. 4.8), masonry walls (Fig. 4.9), cement concrete 
or using gabions. Gabions also have advantages over more rigid structures because they 
can conform to ground movement, dissipate energy from flowing water, and drain freely. 
Their strength and effectiveness increases with time as silt and vegetation fill the interstitial 
voids and reinforce the structure. Flood walls are nowadays mainly constructed from pre-
fabricated concrete elements. Flood walls often have floodgates which are large openings to 
provide passage except during periods of flooding, when they are closed.

4.2.1.5	
Slope Protection Works
Option 1 : Gabion Lining on Bed and Bank for River: The erosion of river banks can be 
controlled by providing gabion mattress along the bank and bed (Fig. 4.10). This lining of 
banks prevents the surface erosion of banks and apron on the river bed prevents the failure 
of river banks due to scouring. Also, the section can be increased by cutting the bank on 
both sides and extending the banks to some extent. In case of steep slopes (>1V:2H and 
<1V:1.5H), there is a possibility for sliding of revetment material due to its dead weight; in such 
cases anchoring on the top of bank slope shall be provided. However, provision of anchoring 
on the top is subject to careful installation as otherwise excavations may destabilize the 
bank slopes. Gabion mattress shall be filled with stones or geotextile bags depending on the 
availability of fill material, durability requirements etc. The detailed specifications of gabions/ 
gabion mattress are explained in Section 6.9.
Fig. 4.10 Bank Protection using Gabion Mattress
Option 2 - Gabion Lining on Bank using Gabion Mattress and Scour Filling : Gabion 
mattress and Gabion lining founded on dumped loose rock or stone filled sack gabions 
at the toe above poor bed material and to fill the existing scour holes (Fig. 4.11). Gabion 
mattress and cylindrical gabions shall be filled with stones or geotextile bags depending 
on the availability of fill material, durability requirements etc. The detailed specifications of 
gabions/ gabion mattress/cylindrical are explained in Section 6.9
Option 3: Geotextile Bag Lining for Bank Protection
Geotextile bags are used for erosion control at river banks where scarcity of rock presents 
(Fig. 4.12). It is also used in highly contaminated water and shall be provided for significant 
flow velocity. However, suitable bag dimensions and geotextile material shall be selected 
based on the flow conditions. The detailed specifications of geotextile bags for use in flood 
management works are explained in Section 6.6.

Option 4: Wood Pile Fence
Stabilization of eroded banks with wooden pile fence in combination with rubble stones is 
an economical option but this solution will not be feasible in case of river banks with greater 
heights and deep cuts (Fig. 4.138). Also in case of higher flow velocities, wooden piles are 
prone to damages and hence this solution shall be implemented only in rivers with less

intensity. This option being an age old technique of flood control works and wooden piles 
being used (by cutting trees), its adoption shall be made in case of non-feasibility of other 
solutions.
Fig. 4.13 Wooden Pile Fence
Option 5: Dry Boulder / Grouted Riprap
One of the oldest and conventional methods of protecting the river banks from flooding and 
erosion is using dry boulder pitching. However due to certain issues like stability of stones 
in pitching during heavy floods, these requires periodic maintenance. Also in places where 
availability of stones is less, alternative solutions can be adopted. To eliminate the stability 
issues of individual stones in the dry rubble riprap during heavy floods hence it can be grouted 
with cement mortar which makes the protection stronger. This proves feasible in case of 
steeper slopes and turbulent flow conditions. Since the grouted riprap being impermeable, 
proper sub surface drainage measures shall be provided.
This solution is not feasible in case of continuous flowing rivers as the grouting operations will 
not be possible in such conditions.
Option 6: Concrete Lining
Concrete lining on the banks of river for erosion/flood protection will be the feasible 
option especially where rivers in hilly regions accompanied by heavy boulders (Fig. 4.14). 
Implementation of other protection measures will be supplemented with suitable protection 
measures from boulders movement in such cases concrete lining will be the feasible option.
Structure like concrete grout mattress can also be implemented for timely completion and 
under water construction. Here, geotextile material shall act as the formwork for the concrete 
lining.
Though concrete being a durable material and can sustain heavy turbulence, its usage shall 
be limited considering its rigidity (to accommodate settlements), construction feasibility (in 
case of continuous flows) and environmental impacts (carbon footprint).

Option 7: Porcupines
Porcupines are a form of permeable structure designed to reduce flow and trap sediment. 
They have pole-like projections in all directions, resembling a porcupine with its quills sticking 
into the air (Fig. 4.15a9). They are used as flood control structures, and for river bank and bed 
protection. Porcupines can be used in a line forming a spur into a river, as silting aprons for 
larger spurs, and in a longitudinal line along an embankment (Fig. 4.15b10).

Option 8: Cylindrical Gabions: The cylindrical Gabions are another alternative which can 
be used in case of emergency works, filling of scour holes and immediate dumping on river 
bank toes in order to control the damage. These cylindrical gabions can be either filled with 
stones or lined with Geotextile material and filled with sand. These are used for preparation 
of foundation base for the structures, which are not easily accessible and most of the times 
underwater. The containment system comes handy where the flow is turbulent and need to 
heavy mass blocks to sustain the impacts of flow. The geotextile lined sand filled containment 
units shall be used in places where availability of stone is scarce, where sand is available 
for filling. This system works as a composite system and helps in the areas where velocity of 
water is relatively high and Geotextile bags alone would not be able to withstand the shear 
stresses induced by the water on the system components.
There are many types of slope protection work as shown in the Table 4.1. The type of slope 
protection work at the site shall be selected based on the design velocity, slope, availability 
of construction materials near the site, ease of construction works and economy, etc. When 
there are constraints due to the required boulder stones during flood and the slope of the 
bank combination of the slope covering works shall be considered. IRC:56, IS 8237 may be 
referred for details on Protection of Slope for Reservoir Embankments and Erosion Control 
Works. For counter measures on bridge scour and stream instability hydraulic engineering

Floodways
A floodway is a designated piece of land that is purposefully left clear of development, for the 
purpose of passing flood waters. When water rises beyond the capacity of the nearby rivers 
and channels, it then passes over this designated area (In some areas of the country, the term 
floodway is used to designate the 100-year floodplain). Floodways must be maintained so 
that when water passes over them, it doesn’t rise beyond the expected levels. Obstructions 
such as earth deposits, debris, trash, undesirable vegetation, or unauthorized structures or 
encroachments reduce the floodway capacity and must be removed and disposed of properly.

4.2.2	
Non-Structural Protection Measures
Non-structural measures strive to keep people away from flood waters. It contemplates the 
use of flood plains judiciously, simultaneously permitting vacating of the same for use by 
the river whenever the situation demands. This technique allows the use of flood plains by 
reducing the disaster dimension, while retaining its beneficial effects.
4.2.2.1	
Flood Forecasting and Warning
 Flood forecasting activities in India made a small beginning in November 1958 when the 
Central Water Commission created a Flood Forecasting Unit for flood forecasting for the river 
Yamuna at Delhi, the National Capital. The disastrous floods in 1968 in many parts of the 
country necessitated the setting up of forecasting centers on interstate rivers. Networks of 
flood forecasting stations established in major and interstate river basins. In that total Flood 
Forecasting Stations 175, Inflow 28, Stage 147. These are issued for different areas mostly 
by the Central Water Commission/Meteorological Department and by the State Irrigation/ 
Flood Department. However, an effective Warning System is one that can release warning in 
advance, i.e. 72hrs, 48hrs and 24hrs.
4.2.2.2	
Flood Routing Techniques
Flood routing is the technique of determining the flood hydrograph at a section of a river by 
utilizing the data of flood flow at one or more upstream sections. The hydrologic analysis of 
problems such as flood forecasting, flood protection, reservoir design and spillway design 
invariably include flood routing. In these applications, two broad categories of routing can be 
recognized. These are: 
	
1.	
Reservoir routing, and 
	
2.	
Channel routing 
A variety of routing methods are available and they can be broadly classified into two 
categories as: 
	
1.	
Hydrologic routing and 
	
2.	
Hydraulic routing 
Hydrologic-routing methods employ essentially the equation of continuity. Hydraulic methods, 
on the other hand, employ the continuity equation together with the equation of motion of 
unsteady flood flow.
Flood Forecasting: Flood retention reservoirs, where available, can play a crucial role in flood 
control. For optimum operation of such reservoirs, reliable forecast estimates of the incoming 
flood flow over the time shall be needed and these are required for filling and emptying the 
reservoir. In case of most reservoirs, whose primary purpose is water supply, flood operation 
is an important component of their management. The Minimum Draw Down Level (MDDL) 
is fixed from design considerations to meet the objectives of water use. Most floods are 
expected to occur in the wet season, and even if the reservoir is full, some attenuation of the 



======================================================================

======================================================================

incoming flood hydrograph will occur due to the size of the reservoir, the out flowing flood 
being released through either uncontrolled or controlled spillways. Reservoirs are designed 
with particular characteristics defined by Storage and outflow up to a Maximum Water Level 
(MWL). However, in case of large floods, this design capacity may be exceeded and water 
may have to be released. Depending on the flooding scenario, the downstream area of 
the dam which may already be in critical situation during wet season, such flood release 
from reservoirs may have devastating effects. As such, effective management and control 
measures must be devised.
4.2.2.3 
Boosting of Pumping Capacity by Installation of Artificial Emergency Drainage at 
Critical Locations.
Floodwater pumping stations should be designed to operate automatically with appropriate 
type of pumps which are controlled by water level sensors installed in the pump sump. 
Accumulated storm water from the flood storage facilities is pumped to the nearest main 
drainage channel outside the polder (a piece of low-lying land reclaimed from the sea or a 
river and protected by dykes).
A good appearance is one of the functional requirements of pumping stations. This is 
particularly important for pumping stations located in urban areas and exposed to public 
views. For those in village areas, local residents should be enquired as far as possible. 
To enhance the appearance of pumping stations, external finishes are usually provided for 
superstructure above ground. The construction cost for finishes together with the future 
maintenance cost should be taken into account in selecting the type of finishes to be used. To 
save cost, fair concrete finishes may be considered for internal walls of unmanned pumping 
station. However, the floor of pumping station should be painted with anti-skidding coats.
4.2.2.4	
Design Capacity
The design capacity for all duty pumps should be adequate to handle rainstorm runoffs 
collected inside the polder with a return period of 10 years. Stand-by pumps must be available 
and should be able to automatically take over the failed duty pumps. Both duty pumps and 
stand-by pumps should be interchangeable. The standby pumps should be so designed such 
that they can also be activated in case of exceptionally severe rainstorms.
In the determination of the pumping requirements, the following guidelines should be followed:
	
(a)	
The design freeboard for floodwater storage facilities should be 300 mm for 
a storm with a 10-year return period.
	
(b)	
Combinations of stand-by pumps and duty pumps can be formulated for an 
individual village flood protection scheme so that if any of the duty pumps in 
the station becomes inoperable due to routine maintenance or mechanical 
failure, the design capacity of the pumping station can still be maintained. 
As a simple rule, the total capacity of the stand-by pumps should be at least 
30% of the total capacity of the duty pumps.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:113-2018
37
	
(c)	
The total maximum pumping capacity (both duty pumps plus stand-by 
pumps) of a pumping station should be able to accommodate a storm with a 
50-year return period.
The flood depths inside the polder during a 50-year and a 200-year rainstorm under the 
proper functioning of duty pumps and the floodwater storage facilities should be checked.
If the flood depth is considered intolerable, the capacity of the storage facilities should be 
increased to suit.
4.2.2.5	
Integrated River Basin Approach
Effective measures for flood prevention and protection have to be taken in the level of river 
basins and that it is necessary to take into account interdependence and interaction of effects 
of individual measures implemented along water courses. It is absolutely necessary to 
organize the water management systems and improve forecasting, flood defense measures 
and crisis management on a river basin basis, cutting across regional boundaries and country 
borders. So a sustainable way by taking a river basin integrated and long term view, probably 
of the order of 50 or 100 years.
4.2.2.6	
Drainage System
A storm drainage system is a system receiving, conveying, and controlling storm water runoff 
in response to precipitation and snowmelt. Such systems include: ditches, culverts, swales, 
subsurface interceptor drains, roadways, curb and gutters, catch basins, manholes, pipes, 
attenuation ponds and service lateral lines. It is designed to convey runoff from frequent 
storms (e.g., up to 2 or 5 year storms). The main purpose of this system is to minimize storm 
water ponding at intersections and pedestrian crossings which may cause inconvenience 
to both pedestrians and motorists so it is also called the convenience system. The major 
drainage system comprises the natural streams and valleys and man-made streets, channels 
and ponds. It is designed to accommodate runoff from less frequent storms (e.g., 100 year 
or the Regional storms). The main purpose is to essentially eliminate the risk of loss of life 
and property damage due to flooding. There have been many methodologies developed 
earlier to estimate the total runoff volume, the peak rate runoff and the run off hydrograph 
from land surfaces under a variety of conditions like runoff curve number method, small storm 
hydrology method, infiltration model methods etc. for earlier stages and Rational method, 
SCS method, modified Rational method in present stages.
4.2.2.6.1	 Storm Water Management to counter Anthropogenic Impacts.
Managing the quantity and quality of storm water is termed, “Storm Water Management.” 
The term Best Management Practice (BMP) or storm water control measure  is often used to 
refer to both structural or engineered control devices and systems (e.g. retention ponds) to 
treat or store polluted storm water, as well as operational or procedural practices (e.g. street 
sweeping). Storm water management includes both technical and institutional aspects.

4.2.2.6.2	 Interception by tree canopy, vegetation, natural ponds –depression storage in 
forested catchments.
Trees and forests play an incredible role in reducing storm water in several ways and removing 
or filtering pollutants that would otherwise wind up in our waterways.
	
l	
Canopy Interception and Infiltration: Forests filter and regulate the flow of 
water, in large part due to their leafy canopy that intercepts rainfall, slowing 
its fall to the ground and the forest floor, which acts like an enormous 
sponge, typically absorbing up to 450 mm of precipitation (depending on soil 
composition) before gradually releasing it to natural channels and recharging 
ground water. Average interception of rainfall by a forest canopy ranges from 
10-40% depending on species, time of year, and precipitation rates per storm 
event. In urban and suburban settings a single deciduous tree can intercept 
from 1900 to 2900 litres per year; and a mature evergreen can intercept 
more than 1500 litres per year. Even young, small trees help.
4.2.2.6.3	 Leakage from water distribution (pressurized pipes-low losses high volumes) and 
waste water and sewerage networks buried under roads and road embankments.
Systematic leakage-control programs have two main components: water audits and leak-
detection surveys. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to develop water audit 
procedures and leak-detection methods. As a result, water system operators now have several 
well established procedures and modern equipment to help them control water leakage.
4.2.2.6.4	 Management of storm water runoffs by source control; conveyance capacity of 
natural channels-building new drains surface and underground
A storm water conveyance channel is a permanent waterway, designed to convey storm 
water runoff. The channel is lined with vegetation or riprap, or, in limited cases, gabions, 
which extend up the side slopes to design flow depth. This practice provides a means of 
transporting concentrated surface runoff without causing erosion or flooding. Channels, 
including road ditches that are constructed as part of a development to transport surface 
runoff generally are included in this practice.
Properly designed storm water conveyance channels are effective in preventing erosion 
caused by concentrated flows. They can significantly reduce or eliminate sediment loads 
originating in the channel area. Channel design and stability will differ depending on the soil 
type and topography. In hilly terrain, for example, velocities may most often be such that 
grass-lined channels won’t work effectively and riprap will be needed instead. If deep cuts 
are required on hilly terrain, an above-ground channel may be impractical.
The design of storm water conveyance channels should be done by registered professional 
engineers.

1.	
Shape
There are two types of channels to choose from: parabolic and trapezoidal. Parabolic 
channels are more similar to the shape of natural channels and are often used where space 
is available for a wide, shallow channel to allow low velocities. Trapezoidal channels are 
normally used where deeper channels are needed to carry large flows. Trapezoidal design 
works well with riprap or other structural linings, and tends to revert to a parabolic shape over 
time. V-shaped channels are not to be used because they are similar to the shape of gullies.
2.	
Side Slopes
Vegetated slopes in urban areas should be 4:1 or flatter for maintenance reasons. Slopes 
can be steeper for structurally lined channels as long as they are within the capability of the 
soil and structural lining. For trapezoidal channels with a bottom width greater than 4.5 m, the 
center should be lowered 150 mm to prevent meandering during low flows.
3.	
Capacity
Unless local storm water requirements indicate otherwise, all storm water channels should 
be designed to contain at least the peak flow from a 10-year frequency storm. In areas 
where flooding of the channel will cause damage to property owners, the channel capacity 
should be increased. The capacity of the channel should not exceed the capacity of the outlet 
area. Property damage or safety hazards may result if channel capacity is exceeded. Extra 
capacity may be needed for areas where sediment is expected to accumulate. An extra 100 
to 150 mm of depth is recommended.
4.	
Velocity
 Channels should be designed so that the velocity of flow expected from the design storm 
does not exceed the permissible velocity for the type of lining used. Design velocities should 
be appropriate for the type of liner selected.
5.	
Depth
The design water surface elevation of a channel receiving water from diversions or other 
tributary channels should be equal to or less than the design water surface elevation of the 
diversion or other tributary channel at the point of intersection. 
6.	
Cross-sections
The top width of parabolic and grass-lined channels should not exceed 9 m, and the bottom 
width of trapezoidal, grass-lined channels should not exceed 4.5 m unless multiple or divided 
waterways, riprap center, or other means are provided to control meandering of low flows. 
Freeboard: Where good vegetative cover cannot be grown adjacent to the lined side slopes, 
a minimum freeboard of 1m above design flow depth should be incorporated into the lined 
waterway. 
7.	
Building New Drains
Planning for new drainage infrastructure and upgrading of existing drains is done in 
consultation with the key planning agencies and authorities and to continuously monitor 
upcoming developments and upgrade the drains and canals promptly to:

are identified and removed,

drainage standards, and
	
c.	
Rehabilitate deteriorating drains.
4.3	
Emergency Flood Protection Measures
Emergency flood protection measures are temporary in nature and are implemented between 
the flood warning and the flood event to protect the areas from floodwaters.
Any response to flood emergencies must be rapid and effective in order to restore the natural 
status of the impacted region, to contain the damage and lives can be restarted. There is little 
time to react to sudden effects of landslides and floods in remote and hard to reach areas.
To deal with flood emergency situations, speed and efficiency of installation are vital. It should 
be:
	
l	
Rapid and simple to deploy 
	
l	
Flexible and light 
	
l	
Simple connection between units 
	
l	
Uses locally available fill material 
	
l	
Easy transportation 
	
l	
Re-usable.
Geotextile bags, geocomposite containment units, temporary flood barriers, and flood 
wrapping systems are common emergency flood protection measures and are described in 
the following subsections. 
4.3.1	
Geotextile Bags Filled with Sand
Temporary walls constructed of sand/geotextile bags can be used to protect structures from 
flooding or provide additional height to existing levee systems when flood waters reach 
critical levels. However, unless emergency placement is planned well in advance under the 
direction of trained personnel, most sandbag barriers are not constructed in accordance with 
proper practices, leading to leakage and failures. Properly filled and placed, geotextile bags 
can act as a barrier to divert moving water around, instead of through, buildings (Fig.4.1611). 
Geotextile bags can also be used to prevent overtopping of leveled streams; to divert current 
flow to a specific area; to contain seepage behind levees; and to provide weight on back 
slopes of levees, poly sheeting, and other barriers.
To be effective, sand/geotextile bags and sand should be stockpiled and checked regularly 
to ensure that the sandbags have not deteriorated. Sand and/or geotextile filled sandbags

stored unprotected out of doors may be rendered unusable. The disadvantages of sandbags 
are high disposal costs and a tendency to absorb pollutants from contaminated floodwaters, 
which necessitates their disposal as hazardous waste.
Fig. 4.16 Techniques for Proper Placement or Dumping of Sand/Geotextile Bags
4.3.2	
Geocomposite Containment units: Use of Composite Material using Cylindrical 
Gabions Lined with Geotextile Material
The cylindrical Gabion lined with Geotextile material is a containment system, which is used 
for filling dry sand as filler material and placing in position (Fig. 4.17). These are used for 
preparation of foundation base for the structures, which are not easily accessible and most 
of the times underwater. The containment system comes handy where availability of stone is 
less, where sand is available for filling. This system works as a composite system and helps 
in the areas where velocity of water is relatively high and Geotextile bags alone would not be 
able to withstand the shear stresses induced by the water on the system components.
The components are made of mechanically woven hexagonal shaped Double Twisted (DT) 
galvanized and PVC coated wire mesh cylindrical gabion lined with Non-Woven Geotextile 
materials used for applications in retaining wall/Scour protection works/river training works/
Bank protection works/under water placement/erosion control works. Technical specifications 
are given in Chapter 6.
4.3.3	
Temporary Flood Barriers
Temporary flood barriers are those that can be assembled relatively easily, moved into place, 
anchored, and filled with water sand and local fill material (Fig. 4.18). Flood control takes 
many forms, from reinforcing a levee, to building temporary levees, to completely encircling 
surrounding infrastructure. Temporary flood barrier system shall allow to control or divert flood

Strengthening of Road Infrastructure in Holistic Context
To strengthen the road embankment and pavement and to minimize the impact on flood 
plains, a single structure or a combination of the above structure may require to be adopted.

4.5.1	
Road/ Track Approaches
Potential increases in flood levels due to obstruction by road or track approaches to bridges 
need to be considered. Where the road or track approaches are at natural surface level 
or floodplain level, the structure would not obstruct flood flows. Where the road or track 
approaches are above natural surface level or floodplain level, an assessment of the flows 
across the floodplain is needed. Detailed hydraulic modeling (Numerical Studies) would be a 
pre-requisite for approval in such cases.
4.5.2	
Local Drainage
Local drainage from the site and access roads should be directed to sedimentation basins 
or grassed filter zones to trap sediments, rather than discharging directly to the stream. 
Where outfall directly to the waterway cannot be avoided, piped or rock chute outfalls may 
be needed. 
The bridge deck should be graded to sedimentation basins or grassed filter zones to trap 
sediments at each end of the bridge, with the return flow either overland or by pipe to the 
stream.
4.5.3	
Bridge Abutments
The abutments should be located so that they do not significantly encroach into the waterway 
thereby reducing the available waterway area. Scour and stream instability problems have 
always threatened the safety of highway bridges. Whenever a bridge is constructed across 
a water body like river or channel. Water normally flows faster around piers and abutments 
making them susceptible to local scour and incase of flood situations the abutment becomes 
more susceptible to these kind of problems because of huge discharge and high velocities. 
At bridge openings, contraction scour can occur when water accelerates as it flows through 
an opening that is narrower than the channel upstream from the bridge. 
Counter measures: Counter measures for these problems are defined as measures 
incorporated into a highway-stream crossing system to monitor, control, inhibit, change, 
delay, or minimize stream instability and bridge scour problems.  Some of them are

Batter Protection
Rock beaching is generally used on the batters to protect against abutment scour, as this 
area will generally not re-vegetate due to inadequate light and lack of rainfall. Beaching 
should extend typically 3 m upstream and downstream of the bridge abutments. 
The batter is to be excavated to the depth of the beaching to maintain the waterway area. 
The slope of the batters should be in the range of 1(v):1(h) to 1(v):2(h).
In general, the beaching should extend at least 600 mm below the toe of the bank to mitigate

flooding may occur, and identify what might be damaged in the flood.

l	
Use flood and inundation maps to identify risks to individuals and communities; 
keep emergency response plans in the state of readiness, and plan for 
engineering interventions in terms of flood protection measures.
 
l	
Spread public awareness about potential risks of flooding so that people 
know in advance about the risks they face.
 
l	
Install sign posts marking the likely flooding levels to keep communities 
reminding of what is anticipated in the event of a flood disaster.
 
l	
Prepare community plans of action that explain what to do as the first 
responders in case of flooding.
To communicate the results of risk analyses and to sensitize people at risk and decision 
makers is a task of the highest importance. It presupposes full understanding of the spatial 
description of the risk described at different scales, ranging from the global to the local scale. 
Most flood risk mapping approaches tend to narrowly focus on the local scale. Such an 
approach is followed for rapid assessment of the flood situation for single land parcels and 
objects like roads and infrastructure.  Usually, maps at the local scale have a scale of 1:2000 
to 1:20000.
The infrastructural development projects, in the flood prone areas, implemented by the 
different organizations, such as the Indian Railways, National Highways Authority of India 
(NHAI), the State Public Works Department, BRO etc. must incorporate flood-safety measures 
in the design and ensure quality assurance during the construction stage. While constructing 
roads, added care is necessary in selection of alignments, positioning of embankments and 
ensuring functionally efficient, and relatively maintenance free bridges, culverts, vents and 
causeways for passage of storm water. The top level of the road embankments must be so 
engineered that even after long term settlement or unforeseen land subsidence, the over-
topping does not occur. In some cases, the flood levels are likely to increase as the fallout of 
construction activities in the catchment, reduction in vegetative cover, deforestation, paving 
of areas, as well as due to the afflux caused by obstruction to the flow due to inadequate size 
of bridges, culverts, vents and causeways. The result is increased vulnerability of the area to 
flooding, submergence of roads and ensuing breaching.
In the regulation of land use in flood plains, it is important to differentiate between different 
types of roads and public utilities in terms of their priorities. Wherever feasible, certain areas 
on either side of the existing and proposed drains (including rural drains) should be declared 
as green belts where no infrastructure or other activity should be allowed. This will not only 
help in maintaining proper drainage but would also facilitate improvement of these drains in 
future to cater for the growing urbanization. In the face of extreme weather events, green 
belts do help in minimizing the damage due to drainage congestion by taking care of the freak 
rainfall events, including cloud bursts. Moreover, these green belts, at suitable locations, can 
also be developed as parks and gardens.

CHAPTER 5
Flood Control Design Guidelines and Structural Methods
5.1	
Introduction
This chapter describes prominent flood control measures, their analysis and limitations 
because of the uncertainties in design. The chief objective of flood control measures is to 
prevent and mitigate hazards due flooding, and minimize the associated risks. Understanding 
of catchment characteristics, river basins and anticipated consequences of flooding are 
fundamental to design of flood control systems. Once the design of a flood control measure 
is ready, it must also pass the check of safety against other location-specific hazards in a 
given case.
5.2	
Design of the Flood Embankment/Levees/Dikes/Road Embankments 
There is a difference between planning, design and construction of road embankments in 
general and those provided for flood protection adjoining the river bodies and water courses. 
The former is designed to ensure safety against base and slope shear failures, unacceptable 
levels of deformation and differential settlements. Embankments near flood prone water 
bodies are special in the sense that, besides being safe against the various anticipated 
modes of failure, they must be strong enough to resist the attack of flood waters. When an 
embankment is subjected to the thrust of water, it will act as an embankment dam. It’s design 
may constitute a routine problem when the embankment is homogeneous and subject to 
steady state seepage. On the other hand, where the thrust of flood water is a variable and 
embankment is non-homogenous (zoned), its design will have to recognize the dynamics of 
change of phreatic surface within the embankment and its consequent impact on embankment 
stability. For design of flood embankments/levees/dikes reference can be made to 
IS 12094: 2000.
Road embankments free from the threat of flooding could be made of a wide range of soil 
types from highly permeable granular materials to clays. Depending upon their heights and 
subsoil characteristics, they can be designed for construction in a single or multiple stages. 
Embankments of small height and made of freely draining material can be constructed in a 
single stage, provided the foundation soil is strong enough to resist base failure. Complexities 
of design and construction are, however, faced in the design of high embankments made 
of fine silts and clays, supported on water bearing clayey strata. Such embankments are 
often constructed in stages so that construction pore water pressures could be maintained at 
safe levels. Familiarity with these basics of embankment design is essential for designing of 
embankments for flood protection. For flood protection, the embankments are usually made 
of different zones with an impervious section at the core supported by two or more other 
sections of relatively pervious material.
Yet another type of problem faced in the highway engineering practice is of widening, raising 
and retrofitting the existing embankments.

Design of New Embankments
When it comes to the planning, design and construction of new embankments, the options 
could be many in terms of the choice of materials, construction procedures and technology. 
The design of new embankments for protection against floods must not only be safe against 
all possible modes of failure but its dike alignment should avoid unstable peat, muck, weak 
subsoil and loose sand foundation to prevent settlements, flow and liquefaction. The weak 
strata may need to be treated, if avoidance is not possible.
Whenever it is necessary to increase the height of an embankment or widen it, discretion 
will have to be exercised whether the river side or the land side should be approached. 
When there is land acquisition or right of way problem or when there is adequate water way, 
widening may be applied on riverside. Wherever possible, the land side should be preferred.
The design considerations include selection of the Embankment height, Design High Flood 
Level (HFL), Free Board, Top width, Slope and Berm designs and analysis of stability. 
The Department of Public Works and Highway of Japan, Flood Control Vol-1 provides 
Technical Standards and Guidelines for Planning and Design which have proven useful in 
engineering practice. It suggests the following:
Height shall be based on design flood level plus the required free board. The calculated flow 
capacity shall be used as the design flood discharge for establishing free board.
Estimation of High Flood Level can only be as accurate as the available site-specific data. 
Since HFL is an important parameter in the embankment design and data inadequacy 
remains a problem, the Japanese Guidelines divide HFL into three categories: (a)where long 
term discharge and gauge data are available, (b) where discharge and gauge data available 
for a short period and (c) where no discharge and gauge data available
Freeboard is defined as the margin from design flood level up to the elevation of the dike 
crest. It is the margin of the height which does not allow overflow. According to the aforesaid 
guidelines, the freeboard shall be based on the design flood discharge which shall not be 
less than the value given in Table 5.1 below. It varies between 0.6 m and 2.0 m.

Top width of the embankment is meant to facilitate the transport of the material during 
construction and maintenance works. The top width should be sufficiently wide to serve as a 
two lane road to take care of vehicular traffic as also to be used as an inspection road.
When the land-side ground level is higher than the design flood level, the crest width shall 
be 3 m or more regardless of the design flood discharge. Crest width shall be designed for 
multi-purpose use, such as for patrolling during floods and in the execution of emergency 
flood prevention works, Table 5.2.

Provision of a Berm is considered necessary for stability, repair and maintenance purposes. 
If the height of the dike is more than 5 m, the berm width shall be 3.00 m or more.
The approximate line of seepage (phreatic surface) in the cross-section of the proposed 
embankment should be known. It mainly depends upon the soils which are to be used in 
construction of the embankment. (Table 5.3)

Slope design, whether on the river side or the country side is an important and complex 
matter because on it depends the embankment stability. Side slope design presupposes 
the knowledge of elements such as (a) nature of the material of which the embankment is 
constructed (b) method of construction (c) height of embankment and (d) duration, to which 
the embankment is exposed to the wave actions
The river side slope should be flatter than the, angle of repose of the material used in the fill 
as suggested in Table 5.4. This is to be further validated by stability analysis.

The slope protection against erosion, of the embankment should be done by 
using the Stone Riprap, Gabion Mattress filled with Stones, Gabion Mattress 
Geotextile Bags, Concrete Pitching using concrete blocks, Geotextile 
Mattress filled with sand.
The general Guidelines, for the country side slope are as given in Table 5.5:-

The drainage arrangement is a critical part of the design. For a typical homogeneous 
embankment, the vital parameters are shown in Fig. 5.1 Longitudinal drains should be 
provided on the berm and the cross drains should be provided at suitable places to drain the 
water from longitudinal drains.

5.3	
Alignment, Function and Design of Groynes
Alignment
Groynes align either normal to the dominant flow direction or at an angle pointing upstream 
or downstream. A Groyne pointing upstream repels the river flow from it and is deflecting

Groyne. A Groyne pointing downstream attracts the river flow towards it and is attracting 
Groyne.
Functions of Groyne:
	
1.	
Training the river along the desired course to reduce the intensity of the flow 
is the main function of Groyne structure.
	
2.	
It also protects the bank by keeping the flow away from it.
	
3.	
Creating a sagging flow, this will lead to silting up of area.
	
4.	
Improving the depths for navigation purpose.
Design of Groyne
Typical sections of the Groyne showing design parameters in the Nose and Shank portions 
is shown in Fig. 5.2 and Fig. 5.3 respectively. Geometric design of Groyne structure shall be 
done as per IS 8408:1994 which specifies the geometric requirements like length of Groyne, 
spacing of Groynes, and selection of different types of Groynes. For the Groynes constructed 
with flexible material/soft solutions like gabions or geotextile tubes, key length equal to 10% 
of length of Groyne shall be provided to enhance the stability.

Fig. 5.3 Typical Section of the Groyne – Design Parameters – Shank Portion
Filters: The use of the geosynthetic filter can be used from the point of Quality control and 
from construction point of view. High puncture resistance geotextile material shall be used in 
case of heavy stones used in the pitching.

5.4	
Guide Bunds
The Guide Bunds could be either Divergent or Convergent. The major classification of guide 
bunds is as per the shape and function of the structure. Divergent Guide Bunds have attracting 
influence on flow and requires a longer length of alignment in comparison to parallel guide 
bunds considering the degree of protection to approach embankments. On the other hand, 
excessive attack and heavy scour might happen at the head and problem of the shoaling 
along the shank.
Parallel Guide Bunds with suitable curve heads generate uniform flow from the head of 
the guide bund to the axis of the Bridge. The Guide Bunds can be classified according to 
the Geometrical Shape. A straight Guide Bund with circular radii is shown in Fig. 5.417. An 
elliptical Guide Bund is shown in Fig. 5.518.
Fig. 5.4 Straight Guide Bund with Circular Radii
Elliptical with Circular radii and Multi radii curved heads are deployed to improve flow 
conditions as in the case of wide flood plains. The ratio of major to minor axis in the case of 
elliptical radii is 2 to 3.5.

Where, L – m1= Meander Length, mb = Meander Belt, b = Average width of channel during 
floods (Fig. 5.6),
Where, r1 = radius of the loop and the rest parameters as explained above,
Radius of the sharpest acute loop:
Average Radius/2.5 - Max discharge up to 5000 cum/sec
Average Radius/2 - Max discharge above 5000 cum/sec
After determination of sharpest loop, the single or double loop are laid out on survey plan 
(containing alignment of approach embankments and high bank) and it may be ensured that 
the safe distance between the anticipated sharpest loop and approach embankment is < L/3.
Where, L - Length of Bridge.

For Elliptical Guide Bund 1.0 L to 1.25 L
D/S side = Function at the D/S is to ensure that river does not attack approach embankments
Length = 0.2 L
Curved Head and tail for Straight Guide Bunds
Function of curved head is to guide river flow smoothly and axially through bridge
Larger radius of the curve is recommended - to guide the river flow.
Radius of Upstream mole Head: 0.4 L to 0.5 L - Length of the Bridge between abutments 
should not be < 150 m and > 600m
Radius of curved tail = 0.3 to 0.5* Radius of Upstream mole
Sweep Angle
U/S Mole Head - 120° to 140°
For curved tail - 30° to 60°

Fig. 5.8 Typical Slope Protection Works
Typical slope protection works are shown in Fig. 5.8. Protection against the surfacial erosion 
on the river banks can be done by constructing a suitable revetment structure. The main 
function of the revetment structure is to protect the river bank or embankment from surface 
erosion caused mainly due to flow of water. Revetment structure does not provide any 
geotechnical stability to the River Bank. So, in order to have geotechnical stability of the river 
bank, it shall be trimmed to stable slope before constructing any revetment structure.
In case if it is inevitable to protect steep slopes of riverbank, the toe of the river bank shall 
be stabilized with a toe wall of required height (Depending on slope height). This toe wall 
provides the geotechnical stability to the River Bank and further the stabilized slope can be 
protected from surface erosion by constructing an appropriate revetment structure on the 
slope.
The detailed design of the revetment structure shall be adopted as per the following standards:

Gabion Revetments
Wire-enclosed rock, or gabion, revetments consist of rectangular wire mesh baskets filled 
with rock. These revetments are formed by filling pre-assembled wire baskets with rock, and 
anchoring to the channel bottom or bank. Wire-enclosed rock revetments are generally of 
two types distinguished by shape:
The primary advantages of wire-enclosed rock revetments include (a) their ability to span 
minor pockets of bank subsidence without failure and (b) the ability to use smaller, lower 
quality, and less dense, rock in the baskets.
Besides its use as a general bank revetment, wire-enclosed rock in the form of either 
mattresses or blocks is also used as bank toe protection. In some instances the wire-enclosed 
rock is used alone for protection of the bank also. In other cases, the wire-enclosed rock is 
used as toe protection along with some other bank revetment.
Design Guidelines for the Gabion Revetments:-
The thickness of the mattress is selected considering the flow velocity that the mattress has 
to sustain slope angle of the river bank and the average stone fill size that would be available 
for filling the mattress box. Indicative thickness of gabion mattress in relation to water velocity 
shall be given as per Table 5.720. Selected thickness of mattress shall be checked for the 
tractive shear stress criteria i.e. the revetment stability check along the bed and slope portion 
as per FHWA-NHI-09-112.

5.6	
General Guidelines for Spur Design and Construction 
Spurs should not be used where the river is already narrow or where the alignment of the 
river banks cannot be modified or reduced. It is also not advisable to use spurs where the 
opposite bank is exposed to transverse flows, which create unacceptable erosion. In such 
cases continuous longitudinal protection is required. The effectiveness of a spur depends on 
its design and location, and the resources available. The location of the upstream starting 
point and the downstream termination point also influence the success of spur installation. 
The main characteristics to be considered are summarized below:
Permeability: Spurs can be permeable or impermeable. Impermeable spurs are built of local 
soil, stones, gravel, rocks, and gabions, while permeable spurs usually consist of one or 
several rows of timber, bamboo, or similar. An impermeable spur blocks and deflects the river 
flow, while a permeable spur allows water to pass through but reduces the water velocity.
Spur Height: Spurs can be designed to be higher than the water level at all times (non-
submerged), or submerged during the time of floods, emerging only when the flood recedes. 
In general, submerged spurs are designed to be permeable, whereas non-submerged spurs 
are impermeable. 
The height of non-submerged spurs should not exceed the bank height because erosion at 
the end of the spur in the overbank area could increase the probability of outflanking when 
the water level (stream stage) is high. If stream stages can be greater than or equal to the 
bank height, the spurs should be equal to the bank height. If flood stages are always lower 
than the bank height, the spurs should be designed so that overtopping will not occur at the 
bank. Submerged spurs should have a height between 1/3 and 1/2 of the water depth. 
Spur Orientation relative to the River Axis: Spurs can be attracting, deflecting, or repelling 
according to their inclination. An attracting spur points downstream and attracts the flow 
towards its head and thus to the bank, maintaining a deep current close to the bank. A 
deflecting spur changes the direction of the flow without repelling it and creates a wake zone 
behind. A repelling spur points upstream and diverts the flow away from itself. The first spur 
in a bend should always be attracting to minimize the impact of the flow. 
Spur Shape: Spurs are basically bar shaped, but the end protruding into the water flow 
can be shaped differently. An oval or elliptical spur, with the wider portion towards the bank, 
can change the hydraulic efficiency and reduce the direct impact of the flood water on the 
spur body. Investigations have shown that the shape of the spur can affect the bed stress 
distribution and the scour depth around a spur. 
Spur Length: When choosing the length of a spur, it is important to consider the safety of 
the opposite bank. If a spur is too long, it may guide the river current during a flash flood to 
the opposite bank which will cause damage; if it is too short, it may cause erosion of the near 
bank. As a general rule, the length of a spur should be no more than 1/5 the river width and 
no less than 2.5 times the scour depth. Sometimes a spur is made long and strong with the 
aim of changing the river course by repelling it towards the opposite bank, in which case the 



======================================================================
PAGE 70 of 122
======================================================================
IRC:SP:113-2018
59
opposite bank should also be protected. Both the river width and the width of the main flow 
channel to be deflected should be considered when designing the length of a spur. 
The scour depth is given by R = 1.35 (q2f )1/3	
 (5.2) 
where R = the normal scour depth below high flood level (HFL), q = discharge intensity in 
cum/sec per metre width, and f = Lacey’s silt factor, which depends upon the grain size of the 
river bed material.
The value of q can be obtained from q = Qf/Water width in m³/s/m,	
(5.3) 
Where the water width is the flood water width in the river and Qf = 1.2Q – 1.24Q,        (5.4) 
where Q is the discharge. 
Spacing: The effect of a group of spurs depends on their length and spacing. The spacing 
between two spurs depends on the length of the spurs. The effect on flow is best fulfilled if one 
strong eddy is created between each pair of spurs. If the spacing is too wide, the effect of the 
spurs will be insufficient as parts of the bank will remain unaffected. A spacing less than the 
optimum is wasteful as it does not increase the effect. The length of bank protected by a spur 
is generally at least twice the length of the spur projecting perpendicular to the river water 
current; thus spurs do not need to be closer than twice their projecting length. In general, the 
spacing between two spurs should be 2–2.5 times the spur length along a concave bank and 
2.5–3 times the spur length along a convex bank. In the case of a revetment with spurs, the 
spacing can be increased without causing harm to the bank.
Number of Spurs along the Stream Bank: The number of spurs depends on the length of 
stream bank to be protected and the calculated space between spurs.
5.7	
General Guidelines for Porcupines
The use of porcupines for the flood control and anti-erosion works shall be done as per the 
guidelines given in Section 6 of CWC Handbook for Anti-erosion, Flood Protection and River 
Training Works, 2012.

 CHAPTER 6
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
These specifications shall apply to all such road and bridge works in flood prone and flood 
affected areas which are required to be executed under the contract or otherwise directed 
by the Engineer-in charge. In this chapter, specifications of most widely used conventional 
materials like riprap, rubble masonry etc. to most innovative and advanced materials like 
geotextile bags, geotextile tubes are included.
6.1	
Specifications for Stones used in Pitching/Riprap
Stone used for riprap shall be meet the gradation requirements as specified in HEC 11(Design 
of Riprap Revetment) such as hard, durable, angular in shape; resistant to weathering and to 
water action; free from overburden, spoil, shale and organic material. Breadth as well as the 
thickness of a single stone shall not be less than one-third of its length. In general, rounded 
stone or boulders, Shale and stone with shale seams are not accepted unless authorized 
by special provisions. Similarly mudstones and other argillaceous weak rocks should be 
avoided, primarily because they tend to degrade once placed. The minimum weight of the 
stone shall be computed by multiplying the specific gravity (bulk-saturated-surface-dry basis) 
times 1,000 kg/cum.
When the riprap must withstand abrasive action from material transported by the stream, the 
abrasion test in the Los Angeles machine shall also be used. When the abrasion test in the

Specifications of Geotextile Materials used for Anti-erosion, River Training 
and Bank Protection Works
A geotextile fabric is in the form of strong flexible sheets either woven or non-woven. It is used 
in flood management works to improve soil quality and performance in different applications 
like lining, drainage, filtration, separation, reinforcement and protection. 
The basic raw material which is used in geotextile is polymer and the most widely used 
polymers are polypropylene and polyester. Based upon the manufacturing process, geotextile 
is often categorized as woven or non-woven. Woven geotextiles are manufactured by weaving 
weft thread through warp thread. While non-woven geotextile is produced from randomly 
distributed continuous or staple fibers which are bonded together chemically, thermally or 
mechanically.
Geotextile fabrics are used with specific strength and durability requirements as per the 
proposed work. The detailed technical specifications of the geotextiles along with the test 
methods and their recommended values for each parameter are being described in the 
following paragraphs in detail:
6.5.1	
Geotextile Filter:
The material should be woven with multifilament yarn in both warp and weft direction or 
non-woven needle punched type with staple fiber network. The geotextile shall be made 
of polypropylene/polyester with 100% virgin polymer. No recycled polymers shall be used 
in manufacturing of geotextiles. The specifications of geotextile filter shall confirm to 
Section 700 of MORTH Clause 702.
6.6	
Specifications for Geotextile Bags
Geotextile bags are made of woven/non-woven polypropylene/polyester geotextile material;. 
Double layer geotextile bags using woven (tape by tape) and non-woven geotextile are used 
for harsh conditions. Geotextile used to manufacture the geotextile bags should have high 
mechanical and hydraulic properties for enhanced durability along with enhanced puncture, 
abrasion and U.V. resistance characteristics. Geotextile should be inert to biological 
degradation and resistant to naturally encountered chemicals, alkalis, and acids.
6.6.1	
Requirements for a Sustainable and Performing Geosynthetic Bag System:
	
l	
Adequate weight to sustain the uplift pressure due to Hydraulic Forces
	
l	
High Abrasion Resistance
	
l	
Adequate Puncture Strength
	
l	
High Elongation to absorb the Hydraulic Energy



======================================================================
PAGE 75 of 122
======================================================================
IRC:SP:113-2018
64
	
l	
Lower Apparent Opening size to retain even the finer soil particles
	
l	
High Permittivity and Transmissivity
	
l	
Adequate UV Resistance
	
l	
Stable in wider pH range
6.6.2	
Important Considerations in Specifying the Right Geotextile Bags System:
	
l	
Type of Polymer: PP and PET are the commonly used Polymers for these 
works, however through successive field experience PP is found to have 
better performance in case of high alkaline conditions. Therefore, it is always 
advisable to specify on PP for Geotextile bags in alkaline conditions.
	
l	
Quality of Polymer Fiber: The virgin fibers with more than 70 % UV resistance 
shall be used as raw material for making the Fabric and Geotextile bags, no 
recycled fiber shall be allowed for making of Geotextile bags.
	
l	
Type of Fiber: Staple Fiber is much better and found to have superior 
performance for River bank and Coastal application compared to Continuous 
Fibers which degrades when comes in contact with water. 
	
l	
There are several bonding mechanisms available; however the appropriate 
for river application is Needle Punching.
	
l	
Important Properties for performance of Geotextile Bags are- UV Resistance, 
CBR Puncture, Tensile Strength, Seam strength, Apparent Opening size and 
Permeability.
Geotextile used to manufacture Geotextile bags made of non-woven material may conform 
to the properties listed in following Table 6.4. The Specifications for Composite Geotextile 
Bags to be used in harsh conditions are specified in Table 6.5.
6.6.3	
Requirements
6.6.3.1	
Material of Geotextile bags
	
a.	
Geotextile bags shall be made from needle punched nonwoven fabric (Types 
1 to 3) and composite bags shall be made of woven (tape by tape) and 
non-woven fabric manufactured from ultra violet stabilized Polyester or 
Polypropylene and constituent fibre shall be identified by the microscopic 
and confirmatory tests as specified in IS 667; depending upon the end user 
requirements and shall conform to the requirements as specified in Table 
6.3. The geotextile bags shall be inert to commonly encountered chemicals, 
resistant to rot and mildew, and shall have no tears or defects which adversely 
affect or alter its physical properties. 



======================================================================

b.	
All property values except apparent opening size in these specifications 
represent Minimum Average Roll Values (MARV). Average of test results 
from any sampled bag in a lot shall meet or exceed the minimum values 
specified in this standard. In case of apparent opening size, the MARV shall 
represent the Maximum Average Roll Value.  
	
c.	
Polymers used in the manufacture of geo-bags, shall consist of long chain 
synthetic polymers, composed of 100 percent virgin polypropylene or 
polyester. In any case, recycled polyester shall not be permitted in view of 
its inherent non-uniformity and substandard quality as compared to virgin 
polyester fiber. Polypropylene/polyester fiber generally used is virgin only as 
it is not recycled.
Geotextile bags shall be dimensionally stable and able to retain their geometry under 
manufacture, transport, and installation.
6.6.3.2. Prefabrication of Geotextile bags
Geotextile bags shall be prefabricated using UV stabilized PET/PP thread. The geotextile 
bags shall have seam with double line chain stitches along the edges on two sides with a 
stitch density of 20 stitches/dm + 2. The sewing shall be done at a minimum distance of 
10 mm from edges by using a ring spun polyester/polypropylene thread, as the case may 
be, of linear density 1500-2500 Denier for bags up to 400 g/m2 and of 2500-3500 Denier 
(278 – 389 Tex) for bags greater than 400 g/m2. The distance between the two rows of 
stitches shall be 5 to 10 mm. Stitch lines on both sides of the bags shall continue beyond the 
bag’s open mouth and end in a loose loop of thread of length 25 to 50 mm. The ring spun 
polyester / polypropylene thread used for stitching shall be UV stabilized. The stitching shall 
be uniform without any loose thread or knot.
Geotextile used to manufacture geotextile bags having double layers both for woven, 
non-woven & composite material should conform to the properties listed in Table 6.323 and 
6.424.

CHAPTER 7
INSTALLATION AND CONSTRUCTION
7.1	
Introduction
The construction, planning for works envisaged in any flood management/river training works 
is a vital component for the timely completion of the works avoiding time and cost overrun. 
Time is of essence of flood management works as the same has to be completed in available 
non-monsoon season. Construction methodology includes proper construction of the works 
as per the approved design and drawings. This also includes the in-time procurement, 
mobilization and proper installation of the construction materials being used for the works. 
The installation procedure for the innovative materials like Geo-Textile Bags, Geo-Mattress, 
Geo-Textile tubes etc should be performed in a systematic controlled and well planned 
manner so that it would give optimum benefits due to use of these materials. 
This practice provides guidelines for the installation of different systems explained in this 
guideline. This practice, however, is not to be considered as all-encompassing since each 
material and site specific condition usually presents its own challenges and special issues. 
Site or project specific conditions may require them to be altered to ensure effective installation 
under the guidance of the engineer and/or manufacturer.
7.2	
Bank Protection Works/ Slope Covering Works 
7.2.1	
Bank Preparation 
As per the guidelines of “HEC 11 – Design of Riprap Revetment, FHWA”, the bank should 
be prepared by first clearing all trees and debris from the bank and grading the bank surface 
to the desired slope. The area shall be prepared by excavating, shaping and trimming to 
accommodate the stone work and shall be thoroughly compacted by hand-ramming to 
minimize subsequent settlement. A trench shall be excavated as directed by the Engineer 
along the toe of any slope to be pitched or along the unprotected edge of the pitching in the 
beds of stream.
In general, the graded surface should not deviate from the specified slope line by more 
than 150 mm. However, local depressions larger than this can be accommodated because 
initial placement of filter material and/or rock for the revetment will fill these depressions. In 
addition, any large boulders or debris found buried near the edges of the revetment should 
be removed.
7.2.2	
Riprap/Stone Pitching
As per the guidelines of “HEC 11 – Design of Riprap Revetment, FHWA”, the common methods 
of riprap placement are hand placing; machine placing, such as from a skip, dragline or 
some form of bucket; and dumping from trucks and spreading by bulldozer. Hand placement 



======================================================================
PAGE 90 of 122
======================================================================
IRC:SP:113-2018
79
produces the best riprap revetment, but it is an expensive method. Steeper side slopes can 
be used with hand-placed riprap than with other placing methods. 
Where steep slopes are unavoidable (where channel widths are constricted by existing bridge 
openings or other structures, and where acquiring right-of-way is costly), hand placement 
should be considered.
In the machine-placement method, sufficiently small increments of stone should be released 
as close to their final positions as practical. Re-handling or dragging operations to smooth 
the revetment surface tend to result in segregation and breakage of stone and can result in 
a rough revetment surface. 
Stone should not be dropped from an excessive height since this may result in the same 
undesirable conditions. Riprap placement by dumping with spreading is satisfactory provided 
that the required layer thickness is achieved. Riprap placement by dumping and spreading is 
the least desirable method as a large amount of segregation and breakage can occur and is 
not recommended. In some cases, it may be economical to increase the layer thickness and 
stone size somewhat to offset the shortcomings of this placement method.
Commencing at the bottom of the trench, the stone shall be laid and firmly bedded into the 
slope and against adjoining stones. The stones shall be laid with their longitudinal axes at 
right angles to the slope and with their surfaces in contact so as to break joint. The stones 
shall be well rammed into the bank or surface to be protected and the spaces between the 
larger stones shall be filled with fragments of approved pitching stone securely rammed into 
place. Placing of rock by dumping shall not be allowed.
The finished surface of the pitching shall present an even, tight and neat appearance with no 
stones varying by more than 25 mm from specified surface grades or lines. The thickness of 
the pitching, measured at right angles to the surface, shall not be less than 200 mm, or as 
indicated on the drawings.
7.2.3	
Gabions/ Revet Mattresses
Construction details for rock and wire mattresses vary with the design and purpose for which 
the protection is provided. 
Rock and wire mattress revetments may be fabricated where they are to be placed or at 
an off-site location. Fabrication at an off-site location requires that the individual mattress 
units be transported to the site. In this case, extreme care must be taken so that moving and 
placing the mattresses does not damage them by breaking or loosening strands of wire or 
ties or by removing any of the galvanizing or PVC coating.
The following sequence shall be followed in construction of Gabions: 
 
l	
Excavate the formation to the required level as shown in the drawings. If good 
bearing stratum is not observed after the excavation up to mentioned levels 
then, the same should be brought to the notice of Engineer-in-Charge for 



======================================================================
PAGE 91 of 122
======================================================================
IRC:SP:113-2018
80
further advice. The surface of formation should be free from any deleterious 
material and unwanted foreign objects. Loose pockets if any, should be 
excavated and filled with suitable granular or backfill material. 
 
l	
Roll the formation using Vibro-roller of 8 to 10 tonnes capacity in case the 
width is available for roller movement. The design requirements with respect 
to bearing capacity should be achieved and verified before proceeding 
further. Density of compacted formation should be greater than or equal to 
95% of the modified Proctor value. 
 
l	
The formation prepared should be leveled without ruts and undulations. 
 
l	
The outer alignment of the fascia should be marked by the survey team as 
per the requirements in the section and plan drawings. 
 
l	
The non-woven geotextile shall be laid out below. (Only if specified in 
drawings) 
 
l	
The folded gabion unit shall now be opened by placing it on a flat surface 
or leveled ground and straightening out the various end panels. One or two 
persons may be deployed for the straightening of DT mesh panel activity 
depending on the size of gabions. 
 
l	
The back, front, end panels along with the diaphragms shall now be folded 
along the lines after verifying the required correct dimension of the base from 
the section drawings. The diaphragm is secured in position to the base so 
that no additional lacing is necessary at the site.
 
l	
The gabion box shall then be assembled by making the end panels on either 
side meet with the front and back panels. The upper corners at each of the 
pair of side panels shall now be tied with the lacing wire. The diaphragm 
panel used for creating the cells within the gabion shall also be tied to the 
front and back panels.
 
l	
The lower side of the gabion edges and of the existing diaphragms shall then 
be sewn from bottom to top by the lacing procedure. 
 
l	
The procedure for using lacing wire consists of cutting a sufficient length of 
wire, and first looping and/or twisting to secure the lacing wire to the wire 
mesh. Proceed to lace with alternating double and single loops through 
every mesh opening approximately every 150 mm pulling each loop tight 
and finally securing the end of the lacing wire to the wire mesh by looping 
and /or twisting..
 
l	
Adequate care shall be taken during the lacing operation to ensure that the 
base panel of gabion measures the inner dimension required in the section 
drawings. While ensuring the base dimension, proper arrangements shall 
be done to ensure that the side panels form a right angle with the base and 
the gabion box achieves a proper geometry. For this purpose, a right angle 
corner template arrangement made from Wood/Mild steel/Aluminum section 
shall be used. 



======================================================================
PAGE 92 of 122
======================================================================
IRC:SP:113-2018
81
 
l	
Similarly, the required numbers of gabions can be assembled in the available 
open space near the proposed gabion retaining wall structure. 
 
l	
The gabions shall now be placed manually at the proposed structure location 
with the front face along the outer facia alignment marked by the survey 
team. 
 
l	
Rocks for filling the gabion shall be obtained by any suitable quarrying 
method. Rocks should be hard, angular to round, durable and of such quality 
that they do not lose their integrity on exposure to water or weathering during 
the life of the structure. The size of the rocks should range between 150 and 
250 mm. The rocks shall be selected in such a way that at least one face is 
flat-shaped. 
 
l	
MS pipe/frame formwork shall be provided at the gabion fascia for achieving 
a good aesthetic appearance and keeping the bulges within the specified 
tolerances.
 
l	
The rocks should be placed in lifts of 300 mm. The filled layer should never 
be more than 300 mm higher than any adjoining cell.
Installation of mattress units above the water line is usually accomplished by placing individual 
units on the prepared bank, lacing them together, filling them with appropriately sized rock and 
then lacing the tops to the individual units. Where the mattress units must be placed below 
the water line in relatively shallow water, mattress units can be assembled at a convenient 
location and then be placed on the bank using a crane. For deep water installations, an 
efficient method of large-scale placement is to fabricate the mattress sections on a barge or 
pontoon and then launch them into the water at the shoreline. 
7.3	
Installation of Geotextile Bags used for Coastal and Riverine Structures 
	
i.	
After the topographic and bathymetry survey, excavation profile up to the 
desired levels the construction will be commenced. 
	
ii.	
Geotextile bags are filled with good quality sand. Being a flexible structure, it 
will take the shape as the natural bed profile if any settlement takes place in 
future. 
	
iii.	
Before placing the Geotextile bags, a Geotextile filter is placed which will act 
as a filter layer.
	
iv.	
The foundation should be free from ruts, undulations, protrusions etc in order 
to avoid the Geotextile from any damages.  
	
v.	
The large size bags are dry filled at a particular location with a help of a 
frame fabricated essentially for this purpose only. 
	
vi.	
Dry filling shall be carried out at a different site above HFL depending upon 
the availability of the space. 
	
vii.	
Once the Geotextile bags are filled, and the desired weight is achieved, 
the mouth of the bags is stitched. In areas above the water level bags are 
delivered to location using hand carts.



======================================================================
PAGE 93 of 122
======================================================================
IRC:SP:113-2018
82
	
viii.	 Prefilled Large Size bags are then placed onto the site with the help of crane 
and slings attached to place these properly.
	
ix.	
Special care should be taken while dumping the Large Size bags into the 
water so that it would not damage the material. 
	
x.	
Checking of the installed Geotextile Bags shall be   carried out and confirmed 
that the bags are placed in desired locations.
7.4	
Installation of Geotextile Tubes used for Coastal and Riverine Structures
The installation of Geotextile tubes shall be carried out as per the installation procedure 
of GRI GT 11: Standard Practice for Installation of Geotextile Tubes used for Coastal and 
Riverine Structures.
7.5	
Installation and Preparation of Cylindrical Gabion Containment System
DT wire mesh cylindrical gabions shall be supplied folded flat and packed in bundles. Larger 
units may be supplied in rolls and the liner bags for these larger units are supplied separately.
The units are assembled individually in a manner to accommodate the containment system. 
The mesh forming cylindrical gabion and the geotextile containment system shall be unfolded 
from packed bundles. The mesh shall be rolled to form a composite cylindrical shape 
containment unit.
One end of the DT wire mesh cylindrical gabion shall be tied/closed by pulling the shooting 
bar. The Geotextile containment shall be supplied with top end open for filling of the sand and 
the bag shall be stitched with a portable stitching machine post filling the containment unit 
with the sand or appropriate fill materials.
The bundles of Cylindrical Gabions shall be brought to the construction site from the project 
store and stacked in similar fashion as was done at the project stores.
These bundles shall be stacked on a leveled ground with wooden rafters/sleepers in between 
them for easy handling and preventing any damage to the DT mesh and other components 
like the selvedge wire.
The bundles may be opened at the storage yard for supplying the exact quantity of cylindrical 
gabions to the construction site. The individual folded cylindrical gabion units shall be handled 
properly as shown to avoid any damage to the DT mesh and other components.
Post Filling Installation
Once the filling is completed, the filled containment system should be neatly stored together 
and kept in a specified location. The containment system would have minimum weight of 
approximately around 700-850 kgs when filled, depending upon the type of fill material used. 
Care should be taken that these containment systems are not dragged or pulled along the 
ground. For apron construction, the filled containment systems are loaded on a boat/vessel 



======================================================================
PAGE 94 of 122
======================================================================
IRC:SP:113-2018
83
and then dumped into desired location. The lifting of these containment systems is carried 
out by help of cranes.
For units near the bank portion, can be placed in position with the help of the cranes. Care 
should be taken that there should not be any damage to the containment units.
Construction Sequence
The sequence of activities that should be followed to carry out the works is given below:
	
1.	
The material once reaching the site shall be stacked and stored properly 
in dry areas and handled with care in order to minimize the damage to the 
procured items.
	
2.	
The location of material storage and the area identified for filling operation 
should be located in nearby area.
	
3.	
The area for filling operations must be clean and free from organic matter. 
The area should have minimum undulations in order to transport the filled 
containment units to the feeder units easily.
	
4.	
The sand available in the sand stock pile should be free from organic matter.
	
5.	
The filling operations shall be carried out with due care. The selection of the 
filling method will be based on actual site conditions.
	
6.	
Once filled, the bags will be lifted with the help of Hydra cranes and stacked 
appropriately in the stacking yard. The stacking yard should be maintained 
dry and free from burrow animals as a protection measure for the containment 
units.
	
7.	
The filled containment units will then transported to the loading area and 
then transported to areas where dumping is to be carried out.
	
8.	
Small boats to be used to inspect the area post placing or dumping of the 
containment units.
7.6	
Multi Cellular Geocomposite Flood Containment Units can be easily installed 
according to the following instructions
	
1.	
Remove each unit from the pallet; lift and unfold the unit by pulling it straight 
and twisting the end corners.
	
2.	
Join adjacent units in length to form a continuous wall by using connecting 
pins. They will be inserted through the spirals of adjacent unit corners. 
	
3.	
Fold the bottom of the fabric liner inside each cell to form a soil retention seal 
during the filling. 
	
4.	
Fill the unit with material available on site, such as soil, rocks, bricks, gravel, 
etc. Each unit shall be filled uniformly. Filling shall begin from central units 
preferably.

CHAPTER 8
MAINTENANCE AND MONITORING OF FLOOD MITIGATION SYSTEM
8.1	
General
Flood control works as designed and constructed are expected to remain both safe and 
functional throughout their service lives. It is, therefore, imperative that the efficacy of the 
flood control works is periodically and conscientiously monitored, assessed and re-evaluated 
for timely preventive/ corrective action. This chapter outlines activities that are essential to 
protect and maintain flood control works for which an Operation and Maintenance Manual 
(OMM) should be prepared based on region specific body of knowledge and collective 
wisdom. Information on allocation of responsibilities; identification of anticipated flood 
threats; catalogues of flood hazard maps and documented past flood records; stipulation of 
instrumentation, monitoring and inspection schedules; unambiguous directions on emergency 
planning, crisis management and  reporting; directory of  domain experts, institutions, 
designers, contractors; suppliers and disaster managers must all be amenable for quick 
retrieval when needed. Study of and reference to the Guidelines of Flood Mitigation Works-
Operation and Maintenance Manual, 2001 of Ministry of Environment, British Columbia is 
recommended towards evolving region specific OMM tuned to the ground realities.
8.2	
Inspection of Flood Embankments
Routine Annual Inspection 
The importance of routine annual inspection for assessment of the performance of Flood 
Control Works is essential for timely alert and prompt remedial action. The best time to 
schedule an annual inspection would be prior to the flood season during the pre-monsoon 
period. That would allow sufficient time to understand and address maintenance problems in 
the offing. In the event of any adverse assessment reports on the performance of any of the 
flood control works, it is important to quickly follow the matter further by commissioning an 
in-depth investigation by a multi-disciplinary emergency management team, for stitch in time.
The annual inspection report must provide critical observations, and analysis of all visual and 
pictorial evidences related to the structural and non-structural components of flood control 
works. An experienced inspector, or a team of inspectors, should be quick enough to observe 
the dike behaviour in terms of (a) deformation profile of the dike in general and emergence of 
low and high spots along the dike crest (b) slope failure, subsidence and consequent damage 
to the dike slopes (c) bursting of river banks and the associated evidences of bank erosion 
(d) unauthorized excavation, construction and eco-vandalism (e)erosion leading to scour 
of the riverbank protection and (f) debris and other problems at intakes. If and when doubt 
about safety of any flood protection dike raised in the routine inspection report, recourse 
should be taken to a detailed inspection to answer the questions raised in the report. If need 



======================================================================
PAGE 96 of 122
======================================================================
IRC:SP:113-2018
85
be, aerial and underwater surveys for investigation and mapping of damages may also be 
undertaken.
The observations such as (a) the spread of vegetation growth and behaviour of trees (b) 
animal burrows (c) the condition of all fences, gates and locks and the availability of keys 
and (d) damage to water level gauges, etc., may help in the ensuing planning for preventive 
and remedial action.
8.3	
Inspections during High Water Events 
In the age of Information Communication Technology, continuous and real-time monitoring of 
flood protection works, especially in the areas of high hazard is rapidly becoming a matter of 
routine. The techniques of remote sensing coupled with drone surveys have transformed the 
ways patrolling and inspections are carried out by the multi-disciplinary teams, especially in 
the areas of high hazard. The frequency and timings of patrolling and inspections can now be 
guided and modulated by analysis of observational data using modern technology.Wherever 
inspection reports raises doubts and the integrity of flood protection works is suspect, in-depth 
investigation, additional dike inspections and more frequent patrolling should be carried out to 
ensure timely corrective action. During high water events, local water level gauges should be 
monitored regularly and the readings recorded should be analyzed in the light of the previous 
and historic data. Dike patrol frequency should increase as the water levels approach critical 
conditions, and should be continuous while the level is within 1.0 m of the dike crest. 
The content, quality and speed of reporting must receive careful attention so that inspection 
reports not only raise right questions at the right time but also provide enough insights to 
facilitate quick decision making. It is, therefore, necessary to ensure that the inspection team 
has the ability to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviour. It should not only 
trained in the art of observations but should also be fully aware of what is expected of the flood 
control works and what all could go wrong during the high water events. For instance, during 
the high water events, when flood levels are high, it is quite normal to observe enhanced 
seepage appearing at landward toe of the dike.  On the other hand, sudden emergence of 
water streams, evidences of erosion, scouring and piping, subsidence and sloughing of dike 
crest and slopes, locations of low free, accumulations of debris at flood boxes, flap gates and 
trash racks and board bursting of banks are sure indicators of an impending disaster.
A constant watch is necessary on calibration and reliable functioning of all monitoring 
instruments. Pumps must not malfunction when they are needed the most. Cables and pipes 
when inspected must not point to seepage along them. Mapping of surface and subsurface 
cracks and their subsequent propagation can throw light on the performance behaviour of 
dikes.
8.4	
Post Flood Inspections and Evaluations
The post flood inspection must always be by a multi-disciplinary team so that the interplay 
of causative factors could be understood to the last detail and lessons from failures could

be learned for forward planning and remediation. Mapping and assessment of flood inflicted 
damages should be undertaken immediately after water levels have subsided. It is also 
important to correlate the observations with the causative factors and experiences gained 
during similar events in the past. During the inspection, areas requiring action should be 
categorized as vital, essential and desirable so that the priorities are not lost. Many of the 
field evidences recorded and inferences made during the inspection will serve as invaluable 
inputs to the design of remedial packages and therefore independent validation of all major 
observations is essential. Efforts should be made to locate and record a complete high water 
profile along the dike after significant flow events. This information is useful in assessing the 
dike crest level and the freeboard.
Post flood inspections related to cyclonic storms and tsunamis are matters requiring much 
higher levels of expertise and fall outside the scope of these Guidelines.
8.5	
Dike Maintenance/Repair
It is important to develop a check list of items of inspection and Do’s and Don’ts. First and 
foremost, the flood protection works including all fences should be promptly attended to 
ensure timely minor repair work. The locks of the gates should always be kept functional and 
their keys should be easily accessible to the authorized personnel at any time of day and 
night. Effort should be made to insulate flood protection works from possible eco-vandalism. 
One way would be to seek restricted access for unauthorized vehicles, another way would be 
to enhance patrolling. The profile of the dike crest should be periodically retrieved by addition 
of crushed gravel surfacing, as required to maintain a reasonably smooth and competent 
driving surface.  Vegetation on the dike fill side slopes should consist of closely trimmed grass 
or low ground cover. Depending on local growth rates, dike slopes should be trimmed and 
restored at least once in a year. Trees and brush growth should not be allowed, if detrimental 
to safety of dikes. The environmental approvals should become an essential feature of the 
guidelines for dike maintenance.  Animal holes or burrows in fills should be suitably dealt with 
by backfilling/grouting.
Damage to dike slopes should be repaired and the slope should be restored as soon as 
possible by the addition and compaction of appropriate clean earth fill materials. Water level 
gauges and monitoring devices should be periodically inspected, repaired and re-leveled, if 
necessary. It is important that inspection personnel do not miss them out.
8.6	
Bank Protection Maintenance and Repair 
The nature of remedial action required for bank protection will depend on the level of 
maintenance and repair required in a given case. In routine maintenance, use riprap or 
gabion mattress over a geotextile filter is usually enough for bank protection. The design 
for rock gradation or mattress thickness is determined as per the guidelines given in 
Chapter 6. The bank protection will require varying maintenance depending upon the extent, 
level and duration of flooding, frequency and level of exposure to stream flooding, wave 
action and floating debris.  Repair to damaged pitching is commonly made by replacing the

87
damaged portion with a new material. Riprap or gabion mattress shall be prefilled and using 
the crane arrangement, the damaged portion shall be replaced. If a major damage or failure 
of bank protection occurs, professional engineering advice must be sought and necessary 
approvals obtained. 
8.7	
Flood Box Maintenance
When the external water level turns lower than the water level behind the dike, it will be 
subject to higher thrust of water for which it may not be designed. It is for this reason, to 
balance out thrust of water on the dyke, it is common to provide flood boxes.  All the flood 
boxes do is to allow gravity transfer of water from behind the dike into the main water course. 
A typical flood box consists of a conduit or culvert passing through the dike with a flap gate 
at the outlet on the water side. It may also have trash racks at both ends to keep debris out.
For efficient functioning of flood boxes, their periodic cleaning and maintenance is essential. 
Unless both inlet and outlet are cleaned of debris and silt, flow of water will be impaired. 
Similarly, unless the flip gates are cleaned and lubricated to make sure that they swing 
freely and close properly, they will not function when needed the most. Unwanted growth 
of vegetation and trees close to flood boxes often hamper inspection and maintenance. 
Furthermore, the culvert pipes, if made of metal should be checked for corrosion and 
blockage. Culverts whether made of metal or concrete would have to be inspected internally 
for leakage at joints, loss of joint sealant and unacceptable deformation levels, especially at 
joints.

CHAPTER 9
CONCLUSIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE WAY FORWARD
9.1	
Policy Framework
The engineering of Highways and Roads in the flood-prone areas of India should be firmly 
anchored to the over-arching provisions of the National Disaster Management Act of 2005 
and the National Policy on Disaster Management of 2009. The National Platform on Disaster 
Risk Reduction; the Sendai Framework; the Johannesburg Plan30 and the India’s National 
Disaster Management Plan31 all resonate with India’s notified national policy, and aim at 
achieve Sustainable Development through Disaster Mitigation and Mitigation. In the light of 
the above, it is obligatory that highway engineers (a)mainstream flood disaster mitigation into 
the process of highway planning , design and construction, (b) promote culture of prevention, 
preparedness and resilience against flood disasters in a multi-hazard context,(c) encourage 
implementation of environment friendly mitigation measures using time-tested technology and 
traditional wisdom, (d)ensure efficient mechanism for identification, assessment , monitoring 
of disaster risks and for early warning , and (e) recognize every project of reconstruction as 
an opportunity to build back better. It is imperative that the DPR of all major road projects 
must necessarily conform to the broad policy framework outlined above. 
In keeping with the first priority of the Sandai Frame work- Understanding risk in a multi-
hazard environment- to which India stands committed; all major highway and road 
engineering projects should begin with assessment of all tenable hazard scenarios and risk, 
in multi-hazard context. Earlier too, the Hyogo Framework of Action (2005-15) had also laid 
considerable emphasis on an integrated multi-hazard approach to risk reduction. Naturally, 
flood disasters cannot and should not be looked at in isolation while planning, designing, 
constructing and protecting highways and roads. Rather, all schemes of flood safe designs, 
prevention, protection and remediation should be driven by the multi-hazard disaster risk 
resilience approach. For example, a flood safe embankment located in a seismic area must 
necessarily be seismic safe or a flood safe highway in a hilly area must necessarily be 
landslide safe.
9.2	
Recommendations
Flood Hazard and Risk Management
	
1.	
Credible Flood hazard and inundation mapping hold the key to understanding 
of the flood hazard in a specific situation. Development of scientifically 
30	 Evolved at the World Submit on Sustainable Development held during 26 August - 4 September, 
2002
31	 Released in June, 2016



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:113-2018
89
credible, and user-friendly, large scale flood hazard zonation and inundation 
mapping must therefore be accorded the highest priority at all levels. Space 
technologies Landsat-TM and SPOT images and the potential of Landsat-
TM and SPOT images should be fully tapped to prepare large scale flood 
hazard maps and to study hydro-geology and drainage characteristics of 
related catchments. It is equally essential to obtain comprehensive and large 
scale coverage of flood affected infrastructure for risk analysis and updating 
of maps facilitated by Earth Observation Satellite data and high resolution 
images.
	
2.	
Forecasting of floods, timely projection of site specific flood scenarios and 
their periodic revalidation should become a routine practice. It is only then 
that the volume, veracity, velocity and variety of big data on extreme weather 
events and flood prone areas will benefit planning, design, construction and 
protection of highways and roads.
	
3.	
Lessons learned from the previous flood disasters in an area should be 
ploughed back in evolving flood-safe design of roads in that area. For 
instance, reconstruction of a stretch of road or a bridge destroyed by a flood 
or a flood-induced landslide should rule out similar occurrences in that area, 
in future. In other words, it should be possible to instantly recall and effectively 
use information on the previous flood events, for forward planning, design 
and construction.
	
4.	
Systematic documentation of real time flood hazard and inundation, video-
filming, damage assessment and monitoring of the progress of rescue, relief 
and remedial works should be made mandatory in crisis times.
	
5.	
The power of new technology such as Remote controlled and Programmed 
Drones-should be effectively used for pre and post disaster investigations, 
surveys of flood prone areas, delivery of supplies, reaching out to inaccessible 
areas and for providing surveillance. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or Drones 
and Hot Air Balloons are finding sensational applications in flood disaster 
management and India can immensely benefit from their effective use.
9.3	
Planning, Design and Construction
	
1.	
Planning, design and construction of highways and roads in flood prone 
areas should take in to account geo-morphology and hydro-geology of the 
area, long range rainfall records and extreme weather events, catchment 
characteristics, drainage patterns, over-land and subsurface flows and the 
existing negative impacts of ill-planned urbanization on drainage.
	
2.	
All major projects should take steps to ensure that highways and roads 
themselves do not become cause of flooding, or aggravate flooding by 
obstructing natural drainage routes. This is perhaps the single most important 
lesson learned from the study of major flood disasters across the country, 
including the Chennai floods of 2005 and 2015. By the same logic, risk due 



======================================================================
PAGE 101 of 122
======================================================================
IRC:SP:113-2018
90
to flooding can be minimised32 by removing obstructions, clearing drainage 
routes and improving the drainage of the area.
	
3.	
Utmost attention must be paid to alignment of roads. For instance, major 
floods often result from faulty alignment of roads in hilly areas because of the 
frequent choking of water streams and rivers by landslide debris and bursting 
of landslide dams they create resulting in flash floods. These very Riverine 
floods then destroy bridges downstream and trigger more landslides. Every 
DPR should therefore closely examine the various competitive options before 
decision making. Expenditure in selection of most eco-friendly and technically 
sound road alignment should be considered as the best investment strategy, 
especially if roads traverse through a hazardous geo-environment.
	
4.	
Critical engineering scrutiny of road designs and the contingency flood 
management plans is also essential, wherever the road-alignment foul 
river regimes, especially in the areas of high flood hazard. This is all the 
more important because at the planning, design and construction stages, 
it is often difficult to fully account for uncertainties arising from unknown 
unknowns, known unknowns and shaky design assumptions. The failures of 
embankments along the banks of river Koshi during the Bihar floods of 2007 
were precisely because the unknown consequences of the known trend of 
the shifting river course. It was because of this that the embankments on the 
river banks were subjected to an enormous amount of lateral thrust for which 
the embankments had not been designed.
	
5.	
Planning of the road network should be such that it provides alternative 
routes of connectivity for effective post flood evacuation, rescue and relief 
distribution. The NDMA Report of 28 September 2017 on Tamil Nadu floods 
favours formation of green corridors in vulnerable areas to facilitate rapid 
movement of rescue teams.
	
6.	
Designs of embankments must be safe not only against subsidence, slope 
and base failures but the designs must also rule out flood induced liquefaction, 
scouring and erosion. When embankments are designed exclusively for 
flood protection, their designs should be integrated with the designs of other 
related flood control measures such as storage dams and detention basins.
	
7.	
In the design of highways and roads along and across water courses in river 
basins, safety against flooding can be achieved only if the design takes into 
account the interdependence of, and interaction between the individual flood 
mitigation and flood control measures.
32	 This way the reason that, well in advance of the North East Monsoon flood season of 2016, a 
comprehensive programme of cleaning of drains, culverts and preventive maintenance of drainage 
facilities was undertaken in Chennai. Encroachments and blockages on either side of 15870 
bridges and more than 1.4 lakh culverts and were removed, 500 m upstream and downstream, 
and at least 5000 culverts were cleaned.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:113-2018
91
	
8.	
Functional disaster knowledge networks and multi-institutional co-operation 
at all levels of government are essential for effective implementation of 
sectoral policies regarding environmental protection, physical planning, land 
use planning, agriculture, road transport and urban development.
	
9.	
All major ongoing highway constructions which are at risk of flooding should 
be critically reviewed without loss of time to ensure safety against all the 
anticipated flood scenarios. When facing damages due to floods, the softer 
option of taking recourse to palliative measures and quick-fix solutions must 
give way to holistic remediation.
	
10.	 Flood protection is never absolute; even then a high level of protection against 
flooding can be reached through timely intervention. Project authorities 
should always remain alert to the residual risk for each flood control structure. 
In each case, the consequence analysis should be made in consonance with 
the design level of protection beyond which the flood control defences may 
give way.
	
11.	 If the present trends are any indicator, urban areas in India are rapidly 
expanding and the associated network is becoming much more vulnerable 
to urban flooding. Since the highway engineering planning, design and 
construction practices have not improved fast enough to match the growing 
vulnerability of roads to urban floods, it is essential that the present Acts 
related to Town planning, Industrial zone planning, Land reforms and 
Transportation corridors should be expeditiously reviewed and suitably 
amended. Preservation of water bodies, efficient disposal of urban wastes, 
total ban on encroachments, revamping of existing drainage systems, 
augmentation of surface and subsurface drainage all need exceptional 
attention.
9.4	
Use of Smart Construction Materials
For flood resilient construction of roads, inter alia, smart construction materials and 
technologies hold considerable promise. The global market is full of smart materials and 
technologies for improving the drainage of highways and roads, and countering flooding. 
Since little is known about long term performance of newly introduced smart construction 
materials and technologies, their selection to meet site-specific requirement should be done 
with utmost caution and adequate preparedness to meet the contingencies.  
In urban areas, flooding is very common because of impervious road surfaces, paved foot 
paths, ill-planned urban infrastructure and clogged storm water drains. Smart materials such 
as Top-mix Permeable concrete33 has brought a new hope in flood safe highway designs 
as it can absorb 880 gallons of water in one minute to counter inundation effect and make 
driveways, pavements, walkways and parking areas flood-safe . In the patented process, the 
Topmix Permeable is applied over a base layer of gravel and the flood water is allowed to

either permeate into the ground below or is diverted elsewhere, over a period of time, through 
a series of pipes. Similarly holistic drainage solutions making efficient use of different variants 
of Geo-synthetics can significantly reduce flood proneness of urban areas by augmenting 
drainage.
Central and State Governments should launch projects aimed at upgrading, supplementing 
or replacing  non-functional Storm Water Drainage Systems by promoting  large scale 
applications of smart materials and technologies. 
9.5	
Mitigation and Management
For implementation of flood risk resilience measures in a given highway project, care should 
be taken to ensure that (a) technology used is not only be cost and speed effective but it is 
also eco-friendly (b) synergy of measures is fully tapped and (c) question of sustainability is 
adequately addressed.
Floods in rivers often destroy roads and bridges. Over topping and scouring of bridge 
piers are among the main causes of bridge failures. We need technologies to inspect 
and track scouring of bridge foundations in real time for timely corrective action. Physical 
inspection of the foundations of such bridges, especially if unsafe, is neither feasible nor a 
good idea. Highway engineers in the USA have already developed technologies which can 
facilitate condition monitoring of pier foundations threatened by scouring. Also, automated 
instrumentation systems mounted on driverless vehicles hold promise for relatively risk free 
condition monitoring of bridges and robot managed repair work in cases where access is 
risky.
Intelligent Transportation Systems34, well tested telecommunication and Vehicular Ad hoc 
Networks (VANETs) are finding increasing demand in flood disaster management. By 
introducing community based traffic applications, the drivers are now able to share real 
time data on traffic flow, road accidents, flooding related information, and locate the nearest 
safe parking. Also, by field instrumentation and monitoring of floods and stitch in time, it is 
now possible to pro-actively ensure the safety of evacuation roads and routes, and maintain 
access to police and fire stations and hospitals in the times of crisis. The concept of Intelligent 
Streets promises emergency alerts, digital warnings, display of evacuation routes and 
recording of rising water level by lamp-posts. In the event of unacceptable levels of flooding, 
public transportation system will be automatically shut. In the event of road accidents and 
flood trapped vehicles, there will be no need to call police or ambulance as the vehicle itself 
will do the reporting.
Management of potholed-roads to reduce flood risks is of critical importance. Every year 
dozens of people die because of the visible as well as water covered pot holes in the flooded

roads. It is high time we think of innovative solutions deploying smart, easy to implement and 
possibly self healing technologies capable of quick repair of roads and road infra-structure. 
Self-healing technologies also hold considerable Promise.35
9.6	
Flood Protection Works
There are a number of different possible options in terms of products and technologies for 
protection of highways and roads against flooding. For example, use of Geosynthethics/ 
Geotextiles, gabions etc. are quite common. Real progress will be made when we begin to 
document failure case records which are in reality the true teachers. It is quite understandable 
that flourishing businesses thrive on success stories and usually shy away from talking about 
failure case records for the fear of adverse publicity. Both Failure and Success-stories based 
on long-term scientific monitoring and well analyzed feedback needs to be encouraged. 
9.7	
Standardization
The advocacy for standardisation is the need of the hour. This should include all aspects 
including flood hazard mapping, risk assessment, site investigations and flood disaster 
mitigation. 
Standardization of commonly used materials for flood protection works is also highly desirable. 
Take for example, standardization for testing of Geosynthethics. Reportedly the BIS, ASTM, 
ISO and others show fair degree of convergence in thinking. There are hardly any SOPs for 
evaluating the efficacy of the protection works as a whole.
The culture of Observational Method of Design and Construction in Geotechnical treatment of 
Highway engineering problems needs encouragement. We design protection works under the 
veil of uncertainties by making assumptions which are seldom questioned. We make use of 
empirical approaches to design without meditating on their applicability or otherwise, and the 
ensuing consequences. There is no built-in mechanism to scientifically evaluate our designs 
with the passage of time. Many of the designers do not even realize that sometimes, remedies 
could be worse than the respective maladies, if the composite behaviour of the protection 
works get judged only in terms of the strengths of its individual components. Geotechnically 
well established approaches to stability analyses in terms of total and effective stress to rule 
out vital modes of failure are also seen to be generally out of the current practice.
The consideration of aesthetics and environment friendly appearance in design of 
flood protection works should also receive utmost attention. For example, massive rock 
emplacements for coastal road protection provide bad optics as eye-sores and must be 
35	 The  School of Engineering at the University of Cardiff, in Wales are already studying (1) shape-
memory polymers activated by electrical current (2) healing agents made from organic and 
inorganic compounds and (3) capsules containing bacteria and healing agents. We need to 
develop our own technologies to meet our situation specific diverse requirements

94
replaced by aesthetically pleasing and well-designed wave energy dissipation structures or 
tetrapod technology. Similarly hard armor and soft technology applications of Geosynthethics 
for coastal protection must also necessarily have an environment friendly look. 
It is a challenge to the highway engineers to ensure that speed of construction is not raised 
at the expense of quality of road construction. The rapidly expanding highway and road 
networks in hazardous areas calls for care for detailing in planning, design and construction, 
far above the standards of routine practice. It is not easy to maintain performance standards 
of quality while in the race for rapid road construction, under pressure of time. These days of 
global rush for rapid economic development as well as while dealing with situations created 
by disasters, quality assurance usually yields to compromises. To illustrate the point, let us 
consider preventing land loss and re-engineering of failed roads due to flooding. The ideal way 
would be to remove the causes of land-loss and road failure but since speed of construction 
is important, recourse is often taken to construction of retaining walls and revetments without 
fundamentally addressing the causes of land-loss. Every life-size problem, be that related to 
land-loss or any other, may have several competing engineering solutions to pick and choose 
from. In the quest for the apt solution, holistic approach to be followed must be based on 
free-thinking, without bias to specific technologies. In reality, however, the market forces fuel 
the growing trend of putting the technology first and thinking of the solution afterwards. The 
matter is getting quite serious and needs attention.
9.8	
Environment Friendly Solutions
Every flood disaster leaves behind huge piles of debris everywhere. Debris in rivers, reduce 
their flow capacities. Discharge of debris brought down by their tributaries especially during 
the monsoon period, add fuel to the fire. When natural flow channels get blocked due to debris, 
a river is left with no option other than to foul its banks and change its course thereby flooding 
areas which never witnessed floods before. Alarming rates of slope erosion and careless 
disposal of construction debris and slope waste provoke flooding. Since the accumulations 
of debris and slope wastes pose a severe environmental threat, there is an urgent need to 
develop technologies to utilize large volumes river shingle and boulders, fallen rocks, slope 
wastes and landslide debris in construction of highways and roads.
9.9	
Damage Assessment
Overtopping of embankment due to floods often damage roads, highways, and the associated 
infrastructure in a variety of ways. The mapping and assessment of damages on roads after 
every major flooding should therefore become an essential part of normal maintenance 
strategy, documentation and reporting. Lack of reliable information on damages caused by 
the past flood events hits the designer as a handicap. Similarly, absence of, or ignorance 
about performance related data of highways and roads in hazardous areas is also a matter 
of handicap. Moreover, dealing with a damaging flood is not just a matter of managing flood 
waters. For instance, Bihar floods of 2007 not only caused heavy damages to National

95
highways, State highways and large network of rural roads but also damaged a number of 
bridges and culverts.
9.10	
Financial Provisions
Highways and roads under construction, if still unfinished can be wiped out, especially if the 
monsoon rains are severe. There should be enough financial provision in the project budget 
to ensure speedy completion of unfinished projects and to provide timely flood protection, in 
case of a likely problem.
Highways, Roads and Road Infrastructure are the worst hit during floods which is why highest 
investments are required to ensure safety of roads against all types of hazards and curb 
recurring economic devastation. In the post disaster assessment of the Bihar floods of 2007, 
the demand for reconstruction raised by  Road Construction Department of the Government 
of Bihar was Rs 1586 crore, out of the total  of 8000 crore to cover the entire reconstruction 
work36. Similar experiences have been reported from other flood disasters. On the other 
hand, by taking recourse to modicum of annual investments in prevention, protection and 
maintenance, safety of roads can be ensured, especially during the times of crisis when they 
are needed the most.

Project: Construction of 21.5 km Gangapath expressway from Digha to Didarganj, Patna, 
Bihar, India. (Ongoing project and expected date of complete is 2020.)
Problem: In Bihar, floods or peak rainfall periods have become continuous event 
causing recurring disaster which on an annual basis destroys thousands of human lives 
and infrastructure. Patna lies in seismic zone IV, which is a high-risk zone and is liable to 
earthquakes and the city lies largely in the Ganga river basin, which gets affected from flood 
due to the spillover during monsoons. 
Project details: Ganga Path, Christened Loknayak Ganga Path in honor of Jayaprakash 
Narayan, is a 21.5 km Expressway from Digha to Didarganj along southern bank of river Ganga 
in the city of Patna in the state of Bihar. Highway embankment ‘Gangapath’ along the Ganga 
River where ground improvement, erosion control and flood protection measures were adopted 
to overcome the flood. Depending on the ground conditions, various ground improvement 
methods including removal and replacement, basal reinforcement with high strength geogrid 
termed as ‘Paralink’, dynamic compaction, stage construction and construction of additional 
berms were applied to improve the soft soil .Passive bank protection measures are primarily 
armored structures or armor layers preventing a backline from erosion but doesn’t create 
significant interference with the flow. Based on the slope and design calculations, protection 
works were provided with Reno mattresses/gabion mattresses of various thicknesses and 
biodegradable erosion control mat with a Geosynthetic filter layer.

CASE STUDY 2
Project: Emergent Works for the Protection of Rohmoria Area in Dibrugarh District, Assam, 
India
Year: October 2011 to April 2012.
Problem: Area most severely affected by river erosion.
Project Details: Rohmoria, in the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra River in Assam. This 
area is located about 20 to 30 km away from Dibrugarh town in the upstream direction of 
the south bank of Brahmaputra River. The area has witnessed erosion for the last sixty 
years and more than 25 villages had been wiped out by erosion. Water Resource 
Department suggested the use of Geotextile Bags for the bank protection. The height of 
slope was approximately 5.5 m. The bank and bed protection were done with Geotextile 
Bags placed on geotextile filter layer. Peripheral strips of Steel Gabion and PP rope gabions 
filled with layers of geotextile bags were placed at regular intervals to impart further stability 
to the scour protection measures.

bamboo piling work in some other stretches.
The project involved launching of prefilled Gabion mattress. In the rehabilitation process, the 
eroded embankments and banks had to be reconstructed. The Gabion mattress were placed 
at a depth of 20 m under water at a distance of 12 m from the bank. The embankment was 
reconstructed using locally available earth fill compacted to 90% of the maximum dry density

as per Ministry of Surface Transport Standards. The side slope of the embankment was 
protected with a 0.6m thick stone pitching. The river banks which were at a very precarious 
and unstable slope were reconstructed. The slope was stabilized by loose dumping of rocks 
(rip rap) 30-40 kg weight to form a bank slope of 1:2. Permanent protection of the formed 
bank slope was done using a Gabion revetment.

Notes:-
1.	 Figures assessed by the RBA for the States of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh are before 
their bifurcation and as such also include flood prone areas of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand 
respectively.
2.	 RBA, taking into consideration that some of the area reported to be protected by the States is also affected 
by the floods, estimated area prone to floods as 400 lakh hectares. It did not give State-wise break up of 
400 lakh hectares.
3.	 In respect of the States, which did not report flood prone area to the Working Group (WG) of the Eleventh 
Plan, the figures as reported to RBA or the Working Group of Tenth Plan have been taken.

ANNEXure-II
Identification of Flood Hazard Zones (United Nations 1996)
The flooding hazard zones are identified by interpreting the topographic map, soil map and 
land sat imagery. In the process, the watershed of each stream and river was firstly identified 
from the topographic map and delineated. After that, flood plain, lower terrace and coastal 
plain in each watershed were identified and delineated by considering both soil map and land 
sat imagery. Finally each flooding hazard zone shall be transferred to a topographic map of 
the same scale which had already been digitized and stored in the computer system.
The weight of each factor is as follows:
l
Annual rainfall
=
8
l
Size of watershed
=
7
l
Side slope of watershed
=
6
l
Gradient of main drainage channel
=

l

=
4
l
Land use
=
3
l
Type of soil
=
2
l
Communication lines and infrastructure
=
1
Besides, each factor is divided into a number of classes and each class, weighted according 
to the estimated significance for causing flooding. The maximum weight for each class of 
every factor is 8 whilst the minimum is 2 and the total weight used for considering the rate of 
probability of flooding is:
Total weight of each factor = factor weight * weight of factor class
The classes distinguished for each factor are:

Communication Line and other Infrastructure 
Highways, roads, railways, tracks and other infrastructure that obstruct the flow of the river and 
stream promote flooding. The classes and weight of each class of this factor are as follows:
Class
Infrastructure
Weight
1
Watershed area that has infrastructure obstructing the flow direction of 
stream and river within the flood hazard zone at more than 10 locations
8
2
Watershed area that has infrastructure obstructing the flow direction of 
stream and river within the flood hazard zone at 6-10 locations
6
3
Watershed area that has infrastructure obstructing the flow direction of 
stream and river within the flood hazard zone at 3-5 locations
4
4
Watershed area that has infrastructure obstructing the flow direction of 
stream and river within the flood hazard zone at less than <3 locations

Table A2.8 Infrastructure
Based on the weight of every factor and its class, the maximum total weight of each factor 
is the result of the multiplication of such factor weight with the weight of its dividing first 
class. Thus, maximum total weight of the factors rainfall, size of watershed, side slope, slope 
gradient, drainage density, land use, soil type, and infrastructure are 64, 56, 48, 40, 32, 24, 
16, and 8 respectively. The sum of these total maximum weights is 288.
The total minimum weight of each factor, is the result of the multiplication of the factor weight 
with the weight of its lowest class. These are 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 9, 4, and 2 respectively and 
the summed minimum total weight is 75.

Considering this, the total weight of the flood hazard zone with the highest probability to be 
flooded 288 whilst the lowest probability is 75.
Considering the statistic standard deviation values of the total weight data obtained for the 
study area, the weight of each class is given as: 
l	
High	
=	
183-288
