lENTATlVE SPECIFICATION FOR BUILT-UP
SPRAY GROUT
1.
INTRODUCTION
This
standard
was
prepared
by
the
Bituminous Pavements
Committee in their meeting held on the 8th September 1971. Later it
was
approved
by
the
Specifications and Standards Committee and
then by
the
Executive
Committee.
Finally
it was
approved
by
the
Council
in
their
79th meeting
held
at
Gandhinagar
on
the
25th
November,
1972.
Para
5.10
has,
however,
been
modified
to bring in conformity with IRC Special Publication 11
"Handbook
of Quality
Control
for
Construction of Roads & Runways" (First
Revision).
2.
SCOPE
This specification
is intended as an alternative to conventional
water bound
macadam, where water may be scarce or construction
may otherwise be difficult such as when strengthening of an
existing
road
is
involved which cannot be closed to traffic.
Built-up spray
grout could also be adopted when
machinery
is
not
available
for
bituminous macadam, though
it will not be as strong as the latter.
3.
DESCRIPTION
Built-up spray grout shall consist of a two-layer composite con-
struction of compacted crushed coarse aggregates with application of
bituminous binder after each layer for bonding,
finishing
with
key
aggregates at the
top of second layer so
as to yield a thickness not
exceeding 75 mm.
Construction in
more
than
two
layers
is
not
recommended.
It
is
an
open-graded
construction suitable as base or binder
course but should not be utilised as a wearing course.
4.
MATERIALS
4. 1 .
Binder
4.1.1.
The binder shall be one of the following:
(i) a
straight-run
bitumen

(iii) an approved cutback.
4.1.2.
The

CONSTRUCTION
5.1.
Weather and Seasonal Limitations
Built-up spray grout shall not be constructed when the atmos-
pheric temperature in shade
is below 16'C nor when the pavement is
damp, or the weather
is foggy or rainy or a dust storm
is on.
5.2.
Equipment
All equipment necessary for proper construction shall be on the
site of work in good condition.
5.3.
Preparation of Base
The underlying course on which built-up spray grout
is to be
laid shall be prepared, shaped and
conditioned to a uniform grade
and
section
as
specified.
Any depressions or pot-holes
shall
be
properly made up and thoroughly compacted sufficiently in advance.
It
is important that the
surface be dry and thoroughly cleaned
before start of construction. As such the surface shall be swept free
of caked earth and other foreign matter, cleaned with hard brushes,
then with softer brushes and
finally by blowing with sacks or gunny
bags to remove the fine dust.
If the base to be covered
is an old black top surface, it shall be
swept clean and free of sand, dirt, dust and other
loose
deleterious
foreign matter and be dry.
If the base to
be treated
consists of stabilised
soil or porous
aggregates,
a
suitable
bituminous
primer,
vide
IRC
:

Primes'*
shall
be
applied
and
cured
before
the
construction
commences.

Tack Coat
The binder shall be heated
to
the appropriate
temperature
as
specified and applied uniformly
to the base
at
the
rate specified in
Table 3 preferably with a sprayer. The tack coat shall be applied just
ahead of the spreading of coarse aggregates.

Spreading and Compacting
the
First
Layer
of Coarse
Aggregates
5.5.1.
Spreading:
The coarse aggregates shall be spread and
hand packed (with suitable edge protection) at the rate of 0.5 m^ per
10 rn^ to a uniform depth true to the required alignment and profile.
A testing template cut to the camber of the
finished pavement
shall
be used
to obtain uniformity of the crown.
The spreading
shall be carried no
further
in advance
of the
rolling and other operations that can be completed
in one
average
day's work. Segregated aggregates or aggregates mixed with earth or
other foreign substances shall be removed and replaced with clean
graded aggregates.
5.5.2.
Rolling:
After spreading, the coarse aggregates shall be
compacted to full width by
rolling
with
either
three
wheel power
roller of 8 to 10 tonnes
capacity
or an equivalent vibratory
roller.
The rolling shall begin from edges progressing gradually towards the
centre parallel to the centre line of the road, uniformly lapping each
preceding
rear wheel track by
one
third width.
On superelevated
portions,
rolling
shall
commence
from
the
lower
edge
of
the
pavement progressing gradually towards the upper edge.
After the roller has passed once over the whole area, the surface
shall be checked with a camber template and a 3 metre straight edge.
4



======================================================================
PAGE 9 of 12
======================================================================
IRC: 47-1972
The surface shall not vary more
than
12 mm
from the template
or
straight edge.
All surface
irregularities
exceeding the above
limit
shall be corrected by removing or adding aggregates
as required.
Rolling shall be
discontinued
before
the voids
are closed
to
such an extent
as
to
prevent
free and
uniform penetration of the
bitumen.
5.6.
First Application of Binder
After the first layer of coarse
aggregates
has been
rolled and
checked, the binder heated to a
temperature appropriate to
its type
and grade shall be applied uniformly over the surface preferably with
the help of mechanical sprayers.
The
quantity
of binder
shall be
12.5 kg. to 15.0 kg. per 10 m-.
Before applying the binder, the aggre-
gates in the spread layer shall be surface dry to full depth.
5.7.
Spreading and Compacting Second Layer of Coarse
Aggregates
Immediately, after application
of binder on
first layer
as per
para 5.6, coarse aggregates at the rate of
0.5 m^ per 10 m^ shall be
spread for the second layer and compacted as described in para 5.5.
5.8.
Second Application of Binder
After
compacting the second
layer of coarse aggregates, the
binder shall be applied at the rate of
12.5 kg, to
15.0 kg. per 10 m^
as detailed in para 5.6,
5.9.
Application of Key Aggregate
Immediately, after the second application of binder, key aggre-
gates at the
rate of 0.13 m^ per 10 m2 shall be
spread uniformly by
approved manual means or preferably with
the help of
mechanical
gritters so as to cover the surface completely.
As soon as the key aggregates are spread, these shall
be rolled
fully
in accordance with
para
5.5.2.
While
rolling
is
in progress,
additional key aggregates may be spread by hand
as necessary
to
make
up
irregularities.
Rolling
shall continue
until
all
aggregate
particles are firmly embedded
in the binder and present a uniform
closed surface.

road.

5.1 1.
Opening to Traffic
As the built-up spray grout
is an open-graded construction, the
wearing course must be applied before opening it to traffic. In special
circumstances, however, the
Engineer-in- charge may open the road
to limited traffic provided the speed of vehicles
is restricted to 16 km
per hour.
