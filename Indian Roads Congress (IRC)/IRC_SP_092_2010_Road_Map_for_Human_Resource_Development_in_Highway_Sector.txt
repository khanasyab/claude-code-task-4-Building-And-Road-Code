INTRODUCTION
Human
resource
is
the
productive power
in human
beings.
Unlike
the
material
resources, human resources are the participants as also the beneficiaries of economic
development.
In that sense, human resources figure both on the demand as well
as supply side of production
of goods and services. On demand
side, goods and
services produced are used by human being for general amelioration of quality of
life
like alleviation of poverty, improving health, improved access to market etc. On
supply side, human resources and capital form the essential ingredients of production
system which transform the natural and physical resources into goods and services
by developing infrastructure.
In the past road sector projects were executed in small reaches with limited technology
application.
Qualified Engineers were managing road works but human resources
developed for the Workmen were generally non-formal and informal in nature with on
job transfer of knowledge by hands on training by master craftsman who had acquired
skills and knowledge of the trade by way of his long experience on the job and from his
mentors. With the rapid advancement in the field of technology to meet the challenges
posed by national development
policies, human resources need
to be developed
in a more structured fashion to create a net surplus of capability required
to meet
the challenges effectively and
efficiently. Assessment of human resources needed
for Highway sector in future based on projections of urbanization, port development,
connectivity corridors etc.
will be needed on realistic basis. Macro level forecasts at
national, regional or state level for human resources for highway sector are needed
for planning education pedagogy and training facilities, decision making for highway
infrastructure development in matters of choice of technology,
prioritization of sector
development etc. Micro forecasts at enterprise level are needed primarily for planning,
recruitment, and training in accordance with the development plans of enterprise.
Highway sector due by its nature serving public at large,
lies majorly in Public sector
domain with Government or its agencies acting as major player and funded by public
exchequer. Government organizations
like PWDs due
to
their sheer
inertia
with
vertically linked bottom heavy organization structure, over the period failed to keep
pace with the demand
placed by the highway sector growth.
Capability shortage
of the public organizations to meet the challenges
in the field of technology, quality
specifications, and higher level of financial prudence required
in
project execution
coupled with
limitation of funds for highway infrastructure development forced the
public
organization
to
involve
private
sectors as
partners
in
the
highway
sector
development. Contractors, Private Project Consultants, Planning Consultants, Design

IRC:SP:92-2010
Consultants, Supervisors, third party quality assurance are new players who are now
well entrenched and become indispensable to the execution of any major highway
project. Capability deficit of organizations
is thus compensated by transferring and
sharing the competence with those who possess
it.
Like any other infrastructure
sector, expanse, width and depth
of Highway Sector
covers
various
primary
and
complementary
agencies
-
their
organizations,
professionals working under them,
policies governing
their evolutions,
their
likely
future configurations, technology interventions, development of new and innovative
instruments for project delivery, safety and environmental concern
etc.
to name a
few. The present document seeks to explore the dynamics of Highway Sector and
its
players contributing to the growth and development of highway sector and followed by
developing a structured training and development manual which
will serve as a tool
kit for the highway professionals. This T&D manual can also be effectively utilized by
different organizations the same being diagnostic and generic in nature.
The flow and sequencing of the chapters in this Manual have been arranged with a view
to open up to the reader the dimensions and complexity of very many players- some
in the direct, some
in support, some
in regulatory and other support organizations/
groups/bodies,
all
contributing
to
the
highway
development
covering
research,
planning, design, development, construction, asset maintenance and management.
Chapter
1
brings out the journey covered so
far since the
first planned highway
development exercise was undertaken
in 1927, covering various Road Development
Plans that followed Jaykar Committee, opening up to the reader the shift in strategies
adopted for road development over the period and the simultaneous feel of growing
complexity
in terms of organizational
interaction, standards and specifications and
demands placed on the agencies by the growing concern for sustainability aspect of
growth. Chapter 2, deals with the present day scenario of highway sector
in terms
of demands placed on the highway sector which
is to be serviced within a given time
frame by the various highway players. These two chapters thus orient the reader to
appreciate the expanse and depth of Indian highway sector and
its various attributes
which culminate through enormous efforts by those involved
in the highway sector
development
into an
apparently simple highway network
with
comfortable
riding
quality to the highway user. Chapter 3 brings out to the reader the complex web
of various highways players doing the job some
in
parallel, some supporting, a few
others as
regulatory and
other support
functions. The combined
efforts
of them
cumulatively result in the optimal matrix of planning, design, construction, management
and maintenance of highway assets. This chapter also sensitizes the reader as to
the
efforts required
to be made
in the
field
of HR development, HR planning and
2

IRC:SP:92-2010
organizational development before the challenges of future demands as described
in Chapter 2 can be met successfully. Coming to more specific, Chapter 4 and 5
describe various organizations/agencies which are engaged
in the highway sector
development directly and
in complementary manner. These chapters thus open up
vistas
of highway sector players and shows the
richness
of organizations/bodies
spread
all over the
country
involved
in
the complex- interplay
of highway
sector
development. Chapter 6 deals more specifically the organizational requirements for
various organizations
in government/private sector involved
in the
field of highway
planning
, design, development, execution, maintenance and quality assurance. Such
organizational requirements at individual level call for HR development which
is to be
dovetailed with the development at group, process and organization level to enable
organization to function efficiently and competitively. Chapter 7 briefly describes the
concept of human resources and human resource development to give meaning to
the tasl< involved for training and development of professionals involved
in direct or
complementary and other support organizations as described
in Chapter 4 and 5
and are engaged
in the discharge
of their defined
roles and
responsibilities. This
chapter further explores the concept of HRD and
briefly highlights the linkages of
HR development with HR management and organization development.
It intended
to
help one
understand
the
tasks
involved
for
dealing
with
the
issues
dealt
in
Chapter 6 on Organizational Requirement within the context of HRD. Before dealing
with the T&D strategies,
it is considered essential that reader should become conversant
with the meaning of various terms and terminologies used in explaining the T&D related
activities. Towards the end Chapter 8 describes briefly various terminology and their
linkages as will be used
in subsequent chapters. Chapter 9 to Chapter 13 deal with
various steps viz. identification, design, development, implementation, and review of
T&D road map. These chapters are
in
self explanatory sequences with examples
wherever considered essential to help enable organizations described
in Chapter 4
and 5 to develop training and development system on a scientific footing using system
approach. These chapters are intended to cover the steps as considered essential to
transfer knowledge and skills for creating abilities and attitude among the recipients in
scientific manner to make T&D program effective and useful.
HRD being comparatively new discipline
in
its present understanding
is not so far
viewed as an independent professional management tool but rather treated as an
derivate of organizational requirement to deal with new emerging situations with no
special consideration. Chapter 1 4 deals with the issues relating to H R development and
management within the over all context of highway sector organization development
which
is
felt essential
to translate vision
of capacity building
of organizations
into
a
reality. This chapter also describes various issues which
will be
dealt by HRD
Committee and
includes
restructuring
of organizations,
training
of
professionals,
workmen training etc.

IRC:SP:92-2010
DEVELOPMENT OF HIGHWAYS SECTOR
1
Early Twentieth Century
1.1
During the early Twentieth Century, the worsening condition of roads in our
country was a matter of public concern, which found expression
in the deliberations
of the Council
of States.
Following a debate
in the Council, Government of India
appointed the Road Development Plan Committee
in
1927. The recommendation
of this Committee, popularly known as Jayakar Committee was emphatic regarding
inadequacy of Indian road system. The Committee urged that further development
of the road system was desirable
for general welfare and movement of men and
material.
Pursuant to recommendations of the Jayakar Committee, the Central Road
Fund (CRF) was constituted
in 1929 as a non-lapsable fund. The revenue for CRF
was generated out of the proceeds from Customs and Excise Duties levied on petrol
and diesel.
1.2
In
1930,
the
Office
of the
Special
Chief Engineer was
established
to
administer the newly constituted Central Road Fund and to advise the Government of
India in all matters concerning road development. Later on,
it was renamed as the Office
of the Consulting Engineer (Roads) to the Govt, of India and
its activities expanded
during World War
II. Besides, in
1 934, as per Jayakar Committee's recommendations,
Indian Roads Congress (IRC) was established as a body of professional highway
engineers, to oversee development and set standards and procedures. The formation
of the IRC set the pace for the road development in the country.
2
First Road Development Plan—1943-1961 (Nagpur Plan)
2.1
The World War
II saw rapid growth in road traffic and transportation, but the
lack of commensurate maintenance caused deterioration
in condition of roads. The
first attempt to unify road system on all India basis was initiated in
1 943 when the First
Road Development Plan, popularly known as 'Nagpur Plan' on a uniform pattern was
prepared to serve the needs of the country. The road connectivity targets set for the
Nagpur Plan were
as follows:
i)
In highly developed agricultural area, no village will be more than five
miles from a "main road" and the average distance will be less than two
miles in most cases.
5



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
ii)
In non-agricultural areas, no village will be more than 20 miles from a
"main road".
2.2
The roads were
classified
into
five
categories:
-
(i)
National
Highways,
(ii) State Highways,
(iii) Major District Roads,
(iv) Other District Roads and (v) Village
Roads.
In the above
classification,
National Highways, State Highways and Major
District Roads
constitute 'Main Roads', whereas Other
District Roads and
Village
Roads constitute 'Rural Roads'.
2.3
Major factors governing selection of road alignment and construction were
identified as under:
i)
Need of semi-developed and underdeveloped areas including forests
and agricultural areas.
ii)
Location of administrative headquarters, places of pilgrimage, health
resorts, tourist centres, universities etc.
iii)
Location of industries, commercial centres, big railway junctions, ports
etc.
iv)
Strategic needs of the country.
2.4
On 01 .04. 1947 National Highwayscameintoexistence, when the Government
of India assumed responsibility for the development and maintenance of certain roads
and provisionally named as National Highways.
In 1956, the Government, of India
enacted the National Highway Act 1956 and roads provisionally named as National
.Highways were declared statutorily as National Highways.
3
Second Road Development Plan—1961-1981 (Bombay Plan)
3.1
Even though targets of Nagpur Plan were significantly achieved by 1961,
the road system remained deficient and inadequate to meet the country's transport
demand.
The
changed
economic,
industrial
and
agricultural
scenario
of
newly
independent country justified a review of road requirements. The second attempt for
preparing Road Development Plan on
all India basis was started
in 1958 and Chief
Engineers of various States adopted a 20 year Road Development Plan (1961-81)
popularly known as Bombay Plan.
3.2
In Bombay Plan, the connectivity targets were further raised.
It
envisaged
that no village should be more than 1.5 miles from any road
in developed agricultural
areas, 3 miles from any road
in semi-developed areas and 5 miles from any road
in
6

IRC:SP:92-2010
under-developed areas. The Bombay Plan framed a scheme of priorities which included
among others, provision of missing bridges, improvement of road surface to at least
single lane black topped specification for National and State Highways, widening of main
roads in vicinity of large towns to two-lanes or more and provision of two-lane roads on
major arterial routes. The overall objective of Bombay Plan was to raise density of road
mileage from 26 to 52 miles per 100 sq. miles of area. This target was set, taking into
account level of expected development and needs of rural and urban areas.
4
Third Road Development Plan—1981-2001 (Lucknow Plan)
4.1
The decades
of
1980's and
1990's saw
fast growth
in
road
transport,
with
introduction
of contemporary heavy and
light
vehicles,
having
features and
specifications, matching with the best anywhere
in the world. As a departure from
the earlier linear approach, Lucknow Plan was evolved on the basis of the Research
Programme. This plan not only addressed to the revised connectivity targets but also
included targets pertaining to highway construction and maintenance technology as
also materials. Salient features of this plan were as follows:
-
i)
New forms of energy were
introduced, which
include alcohol-petrol
mixtures, LPG and liquid fuel from coal.
ii)
Alternative
binders considered which
include
lime-fly ash-concrete,
lean cement concrete, soil-lime, coal tar, tar-bitumen blends, etc.
iii)
Highway maintenance and
design
study was
initiated
by the then
Ministry of Road Transport & Highways. This in turn led to World Bank
HDM-III Model.
iv)
Geometric design standards were improved.
v)
Data on traffic flows, commodity movement, and passenger travel was
considered essential for road planning.
vi)
Economic
evaluation
in
the
rural
road schemes was emphasized.
Parameters such as increase
in agricultural produce; marketability of
perishable items, education, health etc., were considered.
vii)
Latest
instruments,
like
radar, speed
meters,
vehicle mounted
skid
resistance meters etc., were given cognizance.
viii) Growing importance of research to obtain optimal solutions to planning,
design and construction was recognized.
ix)
It was recommended that adequate funds should be earmarked.

IRC:SP:92-2010
4.2
Lucknow Plan covered following requirements as governing criteria for the
road network planning and development.
i)
Social infrastructure to connect rural,
hilly,
tribal and backward areas
with administrative, market, health and educational centres
ii)
Security and Strategic requirements were considered.
iii)
Need
for
effecting
fuel economy through
provision
of good
roads,
better maintenance
and
bypasses
to
avoid
congested
areas was
emphasized.
iv)
Requirements
for
non-mechanized
traffic
in
urban
areas
were
considered.
4.3
This
Plan
also
provided
directions
for
State Governments
to
prepare
their own perspective plans
for road development, keeping
in view differences
in
land use pattern, population, terrain, potential for economic development and social
infrastructure needs to achieve a balanced road network.

Economic Reforms
5.1
Economic
reforms
introduced
in
the
country
during
Eighties
led
to
enhancement of capital flow into highway sector with bigger size project packages
which led to international lending agencies like World Bank, Asian Development Bank,
OECF and JBIC stepping
in to provide loan assistance for road projects. The entry of
private sector was facilitated by liberalized economic policies of the Government. These
were defining moments in the growth of highway sector and contracting industry.
5.2
State PWDs were having the responsibility of construction of roads including
the National Highways
in respective States.
These State PWDs were not exposed
to the contemporary state of art in construction methodology, plants and equipments,
techniques etc.
Therefore,
it was considered prudent to take measures, which would
be of contemporary nature and akin to the best anywhere
in the world. This led
to
certain changes in the institutional arrangements for execution of highway projects as
follows:
i)
Engagement of consultants for project preparation and construction
supervision,
ii)
Packaging of large size road contracts,
iii)
Entry of foreign contractors, and

In
1988,
the
National
Highways Authority
of
India was
constituted
for
execution of works on
National Highways

Fourth Road Development Plan—2001- 2021 (Road Development Plan
Vision: 2021)
6.1
In 2001, the Indian Roads Congress, at the behest of the Ministry of Road
Transport & Highways,
prepared
the "Road Development Plan
Vision:
2021". This
Plan laid emphasis on the necessity of coordinated approach to develop an Integrated
Transport Policy with optimal inter-modal mix. Besides, emphasis was also laid on safety,
energy efficiency and conservation, environment protection, self-sustaining and viable
transport units. The document recognized development of road infrastructure as the key
element to promote tourism, provide access to mining areas, power plants, ports etc.
6.2
In the document the major issues of concern are as follows.
i)
Inadequate budgetary allocations for the Road Sector, and the need
for mobilization of resources including toll financing and private sector
participation,
ii)
Increasing
traffic
volumes
on
main
corridors
requiring
capacity
augmentation (Expressways, 4-laning/6-laning with service lanes),
iii)
Strengthening of pavement to cope with movement of heavy commercial
vehicles particularly on National Highways and State Highways.
iv)
Back-log of village accessibility, inspite of an impressive road network
length, thus pointing to the need for preparing Master Plans at district
level and undertaking massive programme of construction of Village
Roads in accordance with such plans.
vi)
Preservation of existing road assets, improving riding quality to provide
better level-of-service to road users.
vii)
Improving capacity of roads and other traffic management measures in
urban areas.
viii) Capacity building in the highway departments, consultancy sector and
construction industry for efficient implementation of the development
programme.

'
Development
of
10,000 km
Expressways
by
the
year
2021
for
unhindered and high speed movement of traffic, considering that many
of the National Highway corridors where 4-laning was done would get
saturated in 5 to 10 years time.
ii)
Four/Six laning of 16,000 km of National Highways in the first decade
covering mostly the NHDP and other essential segments and another
19,000 km in the second decade.

efforts for bringing the entire National Highway network
to minimum 2-lane standards which would be tackled
in two
parts,
(i)
Upgrading
existing
sub-standard
two
lanes
to
proper two
lane
standards including strengthening of weak pavements, reconstruction
/rehabilitation of weak or damaged bridges, hard shoulders and spot
improvements
in
accident prone
locations.
The
proposed
targets
being 20,000 km
in the
first decade and 24,000 km
in the second
decade,
(ii) Widening
single lane
to two lanes by assigning
priority
to
routes
identified
under Asian Highway Network and such
other
routes linking the adjoining countries and important
rail heads, inland
container depots, container freight stations etc. The proposed targets
for this beingi 5,000 km in the first decade and 7,000 km in the second
decade.
iv)
Planning
of bypasses
for the NH network
in the form
of peripheral
expressways to interlink the highways radiating from the cities having
population of more than
1
million.
v)
Replacement of all existing railway level crossings on National Highways
with road over/under bridges in a phased manner depending upon the
traffic and number of gate closures.

6.4
This Plan further expands the horizon of previous development plans after
making an objective assessment of likely future development in highway sector in the
all conceivable areas like investment policies, government policies, highway planning
and management, construction technologies, new highway materials, development of
new highway project procurement and execution instruments, traffic and transportation
and safety & environment etc. The document reflecting the urgent need for the high
speed connectivity identified corridors of expressway apart from upgrading the existing
network of national highways and other lower hierarchy roads. Maintenance of highway
assets is given due recognition by assigning importance to RMS and BMS to work out
assessment of maintenance needs of highways and a strategy to finance maintenance
works.
Provision
of way side amenities
is also brought within the
overall network
development. Document also mentions about the importance of corridor management
involving land management, tackling of safety hazards and traffic bottlenecks, control
on overloading of vehicles, incidence management, pavement riding quality.
For this
purpose, the document recommended promulgation of comprehensive legislation by
the Centre and the States for efficient land and traffic management including effective
control on ribbon development and encroachments.
Setting up of a single Highway
Authority was also recommended for not only construction and maintenance of roads
/bridges but also for management of road land and traffic.
6.5
The document also provides
for preparation
of long term
plan covering
following aspects:
i)
For R&D
in the highway sector,
it
is necessary to
identify the thrust
areas which
hold
potential
for
application under
Indian
conditions.
Proper dissemination of research findings and demonstration projects
have been recommended to overcome the reluctance on the part of
the highway engineers to adopt new techniques.
ii)
Focus has been drawn
regarding
the
importance
of strategies
for
mobilization
of funds
by
tapping
all
possible
sources,
viz.
Public,
Private and Foreign and proper management of dedicated highway
development plan
(i.e. from
levy of cess on
petrol and
high speed
diesel) including devising of clear rules for allocation and accountability
and proper monitoring system.
iii)
It
is necessary to give importance on the aspect of capacity building
and human resource development in the sector including development
of
construction
technology,
implementation
of
quality
systems,
environment preservation, highway safety and energy conservation.

Rural Road Development Plan Vision: 2025
!RC:SP:92-2010
7.1
The Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India brought out this
document
in May 2007,
in the background of Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana
(PMGSY), which was launched
in December 2000. Major issues concerning capacity
Building,
Research &
Development, Human
Resource
Development (HRD) and
Human Resource Management (HRM) covered
in the document, are as follows:
i)
Quality Assurances safeguards should be inbuilt at every stage of the
project cycle viz. surveys, investigations, designs, bidding documents,
construction and maintenance.
ii)
States may consider instituting system of technical audit with a view to
propose corrective measures for future projects. The NRRDA may lay-
down the audit procedures.
iii)
It is necessary to sensitize the communities and users of rural roads to
road safety concerns and role, they can play in reducing the accident
burden.
iv)
The road agencies must recognize the potential environment concerns
and comply with the provisions of Environment (Protection) Act and
Environment (Conservation) Act.
v)
The NRRDA may take lead
in introducing a Rural Road Management
Act, which should,
(a) define powers, functions and obligations of the
road authority, (b) requires a register of all public roads and (c) govern
regulations of rural roads and require instituting an asset management
system.
vi)
The PMGSY
programme
seeks
to
integrate
'development'
and
'employment' objectives. The current employment potential is estimated
to be around 460 million man-days per year and rise to over 950 million
man days by the
1 3^^ Five Year Plan (201 7-2022).
vii)
The Government should fund capacity building of District Panchayat
to enable them to take over functions like construction, maintenance,
maintenance management and road safety.
viii) There
is a need for concentrated Research and Development efforts
for evolving most suitable and economical designs and appropriate
technologies.
13

IRC:SP:92-2010
ix)
Further
increase
in
absorption
capacity
will
only come
through
institutional enhancements. There
is a need
for a single specialized
nodal agency
in each State which should be responsible for overall
policy, planning and management of rural roads.
x)
It is necessary to create specialized rural road division so as to ensure
necessary technical expertise and management quality. A single cadre
is necessary.
xi)
There
is a need for District level consultants
in addition to State level
and National level consultants.
xii)
Every State should setup a training centre for roads
including
rural
road. The NITHE should perform and take leading role at national level
and the example of National Academy of Construction at Hyderabad
is
worth replicating by other States. Training Institutes should collaborate
with international agencies like ILO, T&B and IFG.
xiii) Government need to develop independent think tanks and academicians
on various aspects of rural roads like engineering, safety, environmental
issues, socio-economic impact etc. They may also fund institutions like
NCAER, IlPA, IIMs, NTs and NIITs. Eminent persons in the field should
get institutional support and Ministry of Rural Development may provide
lead role.
8
Expanding Horizon of Highways Sector
8.1
The scope and extent of highway sector
in the
last seven decades have
expanded from providing a given
target connectivity level of roads to the population
centres to a complex gamut of schemes covering
social, economical, ecological &
environmental issues apart from the engineering and technology issues concerning
the highway sector.
It
is necessary that status of highways sector
in our country
is
reviewed to ascertain and workout strategies for future.
8.2
In order to develop highways sector according to necessity of time,
role
of different organizations involved
in strategic decision making and those engaged
directly for development and support of highways sector is required to be reviewed, to
ascertain necessity of human resources development.

CHAPTER 2
IRC:SP:92-2010
ROAD HIERARCHY SYSTEM
1
Introduction
1.1
Ever since road development plans were
initiated, major emphasis of
all
such plans have been to enhance and augment the road density
in the country by
setting higher and higher targets for road
connectivity.
In the
First Plan the target
was set for creating a density of 26 miles of road per
1 00 sq. miles of area which was
increased to 52 miles of road per 100 sq. miles of area in the Second Plan.
In Fourth
Road Development Plan,
all villages of the country are targeted
to be connected
by 2010. For identifying and monitoring these connectivity targets, a road hierarchy
system was conceptualized
in the First Road Development Plan which
still continues
for the purpose of identification of any road.
1.2
According to this system roads are divided into five categories i.e. (i) National
Highways,
(ii) State Highways,
(iii) Major District Roads, (iv) Other District Roads and
(v) Village Roads. In this
classification, National Highways, State Highways and Major
District Roads constitute 'Main
Roads', whereas Other
District Roads and Village
Roads constitute 'Rural Roads'. With the passage of time other road categories
like
'urban road', peripheral expressways 'express ways' were added for the purpose of
creating distinct identification based on their functionality. Strategy for setting the road
connectivity targets under different road development plans, however more or less
were based on the above mentioned hierarchy system of road network. Roads and
highways as physical entity running through length and breadth of the country can be
described under their order of hierarchy in following paras:
2
Expressways
2.1
Fourth
road
development
plan
initiated
in
the
year
2001
introduced
Expressways as distinct category. This plan envisaged development of 10,000 km
Expressways by the year 2021
for unhindered and high speed movement of traffic,
considering that many of the National Highway corridors would get saturated with
passage of time.
3
National Highways
3.1
The National Highways have grown from 21440 kms in 1947 to 66590 kms
in 2006,
.i.e. by the end of Tenth Plan period. The National Highways comprise only
15



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
2 percent of total length of roads, but carries over 40 percent of the total traffic across
the length and breadth of the country. The development and maintenance of National
Highways are implemented on Governments and Union Territories agency basis. The
PWDs of States, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and Border Road
Organization (BRO) are the main implementation agencies.
3.2
During recent past, 43,705 l<m of National Highways were entrusted to the
States Governments/Union Territories for the stretches passing through respective
States. The NHAI was entrusted with
16,117 km
of National Highway included
in
various phases of National Highway Development Project (NHDP) and other important
National Highways. 5,51 2 km of National Highways in difficult border areas were given
to
Border Roads Organization.
4
State Highways and Major District Roads
4.1
State Highways (SHs) and Major
District Roads (MDRs)
constitute
the
secondary system of road transportation
in the country. The SHs provide linkages
with the National Highways,
district headquarters of the State and important towns,
tourist centres and minor ports. Their total length stands at about
1 ,28,000 km. Major
District Roads run within the
district connecting areas of production with markets,
connecting the
rural areas to the
district headquarters and
to State Highways and
National Highways. Their length is about 4,70,000 km. These roads also carry medium
to heavy traffic.
It
is assessed that this secondary system of roads carries about 40
percent of the
total road
traffic, although they constitute only about 13 percent of
the
total road
length. They are major carriers of road
traffic within the states and
some interstate traffic. Besides, by serving as linkages between the rural and urban
areas, the State Highways and Major District Roads contribute significantly to the rural
economy as also to the industrial development of the country by enabling movement
of industrial raw materials and products from and to the interior of the country.
4.2
Though the size of the network comprising SHs and MDRs
is very good,
the quality of roads
is
not, as per the standards set for these categories of roads.
Their present condition and stage of development varies widely from State to State.
The status of MDRs
is particularly very bad. The main reason for this state of affairs
is that the funds for the development of this secondary system are inadequate. While
reasonable funds have been made available for the National Highways and the Rural
Roads, somehow the secondary system of roads is not receiving the desired attention
in the matter of financial allocations
in
relation
to requirements. The
result
is that
there are several deficiencies
in the existing SHs and MDRs such as,
(i) inadequate
width of carriageway
in
relation to
traffic demand
(ii) Weak pavement and bridges,
16
I



======================================================================
PAGE 27 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
(iii) Congested stretches passing through cities/towns,
(iv) Poor safety features and
road geometries and inadequate formation width
in
hilly and mountainous
region,
(v) Missing links and bridges and
(vi) Several railway level crossings to be replaced
with ROB/RUBs.
4.3
The
existing road
network
is under severe
strain due
to
traffic growth,
overloading
of vehicles and
inadequacy
of funds
for road maintenance. A broad
assessment shows that over 50 percent of SHs and MDRs network has poor riding
quality. Losses due to poor condition of these roads would be around Rs. 6000 crore per
annum. Besides, their premature failure results in huge rehabilitation and reconstruction
costs implying infusion of avoidable plan funds at accelerated intervals.
5
Other District Roads and Village Roads
5.1
India has essentially a rural oriented economy with 74 percent of its population
living
in
its villages.
In the year 2000,
it was estimated that about 330,000 out of
its
825,000 villages and habitations were without any all-weather road access. This affected
the quality of life of the people living in villages. The road connectivity is a key component
of rural development by promoting access to economic and social services and thereby
generating increased
agricultural income and
productive employment opportunities.
A major thrust for development of rural road (which covered Village Roads) was given
at the beginning of Fifth Five Year Plan
in 1974, when
it was made a part of Minimum
Needs Programme (MNP).
In 1996, MNP merged with Basic Minimum Services (BMS)
programme. The development of Village Roads did not receive any significant impetus
upto the year 2000. The implementation mechanism to achieve the targets of village
population connectivity as envisaged
in the Fourth Road Development Plan
is largely
through the Central Government scheme launched
in the year 2000, popularly known
as Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY). This scheme was launched with full
funding from Central Government.
The Rural Roads included under PMGSY cover
both Other District Roads (ODR) and Village Roads (VR).
The ODRs serve the rural
areas of production and providing them with outlet to market centres, blocks, tehsil and
main roads. The VRs connect villages and group of villages with each other or to market
centres and with nearest road
of higher category. PMGSY envisages development
of
all weather roads, which are negotiable during
all seasons with some
permitted
interruptions,
i.e. cross drainage structures in which duration of overflow or interruptions
shall not exceed 12 hours for ODRs and 24 hours for VRs.
5.2
Rural road network required for providing 'basic access' to
all villages
is
termed as Core Network. Basic access is defined as one all weather road access from
each village to nearby market.
It comprises of Through Routes' and
'Link Routes'.
17



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
The through routes are the ones, which collect traffic from several link roads and lead
it to market centres,
District Road or State Highway or National Highway. The
link
routes are the roads connecting a single habitation to through roads. The spirit and
objective of PMGSY
is to provide good
all weather road connectivity to unconnected
habitations
in rural areas. Provision of new connectivity
is given priority compared to
upgradation works.
-
6
Other Roads
The Other Roads, which have significance in their own way in providing connectivity to
important locations and also for facilitating access to adjoining areas etc., are Forest
Roads, Roads in Border Areas, Roads providing connectivity to dams /reservoirs and
power stations (especially hydro-power stations), roads connecting dedicated areas
such as Special Economic Zones (SEZ), etc. The financing of such roads are made
under different schemes of the Central Govt, and the State Govt.
The responsibility
of development and maintenance
of these roads are vested
with
the concerned
authorities in the Central and the State Govts.
7
Increasing Roles of Roads
For modern society, the transportation system plays very important role for day to day
living. In the present as well as likely future scenario, country's development is going to
witness rapid growth of urban centres providing job opportunities and thereby creating
more intensive flux of movement of human as well as goods and services between
urban centres and rural hinterland. Road network, despite development of alternative
modes
of transport,
will continue to remain dominant mode of transportation. Road
sector will continue to remain hub of advanced technology application
in the area of
construction, maintenance and management of transport network development. Ever
growing complexity of road sector coupled with high magnitude of investment have
brought in several players involved in its development and maintenance, presenting a
true amalgamation of human & technology management.

ADVANCEMENTS
IN ROAD SECTOR
1
Society and Roads
From the earliest pre-historic pathways used by nomads as formed by the continuous
trampling of earth by the pasture animals
lil<e horses and mules to modern highways
criss-crossing the landscape of the country roads have travelled a long distance in time
and space continuum. Roads are exceptional
in their mutability and their longevity in
that where as the artifacts of ancient time are survived through archeological efforts,
but people continue to use roads
built many centuries ago. Complete
life demands
movement as testified by constant and timeless movements of traders, astrologers,
geographers, merchants, sailors and soldiers since time immemorial. As roads outlast
people and conditions that created them and vehicles that traversed over them, they
are central element in social infrastructure. They are endowed with great simplicity and
amazing complexity. Roads lead to freedom of movement and
in that sense they are
key to economic prosperity. Mobility also creates equality and therefore roads have also
acted as a powerful medium to counter the power of monopoly in the human history.
Development of early pathways to modern highways also shows a direct interplay and
correlation between social & technological change tal<ing place in the country and the
development of highways. The density of roads and highways network, their upkeep
and riding quality bears close connection to the country's economic prosperity, social
stability and cultural integration.
2
Prime IViover of Development
2.1
Roads in
its earliest versions were mainly providing small rural connectivity
joining neighbourhood areas of settlements and
productivity, more or less following
natural contours. With the growth of human settlement on a more structured footing
when they became a part of some kind of political system, roads became derivatives
of combination of productivity, social security and accessibility criteria. Development of
road network was governed by political ambitions to bring more and more productivity
centers under
political suzerainty.
In course of time, they developed
into economic
arteries providing speedier connectivity not only between two points but also generating
its own area of influence
all
along
its traverse, creating potential of developing them
into population and productivity centers depending upon other sustainability factors
like water, energy, soil and climatic conditions.

2.2
In modern times roads are no longer a development derivative but have
become a prime mover
in deciding the contours
of development which the
policy
planners would
like to put in place. They have pervasive effect on social, economic,
energy, environmental and land-use issues and their development
is guided by ease
of mobility & accessibility,
livability and sustainability. Highway projects being highly
capital
intensive with
long
gestation
period and
low
rate
of
returns, have
largely
remained within the domain
of government funding. Government, therefore
is the
largest and
biggest stakeholder
in the
planning, designing and implementation
of
highway projects.
2.3
With the enormous growth of highway network the complexity of network
development have grown phenomenally from the
earlier simple
public exchequer
funding and execution of work to the present multitudinous and multifarious aspects
involving government
policies
concerning
land
acquisition,
environment,
ecology;
investment policies for bridging the gap between demand placed by the highway sector
and resource
availability; highway planning covering road network planning,
road
side amenities planning, information system development; construction technologies
with
emphasis
on
low
carbon
foot
print technology development; new highway
materials, specifications and code of practice; new execution instruments
in the light
of emergence of international players
in financing and execution of projects;
traffic
and transportation system, parking management, multi modal system; and safety and
environment involving road side aesthetics, traffic canalization, highway landscaping,
road safety, pedestrian facilities, noise and pollution etc.
3
Wider Decision Support System
3.1
Development of technology along the course of human development is most
directly reflected in creating accessibility to the areas which were earlier beyond easy
reach of mankind. Technology as a harbinger of development when put in use to serve
mankind by taming the nature, the earlier paths and ways following natural contours
were replaced by roads duly stabilized
cutting
into the
natural landscape,
altering,
modifying, even destroying existing flora and fauna. The negative impact on ecology
is however, more than offset by the rewards
in terms of enhanced accessibility and
associated fruits like economic development, social, political and ethnic integration of
the country as a whole. The task of providing stable surface with minimum intrusion
in the ecological setup calls for the application of professional services of planners,
scientists, engineers, technologists, and highway managers. The complexity of task
in hand requires planners and administrators of Central and State Governments and
other professional
groups,
think tank and
individuals
to provide
decision support
system on the policy planning.

3.2
Scientists
in
the
field
of
soil
science,
hydrology,
ecology,
environment,
^structural
engineering
are
engaged
for
developing
science
and
technology
to
help provide solution to the real time
field problems as also to develop best suited
methodology in the construction and maintenance field which
is both economical and
ecologically
least
intrusive.
Engineers,
consultants and
contractors,
are
required
to translate science and technology
into physical
entity
in the shape of roads and
highway network as per the decided standards and specifications. The services of
Quality Assurance experts are called for ensuring that investment done
in creating
and maintaining
capital asset
is resulting
into output consistent with the
laid down
procedures, prescriptions and standards to meet intended results. Speed of execution
of work with ever growing challenges with enhanced
quality and safety standards
calls for introduction of new machineries with higher productivity and reduced direct
human labour component. This
calls for contribution of machinery and equipment,
their operators, manufacturers and technologists.
4
Quality Standards and Laboratory Testing
With the shifting emphasis of Government from the role of a 'provider' to 'enabler and
facilitator' more and more numbers of Mega projects will be seen coming up
in the
country. All such projects require proper testing of materials which
is a pre-requisite
for attaining high quality of the work. This requires specialized material and product
tests covering physical, chemical,
ultrasonic, x-ray and various other types of tests
which can not possibly be carried out
in a site laboratory without adding high-costs
on the project. Product and material testing are not only
required for the purpose of
obtaining
final product of specified service standards, but also for the product and
material development to support quality control, evaluation, research, development,
trouble shooting and many other client organization's need. These tests also require
trained professionals, specialized
in conducting the tests and interpreting the results.
Therefore, the need arises for utilization of independent laboratories with facilities to
conduct the tests as per IRC specifications and
in controlled atmospheric conditions
like temperature, humidity etc.
5
Regulatory Agencies
As highways are not only intrusive but also modifier of country's landscape, contours
and ecologidal set up, planning for the mitigation of adverse impact calls for expertise
in the form
of various
regulatory agencies, bodies
for assessing,
assisting and
if
required, correcting, modulating and modifying the highways planning, execution and
management by playing regulatory
role. Such regulatory role
is also performed by
bodies
like Development Authorities, Municipal Corporations who are mandated
to
21



======================================================================
PAGE 32 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
design, conceive and implement various control rules to ensure that tine development
of areas under their control takes place
in accordance with the character they would
like to impart to their city/township in terms of infrastructure development. Regulation
being legalistic
in
its concept, demands equipping the highway planners, engineers
and managers with the legal aspect of highway related activities.
6
Maintenance Management
Modern
highways
unlike
their
ancestors
are
highly
capital
intensive
proposition
in which money's worth
not only
calls
for the
best option
in terms
of technology
applications with minimum adverse
fall out but also calls for maximum preservation
of asset created with timely and well directed
infusion of maintenance care. Such
maintenance
if imparted with great attention, care and sense of alacrity will translate
into maximization of economy in highways life cycle cost. Any delay in the maintenance
may lead to highways condition beyond economic repair causing avoidable expenditure.
Research bodies and engineers are required to provide expertise using technologies,
innovation,
mechanization
supported
by
responsive
organization
in
creating and
implementing effective maintenance management system. Highway construction being
highly capital intensive activity, financing the same
is no longer
in the public sector
domain. Concept of self financing of construction has given rise to many innovative
contract management instruments
like BOT, BOOT etc. under PPP mode. Coupling
of revenue generating capacity with construction and maintenance of highways with
high level of user satisfaction
in terms of riding quality and way side amenities have
created professional fields in revenue related aspect of highway construction
like toll
management, landscape management, highway petrol for quick shifting of accidented
vehicle and transfer of patient to hospital.
7
Training and Development
7.1
One of the major area of concern highlighted in the 'Road Development Plan
Vision: 2021' is relating to capacity building in the highway departments, Consultancy
Sector and
Construction
Industry
for
efficient implementation
of the development
programme. With
ever
increasing
interaction and
mutual dependence
of various
stakeholders
viz. Road Agencies, Contractors and Consultants
etc.
for the service
and product delivery, there
is all-round need to enhance, develop and up-date the
skills not only in technical designs but also in project management, financial aspects,
legal issues, social and environmental aspects. There
is shortage of skilled
staff at
all levels including
skilled labour, equipment operators, and supervisors, engineers
with the government, contractors and consultants. Exposure to international scenario
and expectation of world standard products from the highway agencies have made
22



======================================================================
PAGE 33 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
the highway sector more demanding on
its professionals. The jump in the project size
has further added to the complexities of tasks involved. The road agencies dealing
with the roads are facing the challenge of rational planning, project identification and
development, efficient and transparent contract procurement, administration, operation,
and management of roads to provide good quality of service to road users. Declared
emphasis on the execution of project through BOT, DBFO route
in the fourth road
development plan, require re-orientation of highway engineers who were groomed
in the earlier government contract procurement system. The contractors are facing
difficulties
in getting
skilled workers, equipment operators and
quality construction
managers. Consultants are also facing shortage of experienced and skilled personnel
for design and engineering for undertaking feasibility studies and preparation of DPRs
and for supervision of projects during construction.
7.2
Thus so many players involved
in the Highway sector, some directly some
in contributory, peripheral and other capacity are expected to discharge the functions
as assigned to them in a manner consistent with the performance standards as set out
for the designated job.
In other words, there should not be any performance related
gap. Information, knowledge and skills of many varied field of management, operation,
maintenance as generated
by the
research
bodies,
experts and
professionals
is
required to be transferred to relevant groups and individuals and
is to be ensured that
such knowledge,
skills and
abilities are adequately received, assimilated and acted
upon by the recipients
in their job deliverance.
It
is essential to widen, enlarge and
enrich the base of skills of highway professionals so that they become capable of
responding to new challenges in effective and confident manner. T&D for the highway
professionals is therefore central to highway sector development.
8
Role Played by Different Organizations
Dynamics of highway sector played out by core sector organizations with professionals
engaged in (a) Highway planning and design (b) Pavement engineering and pavement
material
(c) Geotechnical
engineering
(d)
Bridge engineering and
(e)
Traffic and
transportation as also other complementary, regulatory and
support organizations
should be fully understood to enable one to grasp the complexity and inter relationship
among these organizations
for developing a structured T&D format for their capacity
building through
skills, knowledge and abilitiy enhancement.

CHAPTER 4
CORE ORGANIZATIONS
1
Core Organizations
1.1
The Highway development programs are implemented through a number
of
Government
and
Semi-Government
organizations.
These
organizations
are
responsible
for preparation
of estimates,
getting the estimates approved from the
funding agencies, processing for deciding consultancy and contracting agencies and
thereafter, ensuring implementation
of road development
projects. Some
of these
agencies work exclusively for roads, whereas, other agencies deal with buildings and
roads. These core organizations are,
in fact, central to any road asset management
system and function within more or less a defined and structured procedure directed
in a functionally integrated manner aimed at ensuring desired level of service delivery.
These organizations/groups/bodies may be
in
the
field
of research
like CRRI
or
contract management
like NHAI or even
in the
field of training
like NITHE but one
thing common in them is that they are all integrally and directly linked serving the final
objective of creation, management and maintenance of highway system at the desired
level of service delivery.
2
Planning Commission of India
2.1
The Planning Commission was set up by a Resolution of the Government of
India in March 1950 in pursuance of declared objectives of the Government to promote a
rapid rise in the standard of living of the people by efficient exploitation of the resources of
the country, increasing production and offering opportunities to all for employment in the
service of the community. The Planning Commission was charged with the responsibility
of making assessment of
all resources of the country, augmenting deficient resources,
formulating Plans of the most effective and balanced utilization of resources and determining
priorities.
For the first eight Plans
(i.e. from 1951 to 1997 including interim Annual Plans
between 1966 and 1969, and between 1990-91 and 1991-92) the emphasis was on a
growing public sector with massive investments in basic and heavy industries. Since the
launch of the Ninth Plan in 1997 however, the emphasis on the public sector has become
less pronounced and the current thinking on planning
in the country,
in general,
is that
it
should increasingly be of an indicative nature.
2.2
The Prime Minister
is the Chairman of the Planning Commission, which
works under the overall guidance of the National Development Council. The Deputy
24



======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
Chairman and the full time Members of the Commission, as a composite body, provide
advice and guidance to the subject Divisions for the formulation of Five Year Plans,
Annual Plans, State Plans, Monitoring Plan Programmes, Projects and Schemes. The
1950 resolution setting up the Planning Commission outlined
its functions as follows.
i)
Make an assessment of the
material,
capital and human resources
of the
country,
including
technical
personnel,
and
investigate
the
possibilities of augmenting such of these resources as are found to be
deficient in relation to the nation's requirement;
ii)
Formulate a
Plan
for the most
effective and balanced
utilization
of
country's resources;
iii)
On a determination of priorities, define the stages
in which the Plan
should be carried out and propose the allocation of resources for the
due completion of each state;
iv)
Indicate the factors which are tending to retard economic development,
and determine the conditions which,
in view of the current social and
political situation, should be established for the successful execution of
the Plan;
v)
Determine the nature of the machinery which
will be necessary for
securing the successful implementation of each stage of the Plan in all
its aspects;
vi)
Appraise from time to time the progress achieved
in the execution of
each stage of the Plan and recommend the adjustments of policy and
measures that such appraisal may show to be necessary; and
vii)
Make such interim or ancillary recommendations as appear to
it to be
appropriate either for facilitating the discharge of the duties assigned
to
it, or on a consideration of prevailing economic conditions, current
policies, measures and development programmes or on an examination
of such specific problems as may be referred to
it for advice by Central
or State Governments.
2.3
Planning Commission
plays an
integrative
role
in the development of a
holistic approach to the policy formulation
in
critical areas of human and economic
development including the highways infrastructure.
With the emergency of severe
constraints on available budgetary resources, the resource allocation system between
the States and Ministries of the Central Government is under strain.
This requires the
25



======================================================================
PAGE 36 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
Planning Commission to play a mediatory and facilitating
role, keeping
in view [he
best interest of all concerned.
It has to ensure smooth management of the change
and help
in creating a culture of high productivity and efficiency
in the Government.
The key to
efficient
utilization of resources
lies
in the creation
of appropriate
self-
managed organization at all levels.
In this area, Planning Commission attempts to play
a systems change role and provide consultancy within the Government for developing
better systems,
in order to spread the gains of experience more widely, Planning
Commission also plays an information dissemination role.
3
Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways
3.1
The Governments at the Central and the State levels are responsible for
development and maintenance of highway network in the country. Whereas the Central
Government
is primarily responsible for development and maintenance of National
Highway Network in the country, the State Governments and the Union Territories are
responsible for the development and maintenance of various categories of State Roads.
The Right-of-Way (ROW), i.e. the land acquired for the highways, is accordingly vested
with the concerned Governments at the Central and State levels.
However, besides
being
responsible
for financing
of the development and maintenance
of National
Highway Network in the country, the Central Government also provides funds for the
State Roads under various schemes. Therefore, the financing of Highway projects
and maintenance of existing highways
is by and large from Government funds both
under Plan and Non-Plan. New ways of funding by cess and through public private
participation are also being followed for Highway projects.
Thus planning, funding
and execution of Highway projects,
is by and large responsibility of the Central and
the State Governments. Centre Government deals with Highways sector at planning,
budgeting and funding
level.
This role
is performed
by Ministry of Shipping, Road
Transport and Highways, Department of Rural Development under the
Ministry of
Rural Development and the National Rural Roads Development Agency (NRRDA)
under the Ministry of Rural Development.
3.2
The National Highways came into being on
1 .4.1947 when the Government
of India assumed responsibility for the development and maintenance of certain roads
provisionally known as National Highways.
In 1956, the Govt, of India enacted the
National Highway Act 1956, and the then existing National Highways were declared
statutorily as National Highways.
In the process of implementation
of the various
recommendations of the Nagpur Plan and as a
result of the Central Government
assuming complete financial responsibility for the maintenance and development of a
system of roads accepted by them as National Highways, the Office of the Consulting

Engineer (Road Development) to the Govemnnent of India was expanded and came to
be known as the Roads Wing of the Ministry of Shipping and Transport.
In
1 966, the
head of the Organisation was designated as the Director General (Road Development)
and Additional Secretary to the Government of India, and the post was upgraded to
Special Secretary. The erstwhile Ministry of Shipping and Transport is presently called
Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways.
3.3
The Department of Road Transport and Highways of this
Ministry came
into being during 1999-2000, and
it has two wings,
viz. the Roads Wing and the
Road Transport Wing. The Roads Wing
is concerned mainly with matters relating to
Highways and performs following functions:
i)

Department of Rural Development, Ministry of Rural Development
4.1
In October 1 974, the Department of Rural Development came into existence
as a part of Ministry of Food and Agriculture. In August
1 979, the Department of Rural
Development was elevated to the status of a new Ministry of Rural Reconstruction.
In
January 1982, the Ministry was renamed as Ministry of Rural Development. In January
1985, the
Ministry of Rural Development was again converted
into a Department
under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development which was later rechristened
as
Ministry of Agriculture
in September 1985.
In
July 1991
the Department was
upgraded as Ministry of Rural Development. Another Department wz. Department of
Wasteland Development was created under this Ministry in July 1992.
In March 1995,
the Ministry was renamed as the Ministry of Rural Areas and Employment with three
departments namely, Department of Rural Employment and Poverty Alleviation, Rural
Development and Wasteland Development.
4.2
Again,
in 1999 Ministry of Rural Areas and Employment was renamed as
Ministry of Rural Development.
This Ministry has been acting as a catalyst effecting
the change in rural areas through the implementation of wide spectrum of programmes
which
are
aimed
at
poverty
alleviation,
employment
generation,
infrastructure
development and social security.
Over the years, with the experience gained,
in the
implementation of the programme and in response to the felt needs of the poor, several
programmes have been modified and new programme have been introduced. This
Ministry's main objective is to alleviate rural poverty and ensure improved quality of life
for the rural population especially those below the poverty line. These objectives are
achieved through formulation, development and implementation of programme relating
to various spheres of rural life and activities, from income generation to environmental
replenishment.

4.3
The Department of Rural Development implements schemes for generation
of self-employment and wage employment,
provision of housing and minor irrigation
assets to rural poor, social assistance to the destitute and Rural Roads. Apart from this,
the Department provides the support services and other quality inputs such as assistance
for
strengthening
of DRDA Administration,
Panchayati
Raj
Institutions,
Training &
Research, Human Resource Development, Development of Voluntary Action
etc. for
the proper implementation of the programme. The major programme of the Department
of Rural Development includes Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, (PMGSY).
5
National Highways Authority of India
5.1
The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) was constituted by an Act
of Parliament, the
National Highways Authority of India Act, 1988.
It
is responsible
for the development, maintenance and management of National Highways entrusted.
The Authority started functioning
in February, 1995 with the appointment of full time
Chairman and other Members. NHAI
is mandated to implement National Highways
Development Project (NHDP) which
is India's largest ever highway project with World
class Roads for uninterrupted traffic flow and enhanced safety of road users.
5.2
NHDP (Phase
I & ll)was launched in 1999 covering a length of nearly 14,000
km at an Estimated Cost of Rs. 54,000 crore
(at 1999 prices) and NHDP (Phase
III)
was launched
in 2005 for upgradation and 4 laning of 10,000 km of selected
high-
density corridors of National Highways at an Estimated Cost of
Rs. 55,000 crore (at
2005 prices).
5.3
As per the Government mandate NHAI
is shifting
its emphasis from hitherto
followed 'Construction Contracts' to 'Build Operate Toll (BOT) Contracts' on toll basis to
develop projects from NHDP-Phase
III onwards. This programme
is Estimated to cost
about Rs. 2,36,000 crore, Under NHDP Phase-V and stretches of about 20,000 km
of NHs are envisaged to be improved to 2-lane standards with paved shoulders. For
the NHDP Phase-V, Government has approved the proposal for 6-laning of 6500 km
of selected stretches of existing 4-lane roads on Design, Build, Finance and Operate
(DBFO)
basis.
For NHDP Phase -Vi. the Government has approved the proposal
for the development of 1000 km of access controlled 4/6 lane divided carriageway
expressways on BOT basis.

The Border Roads Organization (BRO)
is
a road construction execution
force, integral to and with support of the Army. Itstarted operations in May
1 960 with just

two projects; Project Tusker (renamed Project Vartak) in the East at Tejpur and project
Beacon in the west.
It has grown into a
1 3-project force, supported by a weil-organized
recruiting/training centre and two well-equipped base workshops for overhaul of plant/
equipment and two Engineer Store Depots for inventory management.
6.2
The BRO has not only linked the border areas of the North and North-East
with the
rest of the country,
but also contributed
to the execution
of road works
in

Islands, Uttarakhand and Chhattisgarh.
6.3
The BRO constructs and maintains roads
in the border areas, classified as
General Staff (GS) roads,
in keeping with Defence requirements.
Besides GS roads,
BRO also executes Agency Works, which are entrusted to
it by other Central Government
Ministries and Departments. Works entrusted by Public Sector Undertakings,
State
Governments and
other Semi-Government Organizations
are executed
as
Deposit
Works. Over the
years,
the BRO
has
diversified
into
the
construction
of
airfields,
permanent steel and pre-stressed concrete bridges and housing projects.
6.4
The BRO has been playing a vital role
in construction and maintenance of
roads under their charge. They have acquired special expertise and field experience
of working
in
difficult areas and rugged
terrain,
particularly
in the NE Region. BRO
need support of the State Governments for availability of land as also environment
and forest clearances.

Central Public Works Department
9.1
The Central Public Works Department (CPWD),
is the principal agency
responsible
for
creating
assets
for various
Ministries and
Departments
of the
Government of India (except Railways, Defence, Communication, Atomic Energy,
Airports Authority of India and All India Radio). About 150 years back in July 1854,
CPWD came into existence as a central agency meant for carrying out
all public
works. However,
it was
in
1930,
that the CPWD got organized
into
its existing
structure. Over the years, the CPWD has executed wide variety of
civil works
ranging from building residential accommodation and office complexes to roads,
bridges, airports and border fencing, not only in ihe country but also in neighboring
countries of South Asia.
9.2
CPWD
has
well
documented
Manuals,
Specifications
and
Standards,
Schedule of Rates, Accounts codes etc. which are updated from time to time, and are
used extensively by various construction agencies
in the country, be
it
in the public
or private sector. CPWD
is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Urban
Development (MOUD) and acts the chief professional advisor to Ministry of Urban
Development in all matters concerned with public works.
It is also the principal adviser
to the Government of India on
all technical matters
related
to
civil,
electrical and
mechanical engineering as also horticulture and architecture works. CPWD
is also
associated with implementation of some of the projects under PMGSY in the State of
Bihar and for construction of roads in
border areas in eastern and western sectors.

National Institute for Training of Highway Engineers, NOIDA
National Institute for Training of Highway Engineers (NITHE) is a registered
Society under the administrative control of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highway.
It
is a collabo.rative body of both Central and State Governments and was set up
in
the year 1983 with the objective of fulfilling the long felt need for training of Highway
Engineers
in the country, both at the entry level and during the service period. The
broad activities of National Institute for Training of Highway Engineers (NITHE) consist
of:
(i) Training of freshly recruited Highway Engineers;
(ii) Short duration technical
and management development courses for Middle and Senior Level Engineers;
(iii)
Training in specialized areas and new trends in highway sector and (iv) Development
of training materials, training modules for domestic and foreign participants.
11.2
Since
its inception, the NITHE has trained 12,000 Highway Engineers and
Administrators involved
in road development from
India and abroad through more
than 500 training programmes (upto December 2006). Participants are drawn from
Ministry
of Shipping, Road Transport and
Highways,
various
State PWDs,
Rural
Engineering Organizations, Public Sector, Private Sector and NGOs involved
in the
field of Highway Engineering. Engineers from foreign Government Departments have

It has also compiled a number of Manuals useful for engineers and
their organizations.
12
State Public Works Departments
12.1
The
critical
role
in execution of road projects
i-ests with the Public Works
Departments (PWDs) in the States. They also implement Works on National Highways
on ground except the segments of National Highways entrusted
to Border Roads
Organization
and
NHAI. The
State PWDs
are
responsible
for
policy,
planning,
construction and
maintenance
of State
Roads. The
State PWDs
are
performing
extremely vital role
in provision of road infrastructure on the ground.
However, they
need to be reoriented to the needs of current emphasis on private sector participation
and
implementation
of
large
scale
projects
with
available
assistances
from
the
multilateral funding agencies like the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and
the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation.
12.2
Several States have already taken the
initiative of reviewing their current
procedures, strengths and weaknesses
in the
existing system. States
like Andhra
Pradesh,
Gujarat,
Karnataka,
Orissa,
Rajasthan, Tamil
Nadu,
Uttar Pradesh,
etc.
have completed
institutional development strategy studies. Many other States have
also initiated the process. The Account Codes and Works Manuals of the State PWDs
need review in the light of procedural changes made at the Central level to keep pace
with the latest emerging technologies. There should be proper synchronization of the
procedures and systems at the Central and State levels.
13
Rural Engineering Organizations in the States
13.1
For executing Rural Roads Projects each State Government has to identify a
suitable agency having its presence in all districts and having established competence
in executing road construction work. These are designated as Executing Agencies
and
could be PWD/Rural
Engineering
Services/Rural
Engineering
Organizations/
Rural Works
Departments/Zila
Parishads/Panchayati
Raj
Institutions.
Each
State
Government
has
also
to
nominate
Nodal
Department which
shall
have
overall
responsibility for implementation of PMGSY in the State.
13.2
In
actual
practice
there
is
no
uniformity
of organizations
handling
the
programme
of Rural Roads and
different practices are being adopted
in
different
States.
In some
States,
the
entire
responsibility
of construction,
maintenance as
well as
planning
lies
with
the
district
level
bodies
like
Zilla
Parishads and
Block
35



======================================================================
PAGE 46 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
Level Panchayat Samities under the
administrative
control
of Rural Development
Departments, while in some States such functions are carried out by local bodies only
in respect of Village Roads and Community Development Roads (Non-Plan Roads,
etc.). In some States, the entire subject of District Roads is left to District Administration
lil<e Zilla Parishads including their planning through District Planning and Development
Councils (DPDCs).
!n some States, not having established Zilla Parishads, all aspects
of roads are dealt with by the PWDs or Rural Engineering Organizations (REOs).
In
many States, planning functions are carried out by the PWD even though survey,
design, construction and maintenance of Rural Roads are under the control of Zilla
Parishads.
13.3
There
is need
for uniformity of approach
in
planning,
construction and
maintenance of rural road programme having regard to different terrain, climate and
socio-economic environment. Where necessary, Zilla Parishads should be supported
with technical assistance by PWDs. While construction may be done by the PWDs/
REOs, maintenance functions may be entrusted
to
local
bodies, which should be
provided with adequate funds and supported with technical trained manpower. This
would require upgrading the quality of technical inputs
in the organizations handling
the worl< of rural roads.
14
Contractors
14.1
For number of years the Contracting industry in the highway sector remained
in a nascent state. As recently as in the eighties of the last Century Employees were
taking
all decisions for implementing Highway Projects. Contractors were individuals
of meager resources and almost ignorant of the technology and l<now-how but for a
few exceptions in construction of bridge structures, most members of the industry were
having annual turnover was
in terms of a few crore rupees. They were unorganized,
had little resources and infrastructure and were operating mostly atTaluka levels. Their
interaction was confined to lower level functionaries like Sub Divisional Officers and
Executive Engineers and
in some cases upto the level of Superintendent Engineers.
Chief Engineers used to be beyond reach for most members of the industry. The size
of the projects were limited to a few crore rupees and involved only components of the
road structures, viz. earthwork, collection/transportation of road materials and labour
charges for doing
individual items of work. The work given
to individual contractor
never involved construction of the road
in
its entirety. Most members of the Industry
Road had a few units of equipments like Graders, Excavators, Road Rollers and the
like. Hardly any qualified technical personnel used to be on the
rolls of the Industry
members.

14.2
Gradually, with the liberalization of the Indian economy towards the end of
the last century, medium to large size projects came into vogue. Employers started
inviting bids for bigger projects, of say up to Rs.100 crore, on similar lines as that of
developed countries.
Keeping pace with the development and to utilize the growing
opportunities, the Indian Construction industry also transformed itself both in size and
capacity; but
it was still not large enough to cope up with the demand and requirements
of such bigger projects. To begin with, the pre-qualification (PQ) criteria were beyond
most of the members of the industry. Very survival necessitated innovative measures.
This forced most members of the industry to have joint ventures between themselves
and with the foreign companies.
Cost of constructions of road work in the developed
countries being many fold as compared to that of India, foreign companies could
fulfill
the PQ criteria quite easily although their overall size and work experiences
in many
cases was only, marginally higher than their Indian counterparts.
Foreign companies
exploited the situation to their advantage and more often then not just lent their names
as Joint Venture partners. They seldom involved themselves with actual construction
activities and their presence
in the country was confined to a few functionaries. The
passive presence of the foreign partners forced the Indian counterparts to man and
manage the bigger size projects by themselves albeit under the overall umbrella of
the foreign partners.
This gave opportunity to the Indian contracting industry to grow
by leaps and bounds as also muster enough resources and upgrade themselves
technologically for handling bigger size projects. This also necessitated inculcation of
corporate culture, for management of projects professionally and delivery of quality
products.
Opening up of the Indian economy also enabled the Industry to acquire
/ import modern construction equipments at competitive cost, gain know-how more
easily and above
all transform themselves from family owned and oriented business
to private limited companies employing thousands of work force and Engineers. Many
members of the industry are now owners of key construction equipments like graders,
excavators, rollers, concrete batching plants, hot mix plants etc. Their yearly turnovers
in most cases have leap frogged 10 times
in the last decade. They are
in a position
to undertake projects of any size and are also spreading their wing overseas.
Such
phenomenal rise of the Indian construction industry in such a short time is unparallel.
The
National Highways
Builders
Federation (NHBF)
is the
single
largest body of
highway builders in the country
representing 52 companies.
15
Developers and Concessionaires
1 5.1
With the highway sector thrown open to private sector for financing on BOT
basis, several entrepreneurs and
contractors are coming
forth as developers and
concessionaries
in the sector. The Government has developed Model Concession
37



======================================================================
PAGE 48 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
Agreement which provides for rights and responsibilities of the concessionaire and
the Government as also a fair allocation of risl<s between them. The Concessionaire
develop
the
project,
undertakes
detailed
design
and
arranges
the
necessary
funds including the grant from the Government. He, then arranges construction of
the
project either through
his own resource or through
hiring outside
contractors.
On completion
of the worl<s, he gets entitlement of
collecting
tolls from the road
users at designated
toll plazas and undertakes operation and maintenance as also
management of the highway project duly meeting the performance requirements laid
down
in the agreement during the concession
period, which may be
in the range
of 20 to 25 years. The Concessionaire
also undertakes to provide several project
facilities for road users - such as rest areas, busbays, truck lay byes, highway traffic
management system, incidence management, ambulance, towaway crane etc. Quality
of service to road users and traffic management measures are generally arranged by
the Concessionaires through dedicated O&M operators and Highway Patrol units. The
NHAI and several State Governments have succeeded
in undertaking road projects
through private financing on BOT(Toll) and BOT(Annuity) Models.
15.2
Financial Institutions are involved in providing funds to the Concessionaire.
Some of the financial institutions which are actively involved
in highway development
are World Bank, Asian Development Bank, Indian Development Finance Corporation,
Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services, Indian Infrastructure Finance Co. Ltd.
NABARD, JBIC, SB! Caps and ICICI Infrastructure Division.
16
Consultants
16.1
The consultancy profession
in the
field of roads and bridges has grown
and a number of domestic firms have graduated to international stature.
Besides, a
number of international firms from abroad are forming joint ventures with domestic
firms or have established their own subsidiary units in India with majority of domestic
professionals. Not only large firms, but even medium size firms are now equipped with
latest state-of-art survey instruments and laboratory testing equipment and many of
them have on their roaster experienced surveyors, material engineers and laboratory
technicians.
16.2
Consultancy has different dimensions and scope of work including planning,
design, traffic and transport studies, Quality Control and supervision etc. For promotion
of consultancy; the Consultancy Development Centre (CDC), an autonomous body
was set up by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), Ministry
of Science and Technology, Government of India. CDC provides
skill up-gradation
to consultants, including running a post graduate programme leading to Masters
in

is the member association of FIDIC in India. They conduct
Training and Seminars for promotion of consultants.
17
Tools, Plants and Equipment Manufacturer/Supplier
During
last decade, the role of tools,
plants, and equipment manufacturers as also
suppliers have increased many fold. The policy of the Government is for facilitating use
of sophisticated machinery in the highway sector in the wake of intensive mechanization
in development and maintenance activities through measures such as exemption of
import custom duty etc. and also exemptions from custom and excise duties being
granted
in case of the projects funded by the World Banl< and Asian Development
Bank. There have given a boost to the domestic equipment manufacturing industry.

Indian Roads Congress
19.1
The
Indian
Roads
Congress
(IRC)
is
the
premier
technical
body
of
Highway Engineers
in the country. The IRC was formed
in December, 1934 on the
recommendations of the
Indian Road Development Committee known as Jayakar
Committee set up by the Govt, of India with the objective of Road Development
in
India. As the activities of the IRC expanded,
it was formally registered as a Society
in 1937 under the Societies Registration Act of 1860. Over the years, the IRC has
burgeoned and grown into a multi-dimensional multifaceted organization, devoted to
the cause of better roads in the country.
19.2
The Congress provides a
national forum
for sharing
of knowledge and
pooling of experience on the entire range of subjects dealing with the construction
and maintenance of roads and bridges, including technology, equipment, research,
39



======================================================================
PAGE 50 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
planning,
finance,
taxation, organization and
all connected
policy
issues.
In more
specific terms, the objectives of the Congress are:
i)
To promote and encourage the science and practice of building and
maintenance of roads;
11)
To provide a channel
for the expression
of collective opinion
of
its
members regarding roads;
ill)
To
promote
the
use
of
standard
specifications
and
to
propose
specifications;
iv)
To advise regarding education, experiment and research connected
with roads;
v)
To hold periodical meetings, to discuss technical questions regarding
roads;
vi)
To suggest legislation for the development, improvement and protection
of roads;
vii)
To suggest improved methods
of administration,
planning,
design,
construction, operation, use and maintenance of roads;
viii) To establish, furnish and maintain libraries and museums for furthering
the science of road making;
ix)
To
publish,
or arrange
for the
publication
of proceedings, journals,
periodicals and other literature connected with the road sector.
19.3
In order to fulfill
its objective to advise regarding education, knowledge and
research connected with roads, the IRC has to fulfill
its objective in broader terms by
showing a way forward to highway sector for education and research needed for proper
development of roads. The Human Resource Committee of the IRC has been given
responsibility to develop such documents which will be helpful
in capacity building of
organizations and enhancing capacity and capability of individuals; from high
level
professionals to workers. The documents are also required to be developed to make
available the information about everything connected with highway sector.

Multifaceted Concern
After introduction of economic reforms and accepting tine need for developing liigliway
sector in a big way tliere lias been shared perception that emphasis need be given for a
paradigm shift from the linear approach to a more coordinated approach within overall
ambit of integrated transport policy with optimal inter-modal mix and emphasis on
safety, energy efficiency and conservation, environment protection, self sustaining and
viable transport units. Fourth Road Development Plan in its formulations addressed to
multifaceted concern of highway sector covering diverse areas
lil<e capacity building
in highway departments,
consultancy
sector and
construction
industry,
incidence
management, improving energy efficiency,
private sector financing of projects with
equity based
profit and
risk sharing. This has
led
to creation and
participation
of
numbers of complimentary organizations and agencies who are engaged in supplying
the needed competency based inputs to enable the
principal highway agencies
to
take decisions more objectively and implement projects on a more scientific basis with
strengthened knowledge and skill capabilities. This chapter, accordingly, covers such
organizations/agencies which are supporting and contributing to the core organizations
and are drawn from the field as diverse as policy planning and funding organizations
to organizations engaged
in research and development,
regulatory, environmental,
training, testing and other support functions.

State Planning Departments
2.1
Exceptforthe National Highways and Central Government funded schemes,
all roads and highways are in the purview of State Governments. The proposals are
framed by the State Public Works Departments and other Departments dealing with
highways and comprehensive scheme for Highways Sector
is framed by the State
Planning Departments under the control of Secretary (Planning). These proposals are
part of State Plan. The annual physical and financial targets are prepared on the basis
of already approved Five Year Plans, depending upon the status of roads and nature
of requirements. The funding of such proposal is done through Planning Commission,
Government of India and revenue generated by the State Governments.
2.2
The State Planning Departments have
vital
role to play as they decides
about priorities and allocation of funds. Thus, State Highways, MDR, ODRs and Village

of projects.
19
Development Bodies and Participatory Agencies
19.1
Urban
Development
Bodies:
In
urban
areas,
roads
are
part
of urban
infrastructure and accordingly, roads schemes are prepared and implemented within
the overall plan of city development. Sometimes, the
city area
is divided between
municipal Council and Improvement trust, which are statutory bodies constituted with
the specific purpose of promoting the development of cities. Road schemes
in
city
areas need approval from such urban Improvement Trust or Development Authority.
An expanded version of an urban Improvement Trust is Delhi Development Authority
(DDA), which was set up with a view to promote and
develop Delhi according
to
Master
Plan
as
approved
for twenty
years
period.
Road
construction schemes
including bridges and flyovers in Delhi are required to be approved by DDA. Besides,
the approval of Delhi Urban Arts Commission
is also necessary.
19.2
Panchyat Raj Agencies: The 73'^ Constitutional Amendment Act of 1993
envisioned a vibrant Panchayati Raj system, responsive to the needs and aspirations
of the
local community, where informed and
inclusive
participation
of
all
citizens,
cutting across caste, class and gender,
in the planning and administration ensures
accountability of the system to the
local community. The Act provides for creation
of three tier system- Gram Panchayat at the village level, Janpad-Panchayat at the
Block level and Zila-Panchayat at district level, with sufficient power and functions
contained
in the Schedule appended to the Act like creation of Financial Commission
for strengthening their financial position. These agencies though are not planning &
development bodies, but different State Governments can enact their own legislations to
assign them functions relating to implementation of schemes of economic development
and social justice like PMGSY and development of other rural connectivity schemes.

19.3
Electrical Transmission Lines: Electric generation, supply and distribution in
different States are largely in Public Sector, with respective Electricity Boards controlling
generation and transmission of electricity.
In metropolitan areas, distribution system
gradually
is being transferred
to
private
distribution agencies as a
part of reforms
brought about
in
electricity sector consequent to enactment of Electricity Act 2003.
Accordingly, as per the
directives issued
by the State Governments or
Electricity
Regulatory Commissions of the States, different agencies operating
in States are to
be coordinated
for shifting of electricity transmission
lines
interfering with ROW or
laying of electrical transmission lines for lighting of highways especially in urban areas
or along designated stretches of highway projects.
19.4
Municipal & other agencies: Municipal bodies and Jal Boards and controlling
water supply, sewerage, drainage especially
in cities and metropolitan areas are to
be interacted and permission obtained for shifting of utilities and for connecting road
side drainage with the city drainage system. Telephone, internet, gas supply are other
utilities which
are found
criss-crossing
city-scape and
are needed
to be
properly
dovetailed into the road projects to avoid any disruption by way of un-intended cutting
of cables, ducts or supply pipes.
20
Environmental Protection Agencies
20.1
With increasing need and urgency for preserving and enhancing natural
environmentforthe subsistence of human life. Governments, world over, are examining
all development
projects from
environmental
point
of view,
before
allowing
their
execution. Principal environment regulatory agency in India is Ministry of Environment
& Forest. This Ministry formulates policies and decides whether to allow the project to
proceed or whether to alter or abandon
it.
20.2
The key environmental
legislations regulating the environmental aspects
of a project are
(a) The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act,
1974,
(b)
The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 (c) The Forest Act, 1927 (d)
The Forest (Conservation) Act 1980,
(e) The Wild
Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and
(f)
The Environment (Protection) Act,
1986.
Ministry of Environment and
Forest, from
time to time, issues notification under the provisions
in the Environment (Protection)
Act, 1986 specifying requirements
in respect of Highway Projects
like
all Highway
Projects costing Rs. 50 crore or more shall not be undertaken unless they have been
accorded
Environmental
Clearance and
others concerning
requirement
of
public
hearing for projects seeking environmental clearance, Coastal Regulation Zones etc.
For any ecological sensitive area,
if Ministry of Environment and Forest has appointed
any statutory authority for clearing the
projects, such
authority's clearance
is also
necessary, for the project in that area.

20.3
Highway Projects require approval from the Ministry of Environment and
Forest.
Detailed
proposals are
required
to be prepared based on ground
studies
done by the experts for such approval. Under the Environment (Protection) Act 1986
and the Forest (Conservation) Act 1980, the steps required to be taken for obtaining
Environmental clearance from Government of India involves steps lil<e (a) Preliminary
study of different alternative alignments from technical and environmental
point of
view (b) Preparing feasibility report and detailed EIA in respect of chosen alignment
(c)
Obtaining
clearances
from
the
concerned
State
Pollution
Control
Board
(d)
Submission of proposal to Ministry of Environment and Forest in required proformae
alongwith documents
like project report, EIA report as per IRC: 104-1988, report of
public hearing, clearance from State Pollution Control Board and recommendations
from State Environment Department and
(e) Proposal for diversion of forest land.
If
required presentation of Project is to be done to the Experts Committee.
21
Human Resource in Highway Sector
21.1
Organizations
directly
working
for
highways
sector and
manned
with
professionals and workmen belonging to this sector are dealt in Chapter-4. Whereas
this Chapter has covered other related organizations manned by professionals who,
though are also
engaged
in the highway sector development,
but
not exclusive,
rather part of their overall responsibility extends to
areas of other sectors as well.
Each of these core as well as other related organizations/agencies/bodies
call
for
different competencies
to enable them
to
contribute
effectively
in highway sector
development. Understanding
their HR requirement
is,
therefore, necessary before
one can
conceptualize and
plan HR
requirement
for the
overall
highway
sector
as such.
In order to study requirement of human resource for highways
sector,
it
is necessary to understand HR requirements both for core organizational and other
related organizations.
21.2
Various organizations, bodies, institutions and agencies whether engaged
directly or and
in supporting capacity for the development of Highways sector, are
manned professionals and workmen who work in various capacities
i.e. as individual
for as a part of unit/group for fulfilling objectives of organizations. The efficacy of such
outcome is contingent to congruity between organization's structure and process with
those who man the organization. For devising ways and means for human resources
development in highways sector,
it is therefore necessary to understand organizational
requirement.

ORGANIZATIONAL REQUIREMENT
1
Capacity Building
Dynamics of highway sector involving many direct, complementary, supporting and
regulatory players
for translating a development vision
into
realty, requires that
all
such
organizations/agencies/bodies
respond
and
work
in
synergistic manner
at
organization, process, group and
individual
level. This calls for capacity building-in
the shape
of continuous development,
retention and
harnessing
the
professional
expertise,
effective human resource management
policies
in
recruitment,
training,
job assignment, transfer and
postings, rewards and punishment, decision making,
motivation, and cross function specialization to name a few.
Harmonious blending of
human resource development and human resource management with the organization
development may be considered as one of the prime requirement for the development
of highway sector. The organizational requirement of the client, consultant, contractor,
research,
training,
quality assurance and
other support organizations whether
in
government, autonomous
or private sector are thus wide and varied, encompassing
both the organization and those working in
it.
2
Government Organizations
2.1
Without
getting
into the organization
specific
analysis, based upon
the
analysis of pitfalls
in achieving the targets set
in various Road Development Plans
and the experiences gained from time to time, some of the key areas requiring focus
of the
various Government
Organizations
for
improving and
streamlining
of the
implementation of projects are summarized as under:
i)
Outsourcing
of
professional
expert
services
for
the
design
and
construction
supervision
of complex
multi-disciplinary
large
sized
projects,
large
span/innovative
bridges,
environmental assessment
studies, rehabilitation works, techno-economic analysis, etc. requiring
special skills.
ii)
Peer review/proof consultancy for finalization of designs for complex
mega projects.
iii)
Ensure
that departmental
officers do
not become complacent and
carry the feeling that they have very little role to play when professional
50



======================================================================
PAGE 61 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
consultancy services are procured through outsourcing so as to obviate
post construction stage problems, audit queries, legislative questions,
complaints, arbitration and litigation, etc.
iv)
Faster decision mal<ing process in the organization, decentralization of
power, greater autonomy at functional and execution levels.
v)
Promote
conducive
worl<ing
atmosphere
and
professional
pride
amongst employees.
vi)
Right person for the assignment.
vii)
Continuation of the Officers assigned for the project without transferring
them in between.
viii) Depute
officers
for
structured
training
courses
periodically
and
specialized training courses for specific assignments.
ix)
Ensure
long term commitment
of consultants
in
the
projects even
beyond the project implementation period and defect liability period.
x)
Systematize project record keeping and archive for future guidance.
Evolve
mechanism
to
ensure
availability
of
consultant's
records/
documents even
after the defects
liability periods are over so
that
potential defects manifesting or disputes/claims arising for the project
can be defended
in various forums.
xi)
Encourage progressive use of information technology
in
all phases,
i.e. project planning, designs, procurement of services, implementation
and monitoring, operation and maintenance.
xii)
Inter-departmental
co-ordination
to
resolve
issues
such
as
environmental
clearance,
land
acquisition,
utility
shifting,
encroachment removal, etc. during pre-construction phase.
xiii) Ensure timely payments to the consultants and contractors.
xiv) System
of
writing
of Performance Appraisal
Report
(PAR)
of
the
Consultant by the Employer's representative and submission at higher
level upon
project completion.
Such
reports
to be attached
to the
dossier of the consultant in the organization for future reference.
xv)
Ensure that consultants indemnify the employer through professional
performance guarantee against
all claims, actions, damages,
liability.

litigation,
etc.
in connection with negligent acts,
errors, omissions of
the consultants.
xvi) Evolve appropriate guidelines and procedures for administration and
management of consultancy services.
xvii) Evolve effective Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Mechanisms.
3
Contracting Industry
3.1
Contractors are the major partners
for both
direct construction
projects
by the Government and BOT projects through private entrepreneurs.
In the Nineties
when the NHDP was launched by the Government, a need was
felt for large size
contracting firms/contractors to take up packages which involved modern mechanized
construction
system
using
plants,
equipments
and
standards
and
specifications
matching with the world standards. Now that many of indigenous contractors have
come
of age and have developed
expertise
to undertake medium
to major value
projects, there is need to evaluate their competence level to ensure that the firms are
capable as regards their organizational and technical capabilities for undertaking the
job and completing the same as per the required quality and speed delivery standards.
For this purpose, Construction Industry Development Council (CIDC) set up by the
Planning Commission, has instituted a system to grade the projects and contractors.
This process,
it is expected, will assist the consultants and clients in selecting proper
contractors to execute the projects.
3.2
With the increased emphasis on
projects through the channel
of Public
Private
Partnership (PPP) which has
led over the years
to the
creation
of many
innovative instruments like BOT, BOOT, BOO projects, the private equity partners like
developers and contractors would be required to undertake additional role
in the risk
sharing of concession agreement. They will also be required to be performed at global
standard with due sensitization to the need for incorporation of Quality, Safety and
Environment in their delivery standards. A close interaction between the Government,
industry, Academia, R&D institutions and CIDC will help further the cause of Contractors
and developers in highways sector. Skill up-gradation of different category of workers/
technicians/engineers to cover the gap between
their available
skill standards and
standards as demanded from them has become absolute necessity and has to be
undertaken by the Government and industry
in the right earnest. Conditions have to
be created for healthy growth of the domestic contractors with possible state of art
technology transfer in the field of construction management, plants and equipment by
seeking support from foreign contractors.

The burgeoning growth and development of the road network after economic
reforms
in 1990s and further spurred by the ambitious targets set by the fourth road
Development plan for the first quarter of 20'*" Century has created an enormous demand
on the technical professionals. The limited availability of suitable technical professionals
in
the
field has posed serious problems
for
effective and
timely implementation
of
projects on a sustainable basis. This demand-supply gap of highway professionals
is
found to have a cascading effect as manifested in adversely affecting the pace of overall
decision making and implementation process. Therefore, there has been need for the
consultancy firms to join hands with the academic institutions and research institutions
in the country to get their support in filling up the gap in provision of specialists.
4.2
Notwithstanding
the
concomitant
professional
growth
with
pace
of
development
in
the
highway
sector,
weaknesses
have
also
been
experienced
particularly
in preparation
of Detailed
Project Reports.
Not many firms have any
system of internal audit by independent persons before the outputs are delivered to
the clients.
4.3
The Consultants should ensure regular participation of the professionals
employed with them,
in the
skill up-gradation programme organized by Consultancy
Development Centre (CDC). CDC
is
putting
in place an accreditation and grading
system for Consultants. This will assist the clients to make a considered decision
in
selection of consultants for their projects.
Similarly, they should also
participate
in
the trainings and seminars organized by Consulting Engineers Association of India
(CEAI). For proper selection of consultants,
it
is desirable to provide a Quality Cost
Based Selection (QCBS) as promoted by FIDIC.
4.4
A system of quality assurance and quality audit for the consultant's work
including instituting a system of grading the firms and keeping a track record of their
past performance need
to be introduced. The specialized
training
in
collaboration
with academic institutions should be worked out for utilization by the consulting firms.
There
is need
to encourage formation of joint ventures with
international firms for
improvement
of
capabilities
especially
in emerging
technologies where domestic
expertise
is
still lacking. Some system of performance evaluation of consultants by
some independent professional agencies could be considered.
4.5
There
is also need for further growth of the consultancy sector. For this,
some mechanism to consciously encourage small size and medium firms wanting to
enter highway sector needs to be evolved.
53

4.6
There are instances of change
in personnel by the consultants on one
ground or the other, although most of the consultancy agreements specify that only
in unavoidable circumstances, such as on
health grounds,
etc., replacements by
equivalent or superior personnel could be allowed. There is requirement to ensure the
continuation of originally proposed team in the interest of the project.
4.7
There is need for consultants to follow the code of ethics prescribed by the
Consulting Engineers Association of India (CEAI) in letter and spirit.
4.8
With the increased role of consultants in highway development it is anticipated
that consultancy sector will draft
in competent professionals to take care of various
activities involved, such as, project formulation, design, supervision, quality control,
monitoring etc.
In view of the prevailing shortage of experienced manpower,
it would
be prudent to develop and train personnel to take up consultancy as a profession.
It
would be advisable to consider a system of sending on deputation Engineers from
Government Department and state PWD's to Consultancy Companies.
5
Concessionaires Firms
5.1
The Concessionaires themselves are not expected to possess
in entirety
the in-house technical capabilities for developing, operating, maintaining the highway
sections for the fixed tenure of the concession period. They may be allowed to mobilize
the expert services and satisfactorily demonstrate and manage the availability of such
services
for the duration
of the Concession
Period. The Concessionaires may be
allowed to pool up expertise (technical, financial,
legal, etc.) of separate companies
through contractual arrangements,
etc. This would enable growth
of the domestic
knowledge based
industries as a whole,
promoting growth
of separate
individual
companies/private
institutions
with dedicated
expertise,
rather than
having
single
organization/company with multi-disciplinary expertise.
5.2
The Concession Agreements
should encourage
promotion and
use
of
innovative technologies/materials as generally they
lay down performance
criteria
and
final product requirements without getting
into the finer technical nuances. The
Concessionaires should accordingly take this opportunity to introduce not only cost-
effective technologies/materials, but also try to promote more environment and ecology
friendly constructions,
with
utilization
of waste/marginal
materials or
industrial
by-
products and try to minimize depletion of natural reserves such as bitumen, aggregates
etc. They would be expected to undertake innovative methods and scientific application
of project management to formulate and complete the project
in shortest possible
time,
in order to generate resources at the earliest. They should also demonstrate
54



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
commitment for proper operation and maintenance services after the highway is open
for commercial operations so that quality of service to road users
is maintained, and
provide satisfaction to the users.
6
Domestic Equipment Manufacturing Industry
6.1
The emphasis will be required to boost the local industry for manufacturing
of highway equipment.
Further, the concept of "Equipment Bank" in the private sector
regarding leasing of equipments needs to be encouraged, and made available to the
contracting agencies. The equipment manufacturers must also respond to meet the
growing volume of works by increasing their levels of production and also manufacture
new range of equipments of international standards suiting to current requirements.
6.2
There
is
necessity
for developing
low
cost
indigenous equipment and
machinery for projects on lower category of roads such as Rural Roads etc., so that
the
projects
could be implemented
within
reasonable
costs and
through
smaller
contractors. The equipment industry also needs to support the contractors with training
of foremen and operators.
7
Need for the Restructuring of Organizations
7.1
Prior
to
1985,
for improvement
of
National
Highways,
the
then
policy
followed
for the
stage
construction and
labour
intensive
construction technology
which
led
to a
thin spread
of available meagre
financial resources over a
larger
length. Therefore,
in the early period the projects were implemented mainly on small
and medium sized contract packages,
involving contractors of lesser capacity and
with the equipments which were mainly road
roller and hot mix plants supplied by
the Government
departments.
However,
for
bridge
works,
comparatively
bigger
contractors were available but their equipment resources were quite limited. A major
push in the direction of big size project package came in
1 985 when for the first time,
the Government of India, while seeking loan assistance for roads from the World Bank
(WB) accepted to adopt International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures and FIDIC
conditions of contract for the highway projects, forming part of the loan package.
In
order to encourage modernization and mechanization, size of the projects were kept
at Rs.100 to Rs.150 million at that time.
7.2
The economic reforms introduced in 1991 gave further impetus to import of
world-class road making equipment. The modifications of the MORTH specifications
facilitated the use of modern equipment. After Year 2000, there has been a growth
in
the usage of modern equipment in the road sector, especially the projects undertaken
55



======================================================================
PAGE 66 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
by NHAI. The country has seen the change in thrust in respect of the use of equipment,
born out of need. The evolution in technology for the road construction has resulted in
the introduction of machines like Wet Mix Plants, Pavers for the construction of base
course, etc. Cold and hot milling machines, cold and hot re-cycling machines have
also been introduced to reduce the thickness of the road crust and to recycle the used
material for the highway construction. On the maintenance aspects the mechanized
construction have been introduced
in the form of pot-hole repairing machines, slurry
sealing machines and
sophisticated machines
like kerb
laying machines and
line
marking machines. Management of maintenance works have also evolved over the
years, grounded on more rigorous scientific analysis of road net-work condition.
7.3
The methodology
of construction has
progressively
shifted from
labour
intensive system
in the pre-economic reform period to the present day mechanized
system.
This has contributed
to adoption of improved designs and
specifications
and
speedier
project
implementation.
However,
this
also demands
adaptation
of
effective working environment and paradigm shift from prevalent institutional system
of yesteryears to an
institutional mechanism suiting the present day requirements.
Further, with the Government's
initiative to encourage implementation of more and
more projects through Private Sector participation on Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT)
mode, the roles of both Government organizations and Private Sector associated with
development of highways have been redefined. In other words,
in the light of modern
technology, use of new specifications, machine oriented construction and
different
contracts for implementation, the implementation organizations need to be upgraded
to take on the challenge of accelerated development works.
7.4
A review of strength and weakness of the existing procedures, rules and
regulations, delegation
of powers,
present method
of implementation, forthcoming
opportunities and threatfrom external environment may be taken up by the organizations
with the aim to address and implement the needed reforms in these organizations.
8
Availability of Technical Professionals in the Sector
8.1
The
present
impetus
of development
in
the
Highway
Sector
is
not
adequately supported by the availability of Technical Professionals
in the Sector,
i.e.
Engineers,
Scientists,
etc. This
is perhaps the most disconcerting
fact which may
adversely affect the development of this sector in the country. Therefore, efforts are
required for developing more number of experts in the Sector. With more lucrative job
avenues opening up in the highway sector, the premier academic institutions should
be sensitized and encouraged to induct more number of students
in the discipline of
Civil Engineering with particular emphasis to specializations, such as. Highway Engg.,
Traffic and Transportation Engg., Structural Engg., Geotechnical Engg. etc.
56

======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
8.2
The
Engineering and
Technical
Institutions
are
to be encouraged
and
incentives
given
for
attracting
students
in
Highway
Engineering
profession. The
Association
of these
Institutions
is also required
for providing
training
to the new
entrants as well as in-service engineers.
9
Training of Engineers and Professionals
9.1
Appropriate training arrangements are required to be made for increasing
the number of Highway Engineers and other professionals.
It is also essential to create
awareness among the highway engineers regarding the technological developments
world over.
The training needs, involving training
in engineering disciplines, project
management
techniques,
financial
management,
operation
and management
of
highways, etc., should be imparted during entry in services, at job sites and through
periodic
in-service
refresher
courses. These
are
applicable
for
contractors
and
consultants. Training of engineers working
in the highway sector
is perhaps one of
the most important area requiring attention.
It has to be a continuous exercise. To
keep pace with technological developments,
it
is essential to keep abreast of good
practices in planning, design, construction management and maintenance of road and
bridge projects.
All concerned both government and private sectors, should formulate
a training
policy and decide on arrangements to network with the existing training
institutions,
i.e. NITHE,
NTs,
IIMs, CRRI,
etc. for regular training of engineers at
all
levels. Such a policy should address the need for training at entry, on job-site, periodic
in-service refresher courses and study leave/tours within the country or abroad
to
enhance their skills in various management and engineering aspects.
9.2
The
National
Institute
for Training
of Highway Engineers
set up by the
Government of India would need to play a vital role in training effort. NITHE should also
come out with a comprehensive plan indicating the various areas of training for different
levels of highway engineers, duration and course contents and periodically update/
modify the same as per the sectoral requirements depending upon the feedbacks
obtained thereon.
NITHE should also function as a repository of documentation of
all major projects for future lessons learning and dissemination. NITHE may consider
entering into MOUs with the international and national training/academic and research
institutions to provide the institutional support.
For augmenting the activities of NITHE
all the departments dealing with roads should support the NITHE by sending adequate
number of persons for training and also provide required finances. To serve highways
sector in comprehensive manner, N ITHE should be given status of a University. Besides,
four more similar institutions be opened
in South, West, East an North-East regions.
57



======================================================================
PAGE 68 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
As required, post-graduate, graduate level, diploma and certificate courses be developed
by NITHE. Besides, the training and skill development of Workmen, Supervisors and
Equipment Operators should also be included in the scope of activities of NITHE.
9.3
There is a marked reluctance on the part of many organizations, especially
the State Government Organizations, to depute technical personnel for training mainly
on the plea that they could not be spared on account of pressing necessities. However,
a mechanism needs to be evolved to make periodic training programme a mandatory
requirement
for promotions,
specific
postings,
etc.
and,
if necessary,
the
training
programmes could be finalized well in time after consulting the concerned higher level
authorities and taken into account the eventualities and possible exigencies, so that
the person deputed for a specific training programme undergoes the same without
fail.
9.4
Respective organizations must carry out a Training Need Analysis (TNA), of
their employees taking into account the competence level required for the job and the
employee data. Periodic training rosters should be prepared and needs to be followed
for effective results. The human resource department of the organization must look
at the training
aspects as an important 'ngredient of their activity.
In order to assist
the organizers and individuals for training of their professionals, IRC
is publishing a
document and placing on
its web site, for giving information about available training
facilities and calendar of training programme being run by various
institutions and
organizations. This
will help
in selecting training required by professionals for their
specialized needs.
10
Training and Certification of Supervisors and Workmen
10.1
According to Government estimate, included
in the National Employment
policy, around 457 million people
in labour force need to acquire new skill standards
or upgrade their skills. Current capacity of the government run Technical Vocational
Education Training Programme
is only 12.2 million each year, whereas, 12.8 million
work force is added every year.
It is found that only 5 percent of youth between the age
group of 20-24 possess vocational skills, while this figure is 28 percent in Germany, 79
percent in Canada and 80 percent in Japan. Most of the labour force employed by the
highway sector comes from un-organized sector, whereas. Government programmes
are mostly focused on organized sector, making
skill development and
certification
need for the highway sector a priority policy input area.
10.2
Training
is,
therefore,
required
at the
cutting edge
level
of technicians,
supervisory
staff
of
road
agencies
and
contractors'
workers—both
skilled
and
58

unskilled. Two to three ITIs
in each State may be identified where such training can
be imparted. National Academy of Construction in Hyderabad
is a very good initiative
of the Government of Andhra Pradesh with the support of the Contractors. This
is an
example, worthy of emulation by other States.
11
HRD is Organizational Requirement
11.1
For
effective and
efficient plan formulations and
project implementation
it
is
vital
that there
is
congruity
of purpose among
all concerned
organizations.
Convergence of their aims and objectives however requires that the activities of
all
the varied functionaries worl<ing
in
different organizations, departments, agencies,
institutes, laboratories etc. are cumulatively found reinforcing the realization of road
map prepared for the highway sector development. This calls for creating a synergy
among various stakeholders associated with Highway Development, viz. the Planning
and Funding agencies at the Government level, implementation agencies at the Govt,
level, Contractors/Concessionaires, Consultants/Independent Engineers, Equipment
manufacturers,
suppliers
of
other
materials,
suppliers/manufacturers
of
various
patented products relevant to the sector. This mutually reinforcing synergy is required
for the promotion of a conducive environment and good work ethos. Fourth Road
Development Plan has laid emphasis on the capacity building of various stockholders'
organization
which
among
others
includes
strengthening
of
decision
support
system by way of stronger database development, specialization
of professionals,
re-engineering of organization for sound decision making, synchronization of working
in the organizational set up and development of skilled man power.
11.2
At the turn of Century, the highway sector in India
is facing challenges, not
witnessed at any time in the past. The highway sector is poised for fast development
and
it has already taken quantum jump with regard to availability of funds. Accordingly
physical targets are being set and sought to be achieved with the expectation
of
international standards. All the agencies are aware of challenges ahead. However, the
critical review of capability and capacity of different organizations and agencies reveal
the hard fact that they need capacity building and re-structuring at the organizational
level and enhancing professional capability and skills of individual working
in different
organizations dealing with highway sector.
It
is, therefore, necessary that capabilities
of human resources are enhanced, so that challenges ahead can be faced with
full
preparedness,
it
is to be realized that any organization finally depends for
its growth
and sustenance on those who make up the organization. For this purpose, Human
Resource Development (HRD) has to be given serious consideration and prominent
place in organizational functioning.

CHAPTER
7
HR AND HRD SPECTRUM
1
HRD is Organizational Requirement
In the past the subject of Human Resources Development had always drawn attention
by many philosophers, social scientists and thinkers.
In the recent past, the modern
trend
in HRD has brought out new concepts, which are
unparallel.
It
is therefore,
considered necessary to briefly present latest trends in HRD and HRM so that different
organizations can study and adopt these trends.
2
Human as Resources
2.1
The
notion
of human as resources
for the purpose
of HRD subsumes
three conditions.
First
is 'Employability' that
is need of the people to acquire basic
competencies that are of value in the marketplace as well as within the organization.
It
acknowledges that both individual and organizations have a responsibility to develop
generic competencies. Second
is the demonstration of 'entrepreneurial behavior' by
the organizations and for the individuals to take responsibility for their 'own show' within
an organizational setting. Third, the employees are expected to interact with others
and demonstrate effective 'team work' alongside demonstration of individuality and
'added value' to the organization. In the context of HRD 'Development' means growth,
continuous acquisition and
application
of one's
skill. The concept of Development
of human resource
is,
therefore
in
the context
of organizations
lie
in
harnessing
employee's resource attributes like knowledge,
skill, and attitude by the organizations
for
its own growth and development. The growth and development
of organization
through the development of its human resource in a manner which is both harmonious
and mutually reinforcing
is subject matter of HRD.
In
this way. Human Resources
become central to organization. Today, they have acquired even more central role
in
building sustainable competitive advantage for the organizations as the world moves
towards borderless economies.
3
Defining the HRD
3.1
All the three words namely 'human' 'resource' and
'development' being
generic and broad in assuming their meaning, defining HRD is not an easy task. Most
definitions however recognize the value of human expertise and the responsibility of
utilizing that expertise. At a macro level, HRD as a process or an activity functions as
an agent for societal development.
60



======================================================================
PAGE 71 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
3.2
HRD is both an area of professional practice and an emerging interdisciplinary
body
of knowledge aimed
to meet some
social and organizational
need. HRD
is
about learning and that learning
is something which occurs within an
individual
to
cause development. According to one of the definition, HRD encompasses the study
and
practice of increasing
learning capacity of individuals, groups,
collectives and
organizations through the development and application of learning based interventions
for the purpose of optimizing human and organizational growth and effectiveness. The
HRD thus includes all those activities and process that improves employee's knowledge,
expertise, productivity and satisfaction with a shared belief that such activities or process
will benefit the organization. Such improvement in employees' knowledge, expertise,
productivity and satisfaction
is brought about by learning based interventions. Such
learning experience according to Nadler, should however be conducted
in a definite
time
period
to increase the
possibility of improving job performance and
growth.
Such learning experience must be 'organized' that
is conducted
in a systematic way.
Learning can be incidental or haphazard but organized learning can only be imparted
through a system of training so that learner can attain clear and concise standards of
performance or objectives. Such organized training must be conducted
in a definite
time period that
is the amount of time, the learner will be away from work and must
be determined and specified at the onset of the training programme. Training for the
purpose of understanding HRD, subsumes a planned process which
is undertaken to
modify attitude, knowledge, or skills through learning experience to achieve effective
performance
in an
activity or range of activities.
In other words, through
training,
knowledge is transferred and put to practice. Knowledge
is transformed into learning
experience.
It brings relatively permanent change of knowledge, attitude or behavior.
Unleashing of human expertise through such organized learning and training for the
purpose of improving performance at individual, group and organizational level thus
become the ultimate objective of HRD.
4
Linking People with Organization
There are three main areas with which human resource development
is involved,
namely individual, occupational and organizational development. These
identify the
three major areas in which T&D requirements occur within an organization. At individual
development level HRD covers areas such as skill development, interpersonal skills,
career development etc. T &D needs at group and occupational level covers integrating
cross-functional workers through team building program,
training employees about
new product or services
etc. Such T&D
activities at organization
level may involve
introduction of new culture or way of working. Total Quality Management is one such
intervention at organizational level
in which all groups and individuals are involved.

HRD and HRM Sector
5.1
Both
Human
Resource
Development
(HRD)
and
Human
Resource
Management
(HRM)
deal
with
Human
Resource
(HR)
within
the
context
of
organization's functioning. HRM
is
all about systematically
linking people with the
organization. Management of HR is integrated into strategic decision making process
that directs organizational efforts towards coping with the environment. As a body of
ideas HRM
asserts
critical
relationship
between
environment,
overall
business
strategy
and
human
resource
strategies. HRM
practices
include HR
planning,
recruitment,
selection,
training,
development,
placement,
rewards,
compensation,
retention, career planning, succession
planning, and
evaluation and promotion
of
personnel within organization. Major activities of HR functions include organizational
design, staffing, employees and organizational development, performance appraisal
and management, reward system and benefits, productivity improvement, employer-
employee
relationship,
industrial
relations
and
health
and
safety.
Training
and
development of employees which
is
central focus
of HRD
activities are
positively
related to strategic HRM variables. HRM policies may create an environment which
may encourage or discourage HRD
activities of an organization. Thus, HRD
in an
organization
is an important part of macro-level strategic HRM. Good HRM practices
leads to improved HRD variables as reflected
in increased work motivation by the
employees, initiative, and commitment towards the organization which in consequence
lead
to
improved
efficiency,
productivity and
higher
organizational
performance.
Training and development as a part of HRD are key interventions made
in order to
address skill deficiencies and to add value to human capital. Sound HRD practices thus
emphasize on strategic training system to match skill development for organization's
need, personal development and growth within an organization whereas HRM focuses
on the management aspect of HR as a part of overall strategic management of the
organization.
5.2
The following five areas incorporate elements of both HRD and HRM which
have significant degree of overlap:
i)
Organizational Design: The primary purpose of this area is to integrate
the human
operations,
organizational
structure and system
for the
delivery of products and services in an effective and economic manner.
There are five areas of personnel contributing to organization design,
(a) The operating core; the employees who undertake the delivery of
products and services; (b) The strategic apex; high level managers who
have organizational responsibility;
(c) The middle
line; the managers
who
link the strategic apex and the operating core;
(d) The techno
62

structure;
Subject
specialists
supplying
specialized
services
and
(e) The support
staff; people providing
indirect support for the other
elements of the organization.
ii)
Job
Design:
Each job should
have
a
clear
role
within
the
overall
organizational structure.
If organization
is designed having to require
integrating different roles and work tasks, then job design is the process
of identifying the range and scope of a particular job and the degree of
output from them.
iii)
HR Planning: The main purpose
of
this area
is
to assess
the HR
requirements
of
the
organization.
It
will
also
include
developing
strategies for achieving appropriate staffing level.
iv)
Performance
Management:
Assessment
of
personal
performance
feeds
into
career
development,
compensation
and
promotion,
movement within the organization and sometimes even termination of
employment.
It links performance of an employee with the objectives
of the organization and
is carried out through mechanism of appraisal
system.
v)
Recruiting and Staffing: The
inflow and outflow of people within an
organization is a dynamic process and needs to match the requirement
of the organization within
its operating environment. T&D supports this
process by ensuring that the staff entrusted with the recruitment and
selections have necessary skills to enable them to successfully recruit
and deploy people throughout the organization.

HRD and OD Sector
Organization Development (OD) is the applied behavioral science discipline dedicated
to improving organization and the people
in them through
the use
of theory and
practice of planned change. OD
is a process for teaching people how to solve their
problems, take advantage of opportunities, and learn how to do better and better over
time. OD focuses on issues related to 'human side' of organization by finding ways
to increase the effectiveness of individual, team and organization's human and social
process. Organizational culture processes, and structure captures the essence of OD.
OD programs as a process delineates identifiable flow of interrelated events moving
over time towards the goal of organizational improvement and individual development.
It seeks bring aboutfundamental changes in organization's culture. Important processes
in the organization includes communication, problem solving, and decision making.

HR practices, resource allocation, conflict resolution, allocation of rewards, strategic
management,
exercise
of authority, and
self renewal
or continuous
learning. OD
focuses on improving organizational processes. In short OD programme is to optimize
the system by ensuring that the system elements are harmonious and congruent. OD
thus become an effort which is planned, organization wide and managed from the top to
increase organizational effectiveness and health through planned interventions in the
organization's process using behavioral-science knowledge. Both HRD and OD have
performance improvement as one of the desirable goal or purpose. Many behavioral
theories of OD practices can be gainfully utilized by HRD practitioners for performance
improvement. Transition Theory for example, may inform HRD professionals about
how individual cope with change. Understanding how individual cope with change
may explain why, after change interventions, individual performance often decreases
before
it improves. To workout methodology for HRD,
it
is absolutely necessary to
understand various terms used for HR studies.

IRC:SP:92-2010
HRD TERMINOLOGY AND THEIR LINKAGES
Introduction
Without proper understanding the concepts of HRD terminology lil<e learning, training,
development, knowledge and performance etc. and an informed means of selecting
them, there
is likelihood that stakeholders' may not be able to replicate the results or
develop a deep understanding of results they want to achieve. HRD definitions uses
different concepts depending upon how the HRD
is looked upon by the experts, firms
or organization; whether HRD is located on the locus of an individual
, group, process
, organization, society or on
still bigger entity like humanity as a whole. Nevertheless
most definitions recognize the value
of human expertise and the
responsibility of
utilizing that expertise. Such unleashing of expertise
is for the purpose of improving
performance at individual, group, process, and organization level and such performance
improvement is directed towards organization's intent. The ultimate aim of HRD being
performance improvement, the linkages between various concepts and sub-concepts
can be understood only by locating them
in respect to performance.
In any given learning environment, depending upon the learning
style, a trainee or
learner receives new
inputs which are
first absorbed by
him. He forms concepts
and framework based on
his experience and
tests new situation.
In
this stage he
gains knowledge.
In the next step, learner gets
into a phase of active learning by
'doing' where he manipulates his experience to new situation. He develops
'skills'
in
this phase of learning. These
skills are then reinforced through
'interaction' where
learner shares
his newly acquired
behavior or
skills with
his peer group through
questioning, modeling or discussion. He develops 'depth and insight' into his learning
experience. He becomes trained.
In the next phase learner puts his newly acquired
skills
into
practice
to
deal
with new
situation. He develops new metaphors and
re-frames his experience. He gains wisdom. This newly acquired skills and attitude puts
him on expected level of performance which
is the ultimate objective of any training
and development programmme. Three main component of HRD programmme are
Training, Development and Education. 'Training' component of HRD
is that aspect of
learning which
is meant for the present, 'Education'
is for future and 'Development'
is to lead. Although some organizations club
all learning under 'Training' or Training
and Development,' dividing
it into three distinct categories makes the desired goals
and objects more meaningful and precise. Various terms generally used in the training
65



======================================================================

IRC:SP:92-2010
and development program however needs to be understood properly to enable client,
consultant or contractors to implement T&D program
in their organization which will
be effective and long lasting in transferred knowledge and skills to the trainees. These
are briefly described in this chapter.
2
Learning
2.1
Learning has been defined as a relatively permanent change
in behavioral
potentiality that occurs as a result of reinforced practice. Learning has also been defined
as 'the process by which people acquire new skills or knowledge for the purpose of
enhancing performance'. Learning can be 'incidental' or 'intentional'. Incidental learning
is considered to be learning which occurs during course of doing other things such as
reading, talking with others, traveling, etc. Learning has limited value unless
it
is put
into practice where
it becomes 'intentional'. Learning cannot be guaranteed and that
it is only a possibility of learning which may happen. According to John Ruskin 'What
we know, or what we think,
is in the end of little consequence. The only consequence
is what we do'.
2.2
Learning Domain: Learning can be interpreted
in three ways
(a) To get
to know something which was earlier not known
(b) To learn as
in to memorize by
heart like standard activities drill during emergency situation (c) Learning as a change,
which can be either reinforcement or alteration of certain ideas or behavior. Learning
can be either active or passive. Traditional approach to learning
is based on passive
learning, where teacher
is considered as the expert of subject matter and
pupil
is
seen as the recipient of that expertise. There are generally five domain of learning
(i)
New 'knowledge' where information
is largely memorized,
(ii) Process of organizing
and reorganizing knowledge to create new pattern and
relationship,
(iii) Abilities to
do certain things
like
skills of thinking,
skills of new learning,
skills of coping and
solving problems and survival strategies. (iv) Learning of desired attitude, (v) To carry
out new learning into changed 'ways of behaving' i.e. to attain 'wisdom'. Learning can
be divided
it into three major domains namely Cognitive, Affective and Psychomotor
befitting the learners skills and knowledge background. These three domains are then
divided into other learning processes. They are then plotted with the three main areas
of HRD- training, development, and education as illustrated
in Annex-1
2.3
Learning Style: Each learner has
different style of learning and
to that
extent each leaner is unique. Learning style
is a learner or student's consistent way
of responding to and using stimuli
in the context of learning. A few of them are as
follows:
66



======================================================================
PAGE 77 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
2.3.1
David Kolb's learning style: According to Kolb, the learning cycle involves
four processes that must be present for learning
to occur. They are
(i) Activist-
it
involves
active
experimentation
like
small
group
discussions,
feedback.
In
this,
trainer leave learner to determine his/her own
criteria for the relevance of material,
(ii) Reflector-
It involves reflective observations
like study of journals, brainstorming.
In this process, trainer provides expert interpretation,
(iii) Theorist-
It involves abstract
conceptualization by going through and relating the lectures, papers, analogies to the
learning. Trainer in this approach provides case studies, theory reading for learner to
think and conceptualize the issue, (iv) Pragmatist-
It calls for concrete experience like
laboratory and field observations. Here trainer is a coach and learner is autonomous
learner through observations, peer feedback etc.
2.3.2
VAK learning styles: The VAK learning Style uses the three main sensory
receivers
- Vision, Auditory, and Kinesthetic (movement) to determine the dominant
learning style. Learners use
all three to receive information. However, one or more of
these receiving styles is normally dominant. This dominant style defines the best way
for a person to learn new information by filtering what is to be learned. This style may
not always to be the same for some tasks. The learner may prefer one style of learning
for one task, and a combination of others for another task. As a matter of practice, a
good trainers presents information using
all three styles. This allows
all learners, no
matter what their preferred style
is, and an opportunity to become involved.
It also
allows a learner to be presented with the other two methods of reinforcement. Using
combination of VAK, a learner can be helped to learn even faster as learner has more
than one reinforcing material. Some hints for recognizing and implementing the three
styles are (a) Auditory learners often talk to themselves. They also may move their
lips and read out loud. They may have difficulty with reading and writing tasks. They
often do better talking to a colleague or a tape recorder and hearing what was said.
To integrate this style into the learning environment
it
is suggested to
(i) Begin new
material with a brief explanation of what
is coming and conclude with a summary of
what has been covered. Open up the lecture session by questioning learners to draw
as much information from them as possible and then
fill in the gaps by the trainer using
his own expertise. (iii) Include auditory activities, such as brainstorming, questioning
and answering among
learners. (iv) Leave
plenty of time
to debrief
activities. This
allows learners to make connections of what they have learned and how
it applies to
their situation, (v) Have the learners verbalize the questions,
(vi) Develop an internal
dialogue between trainer and the learners, (b) Visual learners have two sub-channels
- linguistic and spatial. Learners who are visual-linguistic, they
like to learn through
written language, such as reading and writing tasks. They remember what has been
written down, even
if they do not read
it more than once. They
like to write down
67



======================================================================
PAGE 78 of 192
======================================================================
iRC:SP:92-2010
directions and pay better attention to lectures
if tlney watch them. Learners who are
visual-spatial usually have difficulty with written language and do better with charts,
demonstrations, videos, and other visual
materials. To
integrate
this
style
into the
learning environment
it
is suggested to
(i) Use graphs, charts,
illustrations, or other
visual aids,
(ii) Include outlines, agendas, handouts, etc. for reading and taking notes,
(iii) Include plenty of contentin handouts for re-reading by the learners afterthe learning
session. (iv) Leave margin space
in handouts for note taking,
(v)
Invite questions to
help them stay alert
in auditory environments,
(vi) Emphasize key points to suggest
when
to takes notes,
(vii) Eliminate
potential distractions,
(viii) Supplement textual
information with illustrations whenever possible, (ix) Show diagrams and then explain
them, (c) Kinesthetic learners do best while touching and moving.
It also has two sub-
channels - kinesthetic (movement) and tactile (touch).They tend to lose concentration
if there is
little or no external stimulation or movement. When listening to lectures they
may want to take notes. When reading, they like to scan the material
first, and then
focus in on the details. They typically use color highlighters and take notes by drawing
pictures, diagrams, or doodling. To integrate this style into the learning environment,
it
is suggested to
(i) Use activities that get the learners up and moving,
(ii) Use colored
markers to emphasize key points on white boards,
(iii) Give frequent stretch breaks
(brain
breaks),
(iv) Give
learners something
to do
with
their hands,
(vii)
Provide
highlighters, colored pens and/or pencils,
(ix) Guide learners through a visualization
of complex tasks, (x) Have them transfer information from the text to another medium
such as a keyboard or a tablet.
2.3.3
Multiple
intelligences
learning
style:
There
are
multiple
intelligences,
and that one uses for the most effective learning. According to this theory 'multiple
intelligences' include the following:
(i) Verbal Linguistic intelligence (sensitive to the
meaning and order of words as
in a
poet).
It uses
activities that involve
hearing,
listening, impromptu or formal speaking, tongue twisters, humor, oral or silent reading,
documentation, creative writing, spelling, journal, poetry etc.(ii) Logical-mathematical
intelligence (ability to handle chains of reasoning and recognize patterns and orders
as
in a scientist).
It uses activities that involve abstract symbols/formulas, outlining,
graphic
organizers,
numeric sequences,
calculation,
etc.
(iii)
Musical
intelligence
(sensitivity to pitch, melody, rhythm, and tone as in a composer).
It uses activities that
involve audio tape, music recitals, singing on key, environmental sounds, percussion
vibrations, music composition, etc. (iv) Spatial intelligence (ability to perceive the world
accurately and tries to re-create or transform aspects of that world as
in a sculptor,
painter, or architect). It uses activities that involve
art,
pictures, sculpture, drawings,
doodling,
mind
mapping,
patterns/designs,
color
schemes,
active
imagination,
imagery, block building etc.
(v) Bodily Kinesthetic intelligence (ability to use the body
68



======================================================================
PAGE 79 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
skillfully and handle objects
adroitly, as
in an
athlete or dancer).
It uses
activities
that involve role playing, physical gestures, drama, inventing, physical exercise, body
language etc. (vi) Interpersonal intelligence (understanding people and relationship as
in a salesman or teacher). Using this intelligence learners think by bouncing ideas off
to each other.
It uses activities that involve group projects, division of labor, sensing
others' motives, receiving/giving feedback, collaboration
skills
etc.(vii) Intrapersonal
intelligence (possessing access
to one's emotional
life as a means
to understand
oneself and others and exhibited by individuals with accurate views of themselves).
It uses activities that involve emotional processing, silent reflection methods, thinking
strategies, concentration
skills,
higher order reasoning,
meta-cognitive techniques
etc.
(viii) Naturalist (ability to connect to the intricacies and subtleties
in nature such
as Charles Darwin, Isaac Newton).
It uses activities that involve bringing the outdoors
into the class,
relating
to the
natural world,
charting, mapping changes, observing
wildlife, documenting star's movements, keeping journals or logs.
3
Training
3.1
Training is the acquisition of technology which permits employee to perform
their present job to standards. Training
is 'that organized process which
is concerned
with the acquisition ofcapabilityorthe maintenance of capability'.
It improves employee's
performance on the job in hand. Training
is also imparted for equipping the employee
to
handle new
machineries,
technologies
or processes. A
person's
performance
is improved by showing him how to master a new or established technology. The
technology may be a piece of heavy machinery, a computer, a procedure for creating
a product, or a method of providing a service.
It will be seen that as per the definition,
training is provided for the present job. This includes training new personnel to perform
their job, introducing a new technology, or bringing an employee up to standards.
In
any system, there are four inputs namely: people,
material, technology, and
time.
Output of such a system can be a product or service. Training
is mainly concerned
with the meeting of two of these inputs -- people and technology where people uses
technology to transform the material input into a tangible output in certain prescribed
fashion.
4
Development
4.1
Development means growth, continuous acquisition and application of one's
skill. Development thus becomes a part of lifelong learning experience. Continuous
acquisition of new viewpoints, new horizon and technologies makes the employee
proactive rather than reactive.
It enables the employee to create better product and
faster services. Unlike training and education, development cannot always be
fully
69



======================================================================
PAGE 80 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
evaluated since development is learning for growth of the individual and not related to
any present or future job. Development being associated with the creativity, innovation
and application of skills,
it is one of the prime mover of providing competitive edge to the
organization.
It is in the forefront of what many now call the 'Learning Organization'.
4.2
Development
involves
changes
in
an
organism
that
are
systematic,
organized, successive and are thought to serve an adaptive function. Training on
the other hand makes the organization more effective and efficient in
its day- to- day
operations. Development
is different from 'change' which refers to alterations that
occur over a period of time in learner's internal cogitative or affective characteristics.
This
change may
be
quantitative
or
qualitative,
and
implies
no
directionality,
encompassing both
regression and progression. Unlike training, which can be fully
measured, development cannot always be
fully evaluated due
to the complexity
of the
skills received and used. Good development programs however affect an
organization's climate and
culture, which can give an organization a competitive
edge. Due
to vagueness
of data, development program
requires
lot
of
skill and
innovative approach by the trainers. The measurement of these programs
is often
attitude
surveys
which
are
performed
before
and
after
implementation.
Since
attitudes often change on a day-to-day basis, several surveys have to be performed
throughout a given period.
5
Education
5.1
Education is training people to do different jobs or to increase their potential.
Unlike
training which can be
fully evaluated
after the
training program, complete
evaluation of education is possible only after the learners use the education generated
potential on their new assignment. Effectiveness of education
is generally reflected in
the efficient performance of new assignment or job. Education is transfer of knowledge
to the learner to enable them to take up new assignments.
It
is often given to people
who have been identified as being considered for a new job either lateral or upwards,
or to increase their potential.
6
Knowledge
6.1
Knowledge is the perception of the agreement or disagreement of two ideas.
It is a fluid mix of framed experience, contextual information, values and expert insight
that provides a framework
for evaluating and
incorporating new experiences and
information. The role of knowledge
in generating appropriate actions
is that
it serves
as a background for articulating possible courses of action (articulation), forjudging
whether courses of action will yield the intended result and for using this judgment in
70



======================================================================
PAGE 81 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
selecting among them (selection), for deciding how actions should be implemented
and for actually implementing actions (implementation).
6.2
Explicit and Implicit Knowledge: There are two types of knowledge (a)
Explicit knowledge:
It
is the type of knowledge that can be transformed
into formal
language,
including
grammatical
statements
(words and
numbers),
mathematical
expressions, specifications, manuals, etc. Explicit knowledge can be readily transmitted
to others and also
can easily be processed by a computer, transmitted electronically,
or stored
in databases.
Explicit knowledge can be
'rationalized knowledge' which
is
general,
context independent,
standardized,
public and
readily sharable
in
the
organizational
environment
like
knowledge
of engineering
design
manual
which
is freely available and can be shared
in the organization or
it can be 'embedded
knowledge', which
is context dependent, narrowly applicable, personalized and may
be personally or professionally sensitive and not easily sharable among the individuals,
(b) Tacit knowledge: As word suggests
it
is the knowledge which
is embedded
in
individual
experience
and
involves
intangible
factors,
such
as
personal
beliefs,
perspective, and the value system. Tacit knowledge tends to be sticky in nature and
therefore requires incremental expenditure
in moving knowledge
in
a form
that
is
useable and
easily understood by the information seeker.
Tacit knowledge
is thus
hard to articulate with formal language.
It contains subjective insights,
intuitions and
hunches. Before
tacit knowledge can be communicated,
it must be converted
into
words, models, or numbers that can be understood. There are two dimensions
to
tacit knowledge
(i) Technical Dimension or Procedural: This encompasses the kind of
informal
skills often captured
in the term know-how. Highly subjective and personal
insights,
intuitions hunches and inspirations derived from bodily experience
fall
into
this dimension,
(ii) Cognitive Dimension: This consists of beliefs, perceptions, ideals,
values, emotions and mental models so ingrained that they are taken
for granted.
Though they cannot be
articulated very
easily,
this dimension
of
tacit knowledge
shapes the way one perceives the world around him.
6.3
Knowledge Conversion: There are four modes of knowledge creation or
conversion that are derived from the above mentioned two kinds of knowledge
(i)
Socialization:
It
is transfer from
tacit to tacit and includes socialization process
like
observation,
imitation, and
practice,
(ii)
Internalization:
It
is transfer from
explicit to
tacit and includes activities of internalization
like 'learning by doing' or visualization,
(iii) Externalization:
It is transfer from tacit to explicit and includes process of transfer
using metaphor,
simile, models
etc.
(iv) Combination:
It
is transfer from
explicit to
explicit and involves process of systemizing concepts into a knowledge system through
media, such as documents, meetings, and conversations. Information
is reconfigured
71



======================================================================
PAGE 82 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
by such means as sorting, combining, and categorizing. Formal education and many
training programs work using combination.
7
Understanding Continuum
7.1
Understanding
is a cognitive process which transforms the data, and other
sensory inputs,
into higher level of value added output
like information, knowledge
and wisdom. Without understanding there cannot be any knowledge generation. One
gains knowledge through context (experiences) and understanding. When one has
context, one can weave the various relationships of the experiences. The greater one
understands the subject matter, the more one
is able to weave past the experiences
(context) into new knowledge by absorbing, doing, interacting, and reflecting.
7.2
in
this
continuum-data,
information,
knowledge
and
wisdom
can
be
considered as a pyramid.
In
this pyramid, base
is data which consists of images,
sound,
digital
transmission
etc. They however have
little
value
unless
they
are
interpreted by structuring, filtering or summarizing and converting them into some kind
of information. Information so generated then becomes contextualized which can be
transmitted or presented through media like lecture, text or internet. This information
when operated upon by the individual using
his experience and processed through
absorbing, doing, interacting and reflecting, is transformed into knowledge. Knowledge
has the complexity of experience, which come about by seeing the information from
different perspectives. The reason knowledge emphasizes on personal interpretation
and understanding, training and education become difficult. One cannot count on one
person's knowledge transferring to another. Knowledge
is
built from scratch by the
learner through experience. Information
is static, but knowledge is dynamic as
it lives
within a person.
7.3
Information
is 'flow of messages' whereas knowledge
is created when this
flow of messages interact with the 'beliefs and commitment of
its holders'. Wisdom
is located
at the apex of pyramid. When knowledge
is combined with
intuition and
experience
it
is often called wisdom. One of the outstanding examples to
illustrate
understanding continuum
is the work of Tycho, Kepler and Isaac Newton
in the field
of science. Tycho, using his telescope, provided clear, well defined observational data
especially of celestial movement of Mars. Tycho provided the first step of data based
on accurate observations. Kepler took the second step of re- arranging the data and
created sense out of these data. In the third step Kepler created order out of enormous
volume of data by laying down three simple laws of planetary movements which were
easy to understand. The knowledge input from Kepler was further extended and given
a universal dimension by Isaac Newton who explained that three simple laws of Kepler
72

IRC:SP:92-2010
were merely offshoot of a more fundamental inverse square law. Wisdom of Newton
converted laws of planetary movement into the universal law of gravitation.
8
Performance
8.1
Performance
is focused behavior or purposeful work.
In other words, jobs
exist to achieve specific and defined results (outputs) and people are employed so
that organizations can achieve those
results. This
is performed by accomplishing
tasks. Performance has two aspects - behavior being the means and
its consequence
being the end. Managing performance has the dual purpose of (a) arranging situations
(environment) so that employees can do their best and
(b) growing the employees
by educating, enlightening, and appreciating them.
Its purpose
is to achieve specific
and defined results from people so that the organization can achieve
its goals and
objectives.
It
is much easier to
fix situations by making
structural changes
to the
organization by adopting strategies
like changing reporting
relationships, enlarging
the job, improving a process, or opening lines of communication.
It
is however much
difficult trying
to change people which has
to be brought about through complex
interplay of many behavioral concepts. An emphasis on the performance improvement
is critical to the credible practice of HRD as there is increasing demand in organization
for high performance. The increasing demand of performance outcomes requires that
areas of HRD practice should develop principles and models based on performance
to prevent trial-and-error application. Once performance barriers have been removed,
employees can be educated, enlightened, and appreciated. This assumption
is based
on the premise that most employees try to do their best. They prefer harmony over
conflict, action over inaction, and productivity over delays.
8.2
Performance Gaps: A performance gap is the behavioral area not performed
to standards when measuring task performance. Some performance gaps are quite
easy to measure. For example,
if the acceptable performance
is that Schedule of
quantities for the tender should be prepared
in one week and
it takes two weeks then
there
is a performance gap.
If the quantity surveyor could not work out the quantity
calculations then
it
is training problem. But
if the quantity surveyor knows the job but
did not do
it, then
it is some other type of performance problem besides training. Some
of the more difficult tasks are to train and measure which are called 'soft skills', which
include the
affective domain such as
feelings,
values,
appreciation, enthusiasms,
motivations, and attitudes. These traits are not observable therefore, a representative
behavior must be measured. For example, we cannot tell
if a worker is well motivated
by looking at him, but we can observe some representative behaviors, such as being
on time, working well with others, performing tasks to standards, etc.

8.3
Measuring Performance Gaps. In a performance analysis, subtracting the
present job performance behavior (B) from the standards (S) gives performance gap
(G) and
is S-B. This measurement, S -B, becomes the span that must be bridged
in
order to reach the objective. Once the performance gap
is found to exist, then this
gap
is to be fitted
in various levels of organization by doing 'performance analyses'.
Need analysis at organizational, occupational and individual level which
will informs
the action to be taken at different levels of organization and corresponding evaluation
at different levels for checking the effectiveness of action taken.
8.4
Performance Improvement (PI): Performance improvement intervention
can be at three levels i.e. at organization level, process level, or at performer level.
In
this three level framework, performance improvement has three component namely
goals, design and management. These three components operate
at organization
(goal), process(design) and individual levels(management) generating a matrix of 9
cells. At organizational
level. Performance Improvement interventions can be
in the
form of 'organization goals' which are strategic
in nature and
include product and
services, market (customer), competitive advantage, and
priorities or
in the form of
'organization design' that looks at the flows among major groups of the organization
rather than activities or in the form of 'organization management' which is conducted by
managing goals and sub-goals, managing performance, managing Resource (people,
equipment, and
capital) and managing
interface
(transition space between various
functions or business
units). At
Process
level. Performance Improvement aims
at
improving series of steps designed to produce a product or service.
It should be seen
as a value chain, that is, each step in the process should add value to the proceeding
steps. Output minus input of any system
is the process value addition. Process level
is considered the pivotal
link between organization and individual performance. This
level usually offers the greatest opportunity for improvement. Outstanding employees
cannot improve their performance levels
if poor processes are in place. Performance
Improvement
Interventions
at
process
level
will
cover
'Process
goals'
which
is
setting goals
for each
process
activity and
will be
derived from
the
organization
goals,
customer
requirements,
and
benchmarking
information;
'Process
design'
which
is designing the process structure along a
logical and streamlined
path; and
'process management' which
is managing the process goals and sub-goals through
performance management. At Job/Performer Level, goals need to be directed towards
process contributions by
individual.
If capable, well-trained people are placed
in a
setting with clear expectations, minimal task interference, reinforcing consequences,
and appropriate feedback; then they will be motivated. People make processes work
and therefore their Job design looks at factors like ergonomics, sequence of activities,
job procedures and allocations of responsibilities.

8.5
Performance Typology. Performance typology indicates the relationship
between various facts, concepts, process and procedures which affect the observable
behavior or performance. Performance improvement being the ultimate objective of
T&D activity,
it is essential to address various factors which contributes to the process
of learning
leading
to desired
level
of performance. Various concepts used
in the
typology are explained briefly in alphabetical order.
PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT
Performance Typology
a)
Abilities:
Abilities
are
general
human
capacities
related
to
the
performance of tasks. They develop over time through the interaction
of heredity and experience, and are long lasting. The main difference
between
a
'competency' and
'ability'
is
that competencies
require
continuing education opportunities to maintain and they may disappear
over time
if not used. While abilities may also 'grow' over time but they
are more permanent in nature.
75



======================================================================
PAGE 86 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
b)
Arousal:
Arousal
level
can
be
thought
of as how much
capacity
is available
for one
to work with. The concept of arousal
is closely
related to other concepts such as anxiety, attention, agitation, stress,
and
motivation. According
to
'Yerkes-Dodson
law'
there
exists an
inverted U-shaped function between arousal (x-axis) and performance
(y-axis). A certain amount of arousal can be a motivator toward change
or learning. But too much or too
little of arousal
will work against the
learner. Some mid-level point of arousal provides maximum motivation
to change (learn). Too
little arousal has an inert affect on the learner,
while too much has a hyper affect. There are optimal levels of arousal
for each task to be learned. For kinesthetic tasks involving standard
drill of activities demanding endurance and persistence like
in military
training, high level of arousal yields better result. But in cognitive tasks
like solving a mathematical problem, lower level of arousal will be more
effective.
c)
Behavior. Behavior is the manner in which a thing acts under specified
conditions or circumstances or in relationship to other things. Behavior
is the outcome of an internal struggle among many mental models that
are defined by other people's behavior.
d)
Attitude: A person may have the competency to perform a task, that
does not mean he or she will have the desire (attitude) to do so correctly.
In other words, competencies give
ability to perform, while attitudes
give desire
to perform. Attitude
involves measuring
people,
issues,
objects, etc. along a dimension ranging from positive to negative. This
"measurement" has two components
(a) cognitive and
(b)
affective.
Beliefs and values of a person combined with his cognitive components
(affective
and
cognitive)
supply
him
his
long
range
or
persistent
measurements for dealing with the world. Attitude quite often changes
with various events
in a person's
life. These emotional changes also
vary in length of time.
It may be noted that attitude subsumes a variety
of 'self concepts,' such as values, feelings, emotions, motivations, etc.
The acquiring of new SKAs through a system of T&D thus involves
acquiring of new values, feelings, emotions and motivation.
e)
Attitude change performance
interventions:
There
are
three
main
methods used for changing attitudes
in performance interventions (a)
Intavation Exposure
Effect- This technique uses
imparting
'positive
experience' by exposing a person
to a concept,
object, or person a
76



======================================================================
PAGE 87 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
number
of times
for
his
desired
attitude
formation.
For example,
exposing a person to timely attendance
in office by his peer group
is
likely to supply him positive experience and without any verbal direction
he may start attending office in time, (b) Reinforcement- This concept is
based upon 'classical conditioning' and 'operant conditioning'. Classical
conditioning is involuntary reflexes, while operant conditioning is based
upon voluntary behavior. For example, making lecture hall well lighted,
attractive
and
non-threatening
is
classical
conditioning.
Operant
conditioning
is based upon the premise that people repeat a behavior
that gives desirable results, for example, saying a few good words or
patting every time a good job is done is more likely result in a desirable
behavior, (c) Persuasive Communication- This technique uses multiple
reinforcement of designed concepts, images
etc.
like
in
advertising
industry for bringing about desired attitude change. The advertisement
industry is based upon this technique to persuade people through both
their cognitive and emotional sides to buy their product.
Belief: Beliefs are assumptions or convictions that a person holds to
be true regarding people, concepts, or things. Values and beliefs are
the
internal force whereas norms, both formal and
informal are the
external force which guides the conduct of the people. The value and
belief system gives a person his world view and power of knowledge.
Competencies: Competence is the state or quality of being adequately
or qualified
to perform a
task. A person gains competency through
education,
training,
experience,
or
natural
abilities.
Competency
has two components
(a) they are observable
or measurable
skills,
knowledge, and
abilities (SKAs)
(b) They must distinguish between
superior performers from the other performers.
In the traditional job-
based organizations, the organization design
is
built around the job
structure. The performance management of such organizations focuses
on job analysis to
identify job-related tasks, which are then used
to
identify a list of SKAs that are required for successful job performance.
In the competency-based models, 'performance indicators' of 'expert
performers' are developed to produce a
list of grouped competencies,
related to effective or superior performance. In this model,
it is not SKAs
which are believed as required for performing a job (as
in job- based
model) but which SKAs do superior performers in a job possess and use.
There are four level of competencies, (a) Unconscious incompetence-
77



======================================================================
PAGE 88 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
organization, group or individual not knowing what they do not know (b)
Conscious incompetence- finding in a learning process something which
one does not know (c
) Conscious competence- acquiring knowledge
and skills through learning and training (d) Unconscious competence-
total absorption of skills as to make action almost involuntary.
h)
Culture: Culture is what sets people free from their nature. Culture may
be high art, discernment and taste or ritual, tradition and ethnicity.
i)
Engagement: When 'engaged', employees utilize their natural talents.
They provide an instant and constant competitive edge. Engagement
reflects loyalty, productivity and employee's psychological commitment
to their roles. There are four levels of engagement (a) Physical energy
- engaging the body
(b) Emotional energy
- engaging the heart
(c)
Mental energy - engaging the mind (d) Spiritual energy
- engaging the
spirit. When the employee's values and beliefs are aligned with those
of the organization, they are said to become 'engaged'.
j)
Environment: Environment is an envelop or surrounding encompassing
the process or activities. There are two types of environment, 'Internal'
and
'external'.
Internal environment
is the surrounding area
in which
the front line (employees) performs their work.
It includes ergonomics
(design
of work
area),
processes,
equipment,
and
the
immediate
surrounding structure. Organization's output which can be products or
services
is then delivered
to 'receiving system' or market place. The
receiving system of organization's output is 'external environment'.
k)
Emotional intelligence
(El): Emotional Intelligence (El)
is the
'abilities
such as
being
able
to
motivate oneself and
persist
in
the face
of
frustrations;
to
control
impulse and
delay
gratification;
to
regulate
one's moods and keep distress from swamping the
ability
to
think.
El has three aspects of human nature (a) A general quality of human
beings possessed by every normal person (b) A quantitative spectrum
of individual differences
in which they can be ranked and ordered
(c)
A qualitative, fine-grained account
in which there
is no comparisons
between people.
In the performance typology
it is the aspect (b) of El
i.e. as quantitative spectrum of individual differences which
is used for
the purpose of emotional management in the organizational set up for
achieving the desired performance.
I)
Experience: Experience
is looking at the present through a rear-view
78



======================================================================
PAGE 89 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
mirror and marching backwards
into the
future.
In the performance
typology,
experience
is
learning
by
doing
which
converts
explicit
knowledge into tacit knowledge.
)
Feeling: Feeling
in essence,
is an idea that resides within a person.
It
is
thought to be a mapping of a particular body state by the mind
in
which a mental image (map)
is formed. This 'mapping' of the body
is
composed of sensory feelings, called 'affects' that are directly evoked
by specific inputs from the internal self and/or external environment.
They include such evaluative experiences as hunger,
thirst, pain, and
sweetness. Feelings are not neutral, but rather hedonic in that they are
either positive or negative, such as pleasantness or unpleasantness.
Unlike emotions, such as pride or anger, they occur in the absence of
any complex cognitive processes.
Intention: Intention
is a person's aspiration to her or his goals.
It
is a
purposeful
activity
in specified
direction. The forming of an
intention
seems to imply a free will and the ability to choose. A person normally
has a strong
will
to self-actualize what he wants
to become. Thus,
intentions
for him become
the
purposeful
activities
that
his
visions
create. Intention has cognitive application.
Motivation: Motivation is the combination of a person's desire and energy
for achieving a goal. Motivation
is the internal process that activates,
guides and maintains behavior.
It
is the cause of action.
Influencing
people's motivation means getting them to want to do what is thought
as must be done. Motivation can be 'intrinsic' like satisfaction, feelings
of achievement; or 'extrinsic' like rewards, punishment, or achieving the
goal. Carl Rogers has stressed that people have natural desire to learn
and the teacher's role should be one of encouraging and supporting
the learner to learn. According to Rogers, motivation for learning comes
from within. Maslow developed a hierarchy of needs that range from
biological
to psychological. Though Rogers and Maslow considered
that motivation
is
intrinsic,
it may be seen
that
motivation
is
quite
often goal centered and changes according to nearness of the goal.
It is therefore important that tutor/trainer should ensure that both short
and long term goals are given and achieved by suitable motivational
inputs. There are many motivational theories like Achievement Theory,
Activation
Theory,
Attribution
Theory,
Cognitive
Evaluation
Theory,
Control Theory, Drive Theory, Equity Theory, ERG Theory, Expectancy
79



======================================================================
PAGE 90 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
Theory, Hygiene Theory, Reinforcement Theory to name a few. Each
theory lays emphasis on one or more aspect of psychological factors
contributing to motivational behavior.
p)
Result: Result or impact of performance intervention are achieved by
closing performance gaps, developing employees
to achieve
better
results,
improving
process, and removing performance
blocks. The
objective of most performance interventions can be stated
in terms of
results or impacts, such as improved efficiency, reduced costs, or better
quality. Performance improvement and impact operate symbiotically
or
in
other words have reverse
causality.
Impacts
also have been
found to influence people's behavior and cause them to perform since
people tend to continue behaviors that are perceived to be excellently
effective. This two way flow is about state of consciousness where the
performers are totally focused, energized, and confident.
q)
Skill:
Skill can be defined as an expertise developed
in the course of
training and experience.
Skill includes not only trade and
craft skills
acquired
by
apprenticeship,
but
high-grade
performance
in many
fields, such as professional
practice, the
arts, games, and
athletics.
Skill requires that the performer has to match the demand of the task.
This
is accomplished by applying a
'strategy' of performance. This
strategy can be seen
in the improvisation done by the craftsman
in
the T&P used by him
to meet the requirements of the task. These
strategies
are
not normally concerned
with
a
single
response,
but
rather with
chains
or programs
of action
to
obtain
a
result. Some
strategies are more efficient than others. Skill consists of choosing and
implementing the most efficient strategies. There are three main parts
to a
skill
(a) Perception of object or events
- perceiving
all
relevant
factors to decide how best the job can be done, (b) Choice of response
1
- making a decision for adopting certain way for the execution of job
(c) Execution of the choice made
- requiring motor coordination and
timing. According to Peter Drucker 'skill can not be explained in words,
it can only be demonstrated. Thus the only way to learn a skill is through
apprenticeship and experience'. Apart from job execution skill, there
is
another kind of skill called 'social
skill' which includes the perception
of needs and desires of others, and of one's effect upon others.
It
is
similar to El and social pressure.
80

IRC:SP:92-2010
Skill gaps: The required performance minus the present performance
equals
skill gap. A
'skill gap analysis' compares the performers
skills
with the skills required for the job in order to identify future performance
improvement opportunities.
Talent Talent
is a special
ability that amplifies
skills and
ability of a
person in performing the given task.
Values: Values are the ideas about the worth or importance of things,
concepts, and
people. They come from
a
person's
beliefs system.
Values are one of the components of attitude. Values help to weigh
the importance
of various
alternatives. They drive
all organizational
and individual efforts.
In an organization,
it is often the value system of
the top management which is assimilated by the employees and made
employee's value system.

CHAPTER 9
IDENTIFICATION OF LEARNING, TRAINING
AND DEVELOPMENT NEEDS
1
Learning, Training and Development
1 .1
Identification of training and development needs: In present days emphasis
is on leaner organization winere tighter focus upon individual contribution has made
the identification of training and development needs a critical element in determining
the organization's success. Training
is important but question
is, what kind of training
and to what level of details? The answer to these questions are sought by conducting
Learning Needs Analysis (LNA) and Training Needs Analysis (TNA). There are three
levels of training needs within an organization namely organizational, occupational
and
individual.
Organizational
level
analysis addresses
to
training
implications
of
new product, new technology, new process
level, new legislation, new procedures
and standards, new market/customer etc. At occupational
level, training needs are
determined by conducting job analysis for which many methods have been evolved by
different professionals. At individual level, training analysis is directed towards bridging
the gap between current level of performance and desired level of performance. The
analysis phase conceptualizes the overall gamut of training program by analyzing
the system to gain complete understanding of
it.
It provides understanding of tasks
associated with each job to decide upon the tasks which are required to be trained.
By building performance measures for the task performance, analysis phase helps
determine as to who must be trained and
in what manner. Instructional setting of the
training
is also decided
in this phase. The product of this phase
is the foundation for
all subsequent development activities. One of the important activities of this phase
is
preparation of Task Inventories' which can be prepared by the training department or
obtained from other departments within the organization. Study of literature should be
the first step in any analysis to prevent redundant work from being performed.
1.2
Training Needs Analysis: The analysis phase
is often called a 'Front-End
Analysis' because
it
is
in this phase, that the task of training needs identification or
problem
identification
is performed. For this purpose, following
actions are taken:
(a)Overview of system or process to gain understanding
(if needed);
(b) Analyzing
the system; (c) Discovering Training Needs; (d) Compiling Task Inventory
(if needed);
(e) Analyzing the task;
(f) Needs analysis;
(g) Templating;
(h) Document analysis;
(i) Building Performance measures; (j) Selecting instructional setting and (k) Estimating
training cost. These steps are discussed briefly in this chapter.
82



======================================================================
PAGE 93 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
1.3
Overview of the System or Process
to Gain Understanding: Where
training department
is an
integral
part
of the
organization
or where
the
training
department
is conversant with the organization structure, processes and culture of
the organizations, then some of the steps as thought
fit by the training managers
may be skipped.
It is the familiarity with the clients which will determine the scope of
system overview that will need to be performed.
In case the organization
is facing a
performance problem, then
it
is preferred to review pertinent part of the system
to
properly understand the job and task requirements being performed
in that system.
Estimation of training cost may be required
for demanding training budget and for
charging training cost when training
is rendered to other organization or department
on cost.
2
Analyzing the System
2.1
Needs of Client: Many a times
training programs
fail
to achieve
their
objective because the needs of the client are not properly understood. The
purpose
of this activity
is to aid
in the decision making process by defining
all the elements,
issues, facts and features taking place in the client's system or process. The information
gathered
in this step provides a basic background for training managers, developers,
consultants etc. This step allows the training activity to understand the technical, non-
technical, political, social, and cultural aspects of the client's system. Primarily,
it is an
information gathering technique to provide a solid background for anyone involved
in
the training process. This phase also allows the client to understand the training activity
and
its purpose. Analysis phase helps client understand their organizational process
from the perspective of training managers. Besides introducing training
activity the
clients will be able to perceive system differently compared to what they themselves
helped to define.
2.2
Process Analysis: A process
is a planned series of actions that advances
a material or procedure from one stage of completion to the next. They are identifiable
flow
of
interrelated events moving over time towards the goals
of organizational
improvement and individual development. A process starts with a trigger that causes
a specific action to be taken by a person, another process, or work group. The ending
of process occurs when the results get passed on to another person, process, or work
group.
In the analysis phase, performance of task needs to be fully understood as to
'what kind of task is processed in which manner' to build performance measures which
are sought to be attained through training. Knowing the basics of a system enables
the professionals
in the training department to better understand the tasks that lay
ahead. Although in the analysis phase, systems and processes specific to training are
looked in to for understanding their purpose and goals, the main emphasis of this initial
83



======================================================================
PAGE 94 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
research should be on the people within the system. As much as possible information
about potential learners should be gathered. The target population data
is essential
and most useful when making decisions about the proposed learning program. People
in the organization being the one who process the task, they constitute the biggest
variable in a training program.
2.3
Listed below are some of the aspects which need to be looked into
in the
initial work:
i)
Anticipated number of learners;
ii)
Location of learners;
iii)
Education and experience of the learners;
iv)
Background of learners;
v)
Experience in present or related jobs;
vi)
Job performance requirements versus present skill levels;
vii)
Language or cultural differences of learners
;
viii)
Motivation of learners;
ix)
Physical or mental characteristics of learners and
x)
Specific interests or biases of learners.
The information gathered should be sufficient to provide 'big picture' of the system and
the people who work in
it, to one who may not be familiar with the system.
3
Discovering Training Needs
3.1
There are two main methods to discover training needs. The first method
takes the proactive approach. This
is when a training analyst goes into the system or
process and searches for problems or potential problems. The goal
is to make the
system more
efficient and to prevent future problems from occurring. When a new
employee
is recruited
his SKAs are known, and the SKAs which
will be expected
from him for efficient job performance is also known. The second method
is when the
organization, department or a wing of the organization asks the training department
for
help
in
fixing
a
problem. These problems
are
usually caused
by new
hires,
promotions, transfers,
appraisals,
rapid expansion, changes, or the
introduction
of
new technologies.
In such cases, first, the problem
is investigated. Investigation may
84



======================================================================
PAGE 95 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
indicate that a training need exists wlien an employee
lacl<s the knowledge or
skill
to perform an assigned task satisfactorily.
In other words, training need exists when
there is a variation between what the employee is expected to do on the job and what
the actual job performance
is. To decide
if training
is the answer, one basic question
needs to be asked, 'Does the employee know how to meet the required performance
standards for an accountable task?'
If the answer
is "No," then training
is needed.
If
the answer is "Yes" then another action, besides training,
is needed. The answer 'Yes'
should be, however validated by further related queries. Where
it is felt that training
is
not required, then some other actions like counseling, job re-design, or organizational
development can be initiated. Often, the employee does not perform to standards due
to time factors, working conditions, or a misunderstanding of the required standards.
Management must recognize and consider other factors which impact performance
that may not be corrected with training. Factors such as quality of procedures, human
factors, management style, and the work environment also affect performance. These
factors may be required to be suitably addressed using behavioral science theories.
3.2
Some questions that might be asked to determine training needs are:
i)
What are the employees doing that they shouldn't be doing?
ii)
What specific things would be expected from the employees that they
should do, but they don't do?
iii)
When we envision employees performing their job properly, what do
we envision them doing?
iv)
What prevents the employee from performing
a
prescribed task
to
standards?
v)
Are job aids available and
if so, are they accurate? Are they being
used?
vi)
Are the standards reasonable?
If not, why?
vii)
If the employee could change one thing
in the task he performs then,
what would
it be?
viii) What subject would we like to see the employee/ workers trained on?
ix)
What new technology would benefit the employee/worker the most,
in

The data gathered must accurately reflect the specific tasks now being performed.
The information gathered will be used as the basis to select the tasks that need to be
trained.

Compilation of Task Inventory
4.1
Compilation
of Task
Inventory
includes
compilation
of
a
Job
list,
Job
descriptions, and task inventory for each job which may not be normally performed
every time one researches a performance problem. But they are essential to anyone
involved
in HRD, management, or performance as they set the standards for how a
job
is to be performed.
If the job and task inventories have already been compiled,
then
it should be reviewed and updated before moving on
to the task analysis or
needs analysis.
4.2
Job
List: A job
list
is a compilation
of
all job
titles associated with the
system. Jobs are collection of tasks and responsibilities. A job is generally associated
with the employee's
title. Wireman, supervisor, surveyor, design engineer, quantity
survey are jobs. A job consists of responsibilities, duties, and tasks that are defined
in organization manual and can be accomplished, measured, and rated.
It is used as
an employment tool for classifying work and for selecting employees.
4.3
Job Description. After listing the jobs, a job description
is then obtained
by performing
a job
analysis. Job
analysis
is the process
of breaking down
the
complexity of a person's job into logical parts.
It identifies the knowledge,
skills, and
attitudes (KSA) required for performing the job correctly.
It
is often concerned with
the subjective elements of a job that
is, expectations and attitudes. An indicative
list
of jobs description
in highway sector organizations at various policy planning, project
planning, work execution and maintenance levels are given
in Annex-2. There are
five components of a job.
(i) Job
- the main description of what a person does,
(ii)
Duties -
it contains two or more tasks
(iii) Tasks-
it contains two or more elements and
has identifiable beginning and end.
(iv) Elements-
it contains two or more SKAs
(v)
SKAs. To illustrate, a 'mechanic' is a job; his duty is to tune engine; his task is to clean
the carburetor (a task has a verb and object); his element is to replace the defective
parts on the carburetor and finally his SKA is that he must know about different parts
of engine, carburetor and their assembly system.
4.4
Task inventory: Job of an employee
is the identification of SKA attributes
required to perform job correctly whereas a task is a function the employee performs,
such as surveying, making entries in measurement book, preparation of payment bills,
or posting accounts into a ledger. A task
is a well defined unit of work.
It stands by
86



======================================================================
PAGE 97 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
itself.
It is a logical and necessary action in the performance of a job or duty.
It has an
identifiable start and end point and results in a measurable accomplishment or product.
Task involves application of Skills, Knowledge, and Attitudes (SKA) to perform a task.
Some jobs may only have a couple of tasks associated with them, while others will
have dozens of tasks.
4.5
The following are characteristics of tasks:
i)
A task has a definite beginning and end;
"
.
ii)
Tasks are performed
in measurable period of time;
iii)
Tasks are observable. By observing the performance of a jobholder, a
definite determination can be made that the task has been performed
and
iv)
Each task is independent of other actions. Tasks are not dependent on
components of a procedure. A task is performed by an individual for its
own sake.
4.6
Task Statement: A 'task statement' is a statement of a highly specific action.
It always has a verb and an object like 'doing quantity surveying' or 'making architectural
drawing' or 'compacting the earth' etc. A task statement should not be confused with
an 'objective' which has conditions and standards and may be a culmination of many
tasks performed by different systems like 'construction of a bridge
in eighteen months'
or 'constructing an office building which
is
efficient,
effective and to the satisfaction
of clients' which
are objectives. The task inventory consists of
all the tasks that a
jobholder or an employee
is required to perform to some specified standards. Each
and every task performed by the job incumbent must be listed on the task inventory.
It
provides vital information about the skills, knowledge, and abilities required to perform
a job. This information
is valuable for developing employee selection procedures and
training programs.
For training purposes,
it tells the developer what the job requires.
It
is also valuable for setting standards
in performance appraisals and evaluating jobs to
determine the rewards, compensation etc. Tasks inventory should be prepared indicating
how a task
is performed, and stating the objective. For example
in the task inventory
of 'compiling progress reports using MS Excel' task objective
is compiling the progress
report which is performed by using MS Excel. One way of getting a comprehensive list is
to have the employees prepare their own
list, starting with the most important tasks and
then, comparing these lists with the list prepared by the training manager. Task analysis
should specially be performed very meticulously whenever there are new processes or
equipment, when job performance is below standards, or when requests for changes to
current training or for new training are received.

4.7
Selecting the Tasks: After having understood the system or process being
researched, the purpose of the system, the people within the system, the main goals
they are trying to achieve, the jobs and the associated tasks the system requires; next
step
is to select the tasks to be trained. Often
it helps to select tasks for training by
dividing them into three groups namely
(i) Those that are to be included
in a formal
learning program;
(ii) Those that are to be included
in On-the-Job-Training (OJT) and
(iii) Those for which no formal or OJT
is needed
(i.e., job performance aids or self
study packets). Following factors should be considered when selecting tasks to be
trained:
i)
What will happen
if this task is not trained?
ii)
What will be the benefits
if this task is trained?
iii)
How will this training help to achieve training intents/ goals?
iv)
Will
training
enhance
measurable
and
visible
performance
improvement?
v)
If not trained, how will the employee learn the task or improve the task
performance?
vi)
Can trained people be hired cost effectively for the task performance
instead of training the employee?
vii)
Is
the
training
mandated
by
some
legislative
requirement
like
Occupational Safety?
viii) Can self study packet be used in place of formal training?
5
Analyzing the Tasks (Task Analysis)
5.1
Atask analysis defines a job in terms of SKA which are necessary to perform
daily tasks. Task analysis
is a structured framework that dissects a job and arrives at
a
reliable method of describing
it across time and people by composing a detailed
listing of all the tasks. The first product of a task analysis
is a task statement for each
task which
is composed of an action and a result (product). For example
in the task
'the site engineer checks and approves the 250 mm GSB layer' the 'checking' of GSB
layer is an action which
is governed and guided by the specifications and 'approve' is
the product of action 'checking'. Or, in the task 'spreading of GSB
is carried out by the
motor grader to achieve proper line and gradients' the action
is 'spreading of GSB by
motor grader' which results into a product 'as per lines and levels'.
It will be noticed that
the action can be mental such as 'approving' or physical such as 'spreading'. Some
88



======================================================================
PAGE 99 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
other examples of mental action would be 'analyze, calculate,
predict, and design'.
Physical examples of action may include, 'spread,
lay,
roll, compact, dig, move' etc.
Actions can also deal with people such as counsel, mentor, teach, and explain. For
example
in 'Surveyor explaining working of new Theodolite to site supervisor', action
is 'explaining' which results into a product of 'site supervisor who
is comfortable with
the operation of new Theodolite'.
Task actions are usually sorted into People, Data
and Thing, to identify the main characteristics of the job. Good task statements are
not easy to write as they require in depth analysis of the job. Once the task statement
has been defined, the task analysis
will then go into further detail by describing the
task frequency, difficulty of learning, importance of training the task, task difficulty, task
criticality and overall importance of task. These details will enable the trainer to identify
the SKA required for successful task performance. Methods generally employed for
performing a task analysis are observations,
interviews, and questionnaires. When
deciding which tasks to train, two guiding factors are that
it should be effective and
efficient.
In other words, training program to be selected should meet the learning
intents within acceptable costs.
5.2
Following questions may be asked when performing a task analysis:
i)
How difficult or complex is the task?
ii)
What behaviors are used
in the performance of the job?
iii)
How frequently is the task performed?
iv)
How critical
is the task to the performance of the job?
v)
To what degree
is the task performed individually, or is part of a set of
collective tasks?
vi)
If the task is a subset of a set of collective tasks, what is the relationship
between the various tasks?
vii)
What
is the consequence
if the task
is performed incorrectly or
is not
performed at all?
viii) To what extent can the task be trained on the job?
ix)
What level of task proficiency is expected following training?
x)
How critical
is the task?
xi)
What information
is needed to perform the task? What is the source of
information?

What are the performance requirements?
xiii) Does
execution
of
the
task
require
coordination

personnel or with other tasl<s?
xiv) Are
the demands
(perceptual,

physical)
imposed by the task excessive?
xv) How often
is the task performed during a specified time-frame
(i.e.,
daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)?

prerequisite
skills,
knowledge,
and

are
required
to
perform the task?
xviii) What are the current criteria for acceptable performance? What are the
desired criteria?
xix) What behaviors distinguish good performers from poor performers?
xx) What behaviors are critical to the performance of the task?

developed
for
obtaining
and
compilation
of answers
to
above
questions. Such format can be under the caption Task Performance Measure' or
'Build Performance Measures' depending upon the queries.
5.3
Cognitive Task Analysis: For tasks with a high cognitive component,
(i.e.,
decision making, problem solving, or judgments), a traditional task analysis may fail to
identify those cognitive skills required which one may require to perform a given task
or job. A cognitive task analysis
is performed to identify and to describe the cognitive
components of a task. There are a variety of methodologies available
to help the
training designer to represent and define the various knowledge structures needed
to perform a task or job. There are three knowledge (cognitive) structures namely,
declarative, procedural and strategic.
a)
First knowledge structure: Declarative knowledge tells us why things
work the way they do like 'water flows from higher to lower level' or that
the object or thing has a particular name or location like 'Delhi is capital
of India'.
It includes information about the concepts and elements in the
domain and the relationships between them.
Declarative knowledge
includes facts, principles, rules of science and concepts like "Knowing
the rules of good database design" or 'knowing the steps for working
90



======================================================================
PAGE 101 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
out rates analysis of an item' or 'knowing the procedure for fixing plinth
level' etc. Methods for eliciting declarative l<nowledge can be through
'Card Sorting process' in which the researcher obtains sets of concepts
that broadly cover the domain (derived from glossary, texts, or gleaned
from
introductory
tutorial
talk), then
transfers each concept onto a
card. Subject Matter Expert then sort the cards into common groups or
functions according to similarity or some other sorting
criteria. These
groups are then further grouped until eventually a hierarchy of groups
is formed. Another method uses 'Data Flow Modeling'
in which an
expert
is interviewed. The researcher then draws data flow diagram
using data gathered from interview.
Second knowledge structure: Procedural knowledge which tells how to
perform a given task. Procedural knowledge contains the discrete steps
or actions and the available alternatives to perform a given task. With
practice, procedural knowledge can become an automatic process,
thus allowing one
to perform a task without conscious awareness.
This automatically also allows one to perform more than one complex
task at a given time. A couple of examples would be 'check the BM
base course for line, grade and camber using template' or 'compacting
the side slopes using plate vibrator'. Methods for eliciting procedural
knowledge uses techniques
like
'Interviewing' which
is
a
variation
of a basic interview and includes
(i) working backwards through the
problem (ii) drawing a concept map (iii) showing an expert photographs
depicting system
in
a number of states and
asking questions and
(iv) expert describes procedure to interviewer and then the interviewer
teaches
it back to the expert.
Third knowledge structure: Third structure of knowledge
is 'strategic
knowledge' which comprises of information forming the basis of problem
solving, such as action plans to meet specific goals; knowledge of the
context in which procedures should be implemented; actions to be taken
if a proposed solution fails; and how to respond
if necessary information
is absent. An example of this would be a Superintending Engineer or
Chief Engineer, who formulates plan for the construction of building as
per client's requirement covering architectural design, structural design,
landscape design, execution of work etc. Methods for eliciting strategic
knowledge are
(i) Critical Decision Method - In this, interview of expert
is taken to identify non-routine events that challenged his expertise and
events which made a significant difference to hisdecision making. Atime
91



======================================================================
PAGE 102 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
line of events is tlien constructed and key points are furtlier probed;
(ii)
Non-Critical Decision Method -
In this, a semi-structured interview
is
performed utilizing specific probes designed to elicit a particular type of
information. The data
is then examined for perceptual cues, judgment
.
!
details, and decision strategy details that are not generally captured
with traditional reporting methods.
5.4
Functional Analysis: When a position that performs a large number of
tasks (e.g. manager or engineer)
is analyzed, a technique called functional analysis
can be used. Rather than conducting a job analysis to identify specific tasks, major
functions within the position are identified. After the competencies necessary to perform
the major functions are identified, those competencies can be analyzed to determine
objectives for training. For example, a site engineer
might make many plans such
as work execution plan, plan for making site available, plan for traffic diversion, plan
for arranging workers for doing the planned job, planning material for work execution
etc. The training objectives needed to perform these actions might read as: SKAs to
Create bar chart, activity network chart, resource planning using MS Project.
6
Needs Analysis
6.1
A Needs Analysis
is done for complete understanding of the shortcomings
of the system. While a task analysis looks strictly at the tasks performed on the job, a
needs analysis looks not only at the tasks being performed, but also at other parts of
the system that might yield clues at what might be done to improve
it. Depending upon
the training
intents, training analyst may perform one, both, or a hybrid of the two.
Generally, the analyst generates a
list of tasks to be performed. This
list is integrated
into a survey which covers job incumbents, subject matter experts and supervisory
personnel where the respondents are asked to evaluate the frequency, the criticality
.of each task for the successful performance of the job, and the amount of training
which they feel they require reaching proficiency level. The surveys are then compiled
and findings are discussed and tasks approved. For many jobs, this basic traditional
task analysis works just fine. For others, some different tools might be required. The
following are the instruments that may be incorporated into the needs analysis.
6.2
People-Data-Things
Analysis.
Jobs
are
often
characterized
by
the
proportions of time spent on people, data, and things. Performance deficiencies are
often the result from a mismatch between the nature of a job, and the employee's
preference for focus on people, data, or things. Although most jobs
entail that the
jobholder work with
all
three, there
is usually one
of the three that the job most
extensively focuses on. Listing all job responsibilities under one of the three categories
92

will provide the information as to what major role an employee will be expected to fulfill
-- a people person, a data person, or a thing person.

6.4
Tabletop Analysis: Using a facilitator, a small group of 3 to 1 0 Subject Matter
Experts (SME) convene to identify the various tasks to be performed. A minimum of one
job holder and one supervisor are needed to discuss the tasks. The facilitator conducts
the sessions and documents the information. Through brainstorming and consensus
building, the team develops a sequential list of tasks. Following this process, the team
determines which tasks should be trained. Task selection
is based on the frequency,
difficulty, criticality and the consequences of error or poor performance. This method
is labor intensive for the subject matter experts. The validity of the identified tasks
is
dependent upon the credibility of the selected subject matter experts. For consistency,
the team of experts should remain the same throughout the process. The table-top
method of job analysis typically consists of
(i) Orienting the team
(ii) Reviewing the
job. (iii)
Identifying the duty areas associated with the job
(iv)
Identifying the tasks
performed in each duty area and write task statements (v) Sequencing the duty areas
and task statements and
(vi) Selecting tasks for training.
6.5
Hybrid Mettrod: This involves both a quantitative analysis and consensus
building. Using job task documents, a list of tasks is compiled by an analyst. Through an
iterative process involving consensus building, the validity of the task list is assessed
93



======================================================================
PAGE 104 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
by subject matter experts, supervisors and job
holder. Through discussions, each
task's complexity, importance and frequency are numerically rated by members of the
consensus group. Once the tasks are identified, the group identifies and validates the
knowledge, skills and abilities required to perform each task.
7
Templating
7.1
DocumentAnalysis and Building Performance Measurements: Training
content can be determined by the careful review and analysis of a template (a
list of
system facilities, procedures, theory topics, or generic learning objectives). The template
technique uses a simplified process for determining content or developing learning
objectives associated with the operation or maintenance of a specific system. This
technique produces generic and system-specific learning objectives for the training and
evaluation of personnel. A template containing generic learning objectives is reviewed
by subject matter experts for applicability. This approach directly generates system-
specific terminal and enabling learning objectives.
It
is important that the template
be carefully reviewed to determine the applicability of each item to the system. The
template technique includes
(i) Develop or modify an existing template to meet facility
needs. (ii)Use of a trainer and a subject matter experts to select applicable objectives
and/or complete portions of the template for a given system, component, or process.
7.2
Document Analysis: This technique
is especially valuable when accurate
procedures and other job
related documents are
available. Document analysis
is
a
simplified technique
for determining
required knowledge and
skills
directly from
operating procedures, administrative procedures, and other job related documents.
A SME and a trainer review each section and step of the procedure or document to
determine training program content. Document analysis consists of
(i) Review the
procedure or document and
list the knowledge and skills required by a jobholder and
(ii) Verify the accuracy of the results.
7.3
Building Performance Measures: Constructing performance measures
for each task to be trained
is one of the critical steps for achieving the performance
measures. This information provides documentation for the correct performance of
tasks. Performance measures are the standards for how well a task must be performed.
The task performance measures so developed by the training professionals should
be discussed and approved by the client management. Document for recording the
performance measure should describe the conditions, behavior (task), performance
measures, and critical task steps for the task. This document will later be used to build
the learning objectives.
It is also valuable for documenting how to perform a task and
how well
it must be performed in that
it aids management in their evaluations of the job

holder.There are four basic analysis techniques used to ensure that all performance
measures associated with a task are recorded:
i)
Observation task analysis: In this technique, task under actual working
conditions
is observed and each step for performing the task and the
standards of performance is recorded;
ii)
Simulated task
analysis:
In
this technique,
working
conditions
are
simulated and
skilled
individuals or groups performing the task are
observed. The working conditions should match the job environment
as closely as possible.
Each step and standards of performance with
inputs from the skilled performers are recorded;
iii)
Content analysis:
In this technique, operating or technical manual are
analyzed to determine the steps and standards of performance and
iv)
Interview analysis: In this technique, SMEs are consulted to determine
the required steps and standards of performance. This technique can
be used to validate the data gathered by other techniques. This method
should generally not be used alone as SMEs often leave out vital steps
of the tasks as some of the steps become so internalized that experts
fail to acknowledge doing so.
8
Selecting Instructional Setting
8.1
This step selects the appropriate delivery system or medium of instructions
and decision about how the training
will take place. The instructional setting
is the
major medium
of a
training program,
for example,
it may be decided
that a Job
Performance Aid (JPA) will be most suited delivery system for operating a piece of
equipment or classroom training for learning teamwork, or Computer Based Training
(CBT) for imparting a new skill.
8.2
The instructional setting has 'minor media' within
it. Minor media are the
learning
strategies
that
instruct the
learning
points
or steps.
For example a JPA
instructional setting might have two
- a sign/marker for starting the equipment and a
manual for performing the various operations. The classroom setting could have charts
/graphs for teaching some technical concept, multi media for teaching communication
skills
, and lectures for introducing new information. The CBT could use video, self-
tests, and simulations. Next step
in the selection of instructional setting
is deciding
about the required delivery system.
95

======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
8.3
Following
can
be
the
options
to consider when
selecting
the
delivery
system:
i)
Feedback: Sonnetimes the job of the trainer is not to train the workers
who cannot perform the task, but to train their supervisors or managers
in effective coaching and supervision methods. By receiving feed back
from the supervisor, trainer decides about the delivery system which
can most effectively bridge the performance gap.
ii)
Classroom: This is normally viewed as the traditional type of training.
It
is best used in lectures or team training setting.
Its main disadvantage
^
is that no one learns at the same pace.
iii)
Self-paced: This allows the learners to proceed at their own pace and is
suitable for learners pursuing cognitive skills like computation, analysis
etc but
it require more development time and coordination.
iv)
JPA^OJT: This includes Job Performance Aids (JPA) such as manuals
and On-the-Job training (OJT). JPA are normally the cheapest method
to implement while OJT can provide high quality, cost effective training.
The disadvantage
is the interruptions that take place
in the workplace
with OJT, while JPA provide no supervision or coaching.
v)
Specialized: Best-Of-Class Model (blended, hybrid or modular) are a
combination of various media that provides the learners with the best
type of instruction
- this should be the goal of any training program.
Also included in this category are Coaching and Mentoring.
8.4
Although
most
learning
objectives and
concepts
can
be
taught
using
almost any of the many types of training media, most have an
ideal medium
in a
given learning situation. When selecting training media, one needs to consider learner
needs, resources, experience, and training goals. The goal of a good training effort
is to build a viable and efficient program. That
is,
it should provide the best learning
environment at the lowest possible cost. Selecting the best medium for each module
and incorporating
it into the delivery system helps
in making training course a Best-
Of-Class program. Basic Guidelines, however are to enable the learners to master
the new
or existing technology
in
a
professional,
effective, and
efficient manner.
An illustrative needs analysis template is given at Annex-3.
9
Training Cost
The last step in the analysis phase is to document the training project and perform an
estimate of the cost to implement
it.
It has been added
in this phase as organizations

in advance.

procurement sometimes takes time, training program can proceed on to next phase of
designing the program after obtaining an approval from the management for arranging
the budget on submission of rough cost estimate. Thus as per the requirements
it is
possible to plan the
training and development program and simultaneously assess
costs,
if required.

PLANNING AND DESIGNING OF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
1
Determining Training IVIethod
1.1
After having analyzed the organization, processes, occupation, individual
job and tasks and deciding that there exists training need, next step
is to determine
the training methods that could be used
in the delivery of training courses. Design
or methods,
is understood to be a known approach or procedure; an acknowledged
practice by the trainers as a way of teaching or promoting learning. The concept of
design represents the basic 'how to' level of training as a sub component of learning
objectives.
It also embraces use of 'technique' and 'material'. For example,
'lecture'
can be a training method but the
technique of lecture
will take
into account
the
characteristics
of learners
like whether they
are
logical-
mathematical
or
visual-
spatial. Trainer will accordingly decide upon
'attitude scales' of his lecture
and
use
material like charts or hand-outs as may be appropriate for the purpose of instruction's
delivery. Design or delivery method
is thus a tool which the trainer uses for optimal
use. Therefore,
it
is essential that a trainer must have teaching
skills, concern and
competence. The
choice and
appropriate
use
of
training
design
will
clearly
be
influenced by the knowledge and skill of trainer. There are number of training methods
like
learning
cycle, planned and emergent
learning,
neuro-linguistic programming,
multiple
intelligence,
experiential
learning
etc.
Understanding
of these
theoretical
concepts helps the trainer in the selection, design and use of training methods. This
phase thus ensures the systematic development of the training program. This process
is driven by the products of the analysis phase and ends in a model or blueprint of the
training program for future development.
1.2
To
focus
the
training
program
on
the
required
task
performance
measurements, following development order of training programme should be followed
after analyzing the task to determine the objective
as described in previous chapter.
i)
Developing the learning objective
fully and determining
if
it has any
enabling objectives.
If
it does, then such enabling objectives must be
clearly spelt out;
ii)
Identifying
Learning Steps
required
for performing
the
objective
to
standards;
iii)
Building a test instrument to determine
if the learner can perform the
steps that are required to reach the objective and includes steps
like
planning the test, and developing the tests (kind of tests, type of tests);

v)
Program Sequencing,
Structuring or developing course content that
will train the learners to perform the objective. Learners can perform
the objective
if they can meet the evaluation standards. The 'objective'
is the focal
point of this development order. The objective specifies
what behavior must be displayed by the learner to perform the task to
standards. Training
is then developed to teach the steps that will best
lead to the desired behavior.
2
Developing Learning Objectives
2.1
In the analysis phase, one discovers what needs to be trained. In this phase,
writing clear learning objectives answers the question, 'What will the learners be able
to do when they finish the training program?' Only with well constructed
learning
objectives,
instructors
will know what
is to be taught, learners
will know what they
are supposed to learn, and organizations will know the final
utility of training budget
investment. Learning objectives form the basis for 'what is' to be learned, 'how well'
it is
to be performed, and under 'what conditions'
it is to be performed. A learning objective
is a statement of what the learners will be expected to do once they have completed
a specified course of instruction.
It prescribes the conditions, behavior (action), and
standard of task performance forthetraining setting. For example, a learner's knowledge
is a state of mind which cannot be directly measured but an indirect evaluation of the
same can be done by observing his behavior or performance. Objectives are different
from goals. Goals describe a learning outcome
in general terms. For example,
'the
learner
will successfully complete the surveying course,
before moving on
to the
survey supervisor's course.'
It gives general indication of direction to be followed but
provides no guidance about how to achieve
it. On the other hand, an objective
is a
specific statement of instructional intent which attempts to change knowledge,
skills
or attitudes as a result of a learning experience. For example, 'the learner will master
Theodolite survey before moving on to computerized Total Station Survey'. Specific
'Terminal Learning Objectives' must be developed for each of the tasks selected
in
the learning program. A Terminal Learning Objective
is the highest level of learning
(SKA) appropriate to the human performance requirements a learner or trainee
is
expected to accomplish. Each terminal learning objective is analyzed to determine
if it
needs one or more enabling learning objectives, that is, whether
it needs to be broken
down into smaller, more manageable objectives. An enabling learning objective thus
measures one of the elements of the terminal learning objective.
99



======================================================================
PAGE 110 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
2.2
A learning objective has tlnree main components as follows:
i)
Task or observable action: This describes the observable performance
or behavior. Observable
action
is a statement which defines some
'doable' activity using a verb
in the statement. For example 'weld a
joint' or
'lift a load'. Each objective covers one behavior; hence, only
one verb should be present.
If there are many behaviors covered or the
behaviors are complicated, then the objective should be further broken
down
into one or more enabling learning objectives that support the
main terminal learning objective.
ii)
Standard or atleast one measurable criterion: This states the level of
acceptable performance of the task
in terms of quantity,
quality, time
limitations, etc. This must answer any question such as 'How much or
how many?"How fast?' or 'How well?'
For example 'At least 30 Cubic
meter of concrete must be produced within one
hour'. Or 'meeting
quality standards
of M35
concrete'. There can be more than one
'
measurable criterion.
ill)
Conditions or environment:
It describes the actual conditions under
which the task will occur or be observed. Also,
it identifies the tools,
procedures, materials, aids, or facilities to be used
in performing the
task. This
is generally expressed with a prepositional phrase such as
'using batch mix plant' or 'by checking temperature of the hot mix'.
2.3
'
Illustration below are given as examples of learning objectives
Example
1: Prepare a road work estimate with no calculation mistakes using
MORTH specifications.
Observable Action: Prepare a road work estimate.
Measurable Criteria: with no calculation mistakes
Conditions of Performance: using MOR&TH specifications.
NOTE:
Generally speaking, the larger the organization or the more technical the task,
the more specific the conditions of performance must be spelled out.
In the above
example, the task of road estimate preparation can be further broken down
in to
enabling objective like 'work out quantity of material from the drawing using CAD
software' and
'work out rates of material using MOR&TH analysis of rates' etc.
100

Example 2: Interpret contourmap obtained from GPS elevations database within
5 minutes without using comprehensive chart analysis.
Observable
Action:
Interpret
contour
maps
obtained
from
GPS
elevations
database.
Measurable Criteria: within 5 minutes
Conditions of Performance: without using comprehensive chart analysis.
.
Example
3: Complete
the design of sinking
well by tomorrow, even when
exhausted, unless you fall sick.
Observable Action: Designing sinking well.
Measurable Criteria: 24 hours.
Conditions: even when exhausted
Variable: unless you fall sick.
Example 4: After training, a Beldar will be able to load a dumper truck with
3 loads of a scoop loader, in the hours of darkness, unless the work area is
muddy.
Observable Action: load a dumper truck
^
Measurable Criteria: with 3 loads
Conditions: a scoop loader in the hours of darkness
Variable: unless the work area
is muddy
2.4
The learning objective spells out the exact training requirement. As seen
above,
if estimate
is prepared
in
10 days even
after the
training which aimed
at
enabling the learner to do the job of estimate preparation within one day or a beldar
fails to load the dumper truck with three scoops after the training, then the learning
objectives are not met and time and money spent on training
is not properly utilized.
A clearly formulated objective has two dimensions, a behavioral aspect and a content
aspect. The behavioral aspect is the action the learner must perform, while the content
is the product or service that is produced by the learner's actions. For example in the
statement 'the laboratory technician
will learn determination of OMC of soil sample
by studying Road Works Manual' there
is no outcome of training but an
activity of
101



======================================================================
PAGE 112 of 192
======================================================================
1RC:SP:92-2010
learning. Reading a manual is an activity of learning (behavioral aspect) but there is no
service produced by the learner's action (content aspect).
In another example 'Given
a forklift, load a stone boulder into a trailer without any safety errors'. In this example,
the behavioral aspect
is loading a trailer, while the content aspect
is a stone boulder
placed on the
trailer. Learning objectives look very similar to tasks. A task analysis
itemizes each discrete
skill found
in a job, but
it provides only end goal statements,
while learning objectives spell out the pre-requisite skills and makes them the course
objectives. The
learning
objective should be a good simulation
of the
conditions,
behaviors and standards of the performance needed
in the real world. Hence, the
evaluation at the end of the instruction should match the objective. The methodology
and contents of the learning program should directly support the learning objectives.
The
instructional media should
explain, demonstrate, and
provide
practice. Then,
when students learn, they can perform on the test, meet the objective, and perform as
they must in the real world.
3
Identifying Learning Steps
3.1
After formulating the learning objectives,
next step
in the design phase
is identification and compilation of learning steps. The learning steps are compiled
into a
list that specifies each activity that must be performed
in order to successfully
complete the task. For example, the learning steps for the objective 'Given a sloping
embankment, check for benching requirement for widening
existing embankment'
might read like this:
i)
Check slope of the existing embankment to find whether
it
is steeper
than 4:1;
ii)
Create 0.3 meter wide horizontal bench by cutting into old slope;
iii)
Check for using material obtained from cutting of benches for widening
purpose;
iv)
Add fresh embankment material;
v)
Check for bond between fresh embankment materials with old slope;
vi)
Check for the new slope after adding new embankment material and
vii)
Check for compaction requirement of widened portion.
3.2
Various enabling objectives required
to perform above mentioned steps
like, how to check slope (step
1), how to create bench of required width (step
2),
checking properties of excavated material before mixing the same with fresh material
102



======================================================================
PAGE 113 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
(step 3) etc. should also be fully spelt out and learning steps for each of such enabling
objectives should be prepared.
4
Building Test Instruments
4.1
Building
Test: Instruments means suitable that tests are required to be
developed to evaluate the learner's
in depth l<nowledge of the learning objective.
It
exposes the learner about the
pre-requisite
sl<ills he
will need
to develop
prior to
undertal<ing task performance.
In depth knowledge about learning
objectives and
learning steps creates an automatic and
in
built standard and prescribed approach
towards task performance.
It also helps to provide feedback to both the learner and
the instructor. Tests are often referred to as 'evaluations' or 'measurements'. Various
terms used for evaluation of learner are defined as below:
i)
Test or test instrument:
It
is a systematic procedure for measuring a
sample of an individual's behavior, such as multiple-choice, performance
test, etc.
ii)
Evaluation:
Evaluation
is the process
of determining the value and
effectiveness
of a
learning
program,
module,
and
course.
It
is
a
systematic process for the collection and use of information from many
sources to be applied
in interpreting the results and
in making value
judgments and decisions. This collection of results or scores is normally
used in the final analysis of whether a learner passes or fails. In a short
course the evaluation could consist of one test, while in a larger course
the evaluation could consist of dozens of tests.
iii)
Measurement:
It
is
the
process
employed
to
obtain
a
quantified
representation of the degree to which a learner reflects a trait or behavior.
This is one of the many scores that an individual may achieve on a test.
An evaluator
is most interested
in the gap between a learner's score
and the maximum score possible.
If the testing instrument is true, then
measurement indicates the area that the learner did not master.
4.2
Planning the
Test: Test items should be recorded
in planned manner.
Without an advance plan, some test items may be over represented while others may
stay untouched. Often,
it
is easier to build test items on some topics than on others.
These easier topics tend to get over-represented.
It
is also easier to build test items
that require the recall of simple facts, rather than items calling for critical evaluation,
integration of different facts, or application of principles to new situations. A good test
or evaluation plan can have
a descriptive scheme that states what the learners may
103



======================================================================
PAGE 114 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
or may not do while taking the test.
It includes behavioral objectives, content topics,
the distribution of test items, and what the learner's test performance really means.
4.3
Kinds of Tests: The most commonly used
varieties of tests
in training
programs are Criterion Referenced Written Tests, Performance Tests, and Attitude
Surveys. Although there are exceptions, normally one of the three types of test
is
given to test one of the three learning domains. Although most tasks require
the
use of more than one learning domain, there
is generally one that stands out. The
dominant domain should be the focal point of the test evaluations. Different kinds of
tests are briefly described below:
i)
Criterion referenced
test
It
evaluates
the
cognitive domain which
includes the recall or recognition of specific facts, procedural patterns,
and concepts that serve in the development of intellectual abilities and
skills. The testing of these abilities and skills are often measured with
a written test or a performance test. A criterion referenced evaluation
focuses on how
well
a
learner
is
performing
in terms
of a known
standard or criterion. This differs from a norm referenced evaluation
which focuses on how well a learner performs in comparison with other
learners or peers.
ii)
Performance test:
It evaluates the psychomotor domain which involves
physical movement,
coordination, and use of the
motor-skill
areas.
Measured
in
terms
of speed,
precision,
distance,
procedures,
or
techniques in execution.
It can also be used to evaluate the cognitive
domain. A performance
test
is
also a
criterion
referenced
test
if
it
measures against a set standard or criterion. A performance test that
evaluates to see who can perform a task the quickest would be a normal
referenced performance test.
^
iii)
/\ff/fL/c/c SL/n/ey;
It evaluates the affective domain which addresses the
manner
in which emotive elements are dealt with and include
things
such
as
feelings,
values,
appreciation,
enthusiasms,
motivations,
and attitudes. Attitudes are not observable therefore a representative
behavior
is required
to be measured.
For example,
it
is
difficult to
tell whether an employee
is well motivated by looking at him, but his
representative
behavior such
as
being on
time,
working
well
with
others, performing tasks
in an excellent manner can give fairly good
assessment with regard
to
his motivation
level. Since
attitudes are
defined as latent constructs and are not observable in themselves, the
104



======================================================================
PAGE 115 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
developer must identify some sort of behavior that would seem to be
representative of the display of the attitude
in question. This behavior
can then be measured as an index of the attitude construct. Often, the
survey must be administered several times as employees' attitude will
vary from day to day, indeed, sometimes even hour to hour. Before and
after measurements should be taken to show the changes in attitude.
Generally, a survey
is conducted one or more times
to assess the
attitude
in a given area, then a program
is undertaken to change the
employee's
attitudes. After the program
is completed, the survey
is
again administered to test its effectiveness.
5.1
Types of Tests
5.1
Having a learner perform the task under realistic conditions
is normally a
better indicator of a person's
ability to perform the task. The performance test or a
criterion referenced written test should be used to measure the learners' achievements
against the objectives. The test items should determine the learner's acquisition of the
KSAs required
for performing the task. Since a written measuring device samples
only a portion of the population of behaviors, the sample must be representative of the
behaviors associated with the task. Since
it must be representative,
it must also be
comprehensive. Different types of tests are listed below:
5.2
Written Tests: A written test may contain any of these types of questions:
i)
Open-ended question: This
is a question with an unlimited answer.
The question
is followed by an ample blank space for the response.
Although open ended questions provide a superior method of testing
than multiple-choice or true-false questions as they allow
little or no
guessing but they take longer to construct and are more
difficult to
grade.
ii)
Checklist: This question
lists items and directs the learner to check
those that apply to the situation.
iii)
Two-way question: This type of question has alternate responses, such
as yes/no or true/false.
iv)
Multiple-choice question: this gives several choices, and the learner
is asked
to select the most correct one. The most commonly used
question in training environments is the multiple-choice question. Each
question
is called a test item. Text of question
is called the 'stem' and
105



======================================================================
PAGE 116 of 192
======================================================================
1RC:SP:92-2010
incorrect responses
are
called
'distracters'. When
writing
multiple-
choice questions following points should be l<ept in mind to build a well
constructed test instrument:
•
The stem should present the problem clearly
•
Only one correct answer should be included.
•
Distracters should be plausible
•
Option
'All the above' should be used sparingly.
If used, an equal
number of 'All the above' should be correct and incorrect (distracters).
'None of the above' should also be used very sparingly.
•
Each item should test one central idea or principle. This enables
the learner to fully concentrate on answering the question instead
of dissecting the question.
It also allows the instructor to determine
exactly which principles were not comprehended by the learner
•
The distracters and answer for a question should be listed in series.
That
is, high to low, low to high, alphabetical, longest to shortest,
like vs unlike, function, etc
•
Often, test items can be improved by modifying the stem.
If a plausible
distracter can not be found, then a fewer number of distracters can
be selected. Although four choices are considered
in the standard
for multiple-choice questions they allow a 25 percent chance
of
the learner guessing the correct answer.
If four plausible distracter
.
are
difficult to find then choice can be reduced to three plausible
distracters. A distracter should never be used just to provide four
choices as
it wastes the learner's time reading through the possible
choices.
v)
True and false: True and false questions provide an adequate method
for testing learners when two or more distracters cannot be constructed
for a multiple-choice question or to break up the monopoly of a long
test.
In this method, the distracter should be highly plausible forcing
the learner to do some kind of analysis to reject
it. With a true-false
question their odds however get better with a 50 percent chance of
guessing the correct answer.
vi)
Essay: Essay requires an answer
in a sentence, paragraph, or short
composition.
106



======================================================================
PAGE 117 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
To check against the possibility that such multiple choice, true/false, questions really
succeed
in measuring the ability to not only locate right answer but also the ability to
recall and reproduce right answer,
it
is essential that such questions are formulated
very carefully. Essay types of questions are criticized in that its evaluation sometimes
tends to be subjective. But essay type test best reflects the ability- of comprehension
and expression thereof by the learner.
5.3
Tests to Check Performance: A performance test allows the learner to
demonstrate a skill that has been learned in a training program. Performance tests are
also criterion referenced
in that they require the learner to demonstrate the required
behavior stated
in the objective. For example, the learning objective 'checking for
benching
in widening of pavement
in embankment'
could be tested by having the
learners asked a question with embankment slope given in percentage
like 20 percent
slope instead of expressing
in ratio X:Y. 20 percent is flatter than
1 :4 and as such does
not require benching. The evaluator should have a check that all the performance steps
that the learner must perform to pass the test are adequately covered in the test.
If the
standard
is met, then the learner passes.
If any of the steps are missed or performed
incorrectly, then the learner should be given additional practice and coaching and then
retested. There are three critical factors
in a well conceived performance test
(i) The
learner must know what behaviors (actions) are required in order to pass the test. This
is accomplished by providing adequate practice and coaching sessions throughout
the learning sessions.
Prior to the performance evaluation, the steps required for a
successful completion of the test must be understood by the learner,
(ii) The necessary
equipment and scenario must be ready and
in good working condition
prior to the
test. This
is accomplished by prior planning and a commitment by the leaders of the
organization to provide the necessary resources,
(iii) The evaluator must know what
behaviors are to be looked for and how they are rated. The evaluator must know each
step of the task to look for and the parameters for the successful completion of each
step
5.4
Listing Entry Betiavior. For this purpose, a sample of the learner target
population should be tested to determine whether their entry behavior or SKAs match
with the proposed level of instruction. Such testing
is useful to establish
if trainer's
assumption of learner's threshold knowledge and the starting
point of the training
program are correct. That is, whether the proposed learners have the needed SKAs to
master the terminal learning objective
in the training program or must they be taught
additional enabling objectives.
For example, an instructional program on designing
flexible overlays
using FWD
might
instruct several advanced uses
of a
piece
of
diagnostic equipment. The instructional plan will be based on the assumption that the
107



======================================================================
PAGE 118 of 192
======================================================================
!RC:SP:92-2010
learners have mastered the Benkelman Beam Deflection method from prior experience
or training. These basic diagnostic procedures should be tested on the proposed
learners to validate the instructional plan assumption.
If they have not mastered one
or more of the basic diagnostic procedures, then these un-mastered procedures will
have to be accounted for
in the training plan. Once their present KSAs have been
tested, then the tasks to be taught should be tested on a small sample of personnel
who have mastered the tasks previously to ensure the proposed test is correct. Finally,
a sample of the proposed learners is tested to see
if they can pass any portions of the
test without any instruction.
6
Program Sequence and Structure
6.1
The last step
in the design phase
is to determine program sequence and
structure to ensure the learning objectives are met. A proper sequence provides the
learners with a pattern of relationship so that each activity will have a definite purpose.
The more meaningful the content, the easier
it is to learn and, consequently, the more
effective the instruction. Proper sequencing also helps to avoid inconsistencies in the
content of the
instruction. When material
is carefully sequenced, duplication
is far
less likely. The presence of duplication often indicates that the program has not been
properly sequenced.
6.2
Some of the techniques and considerations used
in sequencing are listed
below:
1)
Job performance order.
It is sequencing the job performance steps
in
learning program.
"
ii)
From simple
to complex: Objectives may be sequenced
in terms of
increasing complexity.
iii)
Critical sequence:
Objects
are
ordered
in
terms
of
their
relative
importance.
iv)
Known to unknown: Familiar topics are considered before taking up
unfamiliar ones.
v)
Dependent relationship: Mastery of one objective requires prior mastery
of another
vi)
Supportive
relationship: Transfer
of learning
takes
place from one
objective to another, usually because common elements are included
108



======================================================================
PAGE 119 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
in each objective. Tliese should be placed as close together as possible
so that the maximum transfer of learning can take place
vii)
Cause to effect: Objectives are sequenced from cause to effect.
6.3
If there are a number of objectives, then they should be organized
into
clusters which have some common
characteristics considered
appropriate by the
trainer to be clubbed for the purpose of imparting learning. The sequencing performed
earlier
(listing of steps)
is the basis for breaking the objectives down
into clusters
based on the class relationship between them.
If the training program
is long, then
reinforcement also has to be accounted
for. One of the behavioral characteristics
of learners indicates that not only the rate at which people learn must be accounted
for, but also the rate of decay that takes place after an objective
is mastered must
also be accounted
for. To account for this decay factor, reinforcement loops must
be
built into the instructional process. The decay factor also has to be considered
once the learner graduates from the program.
If a task
is taught
in the instructional
program and then
is not used for some time after the learners return to their duties,
then some decay
is likely to take place. The remedy for this
is to coordinate with the
learner's supervisor to ensure the learners perform their newly acquired skills as soon
as possible upon returning to the job.
In any instructional program, there
is usually
a wide variety of abilities among the learners. Some will have extensive experience,
while others are having only limited experience. Many other variables will affect the
progression and productivity of the learners. Provisions must be made to compensate
for these differences.
In a self-paced course, extra modules can help the learners
that are having
difficulties.
In a class room
course, additional instructions, reading
assignments, or study halls may be required to keep the slower learners on pace with
the other learners. The product of the sequencing step should be a learning map which
shows the proposed layout of the objectives. An example of learning objective map
showing monitoring of reports generated under MIS
is shown
in Annex-4. Learning
process which takes place
in the cognitive, affective and psychomotor domain of a
learner is explained in Annex-5.
7.
After comprehensive planning of training methodology, the next step
is to
develop instruction strategies for delivering the training and development activities in
most effective manner.

INSTRUCHONAL STRATEGIES
1
Strategies for Transfer of Learning
Development phase
relates
to
putting
in
place
learning
strategies. The concept
of learning
in the development phase
is translated
into effective
action. The main
instructional setting and media for transfer of learning is chosen in the analysis phase.
In design phase, the course content or methods to achieve learning objectives are
formulated. Development phase begins with specifying the learning activities that will
best assist in the learning process. In this phase, the learning strategies and supporting
media that will assist the learners in mastering the objectives are selected.
Selection
of the proper activities helps trainer to understand what learning is and what activities
enhance a particular form of learning. Media and strategy dictionary can be used for
seeking assistance for selection of activities. For the purpose of developing learning
strategies, foundational concept of learning can be elaborated as below:
i)
Learning is indexed by a change in behavior, which must be translated
into observable behavior;
ii)
After learning, learners are capable of performing something that they
could not do before the learning experience;
iii)
This change is relatively permanent;
it is neither transitory nor fixed;
iv)
The change
in
behavior need
not occur immediately following
the
learning experience. Although there may be a potential to act differently,
this potential may not be translated into a new behavior immediately;
v)
The change in behavior results from experience or practice and
vi)
The experience or practice must be reinforced.
2
Process for Learning
2.1
Learning a subject seems to involve three almost simultaneous processes
(i) there is acquisition of new information. Often the information runs counter to or is a
replacement for what the learner had previously known,
(ii) Learning may be called a
'transformation'- the process of manipulating knowledge to make
it fit for undertaking
new tasks. Transformation comprises the ways we deal with information
in order to
go beyond
it.
(iii) Some type of evaluation takes place by the learner in order to check
whether the information and skills are adequate for the task.

Conceptualizing Learning or Instructional Strategies
Learning
strategies
or
instructional
strategies
are
the various
methodologies used
to involve the learners
in the training program, such as questioning during
lectures,
simulation with Computer Based training (CBT), reflection after reading, etc. They are
used to obtain the 'learning objectives' or newly acquired behaviors which are expected
by the
learners when they return back to their jobs. The learning objectives,
in turn,
are transferred by the 'media'
in which instructions are presented. The media can be
CBT, self study, classroom, OJT (On the Job Training),
etc.
In the delivery of course
content, optimum
mix
of
different medium must be
used.
For example,
training's
learning objective
is 'Laying and compaction of Water Bound Macadam (WBM) base
course'. Media can be OJT. Trainer's instructional strategies can be to have the learners
watch a demonstration
in order to get an overall view of the laying and compaction of
WBM using stone aggregate, screening, blinding material; their spreading,
rolling and
setting and drying. OJT can have a question and answer period, observe small group
demonstrations, and then receive hands-on
practice by actually performing the job.
Knowing the type of knowledge, skill, or attitude from the taxonomy, the learning domain
can be effectively used in determining the 'learning or instructional strategy'.
4
Conceptualizing Learning Styles
Every learner
is unique person. A learning
style
is a
learner's consistent way of
responding to and using stimuli
in the context of learning. Achieving a solid learning
111



======================================================================
PAGE 122 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
environment that meets the student's need, rather than their styles seems to be the
most important key for effective
learning. Learning
style as discussed
in previous
chapter may be referred to for selection of most effective learning style for the given
set of pupil and learning objectives.
5
Conceptualizing Learning Process
While learning styles show that learners are
all different, the learning process shows
how and why one
learns something. This, perhaps,
is even more important than
addressing the various learning styles. Although people have a preferred style, they
can
still learn under almost any style, but
if the learning process
is not
in place,
it
makes learning a new task or subject almost unachievable.
In experiential learning
cycle, there are four stages of learning process namely experiencing,
interpreting,
generalizing and testing which keeps on taking place in a learner in a dynamic cyclic
order, each
reinforcing the next
like experience reinforcing the
interpreting and so
forth. Learning process thus becomes both
iterative and
interactive. Not only does
new experience or information become a spur to reflection and action, reflection can
lead to testing ideas through experience. While developing the instructional strategy,
one however needs to take account of choices and deliberate decisions to pick up one
and reject other ways of imparting the experiences,
interpretations, generalizations
and testing to learners.
6
Choosing Delivery System
In this step, a trainer chooses the instructional and support material that provides the
most effective learning stimulus. Care should be taken not to select materials just
because they are available. The purpose
in this step
is to select learning methods
and the media that support them in order to best magnify the learning process. When
choosing the media which
is best suited to train the objective following considerations
may be kept in mind:
i)
The instructional setting: What type of setting
is required?
Is
it up to
date or does
it require modification?
If the
instructors and
learners
have to travel to see the working demonstration then what materials
must they bring?
ii)
l\/ledia
characteristics:
What
is
the
best
media
for
the
chosen
inLtructions? How must the media be obtained?
ill)
Instructional material: Can
it be developed within the proposed budget?
What are the constraining factors for producing this material? Will the
112



======================================================================
PAGE 123 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
technology likely to change before the proposed training material can
be produced?
iv)
Time: What
critical time factors are involved? When and how many
.
learners must be trained by a given time? Is there more than one group
to be trained and how closely will each group follow?
v)
Instructors: Are they qualified for this type of instruction? Must a Train
the Trainer' class be given to bring the instructors up to par? How long
will
it take to bring them up to par? How many instructors are available
for this instruction?
7
Training Media
Media is the means of communicating and transferring a learning concept or objective
to another individual. There are two types of training media within a training program.
The first is the instructional setting or major media like class room or lecture hall or site of
work. The second is the delivery systems or learning strategies. These are the various
instructional methods that take place within the instructional setting. For example,
in
the class room
in the training
institute there may be one or combination of learning
strategies like lectures, multimedia presentation, programmed instruction, coaching,
etc. Training media may be grouped into four major categories (i) Lockstep:
It includes
class room (Conventional), Boot Camp, Lecture, Telecommunication, Video
(ii) Self-
^
Paced
:
It includes Personalized System of Instructibn (PSI), Programmed Learning,
Text Instruction, Action Learning (experimental), Workbook, Computer Based Training
(CBT), e-learning or Internet Dfstance Learning (IDL) (Online, Networked, or Web)
(iii)
Job:
It includes Job Performance Aid (JPA), On-The-Job (OJT) (iv) Specialized: Best
•
of class model, Coaching, mentoring.
8
Selection of Instruction Media
'
8.1
Media instruction chart can be used to determine the optimum mix of training
media. For most effective output, use of variety of media singly or in combination are
used for transferring learning to others. No one medium
is better than other, each
medium
is best in certain environments. Each type of instructional method however
requires certain points to be considered before deciding one or other type of instruction
media. Different types of instruction method briefly described as under:
8.2
Job Performance Aid (JPA): These are the performance aids comprising
of
list of steps needed for performing a task. These are aids which the trainer feels
should be supporting to instruction delivery. Job Performance Aids Includes technical
113



======================================================================
PAGE 124 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
manuals, flowcharts, or other means of listing the steps for performing a task. Computer
Based JPAs include Electronic Performance Support Systems (EPSS), wizards, and
Help Systems. Web Based Performance Support Systems (WPSS) can be instantly
updated, unlike a technical manual that requires to be printed or to be copied and
then distributed. EPSSs are however should not be emphasized
for the tasks that
requires high psychomotor skills or
if the trainees lack the pre-requisite skills. Colour
charts are often used to convey specific associations and emotional responses
like
for example red colour conveys hot,
fire, heat in 'mental association', danger/blood/
auspicious occasion
in
'direct association' and passion, excitation,
activity, urgency,
speed
in
'objective association'.
Different colors accordingly are rated
for different
associative responses and can be used for instructional impact. Chart/flow diagram
are effectively used to show the working of equipment. They should be lucid
in their
explanation, readable from trainees' position and well illuminated to enable learner to
follow instruction for any hands on exercised.
8.3
Just-In-Time Training: Just-in-Time Training as the word suggests conveys
the concept of providing training when
it is actually needed, rather than on a deferred
basis. Such training
is usually automated, such as web based or having coaches on
stand-by for such needs.
8.4
Lecture: Although this is the most popular, way to present information since
it
is easy to design and implement,
it can also be one of the worst methods as
it
is
passive, and auditory
in nature. This method varies from presenting a discourse
(extended speech) on a subject to an exchange
of ideas.
Lectures are generally
supported with activities like demonstration, examples, and case studies, quizzes to
help learners grasp and understand the subject. When used correctly, lectures can set
the stage for deeper learning to take place. Many learners can find this type of training
confusing as their comprehension, reading, and listening rates are
all quite different.
In case a learning program
is categorized as discussion, there must be some pre-
learning so that an intelligent discussion can take place.
8.5
Self Teaching Package: This system requires higher motivation coupled
with well developed SKAs in the learner to be effective. There are many self learning
packages available and can be effectively made use of.
8.6
Resident Instruction:
This system of instruction although takes longer
initial development time, they are usually cheaper over the long run
if they can be
used for an extended period of time. They are employed generally for transfer of new
knowledge, concepts and their practical application. They include Computer Based
Training (CBT), Text Instruction, Personalized System of Instruction, and Programmed
114



======================================================================
PAGE 125 of 192
======================================================================
1RC:SP:92-2010
Learning. Since learning
is an individual phenomenon and not a group phenomenon,
this method allows the learners to proceed at their own pace. The main disadvantage
is that the learners must be motivated to learn on their own. This type of training
is
suitable
if close supervision is not required and the task can be learned by individuals
or a group.
8.7
Programmed Text Learning: Programme Text learning involves features
like
(i)
Learners are exposed to small amounts of information and proceeded
from
one frame, or one item of information, to the next in an orderly fashion
( linear fashion),
(ii) Learners are motivated by incentive like their correct responses can be rewarded
and their incorrect responses can be corrected,
(iii) Learners are informed immediately
about whether or not their response
is correct (feedback),
(iv)
Learners proceed at
their own pace
(self-paced). Some times trainer diagnoses learner's responses
to
ascertain learning gaps and decide upon what additional enabling
instructions are
needed by a learner or group of learners. Linear program
is then branched out and
accordingly called branching program. Since
it attempts
to diagnose the
learner's
response,
it usually
involves a
multi-choice format. After the
learners have been
presented a certain amount of information, they are given a multiple-choice question.
If they answer correctly they move on to the next body of information.
If they are
incorrect, they are directed to additional information, depending on the mistake they
made. Many CBT training courses are based on the concept of linear or branching
programmed learning.
8.8
Multimedia Computer Programs: The multimedia course content being
easily up gradable, they are effective where the training subject is low on
its shelf life
like course on computer software. Also there should be institutional facility available
for continuous up gradation of course material.
8.9
ComputerAided Instruction: This calls for computer specialist trainer who
can develop needed software to impart the instruction.
8.10
Personalized Instruction or Personalized System of Instruction (PSI):
It
is similar to text instruction, but has the following characteristics (a) Lectures are
given infrequently and only for inspirational purposes (b) The course
is divided
into
small
units. For each unit the learner gets a study guide that tells the learner what
to read and what they must know. After reading the text they answer a set of study
questions. The units are small enough so that most can complete the reading and
answer the questions
in a couple of hours. Other forms of training, such as CBT,
activities, etc. may also be used, (c) The learner then takes a unit test. A trainer scores
the test and goes over the results, providing feedback and probing to see
if the learner
115



======================================================================
PAGE 126 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
really understands the material. The learner must score
at least A+ or 90 percent
before moving on to the next unit. There
is no penalty for failing
in unit test (d) those
who fail to score the required percentage marks are coached, given relevant learning
assignments, and then retested until they can pass. Once all units have been passed,
then the learner graduates from the course.
8.11
On-The-Job Training (OJT): OJT takes place
in normal work
settings.
OJT can be an excellent training device provided trainer is a specialist in the subject
matter and
is ready to take fare share of trouble of keeping the learner sufficiently
motivated during OJT. The design, development, and implementation of OJT material
need the same care and attention as any other training courseware. OJT has one
great advantage
in that
it facilitates quicker transfer of learning as the learner has
immediate opportunity to practice learned SKAs on Job and thus training costs are
reduced. OJT limitation is that sometime job site may be quite far or may have physical
constraints and distractions that could inhibit learning and using expensive equipment
for training can
result
in costly damage and disruption of production schedules.
In
some cases instructors give class room instructions, and then hand the learners over
to the supervisors or coaches.
8.12
Boot Camp: Boot Camp is an intensive learning environment that accelerates
learning and generally employed for accelerated training in the high-tech arena. Boot
camps have smaller classes than conventional ones with typically a dozen students
or less. Applicants are screened to ensure they have a certain
level of knowledge
of the subject area, so that other learners are not slowed down
in the rapid learning
environment. Boot camps are held away from the learner's work environment so there
will not be any distractions. Training normally run from one to two weeks, and trains a
learner in one subject for 12 to 16 hours a day. The advantage of this type of training is
that the organization gets fully up-and-running employee back within a short period of
time. The disadvantage of Boot Camp is that learners tend to lose their newly acquired
skills
if they are not used immediately as the skills are not that well assimilated by the
learner as in the case of slower pace of traditional learning programs.
8.13
Classroom
(Residential): This system
is used when
a
large group
of
learners are required to be taught the same thing at the same time or the task difficulty
requires formal training.
It should be ensured that all lessons are fully outlined before
undertaking classroom instructions. Conventional classes can run from a couple of
hours to a couple of weeks and have large group with 20 to 40 learners, who may have
varying levels of knowledge and skills. This type of training provides human interaction.
If the class
is not too large, then the trainer may determine the learners' needs and
116



======================================================================
PAGE 127 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
instructions can be adapted and adjusted accordingly. The advantages of this system
is that the classroom setting permits the use of a wide variety of training methods,
e.g. video, lecture, simulation, discussion etc. Also, the environment can be controlled
to create a climate conducive to learning and classrooms can accommodate a large
number of learners. The main limitations may be increased costs due to travel and
staying cost of large number of learners and that the classroom may be quite dissimilar
to the job setting.
If this type of training
is required then there are two options. The
first is In-House Training where organization makes use of its own training facility like
training institute and
in house trainers to company trainers to deliver the instruction.
The second option is 'Contract Training', where the trainers are contracted to perform
the training at the location as decided by the organization or firm or at the location as
may be decided by the trainer or at a separate training site. The two main factors that
must be considered when deciding upon In-House or Contract Training are (a) who
has the technical expertise to provide the instruction and who can provide the best
training at the lowest cost (b) whether training will be
lock-step or self-paced.
In lock-
step instruction everyone proceeds at the same pace, where as self-paced instruction
allow the learners to proceed at their oWn pace.
8.14
Coaching: A coach can be thought as a one-on-one trainer. He can be a
supervisor, co-worker, peer or other outside consultant who
is to examine employee
performance and provides guidance, feedback, and direction to assure a successful
grasp of skills and task completion. The main difference between a coach and a trainer
is that coaching is done in real time. That is,
it is performed on the job. The coach uses
real tasks and problems to help the learner increase his or her performance. While in
training, examples are used within the classroom.
8.15
Lockstep and Self Pace: Self pace
is generally considered
better than
lockstep because
it allows each learner to proceed at her or his own pace, but
it
is
more difficult to manage than lockstep and usually requires more instructors because
of the wide range of variables that take place within the learning environment.
In
lockstep all the learners proceed at the same pace.
It requires fewer instructors and is
more easily managed than self-paced instruction.
It is often the medium of choice for
one-shot training sessions. The main disadvantage of lockstep
is that the pace
is set
for some hypothetical average learners as
in reality there are no average learners to
be found. Also,
it is hard to meet individual learning requirements and styles.
8.16
Mentoring: A mentor
is
a
person who
confers
personal
care
on
the
learner and strives to ensure that learner gets the best possible chance to
fulfill his
career potential.
It involves teaching, coaching, and helping to build a high degree
117



======================================================================
PAGE 128 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
of confidence.
Traditionally, a senior employee
is paired with a junior employee to
prepare iiim or her for increasing responsibility. But the number of senior employees
being limited another method can be devised.
If the employee has identified certain
skills to be improved, then a Special Project Mentor (SPM) can be assigned. A SPM
should not only be an expert with the desired
skills, but also someone who enjoys
coaching and teaching their special skills.
8.17
Telecommunication:
In
this system
Instructional
television
(ITV)
links
several locations for instructional and conference purposes between remote locations
via telecommunication technology. Satellites can cut travel expenses and beam the
training to thousands of locations.
8.18
Text Instruction:
In
this, a learner
is assigned reading material to study.
The reading material may be technical manuals, books, or training material produced
by the training institute or the trainer. Self-tests are included throughout the training
material. Classes and evaluations may also be part of the training material. For making
transfer of knowledge more effective they are given a mentor or coach to consult in
case they have difficulties with any of the reading assignments. The mentor should
hold discussions with their assigned learner on a regular basis.
8.19
Workbook:
It is similar to Text Instruction, except the reading material has
activities and exercises to reinforce the learning concepts.
8.20
Video: Video or multi media systems are generally provided by the outside
vendors, followed by specially prepared
films. This also
includes short visuals
to
present a problem
for solving
or discussing. This system
is
particularly
useful
in
providing
instructions
relating
to
skills
like communication,
presentation technique,
time management etc.
8.21
Computer Based Training (CBT) or Computer Aided Instruction (CAI):
CBT has the main advantage
in that
it provides immediately feedback to the learner
and presents various levels of multimedia material until the learner reaches mastery.
This system includes educational activities presented in games, drills, and simulations
format. Games are used to strengthen the learnt knowledge. A simulation model
is a
real situation
in which the learner accomplishes a real task.
It
is also self-paced and
can be delivered to the learner's desk. Some disadvantages are some learners find
it
difficult to work with a computer for long periods of time as they find human interaction
more appealing to their cognitive faculties. Also, CBT has rather long development
times depending upon complexity of the instruction.

IRC:SP:92-2010
8.22
E-learning
or
Internet
Distance
Learning
(IDL)
(Intranet,
Online,
Networked, Enterprise, or Web): This form of learning has recently emerged as one
of the most cost effective vehicle for reaching learners remotely. IDL
is composed of
organizational computer networks that use the Internet, World Wide Web technology,
and software for finding, managing,
creating, and
distributing information.
Its main
limitations
are
network
bandwidth
(size
of
network's
transmittal
capacity),
and
the requirement for each learner to be connected. This type of media
is starting to
become a favorite with organizations that have workforces
in multiple locations and
only require simple learning materials. More complex training requirements will have
longer development times as
it basically turns into CBT training development.
8.23
Other Training Methods. There are many other types of training methods
apart from a few described above. They are briefly described in Annex-6.
9
Developing the Instruction
9.1
Reviewing Existing Material:
It is important to review any existing materials
to determine
if they can be adopted or redesigned
into the program. This not only
includes material developed in-house, but also material developed by third
parties.
Whenever possible, the duplication of materials must be avoided to save resources.
9.2
Only after
all the preplanning has been accomplished,
is
it time
to
start
developing the
instructional
material. Developing different forms of course content
requires a certain amount of skill and
art. Strategies for developing course content
cover
(i) Organizational strategies (broken down to micro level or macro level) to decide
the way in which lessons are to be arranged and sequenced,
(ii) Delivery strategies
to decide how the information
is carried to the students
i.e. selection of instructional
material,
(iii) Management strategies involving decisions that help learner to interact
with the activities designed for learning. There are many instructional strategy models
being employed by the professionals depending upon their preferences. Two models,
which are more frequently used, are discussed below.
9.3
Robert Gagne's Nine Steps of Instruction: Based on above mentioned
three strategies, Robert Gagne has developed nine steps of instruction which run
in the following sequences:
(i) Gain Attention-
it involves asking a few introductory
questions informing learner of objectives i.e. What learner should expect in the session
(ii) Recapitulation of prior information-
it involves sharing information which learners
are expected to know on the subject
(iii)
Present
information-
it involves blending
the course
material with information
recall
in previous steps and sequencing the
instructions from lower to higher level of difficulty
(iv) Provide guidance-
it involves
119



======================================================================
PAGE 130 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
instructions to learner on
how he should
learn
(v)
Elicit performance-
it involves
asking learners
to do the task with newly acquires SKAs
(vi) Provide feedback-
it
involves analyzing
learner's response to instructions by conducting quizzes, tests
etc.
(vii) Asses performance-
it involves determining whether the
lesson has been
learnt the way instructor wants learner to learn (viii)Reflection-
it involves summarizing
the learning and ensuring that the training has brought about the intended changes
in SKAs (ix) Enhance retention and transfer-
It involves supply of
additional practice
material, informing about similar problem situation, and also apprising the organization
about placement strategies
for effective utilization of acquired SKAs by learners.
9.4
ARCS Approach: This
instruction design process
is
built on Attention,
Relevance, Confidence, Satisfaction (ARCS). These are briefly discussed as below:
i)
Attention:
It can be gained in two ways (a) by perpetual arousal which
makes use of some novel or uncertain event to gain attention of learner.
It
is similar to introductory remarks
in which the topic
is opened up
with higher level
of learner's attention
(b) by enquiry arousal which
stimulates curiosity among the learner by posing them challenging but
interesting questions or problems to be solved. This also stimulates
information seeking behavior by posing or having the learner generate
questions or a problem to solve.
ii)
Re/euance: This is done to impart relevance of the material at the same
time marinating high motivation level by using concrete language and
examples with which
the
learners
are
familiar. They are
six major
strategies for accomplishing this namely
•
Experience
- telling the learners how the new learning will use their
existing skills
•
Present Worth
- what will be the present worth of the subject matter
for the learner or why should he learn the lesson
•
Future Usefulness
- what will the subject matter do for the learner
tomorrow?
^
;
•
Needs Matching
- how the
training
in
the
lesson
will
affect the
dynamics of achievement,
risk taking, power, and affiliation for the
learner.
•
Modelling
-
this
strategy
includes
guest speakers,
videos,
and
inviting the learners who finish their work first to serve as tutors.
120

•
Choice- allowing the learners to use different methods to pursue
their work or allowing choices in how they organize
it.
iii)
Confidence:
it
is generating confidence that learners
will succeed
in
degree of challenges with which he
is going to be presented
in the
course. The strategies employed for this are providing
•
Objectives and
Pre-requisites
- helping students
to estimate the
probability of success by presenting performance requirements and
evaluation criteria.
It should be ensured that the learners are aware
of performance requirements and evaluative criteria.
•
Growing
the
Learners
-
every
learning
journey
begins
with
a
single step that builds upon
itself. This allows a number of small
successes that gets more challenging with every step.
Learners
should understand that there is a correlation between the amount of
energy they put into a learning experience and the amount of skill
and knowledge they will gain from that experience.
•
Feedback
- providing feedback and supporting internal attributions
for success.
•
Learner Control
- Learners should feel some degree of control over
their learning and assessment. They should believe thattheir success
is a direct result of the amount of effort they have put forth.
iv)
Satisfaction:
learner should
get opportunity
to use newly acquired
skill or knowledge
in the
real or stimulated
setting. Learners should
be provided reinforcements that will sustain the desired behavior.
If
learners
feel good about learning
results, they
will be motivated
to
learn.
Satisfaction
is based upon
motivation, which can be
intrinsic
or extrinsic. Some basic rules to be adopted
in satisfaction strategy
are (a) Do not annoy the learner by over-rewarding simple behavior
(b)
If negative consequences are too entertaining the learners may
deliberately choose the wrong answer,
(c) Using too many extrinsic
rewards may eclipse the instruction.
10
Synthesizing and Validation of Instructions
10.1
It has to be ensured that when training material and media
is developed,
the same
is synthesized
into an integrated program.
It should flow as naturally as
possible, with each lesson block building the foundation for the next one. Training
121



======================================================================
PAGE 132 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
material should display variety that is conducive to learning. There should be suitable
break between practice periods and instructional periods rather than having
all the
instruction
in the beginning followed by nothing but practice. Time
will have
to be
considered when synthesizing the complete
learning program. Developing course
content thus follows the principle of 'train and adjust'
till course content become the
best training material produced.
10.2
The last step
is to validate the material by using representative samples of
the target population and then revising the program as needed. The main element of
the systems approach to training
is revising and validating the instructional material
until the learners meet the planned learning objectives. The initial validation will depend
upon the complexity of the training material and
resources available. The participants
can be randomly selected, but they must represent all strata of the target population,
bright, average, and slow learners. They should be clearly told what their roles are
in the validation process. Learner should know that they are helping to develop and
improve the lessons and that they should feel free to
tell the trainer what they think
about
it. The participants should be pre-tested to ensure that the students learn from
the instructional material and not from past experience. Adjustment
in the procedure
can be done as needed to fit the size and complexity of training program, but
it should
be kept
in mind that the closer the
validation
interval, lesser will be the
problems
encountered during the
training.
11
After completing the planning work for T&D, the instructional strategies are
developed, as brought out in this chapter. The stage
is set for taking the learning to
participants.

CHAPTER
12
DELIVERING TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
1
Course Management Plan
1.1
Implementation phase
of training program
is
similar
to phase
of worl<
execution after the completing pre-construction exercise like preparation of drawing,
design, tender document etc. Success of training program depends upon how well
the instructional strategies are finally executed on the ground. Extent to which the
training implementation
will be successful, however largely depends upon how well
the courseware has been prepared. The course management plan
is implemented by
ensuring that the course content or courseware, class setting, and staff are ready. The
learners must be scheduled and notified. Any pre-reading material must be supplied
to trainers ahead of time. The training staff may require training (Train-the-Trainer) to
perform their roles
in the learning process. They must be given time to prepare and
rehearse their instruction.
1.2
An instructor has to prepare himself well before he can transfer effective
learning experience to learners. One
of the items
of implementation phase
is the
Training
Management
Plan
(TMP),
sometimes
called
the
Course
Management
Plan (CMP). TMP should contain
(i) A clear and complete description of the course;
(ii) A description of the target population;
(iii) Directions for administering the course;
(iv)
Directions
for
administering
and
scoring
tests;
(v)
Directions
for
guidance,
assistance, and evaluation of the
learners;
(vi) A
list of
all tasks to be
instructed;
(vii) Course map or course sequence; (viii) Program of Instruction - how the course is to
be taught;
(ix) A copy of all the training material,
i.e., training outlines, student guides,
etc.
(x)
Instructor and
staff training requirements (needed and accomplished) and
(xi) Any other documents related to the administration of the course.
2
Conducting Training
The
training
course
is
brought
to
life
by
skillful
trainers.
In
training
program's
success,
it
is the trainer's involvement which should be kept
in the focus,
rather
than favorable impressions such as trainer's oratorical
skills. Training program
is
less concerned with platform skills of the trainer and more concerned with skills that
facilitate learning.
Learning is achieved more effectively by focusing on the learners
than on the style of lecturing. Good trainers can bring a poorly designed course to
life and make a well constructed course great. Different organization use different
123

1RC:SP:92-2010
titles like Trainer, instructor, Coach or Facilitator. These titles can be briefly defined
as follows:
i)
Trainer.
Directs the growth of learners by making them
qualified
or
proficient in a skill or task;
ii)
Instructor. Gives knowledge or information to learners
in a systematic
manner;
iii)
Coach: Instructs, demonstrates, directs, guides, and prompts learners.
He is generally concerned with methods rather than concepts and
iv)
Facilitator Makes
it easier for learners to learn. He guides a
team
towards the
results for which
it exists to achieve and then the team
maintains or improves its competency for continuing to achieve results.
3
The Art and Science of Training
The art of training lies
in the repertoire of skills that the trainer uses to train others.
It
is employing the 'technique'
in the delivery system. Some of these skills may come
naturally, while others must be practiced and learned. Although most of these skills
are based on
scientific fact or theory but knowing when and how to use them
is
more of an
art. There are three factors that must happen for a successful learning
experience to take place
(i) Knowledge: The trainer must know the subject matter.
A trainer also
provides
the
leadership,
models
behavior, and
adapts
to
learning
preferences,
(ii) Environment: The trainer must have the tools to transfer the subject
matter to the learners,
i.e. computers and software for computer classes, adequate
classroom space, course material such as lesson plans and training aids,
etc. The
trainer must fuse these training tools with the learning preferences of the learners,
(iii)
Involvement Skills: The trainer must know the learners.
It is important that trainer must
really 'know' his/her students. A trainer should have clear idea before proceeding to
class room to answer questions like 'what are the learner's real goals for being in the
classroom?' 'What are their learning styles?' 'What tools do the learners need to help
them succeed?' 'What are those tools that will help me to help the learners succeed
in the given learning environment of training?
It is the duty of the trainer to coach the
learners to become self-directed,
intrinsically motivated, goal oriented, and open to
learning.
4
Involvement Skills
Involvement skills are the inner tools employed by the trainer as distinct from external
124



======================================================================
PAGE 135 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
tools such as projectors, lesson outlines, and training. Some of the involvennent skills
needed by trainers to coach their learners to success are described below:
i)
Flexibility:
Flexibility
is
adapting
the
training
program
to meet
the
learners' needs
by
analyzing and
responding
to
individual
learner
needs. For example,
at on-site training on
'earth work compaction',
trainees are told that for embankment construction, earth work should
be consolidated under optimum moisture conditions (OMC) with each
layer moistened to +1 percent to - 2 percent of OMC. But there are no
tools available to demonstrate to check for OMC as'per BIS methods of
testfor soil. This absence of requisite tools may leave the learner with the
knowledge of testing requirement but will fall short of skills attainment,
rendering the training on earthwork compaction less than adequate.
Flexibility demands that determination of OMC by demonstration can
be shifted
to subsequent day and students are trained on other soil
parameters
like
Liquid
Limit,
Plasticity
Index,
deleterious
content,
gradation etc. This requires involvement, expertise and innovation on
the part of trainer. Trainer should be prepared to change the content
of training not only before start of training course but also during the
training program. Trainer must consistently monitor and evaluate the
learner^:' needs throughout the course of instruction and should
not
be afraid to change the instructional steps to meet the needs of the
learners.
ii)
Spontaneity: Although a good training program has structure but
it can
not be supposed to be executed
in a
rigid frame work.
Spontaneity
is the
skill to contrive an innovative approach on the spur of moment
and
is generally a result of feed back from the learner. For example,
while
on-site
training
on
'earth work compaction
of
slope'
trainer
may demonstrate that the slope of an embankment can be roughly
determined even by using a simple thread. Spontaneity also make
training program lively and more interactive.
iii)
Empathy: Empathy
is the
ability to perceive another person's view
of the world as though they were your own. Empathy differs from
sympathy
in
that sympathy connotes spontaneous emotion
rather
than
a conscious, reasoned response. Empathy with the
learners
helps trainer to have better understanding of learner's response to
the
training
being
imparted.
It also opens up
learner's
inhibitions
and limitations to trainer which help trainer in modulating his course
125



======================================================================
PAGE 136 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
presentation to make
it more comprehendible and receivable by the
learners.
iv)
Compassion: Compassion mitigates stress. Tliough some stress in the
form of arousal
is considered good as
it helps to motivate the learner.
Without some level of stress, task accomplishment is found to be casual
and tardy. However, too much stress places an additional burden on
most people. Stress level to be employed depends upon the type and
kind of learning and learners composition.
v)
Questioning: Effective questioning requires that trainer knows what he
wants to find out by questioning. He must generate interest of learner in
advance so that questions are received by them in de-stressed condition.
Using open ended questions to elicit long dialogue is considered more
effective
in training courses where
rigid manual process requirement
is not emphasized. Question asked should be short and not confusing.
The format of question should be such that the answer should suggest
a course of action. Questioning involves three elements i.e. Ask, Pause
and Call and generally called ARC method. The process of ARC runs
like
(i) Ask the question
(ii) Rause to allow learners to think. Normally
about 7 to 15 seconds may be given depending upon the difficulty of the
question. Looking at the learners will tell
if most of them look perplexed
or do they look comfortable with the question? The questions asked
should help trainer to gauge the effectiveness of his/her instruction.
It
may be noted that longer pause time and associated quietness in the
classroom can be quite disturbing to many, which
will normally force
them to answer because of the quietness. Frequent questioning
is not
considered an effective training method
(iii) Call on someone to answer
the question. Calling on someone after asking the question allows
all
the learners to think. Even
if a learner has no idea of the answer, he
is
thinking of a way not to be called upon, such as looking busy by taking
notes or fidgeting with something.
iv)
Compreliension:
It
Involves
transferring
the
ability
to
interpret and
communicate the meaning of given variables.
v)
Application:
It
implies
that
learner should be
able
to use acquired
knowledge to solve problems.
vi)
Analysis: Analysis requires that a learner should be able to examine
126



======================================================================
PAGE 137 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
material or relationships of information of constituent parts and to arrive
at some solution or response.
"i)
Synthesis:
It requires the learner should be able to combine elements
and parts into a unified entity.
"ii)
Evaluation:
It
involves
making
judgments,
appraising,
choosing,
assessing, measuring, and
critically inspecting some idea or object
and determining
its relative value or worth.
)
Getting feedbacl<: Feedback can be defined as the ability of the receiver
to change and alter the message so the intention of the communicator
or sender is understood. Trainer is expected to paraphrase the words
or restate the learners/sender's feelings or ideas
in
his own words,
rather than just repeating
their words. Feedback need
not be
in
a
verbal response,
it can well be nonverbal ones. There are five main
categories of feedback. They are listed in the order in which they occur
most frequently in daily conversations (i) Evaluative: Making a judgment
about the worth, goodness, or appropriateness of the other person's
statement.(ii) Interpretive: Paraphrasing or attempting to explain what
the
other
persons
statement mean
(iii)
Supportive:
Attempting
to
assist or bolster the other communicator
(iv) Probing: Attempting to
gain additional information, continue the discussion, or clarify a point
(v) Understanding: Attempting to discover completely what the other
communicator means by his/her statements.
)
Counseling:
Counseling
has
a
powerful,
long-term
impact on
the
learners and the effectiveness of the organization. There are two type
of counseling
- directive and non-directive.
In directive counseling, the
counselor identifies the problem and
tells the counselee what to do
about
it. Non-directive counseling means the counselee identifies the
problem and determines the solution with the help of the counselor.
The counselor has to determine which of the two or some appropriate
combination, to give for each situation.
)
Positive
reinforcement:
Throughout
the
program
of
instruction
there needs to be continuous or intermittent reinforcements. These
reinforcements are boosters which cause the 'operates' (responses)
to be learned by the learner. Reinforcement can be in the nature either
of rewards
(positive)
or punishment
(negative).
However,
negative
reinforcements have the greatest effect when they are discontinued.;
127



======================================================================
PAGE 138 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
Reinforcements do not always have to be verbal. For example, head
nods
a
form
of
gestures,
communicate
positive
reinforcement
to
learners and indicate that trainer is listening.
5.
The Learning Cycle
Learning generally goes through a process on the following pattern:
i)
The learner starts the training as a beginner. He is very enthusiastic to
learn a new
skill. He may be somewhat apprehensive because he
is
about to enter a 'change process'. He needs clear instructions because
the task
is new, and just a
little
bit of support to calm the stress of
change.
ii)
The level of guidance from the trainer becomes somewhat less so that
the learner may experiment with the learning style that works best for
him. He has now reached failure a few times in the process. Although
the trainer
still provides a
lot of technical support, emotional support
must increase to help keep his confidence high. This normally becomes
one of the toughest time for the trainer as he has to provide technical
support and emotional support. Technical support
is needed so that
the failures do not become learned. Emotional support
is required so
that the learner does not give up. The emotional feedback needs to be
specific with positive reinforcement.
ill)
At this point, the learner has become capable of performing
his new
skill. The amount of guidance drops to just a few pointers so that the
learner can experiment with his new skill. But as he
is
still not sure of
himself, the amount of emotional support stays high to help build up his
confidence.
iv)
The
learner now
returns
to
his
job.
His
supervisor
provides
little
direction and less support so that he can begin to take ownership of
his new tasks and responsibilities. He is allowed to perform. He is also
encouraged to take on new responsibilities and new assignments. The
learning cycle now repeats itself.
6
Learning Environment
6.1
Setting up the Learning Environment. Generally training environment
in the form of class room,
hall are
in place
in the training
institute building of the
128



======================================================================
PAGE 139 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
organization. A few guiding parameters can however be listed as follows:
i)
Space (square meters) for the classroom:
1 .5 to
1 .7 square meters per
participant.
ii)
Configuration of class room:
It should be as nearly square as possible.
This will bring people together both psychologically and physically. The
room should be at least 3 meter high. This allows a projection screen
to be placed high enough so the learners in the rear can see over, not
around the people in front of them. The distance from the screen to the
last seat of rows should not exceed 6W (W is screen width). Minimum
distance between screen to the front row of seats should be 2W (twice
the width of the screen). The proper viewing width
is 3W (1& 1/2 width
of screen from centerline).
iii)
Table space per student: After the PCs are placed
(if any) there should
be at least 1 .0 linear meter (with a depth of 0.6 to 0.8 meter) per learner.
This allows them to spread their papers during activities.
iv)
Type ofseating arrangement: This depends on the learning environment
that trainer
is trying to obtain and depends upon the room size and
dimensions.
6.2
Psychological
Factors
in
the
^earning
Environment:
For
various
psychological factors to be considered in the learning environment, there are number
of
learning
theories
like
Herzberg's
Hygiene
and
motivational
factors,
Douglas
McGregor's theory X and theory Y, Clayton Alderfer's Existence/Relatedness/Growth
(ERG), Vroom's
Expectancy and many more.
7
Learning Style
A learning style is a student's consistent way of responding to and using stimuli in the
context of learning. Various learning style
like VAK,
Multiple Intelligences
etc. may
be used for the transfer of instructions. For example linguistic-verbal learners tend to
think best via words. For them activities that involve hearing, listening, impromptu or
formal speaking, creative writing, documentation can be more effective. For logical-
mathematical learners activities involving formulas, graphs, drawings, mind mapping
can be used
for
learning.
Using
visual,
auditory and
kinesthetic (VAK) channels
will reinforce learning concepts. For avid learners, feeling apprehensive about new
learning, clear instructions
will be useful whereas for reluctant learners' emotional
support to help them build confidence will be required.

Transfer of Learning
Transfer of learning is the influence of prior learning on performance in a new situation.
If transfer of some
of skills and knowledge from
prior learning
is not transferred,
then each new learning situation would start from scratch. The first place to practice
transfer of learning
is within the classroom. Classroom setting makes
it much easier
to transfer new skills and knowledge to the job.
It provides practice on a variety of
tasks that enhances and quickens the learning process.
Also, the learners become
accustomed
to using their newly acquired knowledge and
skills
in novel situations
thus encouraging transfer of learning to the job. There
is generally a brief period of
slowing down of learning curve when a new set of learning
is imparted. However, the
variations
in the learning environment soon begin to strengthen previously acquired
skills and knowledge and should therefore, be encouraged. For example, practicing to
design overlay surface using a variety of methods will provide experience of arriving at
different results with different stimulus situations making new learning easier. Another
example is that greater learning occurs not by re-reading the same text, but by reading
another text on the same subject
matter. Encouraging transfer of learning
in the
classroom provides the skills and knowledge for its successful implementation outside
of the class.
It has however to be ensured that learning so transferred
in the session
is used upon the job. Transfer of learning
is useful only when
it is accompanied with a
retention plan of newly acquired skills.
9
Presentations
Presentations and
reports are ways of communicating ideas and
information
to a
group. But unlike a report, a presentation carries the speaker's personality better and
allows immediate interaction between all the participants. A good presentation has: (a)
Content:
It contains information that people need. But unlike reports, which are read
at the reader's own pace, presentations must account for how much information the
audience can absorb in one sitting, (b) Structure:
-
It has a logical beginning, middle,
and end.
It must be sequenced and paced so that the audience can understand
it.
Where as reports have appendices and footnotes to guide the reader, in presentation
the speaker must be careful not to loose the audience when wandering from the main
point of the presentation,
(c) Packaging
-
It must be well prepared. A report can be
re-read and
portions skipped
over, but with a presentation, the audience
is at the
mercy of a presenter (d) Human Element
- A good presentation will be remembered
much more than a good report because
it has a person attached to
it.
10
Increasing Effectiveness of Learning Behavior
The task of transferring new SKAs quite often threatens his self image. This makes
130



======================================================================
PAGE 141 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
changing
his
effective behavior which
is one
of the
difficult tasks
to accomplish.
Affective behavior includes the manner in which the things which
lie in the domain of
emotions
like feelings, values, appreciation, enthusiasm, motivations and
attitudes
are dealt with.
It
is, therefore, important to affirm the learner's core value such as
moral, religious, family, political etc. A learning which supports his belief and value are
more readily accepted by the learner.
If a trainer confronts the learners with learning
points that suggests they may have acted
(in the past) in a foolish or in a dangerous
manner, they become resistant to change. For example,
if
it was told by a learner
that to increase the workability of concrete (due to low W-C ratio) he had added sand
in the mix, then
it may not be proper for the trainer to call this act of his as foolish or
dangerous though
it certainly exhibited his gross ignorance about the quality aspect
of concrete work. No one wants to be told that he did something stupid. Thus,
it
is
important to remind the learner of their "goodness" in order to make various learning
points easier for him to digest. The learning will not then be so threatening because
thinking about an important value will have affirmed each learner's image of himself
or herself as a smart and capable person. Changing
affective behavior
in respect
of transfer of learning
in safety related aspects
is more difficult yet more important.
Making a learner to learn to start earth moving equipment only after checking
all the
requisite parameters (as per the equipment manual)
is more likely to be resisted as
it militates against his attitude. However transferring safety learning requires that a
learner knows the rules (knowledge), knows how to act
(skills), and have a proper
attitude for
it (affective).
11
Lesson Plan Template
Lesson plan template is a task which a trainer sets for himself
detailing out what kind
of learning he wants to transfer, how this learning will be transferred, what will be the
goal achieved etc.
in a given training time frame. Annex-7 illustrates a typical lesson
plan template. Annex-8 illustrates an indicative sample of training programme module

CHAPTER

ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION
1
Purpose of Evolution
1.1
Assessment and evaluation
is an ongoing process throughout the entire
learning, training and development program.
It is performed during the analysis, design,
development, and implementation phases.
It is also performed after the learners return
to their jobs,
its purpose is to collect and document learner's performance in a training
course, as well as on the job. The goal
in this phase
is to fix problems and make the
system better. The most exiting place in teaching is the gap between what the teacher
teaches and what the student learns. This
is where the unpredictable transformation
takes place. The transformation
is
in the form of mutation of knowledge and
skills
dividing learner's earlier world view from that of a world view of a trained person.
In that sense, the transformation
is not passive and defined, rather
in the shape of
ever evolving spiral of human development. Evaluations help to measure the gap by
determining the value and effectiveness of a learning program.
It uses assessment and
validation tools to provide data for the evaluation. Assessment is the measurement of
the practical results of the training in the work environment while validation determines
if the objectives of the training goal were met.
1.2
There are five main purposes of evaluation
(i) Feedback - Linking learning
outcomes to objectives and providing a form of quality control;
(ii) Control
- Making
links from training to organizational activities and to consider cost effectiveness;
(iii)
Research
- Determining the relationships between learning, training, and the transfer
of training to the job;
(iv) Intervention
- The
results of the evaluation influence the
context in which
it is occurring and (v) Power games - Manipulating evaluative data for
organizational politics.
2
Evaluation Categories
Evaluations are normally divided into two broad categories
(i) Formative Evaluation:
Also known as
internal,
is a method
of judging the worth
of a program while the
program activities are 'forming' (in progress). This part of the evaluation focuses on the
process. Thus, formative evaluations are basically done during training period. They
permit the learner and the instructor to monitor how well the instructional objectives
are being met.
Its main purpose is to catch deficiencies so that the proper intervention
can take place. This allows the learner to master the required
skills and knowledge.
Formative evaluation
is also useful
in analyzing learning materials, student learning
132



======================================================================
PAGE 143 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
and
achievements,
and
teacher
effectiveness.
Formative
evaluation
is
primarily
a
building process which accumulates a
series
of components
of new
materials,
skills, and problems
into an ultimate meaningful whole;
(ii) Summative Evaluation:
The summative evaluation (also know as external)
is a method of judging the worth
of a program at the end of the program activities (summation). The focus
is on the
outcome.
During
learning and
training,
a
learner undergoes
reaction followed
by
learning. Assessment at this stage
is formative evaluation.
In the next phase, when
learner utilizes his acquired skills and behaviour at work place, he 'performs' and this
performance leads to overall 'impact' on the job deliverance. Assessment at this post
training phase
is summative evaluation.
In
brief,
the reactive evaluation
is a tool to
help determine
if the objectives can be reached. The learning evaluation
is a tool to
help reach the objectives. The performance evaluation is a tool to see
if the objectives
have actually been met, while the impact evaluation
is a tool to judge the value or
worth of the objectives.
3
Instruments used in Evaluation
3.1
The various instruments used to collect the data are questionnaires, surveys,
interviews, observations, and testing. The model or methodology used to gather the
data should be a specified step-by-step procedure.
It should be carefully designed
and executed to ensure the data is accurate and valid.
3.2
Questionnaires are the least expensive procedure for external evaluations
and can be used to collect large samples of information. They should however be very
carefully designed and
trial tested before using. Trial testing
is essential to ensure
that the recipients of the questionnaire have understood their operation the way the
designer intended. When designing questionnaires, the most important feature
is
the 'guidance' given for
its completion which should be worded
in lucid and simple
language. All instructions should be clearly stated so that nothing is left for the recipients
to imagine.
4
Evaluation of Tests
One of the tools used in the evaluation process is evaluation of tests, also often called
'item analyses'.
It
is used
to 'Test the Test'.
It checks and ensures that the testing
instruments actually measure the required behaviors needed by the learners to perform
a task to standard.
It is evaluation of tests. When evaluating the tests one needs to ask
the question- 'Do the scores on the test provide information that
is really useful and
accurate in evaluating student performance?' The item analysis provides information
about the reliability and validity of test items and learner performance. Item Analysis
133



======================================================================
PAGE 144 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
has two purposes
first, to identify defective test items and secondly, to pinpoint tlie
learning materials (content) tlie learners have and have not mastered, particularly what
sl<ills they lack and what material still causes them difficulty. Item analysis is performed
by comparing the proportion of learners who pass a test item
in contrasting criterion
groups. That
is, for each question on a test, how many learners with the highest test
scores (U) answered the question correctly or incorrectly compared with the learners
who had the lowest test scores (L). The upper (U) and lower (L) criterion groups are
selected from the extremes of the distribution. The use of very extreme groups, say
the upper 10 percent and lower 10 percent, would result in a sharper differentiation,
but
it would reduce the reliability of the results because of the small number of cases
utilized.
In a normal
distribution, the optimum
point at which these two conditions
balance out is 27 percent. With the large and normally distributed samples used in the
development of standardized tests,
it
is customary to work with the upper and lower
27 percent of the criterion distribution. That means,
if the total sample contains 370
cases then the U and L groups will each include exactly 100 cases. There are formats
available which can be used for evaluating the tests for arriving at the judgment as to
whether a test item
is too easy to measure a valid performance standard or whether
the test question was worded wrong resulting in every answer being incorrect or some
group missed the training (or requires additional training) and level of absorption of
difficult concepts by the learners
etc. The item analysis thus identifies deficiencies
either in the test or in the instruction.
5
Evaluation, Effectiveness and Relevance
Training evaluation
is a measurement technique that examines the extent to which
the training programmes meet the intended goals. The evaluation measures used
depend on the goals and can
include
evaluation
of training content and
design,
changes
in learners, and organizational payoffs. Training effectiveness
is the study
of the variables that are
likely to influence training outcome at different stages
(i.e.
before, during and
after) of the training process. The 'effectiveness' variablos have
the potential to increase or decrease the likelihood of successful training outcome and
are typically studied
in three broad categories: individual, training, and organizational
characteristics.
The
training
evaluation
thus
is
a
methodological
approach
for
measuring learning outcomes whereas training effectiveness
is theoretical approach
for
understanding
those
outcomes.
Training
evaluation
provides
a
microview
of
training results and training effectiveness gives a macroview of training outcomes.
Evaluation seeks to find the benefits of training to individuals
in the form of learning
and
enhanced
on-the-job
performance.
Effectiveness
seeks
to
the
benefit
the
organization by determining why individual learned or did not learn. Finally, evaluation
134



======================================================================
PAGE 145 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
results describe 'what' happened as a
result of training
intervention.
Effectiveness
findings tell 'why' those results happened and so assist the training experts to develop
prescriptions for improving training programme. Relevance has contextual worth. The
first three-levels of evaluation strategies- Reaction, Learning, and Performance are
'soft' measurements. Training programs are however approved
in the organization
generally on the basis of level four measurements
i.e. their returns or impacts. Each
level
contributes
to the
effectiveness
of the
next
level,
(i) Reaction
informs how
relevant the training
is to the work the learners perform.
It measures how well the
'training requirement analysis' processes worked. (ii)Learning informs the degree of
relevance that the training package worked to transfer KSAs from the training material
to the learners.
It measures how well the 'design and development' processes worked.
(iii) The performance level informs the degree that the learning can actually be applied
to the learner's job.
It measures how well the 'performance analysis' process worked.
(iv) Impact informs the 'return' the organization receives from the training. The return
can be
'soft'
like
client
satisfaction,
loyalty
to the organization
or
'hard'
like
cost
effectiveness or higher output per unit time.

CHAPTER 14
DOCUMENTATION FOR HRD AND HRB
1
Retrospection
Study of growth of highway sector in India since early twentieth century to present day
amply highlights the fact that Indian highways have evolved and grown with increasing
complexitieswiththeirlargelysuccessful managementwhether in thefield oftechnologies
and their application, growing multiplicity of players, or in the multiplicity of areas of
professional expertise. This achievement could not have been accomplished without
corresponding growth and innovation in the field of organizational structure, processes
and practices. The competence at individual
level
in
all professional disciplines has
also grown contributing at individual, group and organization level for the successful
translation of targets set out
in Nagpur Plan, Bombay Plan and Lucknow Plan
into
a
realty.
Till recently Highway Sector was funded, planned, designed and managed
by Central or State Governments. Human resource development and management
therefore more
or less remained
a
part of overall
organizational management by
respective governments with rules, regulations governing HR functions like recruitment,
planning, promotions, rewards and punishment, duly codified somewhat
in archaic
manner, not leaving enough space for the organization to build and develops human
resources geared
to
serve
its
objectives
in
most
efficient manner.
Training
and
development functions likewise could not be accorded due place and recognition in the
overall organization
management. This resulted in an organization output which was
not uniform across
all of its activities but showed efficiency in disaggregated manner
largely dependent on the competencies of individual who happen to be entrusted with
the job deliverance as can be seen
in highly varying quality of road construction and
maintenance especially of State highways, MDR and ODRs.
2
Initiatives for Changes
2.1
The
mismatch
between
the
demand
placed
by
the
technology,
environmental considerations, enhanced quality and safety standards, entry of private
players, innovative contract management instruments etc. on one side and need for
the organization structure
to respond such challenges
in an
effective and
efficient
manner on the other side forced many State Governments to undertake review for
reorienting and reorganizing their departments. With the World Bank assistance, the
States of Andhra Pradesh,
Gujarat,
Orissa, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu completed
their Institutional Development Strategy (IDS) studies and recommended sustainable
136



======================================================================
PAGE 147 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
improvement to the institutional frameworl<, policies and financing capacities to enable
them
to undertake
effective and
efficient management of road network and meet
transport demand of its users. At Central Government level such reorganization led to
creation of NHAI built on the sound philosophy of remaining lean and thin with teams
of highway professionals to manage projects through contractors and consultants.
These initiatives though taken in right direction and yielded desired results, the general
perception in terms of desired level of comfort, convenience and safety to road users
leave much
to be desired
in terms
of HR management and development by the
organization to harness
full potential of
its workforce and apply them
in congruence
with the organizational intent and objectives. This calls for placing HR development
and management on sound
footing as
a
deliberate and conscious management
policy.
In short, while initiatives taken in this direction are worth appreciation,
it can be
concluded that lot of work is yet to be done for HRD and HRM.
3
HRD and HRM for all Players in Highway Sector
3.1
In
present day
context,
besides Government departments, many other
important
players have emerged
in
private
sector. The
list
includes
Contractors,
Consultants, Testing
Laboratories, Research
Institutes, Concessionaries,
Financial
Institutions, Equipment Manufacturers, Material Manufacturers, Suppliers and many
others. Thus when HRD and HRM requirements are considered,
is necessary that
all players involved
in Highways Sector should
initiate the change and transform to
effective vibrant organizations to undertake challenges of present and future.
3.2
There
is a need
for research and documentation
to study evolution
of
organization structure over the time to enable one to study in the Highway sector, the
response to planning, design, management of construction and maintenance during
different phases of evolution. Besides different kind of problems faced by them when
confronted with growing complexity of highway sector and adoption by organizations
to such changes including their break up and development of new organizations, their
reorientation, re-engineering etc. should be studied.
4
Necessity to Modernize Organizations
4.1
There is a need to study slippages in the target achievements with respect
to inadequacies
in organization structure, coordination among various line and staff
function units, decision hierarchy, competence related issues at individual, group and
process level, interdepartmental decision process flow and other issues where HRD
intervention is called for. Such studies should be a part of organizational development
strategy and
documented as a conscious exercise on regular basis for taking timely
137



======================================================================
PAGE 148 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
corrective actions relating to skill and competency related gaps and creating congruence
between individual's development with the organization's objectives. There is need for
documenting the jobs, roles, goals, duties and responsibilities of various action nodes.
There
is need to undertake Jobs and their analysis, various tasks and activities to be
performed
in a given job and process linkages to enable management to assess the
training and development need for the job performer and accordingly build training
modules
to impart
right kind of training. This
is essential for bridging competence
related gaps followed by suitable management of individual for utilization of newly
acquired skills and knowledge towards fulfillment of organization's objectives.
4.2
It is absolutely necessary that all organizations working for Highway Sector
should follow the processes and programmes for HRD and HRM as brought out
in
this document.
In fact methodology for study, analysis and training contained herein
provides comprehensive guidelines for evolving training and development programme.
Depending on available capabilities, studies for HRD and HRM can be done within
or by outsource sing. A road map
is necessary to appreciate and programme action
to be taken
for HRD and HRM and
thereafter
to implement the programme
by
vigorous monitoring. The importance of such
initiatives should be understood with
all
seriousness.
Broadly the
organization development follows
a
path
of tackling
competence related issues which are generally solved through T&D of individuals
and later on when demand
placed on the organization can no longer be addressed
through competency based solution or when existing organization structure
fails to
adequately respond to externalities; through restructuring of organization.
5
Restructuring of Organizations
5.1
For restructuring of organizations not much work on scientific basis
has
been done
in our country. As already brought out only a few studies were done that
too due to insistence by World Bank. The critical analysis of implementation of these
studies
is required to be deliberated and should be made available to
all concerned
for future guidance.
5.2
HRD committee
is deliberating on "Restructuring of Organizations" and an
approach as outlined below is being adopted for drafting a Manual on this subject.
a)
The Vision 2021 document of Ministry of Road Transport and Highways
has identified a number of measures to accomplish the vision that need
our attention, however the primary concern should be the quality and
effectiveness of the Contractors' setup at the field level where the work
is actually executed and which eventually decides the quality, speed
138



======================================================================
PAGE 149 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
and durability of the end product.
b)
During last 50 years or so the organizational structures of government
departments have remained more or less same whereas large changes
in
systems,
methods and
environment have
taken
place. So
the
existing organizational setup of the Employer (including the Engineer)
that controls the contractors' activities needs to be looked
into so as
to make the same effectively cope with the present day functional and
delivery requirements.
c)
It
is necessary to study model structure of a construction company,
which,
in a way, deals with the works
in a business
like manner and
aims to be effective and productive in delivery. Ways and means will be
found to make
it more efficient, while at the same time study some non
performers.
d)
Earlier
World
Bank
had
studied
a
few
organizations.
Perhaps
restructuring of organization was carried out in a few states including
Andhra Pradesh. Targets set in recommendations need to be compared
with actual performance.
e)
With
the
growing
Public
Private
Partnerships,
Consultancy
Organi-zations are
increasingly
playing an
important
role and
their
effectiveness
is
also
crucial.
Therefore
Organizational
aspects
of
consultants also need to be looked into.
6
Preparedness to undertake Training and Development
6.1
It
is abundantly clear that on the basis of this document comprehensive
studies are necessary to initiate training and development of all individuals in different
organizations
in the Highway Sector. Some organizations have a separate training
institute. These training institutes undertake training based on past experience and
adhoc feedback for requirements. Generally comprehensive studies to evolve training
necessity, target groups,
methodology, assessment of gains, feedback
in
fulfilling
objectives of organizations etc., are not done.
It is necessary to conduct scientific study
to evolve training modules to suit the organization. The implementation is very difficult
task particularly because trainers are really not adequately trained. Generally, training
should be given
by the professionals having background of practice of engineering.
Training should not be imparted by an individual not having adequate field /planning/
design experience. Training
is not sharing the knowledge gained by books but by
knowledge gained by practice. Still these professionals imparting training need training
139



======================================================================
PAGE 150 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
as trainer.
Thus regular training programmes for training of trainers are necessary
and this initiative should be taken by NITHE and other similar institutions.
6.2
On
the
Sl<ill
Development
front
of workmen,
the weakest
link
is
non-
availability of trainers.
For workmen
the
trainer should
have
the knowledge and
experience
in working for the trade and should demonstrate the work with
his own
hands. Good workmen sometimes have
difficulty to communicate because of lack of
education. Therefore for success of the scheme for workmen training,
it is absolutely
necessary to identify trainers and then train them. Here also institutions
like NITHE
can take initiative and start training courses for training of trainers for workmen.
6.3
Training and Development for upgrading the
skills are necessary for
all
individuals
involved
in Highway
Sector. By and
large, these
involved
in Highway
Sector,
are
classified
under two
categories. These
are,
(i)
Professionals and
(ii)
Workmen. Professionals include engineers, architects, planners, designers, financial
managers, administrators
etc. These professionals work for different organizations
such as Govt, departments, public undertakings, research organizations, contractors,
consultants, concessionaries etc. In broader sense, even contractors, consultants and
head of these organizations fall under this category. Other category include, workmen
who perform physical work and produce tangible output with their skills. Workmen
of different disciplines and
categories work
for Highway Sector include
surveyor,
laboratory assistants, supervisors,
civil workers (such as masons/carpenters
etc.),
electricians, mechanics, foremen, machine operators, store assistants etc.
7
Training and Development of Professionals
7.1
Training
and
Development
of
such
professionals
like
Consultants,
Contractors
etc.
is
therefore
very
important
and
need
attention
of
concerned
authorities.
Professionals
like
engineers,
join
the Highway Sector
after acquiring
basic engineering or equipment qualification. But Consultants and Contractors do
not need such
qualification and they start the business
in
this
field
like any other
business. They
all need training but there are no structured training requirements
for professionals. Several developed countries like U.S.A, Australia and Japan have
norms for obligatory training requirements for engineers for which training courses
are conducted accordingly.
In our country structured programmes
for professional
development and
certification
at different stages of career are yet to finalized and
standardized.
It is a huge task and there are several impediments.
7.2
It is felt that Highway Sector should initiate for standardization of structured
training
programmes.
These
programmes
should
cover
technical,
financial,
140



======================================================================
PAGE 151 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
administrative, planning, design and several other areas. The HRD committee
is
working for finalizing of such structured training programmes and syllabus for these
programmes. To start with these programmes can be conducted on voluntary basis
but with the passage of time these should become obligatory and certification should
be done by a national agency. Being a huge and ambitious programme,
it will need
training institutes, trainers, financing and other infrastructure. The conceptualization
and
standardization
of training needs can be done by IRC under the guidance
of Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH) and
with the support
of
NITHE.
8
Policy for Skill Development of Workmen
8.1
For implementation of any project, the role of workmen
is most important.
Unless workmen have requisite skills and their skills are certified, quality work cannot
be expected.
In fact the construction industry
is growing fast and
it has to compete
internationally. The availability of requisite skills in terms of nature, quality and numbers
is a major concern.
In 2008, the Ministry of Labour and Employment, Govt, of India,
announced the National Policy on Skills Development and of Workmen for Highway
Sector. The overall role, mission and objectives of this policy are as follows.
a)
Role
•
Enhancing
an
individual's
employability and
ability
to
adopt
to
changing technologies and labour market demands;
•
Strengthening
productivity,
competiveness,
and
supporting
the
'
process of economic growth;
•
Creating employment opportunities by attracting FDI and business
expansion on the substrate of availability of relevant skills;
b)
Mission
National
Skills
Development System
is
aimed
at empowering
all
individuals
through
improved
skills,
knowledge
and
internationally
recognized qualifications to enable access to decent employment and
promote
inclusive growth and ensure
India's competitiveness
in the
global market.
c)
Objectives
•
Create
opportunities
for
all
to
acquire
skills throughout
life and
especially for younger people and new entrants to workforce.
141



======================================================================

«
Promote
commitment
by
all
stakeholders
to
invest
in
skills
development.
•
Develop
high-quality
skilled
workforce
relevant
to
current
and
emerging market needs.
•
Enable establishment of flexible training mechanisms that respond
meaningfully
to
the
characteristics
of a wide
range
of
training
providers and the trainees' needs.
•
Enable
effective
coordination
between
different
ministries
and
synergize efforts of the Centre and the States.
d)
Coverage
•
School/ institution based training.
•
Formal apprenticeship.
•
Workplace learning and training by industry.
•
Adult learning and retraining.
•
Non-formal training and learning.
•
Informal apprenticeship.
.
•
Lifelong learning.
•
Vocational Education as well as Vocational Training.
8.2
Based on National Policy, the Ministry of Labour and Employment evolved
Skill Development
Initiative Scheme. Documents such as Implementation Manual,
Guidelines for Selection of Vocational Training Providers under
Skill Development
Scheme and Course Curricula for Short Term Courses based on Modular Employble
Skills were drafted. This documentation by the Ministry covers construction sector
but a number of categories of workmen for Highway Sector are not included. The
documentation
by
the
Ministry
also
mentions
that
the
skill
level and
education
attainment of the workforce determines the productivity as well as the ability to adapt to
the changing industrial environment. A majority of Indian workforce does not possess
marketable skills which is an impediment in getting decent employment and improving
their economic condition. While India has large young population, only 5 percent of
the Indian labour force in the age group of 20-24 years has obtained vocational skills
through formal means whereas the percentage
in
industrialized
countries
varies
between 60 percent to 96 percent. Only about 25 Lacs vocational training seats are
142



======================================================================
PAGE 153 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
available
in the country whereas about 128 Lacs persons enter the labour market
every year.
Even out of these training places, very few are available for early school
dropouts. This signifies that a large number of school dropouts do not have access to
skill development for improving their employability.
The educational requirements at entry level and long duration of courses of the formal
training system are some of the impediments for a person to acquire
skills for his
livelihood. Further, the largest share of new jobs
in India
is likely to come from the
unorganized sector
like construction that employs upto 93 percent of the national
workforce, but most of the training programmes cater to the needs of the organized
sector.

Workmen Training and Certification in IHigiiways Sector
9.1
The most important issue which needs attention
in Highway Sector is skill
development and certification of workmen, which include Supervisors, Civil Workers,
Machine Operators, Mechanics,
Electricians, Surveyors, Laboratory Assistants
etc.
Training and certification of workmen,
is difficult for implementation.
9.2
Following difficulties are noted in training and certification of workmen,
a)
Government at policy level is interested for training and certification of
workmen but at implementation level contract management executives
are not sensitized. Provisions made in the contract document by different
organizations like NHAI, Central PWD etc. with regard to training and
certification of workmen are not implemented
in
real
spirit. Contract
management authorities are, at times not aware of such provisions. To
expect them to be proactive is difficult preposition,
if not impossible.
b)
Contractors, sub-contractors, Petty Contractors and Labour Contractors
are not interested
in training and certification of workmen.
They do
not gain anything and may even at times feel that after training and
certification the workmen can demand higher wages, so
it may not be
in their (Contractor's) interest to train workmen.
c)
Workmen are
interested and desirous
for training and
certification.
They are interested even for upgradation of their skills. But they cannot
afford the training financially. The expenditure for trainers and loss of
wages during training period are major areas of concern. Besides, job
of workmen is temporary and seasonal so they cannot think of leaving
the project for the sake of training.

9.3
It is felt that the best course to empower workmen by training,
is to impart
the training at the project site. But there
is difficulty about financing because funds
for training are provided by DGET only
if training organization has a training institute
with adequate training
facilities. Therefore, NGOs and training
institutes interested
in
training
of workmen
at
project
site cannot get financial
assistances.
Policy by
DGET needs review particularly for training and
certification of workmen
at project
site. Besides, provision of Workmen Welfare Cess Act is not covering training under
its scope. The issue
will have to be taken up with State Governments and Central
Government, to provide finance for training from funds collected through Workmen
Welfare Cess.
9.4
In order to empower workmen by training and certification,
it
is necessary
that at
all major project sites training facilities should be arranged by Employer and
Contractor with the help of Training
Institutes and NGOs. As most of the workmen
are having acquired
skill by hands-on training,
it will be easy to train them. To start
with "gap analysis" should be done of
all workmen individually, to ascertain training
input required to achieve desired standards. Training can be arranged
in the manner
that they get class rooms training beyond normal working hours and practical training
during the period, they work for the project. After the training is completed, trade tests
should be conducted through approved agency of DGET and then certificate issued.
For small
projects,
particularly
in
rural areas and small towns
etc. where contract
package size
is small,
it will be necessary to impart classroom training at a central
place and practical training at the respective project sites.
10
Financing of HRD and HRM
10.1
HRD and HRM are necessity of time and broad outline for action
to be
taken has already been brought out in this document.
10.2
For restructuring of organizations earlier initiatives
in Government Sector
were with World Bank and ADB financing. Similarly proposals can always be framed
as per specific requirements for financing by international financing agencies. Besides,
restructuring can be a part of cadre review proposals. For Contractors, Consultants
and other Private Sector Organizations, the funds for restructuring should not be an
impediment as
finally the expenditure on establishment
is reduced and
efficiency
increased.
10.3
Financing
of
training
and
development
of
professionals
employed
by
Government or Private Organizations
is generally done from establishment budget
with or without specific provision for training.
Major organizations like Central PWD
144



======================================================================
PAGE 155 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
have their own training institutes and expenditure to be incurred for training institutes
is part of establishment expenditure. Once the training activity is enhanced, funds for
training can also be correspondingly incurred. Thus by and large, funds may not be a
constrain for training.
10.4
Financing of training for Workmen has
its own difficulty. The scheme given
by Ministry of Labour, Govt, of India has provision of financial assistance to training
organizations. Workmen already at the project site are also to be trained and funds
are
required
for such
training
but no funds are
available.
In order to make such
training financially viable, training institutes and NGO's will have to be funded either
by Employer or State Labor Departments, which
is collecting Workmen Welfare Cess
for construction projects.

Annex-1
(Chapter 8 Clause 2.2)
Categories of Learning
Learning can be divided
it into three major categories:
a)
Cognitive - mental skills (Knowledge).
It includes (a) Verbal Knowledge
- factual and prepositional knowledge
(b) Knowledge Organization
-
how information and concepts are mentally arranged (c) Meta-cognitive
Strategies
- allocation and regulation of cognitive resources
b)
Affective - growth in feelings or emotional areas (Attitude).
It includes (a)
Attitude
- attitude about learning, self-efficacy, perception about ability
to perform, and goal setting (b) Motivation
- motivational disposition.
c)
Psychomotor
-
manual
or
physical
skills
(Skills).
It
includes
(a)
Compilation
-
routine
development
and
procedure
linkage
(b)
Automaticity
-
ability to perform a task without conscious monitoring
and with other tasks.
These three domains are divided into other learning processes. However, these three
major domains are important to trainers as although a new behavior might be learned
in a variety of methods,
it can always be traced back to three major activities.
a)
Cognitive (Knowledge) - mental skills where the brain must be used to
perform intellectual tasks.
b)
Affective
(Attitude)
- best described as "coming from
the
heart," -
values,
beliefs system
influencing the learning
like learner resisting
learning which militates against certain principles held by him as sacred.
Attitude prompts learner to say that just because he knows something,
does not mean that he will act upon
it.
c)
Psychomotor (Skills)
- physical skills where the body must coordinate
muscular
activities
like
applying
brake
and
changing
gears
simultaneously.

Purpose: To determine
if a task should be trained. The first four sections are used to

======================================================================
PAGE 169 of 192
======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
determine
if
it sliould be trained. Tlie last two sections will be of aid
in selecting the
type of training. Depending upon the task, not all questions require an answer.
TASK: For example, lifting a flyover segment and placing in position.
a)
Required
by
Law,
Contract,
Safety
Factors,
Organizational
Requirements
1)
Is the
training mandated by the Occupational Safety and Health
Act? Yes
ii)
Is
training
required
to achieve safety standards as contained
in
contract? Yes
iii) Is there a chance that someone may
hurt or that damages may
occur
if
it is not trained? Yes
iv) Is training needed to ensure that employees want of performance
standards do not lead to contractual/legal complication for the firm/
organization? Yes
v)
Is training required to meet firms/ organization's vision or mission?
Yes - To, provide a safe worl<ing environment for all personal and
safety to public.
vi) Is the training required to meet organizational goals or objectives?
No
Generally, any 'yes' answers
is this section requires training or another performance
initiative. Analyst's recommendation: Training must be provided.
b)
Use of Another Performance Initiative
i)
Is there another solution, such as a job performance aid? No,
as the
activity
is
critical and has
to be repeated
frequently.
It
is
suggested to have class room presentation and activity sequencing
learning which will be followed by on-job demonstration.
ii) Can people be hired that have already been trained? Yes, but
it
will be preferred to have the training given by those engaged on the
job on- site.
iii) To what extent can the task be learned on the job? Training will
only be, provided
to ensure that trainees have assimilated
all the
159



======================================================================
PAGE 170 of 192
======================================================================
!RC:SP:92-2010
required sequences of activities, safety precaution requirement of
each and every step so that they l<now how to operate safely. The
rest of the training will be provided on the job.
iv) Are
the
demands
(perceptual,
cognitive,
psychomotor
or
physical) imposed by the task excessive? They require good
perception (must be able to
lift 40 tonne segment to a height of 1 0-1
2
meters and place them in sequence in air followed by final placement
on the
pier.) and they require some manual dexterity to manipulate
the controls. Also, they are required to stand for a long period. They
are also required to maintain calm and composure during prolonged
period due to slow but accurate placement of segment.
v) Are other performance
interventions
required? None
at
this
time.
vi) Is
there
another
creative
solution
that
better
meets
the
organization's
needs
(brainstorming
required
to
correctly
answer this question)? Not at this time.
Another performance solution
is generally recommended
if
it is cheaper or
if
it better

ii) How
often
is the task performed
during
a
specified
time frame
(e.g, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)? Throughout the day.
iii) How much
time
is needed
to
perform
this
task? Normal task
completion is about 30 to 60 minutes; however
it is performed
throughout the day on a continuous basis.
iv) What
behaviors
are
used
in
its
performance?
Coordinated
movement of material with other personnel, continuous review
of activity sequence with other personal, alignment technique
using basic math.
v) How critical
is the task to the performance of the job? Extremely
critical.
vi) What information is needed to perform the task? Segment number,
its
location sequence in the loading span.
vii)What
is the source of information? Communication with casting
yard, job work plan, identification mark on the segment.
Generally, complex and frequently performed tasks
require
training, while simpler
and infrequently performed tasks require other performance solutions (such as job
performance aids).
e)
Collective (team considerations)
i)
Does
execution
of the
task
require
coordination between
other
personnel or with other tasks? Yes, must work
in tandem with
control operator to move the segment at the designated location
accurately.
ii)
If it is one of a set of collective tasks, what is the relationship between
the various tasks? The segment lifting and placing in alignment
is
followed
by
the
task
of accurate
abutting
of segment,
temporary fastening of segment, placing of segment on pier
and post tensioning of segment.
Identifying the collective degree of the task plays important role
in determining the
forward and backward activities requirements to which conformance of the performance
standard of task to be trained should meet.

People, Data, Things Instrument
Purpose:
It helps to understand the main function of the job. Jobholder performs the
tasks assigned to him. Such tasks may have a focus either on people like management,
or data like design engineer or things like operating a bulldozer. Performance deficiency
is likely to result
if there is a mismatch between the employee's preference and the job
he is performing. For example,
if employee shows preference for design (data) but he
IS put on site execution (thing) then his performance may suffer because of mismatch
between employee's and job focus. Although most jobs entail that the jobholder works
with
all three functions, there
is usually one or two functions that the job extensively
focuses upon.
Listing
all job
responsibilities under one of the three categories
will
provide the information as to what major role an employee will be expected to fulfill -a
people person, a data person, or a thing person.
Instructions: Table shown below, contains a number of verbs to assist the analyst in
selecting the correct category:

Learning Domains Taxonomy
1
The Three Types of Learning: There is more than one type of learning. A
committee of colleges, led by Benjamin Bloom, identified three domains of educational
activities:
Cognitive: mental skills (Knowledge)
Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas (Attitude)
Psychomotor: manual or physical skills (Skills)
Domains can be thought of as categories. Trainers often refer to these three domains
as KSA (Knowledge, Skills, and Attitude). This taxonomy of learning behaviors can be
thought of as "the goals of the training process." That is, after the training session, the
learner should have acquires new skills, knowledge, and/or attitudes. The committee
also produced an elaborate compilation for the cognitive and affective domains, but
none for the psychomotor domain. This compilation divides the three domains
into
subdivisions, starting from the simplest behavior to the most complex. The divisions
outlined are not absolutes and there are other systems or hierarchies that have been
devised
in the educational and training world.
/
2
Cognitive Domain: The
cognitive domain
involves knowledge and
the
development of intellectual
skills. This includes the
recall or recognition of specific
facts, procedural patterns, and concepts that serve in the development of intellectual
abilities and
skills. There are six major categories, which are
listed
in order below,
starting from the simplest behavior to the most complex. The categories can be thought
of as degrees of difficulties. That is, the first one must be mastered before the next one
can take place.

(b) Responding
to
Phenomena:
Active
participation on the part of the learners.
Attends
and
reacts
to
a
particular
phenomenon.
Learning outcomes may
emphasize compliance
in

(c) Valuing: The worth
or value
a person
attaches
to
a
particular
object,
phenomenon, or behavior. This ranges
from
simple
acceptance
to
the
more
complex state of commitment. Valuing
is
based
on
the
internalization
of
a
set
of
specified
values,
while
clues
to these values
are expressed
in
the
learner's overt behavior and are often
identifiable.

(d) Internalizing
values
(characterization):
Has a value system that controls their
behavior.
The
behavior
is
pervasive,
consistent,
predictable,
and
most
importantly,
characteristic
of
the
learner.
Instructional
objectives
are
concerned
with
the
student's
general
patterns of adjustment (personal, social,
emotional).
Examples:
Shows
self-reliance when
working
independently.
Co-operates
in group
activities
(displays teamwork).
Uses an
objective approach
in problem solving.
Displays a professional
commitment to ethical practice on a daily basis. Revises judgments
and changes behavior in light of new evidence. Values people for
what they are, not how they look.

displays,
influences,
listens,
modifies,
performs,
practices,
proposes,
qualifies,
questions,
revises, serves, solves, verifies.
4.Psychomotor: The psychomotor domain includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-
skill areas. Development of these skills requires practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, distance,
procedures, or techniques in execution. The seven major categories listed progresses from the simplest behavior
to the most complex:
Category
Example and Key Words
a)
Perception: The ability to use sensory
cues to guide motor activity. This ranges
from sensory
stimulation,
through cue
selection, to translation.
Examples: Adjust theodolite
level by looking
at the
position
of
water bubble.;

differentiates,
distinguishes, identifies, isolates, relates, selects.
b)
Set:
Set means
readiness
to
act.

includes mental, physical, and emotional
sets. These three sets are dispositions
that predetermine a person's response
to different situations (sometimes called
mindsets).
Examples:
Know
and
act
upon
a
sequence
of
steps
in
a
manufacturing
process;

IRC:SP:92-2010
c)
Guided Response: The early stages
in
learning
a complex
skill
that
includes
imitation and trial and error. Adequacy of
performance is achieved by practicing.
Examples: Perform a mathematical equation as demonstrated;
Follow instructions to build a model; Respond to hand-signals of
instructor while learning to operate a forklift.
Keywords: copies, traces, follows, react, reproduce, responds
d)
Mechanism:
This
is
the
intermediate
stage in learning a complex skill. Learned
responses have become
habitual and
the movements can be performed with
some confidence and proficiency.
Examples:
Use MS Project to find
critical path; Repair a leaking
tape;. Drive a
car.
Key
Words:
assembles,
calibrates,
constructs,
dismantles,
displays,
fastens,
fixes,
grinds,
heats,
manipulates,
measures,
mends, mixes, organizes, sketches.
e)
Complex Overt Response: The
skillful
performance of motor acts that involve
complex movement patterns. Proficiency
is
indicated
by
a
quick,
accurate,
and
highly
coordinated
performance,
requiring
a
minimum
of
energy.
This
category
includes
performing
without
hesitation, and automatic performance.
For
example,
players
are
often
utter
sounds
of satisfaction or expletives as
soon as they hit a tennis ball or throw a
football, because they can tell by the feel
of the act what the result will produce.
Examples: Maneuver quickly a car
into a
tight
parallel
parking
spot; Operate a software quickly and accurately.
Key Words: assembles, builds, calibrates, constructs, dismantles,
displays,
fastens,
fixes,
grinds,
heats,
manipulates,
measures,
mends, mixes, organizes, sketches.
NOTE: The Key Words are the same as Mechanism, but will have
adverbs or adjectives that indicate that the performance is quicker,
better, more accurate, etc.
f)
Adaptation:
Skills
are
well
developed
and the individual can modify movement
patterns to fit special requirements.
Examples: Perform a task with a machine that
it was not originally
intended to do (machine is not damaged and there is no danger in
performing the new task).
Key Words:
adapts,
alters,
changes,
rearranges,
reorganizes,
revises, varies.
g)
Origination:
Creating
new
movement
patterns
to
fit a
particular
situation
or
specific
problem.
Learning outcomes
emphasize creativity based upon highly
developed skills.
Examples:
Construct
a
new
theory;
Develop
a
new
and
comprehensive training programming.
Key Words: arranges,
builds, combines, composes, constructs,
creates, designs,
initiate, makes, originates.

(Chapter 11 Clause 8.23)
,
Various Types of Training/System Methods
1
Action learning sets: Involve a group of people convening to bring to the
set real work problem, supporting and challenging each other. Each participant work
on his or her problem between set meetings and brings new information and solution
back to group. Typically group meets once a month for half a day and for a period of
six months. Learning
is through questioning.
2
Action maze: Similar to case study, but uses printed instructions to guide
through to pre-determined conclusions.
It is called maze because choices and options
are offered at certain stages- rather like pathways. Discovery of preferred paths are the
main outcome of this exercise.
It involves learning through incorrect decision making.
3
Brainstorming: Creative ideas from participants. Group are allowed to submit
ideas or suggestions and none are rejected. No discussion and value judgments are
made at this stage. All ideas can be rearranged and assessed later.
It is good fun and
very creative, allowing a
lot of participant input with no discussion. Participants feel
sense of ownership of ideas.
4
Bulletin
board/newsgroup/computer
conferencing:
provides
specialist
information and discussion on specified topics. Very interactive as one question posted
can be responded by many other people.
5
Business game simulations: Dynamic
exercises or case studies involving
'coming to terms' with a situation, then managing via a set of imposed decision.
It offers
practice in management in decision, observation, analysis etc.
It stills confidence.
6
Buzz groups: small groups, often formed after an input session, answer a
set question or complete a set task and report back to trainer or the rest of the group.
It helps in rapid gain in knowledge. Good group support engendered.
7
Case study: Examination of events or real
life situation, usually aimed
at
learning by analyzing detailed material and defining solutions to a problem.
It provides
god setting for discussing various problem solving approaches.
8
CDROM/CD
writes:
Allows
trainees
to
present
their own
views
and
submission for checking by tutor at his convenience.
It is an effective self-motivating
learning. Retrieval of text, picture makes learning process interactive and computer
oriented.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:92-2010
9
CBT: learner-managed coverage of programmed material, usually involving
keyboard and screen. Compatible hardware and software needed. CBT offers work
place
simulations
incorporating
sound,
animation,
stills,
video
clips
thus
offering
learners an insight to applications in practice.
10
Computer Supported
Collaborative
Learning
(CSCL):
Involves hand-on
experiencesforlearnersvia a computersupported environment. Simulation environment
can be located anywhere on internet. Gains through shared understanding.
11
Continuing
professional
development
(CPD):
Enables
individual
to
systematically build and improve their personal profile in a given profession. Enables
individual to broaden their knowledge, skills and qualities necessary for carrying out
their professional and technical duties.
12
Discovery learning: Learning without a teacher but
in a controlled set-up,
and under supervision. Offers challenges and
build confidence as learners master
new skills. Time constraint does not affect learning process.
13
Discussion:
Free exchange
of
information,
opinions,
etc. A
'controlled'
discussion may follow a planned path with leader controlling the agenda.
Individual
participation may be affected by group composition. Promotes group cohesion.
14
Distance education (DE): Courses offered from a distance. Nowadays they
make use of information and telecommunication technology (ICT). Enables access to
education for those who are unable to attend conventional courses.
15
Exercises: Carries out a particular task along prescribed lines. Often a test
of knowledge earlier communicated. Highly active form of learning; satisfies needs for
practice to apply knowledge or develop skills.
16
Experiential learning: A cyclical process whereby learners gain experience
and then reflect on
it. Individual carry out tasks and then in small groups describe and
recall their 'experiences'
at the
level of relationships, emotions, and feelings. New
ideas emerges that can be tested
in other environment.
17
Films and
videos:
Visual
lectures,
often
in dramatized
form. Expensive
unless produced at mass scale like for Open University. Dramatized version of lecture
enhances motivation.
18
Fish
bowl
exercise: An
inner
circle
of people
doing
the
exercise
are
observed by an outer circle-hence 'fish bowl'. Inner and outer circle than swap. Allows
observational skills to improve.

19
Instructions:
Formula
based
on
'teaching'
session.
Follows
steps-
tell,
show, do, and review process and
results. Design/balance of sessiion
is important.
Confidence is built by mastery and linkages of steps. Provides vehicles for feedback to
instructor.
1
20
In-tray methods: Often used in time management training. Uses a simulated
in-tray with a just a few or many tasks, and participants have order tasks, allocate
times, and explain reasons behind decisions. Participant has to decide priorities, make
decisions, read items, interpret and carry out sets of instructions all with interruptions
and distractions. Very participant-centered with high transfer of learning.
21
Language laboratory: Individual booths equipped with audio program and
linked to a central tutor. Good for early practices but cannot replace eventual need to
practice in public, increases confidence as embarrassment factor is less apparent.
22
Lecture:
Structured,
planned
talk.
Usually accompanied by visual
aids,
e.g., overhead projector slides (OHPs), Power Point slides, flip charts. A lively style
is
needed. Communication of material may be limited
if no feedback to lecturer. Unless
structure is carefully planned and
is animated, audience will tend to lose attention.
23
Multimedia and video conferencing: Although hardware and software can
be
still expensive, this allows contact between distributed sites and where distance
makes travel time and cost prohibitive. Allows two-way interactive communication.
24
Networked learning: Abroad term that means learning is through the medium
of ICT. Prepares individual for lifelong learning through ICT.
25
Open forum: Panel of experts with different views exchanged on the given
topic. Allows participants to interact with outside experts and colleague expertise. Can
deflect difficult questions away from trainers and facilitators.
26
Open learning: Courses and training schemes that are intended to meet
the individual educational needs of learners. Makes education more flexible and also
provides more equitable learning experience.
27
Outdoor development programmes: Dynamic open-air exercises that are
usually carried out
in teams. Traditionally for recreation pursuit but nowadays used
for community
projects. Some
participants may
not accept relevance
of physical
environment.
28
Problem- based
learning (PBL): Large scale exercise,
but leaving most
of the process within learner discretion. Frequently involves collecting and reporting
173



======================================================================
PAGE 180 of 192
======================================================================
!RC:SP:92-2010
data, then offering conclusions and recommendations for improvement. Stimulates
analysis and creativity as well as reporting skills.
29
Prompt list: List of questions to which a person should have answers. Good
as a form of non-directed form of learning.
30
Radio and TV broadcast: Often linked with national courses and qualifications
(e.g., Open University). Viewing time may times unsociable but use of video equipment
can overcome this.
31
Real play: Real-play actors can be used to display difficult employee behavior
or techniques of good management behavior to help coaching and appraisal
skills.
Allows better appreciation of reflective responses in customer-facing situations.
32
Role- play: Enactment of role(s) in protected environment. Participants are
asked to suspend
self-reality and adopt other roles. Unless disciplined, can cause
embarrassment. Can be good for video feedback.
33
Role-reversal: Enactment
of reversed
roles by two or more
learners
in
simulated situations. Needs discipline and realism.
34
Self-managed
learning: Also
called
self-paced
learning.
Learner paced,
often augmented by audio/video tapes. Motivation often declines
if material
is
'dull'.
Tutorial help can be important.
.
35
Simulations: Attempts
to
represent
a
high degree
of
reality,
often
also
termed as business or management 'games'. Games often have rules, players and
are competitive. Permits more complex scenarios to develop that are close to real
life, yet allows
participants
to
practice and make mistakes
in a safe environment.
Generates feeling of interdependence.
36
Study groups: Task-briefed groups that also practice process review, aided
by a process consultant, who does not operate outside this role. Some learners dislike
lack of structure.
It may sometimes generate stress.
37
Syndicate: Larger tasks and exercises involving planning and preparation.
Divides the larger groups into smaller groups with separate rooms. Each of the groups
is asked to discuss tasks and solve or identify a specific problem followed by a review.
Allows groups to develop
its strength and identify due to larger complex project.

No tasks are set and group is required to examine and discuss ongoing process within
itself. Can be frustrating but is worth working through-very rewarding.
39
Virtual learning environment (VLE): Can be used to replace or supplement
conventional classrooms, enabling learning to take place over internet with levels of
face-to-face contact. Learners can undertake learning activity at convenient times and
at their own pace.
.
'
40
Virtual realty training: Enables creation of simulated environment for training
purpose. User can learn by experience and 'explore' the environment they are trying
to learn about without risk to health and safety.
41
Web-based learning: Learning via internet and World Wide Web (WWW)-
now a widely available resource. Allows users to learn at their own pace and
in their
own time. Exciting way to learn as the resources are extensive and tend to present
information in clear manner.

Annex-7
(Chapter 12 Clause 11)
Typical Template for the Trainer for 180 Minute Training Session
1
Leameroutcome:
I (trainer) will chartoutthe objective and course requirement
so that
I can get starting point for developing my lesson plan. This will include
i) making
a note of observable performance or behavior of learners,
ii) Condition under which
the task will be performed,
iii)
What will be my level of acceptable performance
in
respect of quantity and quality (within limited period of my session) from the learners
which will be accepted.
2
Introduction:
I
allot 5 minutes
in which
I
will introduce myself, explain my
authority to convey why learner would like to listen to me, and open up the my session
with some interesting anecdote (interest device)
.
3
Objective:
I
allot 3 minutes
in which
I
will help learners to visualize their
goals and how the learning
is going to help them in future.
4
Course Requirements:
I allot 2 minutes
in which learners are to be told as
to what they must be able to do to pass the course, whatievel of task performance will
be accepted by me.
5
Instruction
outline:
I
allot 10 minutes
in which
I
will give over all-view of
instructions and stimulate prior recall of learning and tell how the present instructions
are built upon learning already available with the learners.
6
First Learning
point:
I
allot 20 minutes
in which
I
will use
full range
of
multiple intelligence style of learning. As
I already know that my class comprises of
Linguistic-verbal learners or logical mathematical learners or visual -spatial learners,
or body kinesthetic learners etc.
I will use instruction material which
is best suited for
the transfer of learning.
7
Second learning
point:
I
allot 25 minutes
in which
I
will use aids for long
term memory such as mnemonics, visualizations, mind maps, or other activities to get
learners involved.
I use VAK to reinforce learning concepts.
I evoke positive emotions
for positive action outcome.
8
Third Learning Point:
I allotSO minutes.
I knowthatthere are fourcombinations
of perceiving and processing which determine learning
style.
I use learning cycles
of (a) Theorist for abstract conceptualization through
lecture,
notes, case study (b)

Pragmatist for concrete experience through laboratories, field work, observation
(c)
Activist for active experimentation
like group discussion, simulation
(d) reflector for
reflective observation like journals, brainstorming.
9
Fourth
Learning
Point:
I
allot 20
minutes.
I
use
this
period
for making
instructions to be absorbed by the learners using different learning styles.
10
Eliciting performance:
I allot 30 minutes to reinforce the learning absorption
by the learners.
I use clear instructions for Avid Beginners. For Intrapersonal Learners,
I use activities that involve emotional processing, silent reflection methods, thinking
strategies, concentration skills, higher order reasoning. For Naturalist Learners,
I use
activities relating to natural world
like maps, outdoor observations. For Disillusioned
Beginners,
I
try to find out the learning styles which work best for them and supply
emotional support to build their confidence. For Reluctant Learners,
I provide emotional
support to keep their confidence level high but less technical support because these
learners know that they can perform task well and have therefore developed reluctance
to receiving instructions. For Task Performers, only
little support
is required from me
as they have begun to take new tasks and responsibilities.
11
Review:
I allot 15 minutes after tea break
in which
I perform reflection or
review activities either in group or individually to reinforce the transfer of learning in a
general way and also ascertain the learning points which have been picked up by the
learners as major concepts.
12
Evaluation:
I allot 20 minutes forjudging whether the learner's behavior after
the session support the learners outcome which
I had kept as my learning objective.
13
Retention and Transfer:
I allot 10 minutes to appraise the learners as to how
the newly acquired skills should be used for retention and transfer of knowledge.
