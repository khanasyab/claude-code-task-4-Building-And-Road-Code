Specifications for Open-Graded Friction Course (OGFC)
1. INTRODUCTION
Open-Graded Friction Course (OGFC) is a thin open-graded bituminous wearing course which 
was developed back in the 1950s. It has been successfully used in many of the developed 
countries. It primarily consists of interconnected air voids, which enhances surface drainage 
during the rainfall, thus reducing the hydroplaning potential. In addition to being a drainage and 
friction course layer, the OGFC has the following advantages: 
i.	
Reduction in vehicle splash (macrotexture) 
ii.	
Reduced pavement-tire noise (macrotexture) 
iii.	
Improved night time visibility. All of these advantages add up to improve road safety 
ultimately.
iv.	
Improves the frictional properties of the pavement surface
v.	
It also helps in rain harvesting when used as shoulders, a parking lot and a walkway. 
The details are given in Annex A. 
Although, OGFC was widely used, there was no Indian Specification for the benefit and adoption 
by the Engineers. Therefore, IRC decided to prepare document on this subject and entrusted this 
task to Flexible Pavement, Airfield & Runways Committee (H-2) of IRC during tenure 2018-20. 
The initial draft was prepared by Dr. Sunil Bose and Dr. Sridhar Raju and the same was further 
deliberated in various meetings of (H-2). The H-2 Committee in its meeting held on 08.06.2019 
approved the document subject to incorporation of comments of members for placing before 
HSS Committee.

crushed, manufactured sand resulting from crushing operations. The fine aggregate shall be 
clean, hard, durable, of fairly cubical shape and free from soft pieces, organic or other deleterious 
substances. The Sand Equivalent Test (IS:2720, Part 37) value for the fine aggregate shall not 
be less than 50. The fine aggregate shall be non-plastic.
3.4	
Stabilizer Length
Only pelletized cellulose fibres shall be utilized. The dosage rate for cellulose fibres is 0.3% 
minimum by weight (on a loose fibre basis) of the total mix. The dosage rate shall be confirmed 
so that the bitumen drain-down does not exceed 0.3% when the designed mix is tested in 
accordance with ASTM D 6390 and AASHTO T305, "Determination of Drain down Characteristics 
in Un-Compacted Asphalt Mixtures" (see Annex B for the outline of the test) or the Schellenberg 
Binder Drainage Test given in Annex C.
3.4.1	
The cellulose fibres used in the form of pellets shall meet the following requirements:
	
Maximum fibre length - 8 mm
	
Ash content - maximum of 20% nonvolatile
	
Oil absorption - more than 4 times of the fibre weight
	
Moisture content - less than 5% by weight
3.4.2	
When the Contractor submits the proposed job-mix formula for OGFC for approval, 
it shall include the fibre manufacturer's most recently dated actual test data showing that the 
fibres meet the above requirements. The Contractor shall protect the cellulose from moisture 
and contamination prior to incorporating it into the OGFC.

4. OGFC MIX DESIGN
4.1	
The combined grading of the coarse aggregate and fine aggregate shall be within the 
limits shown in Table 2.
4.2	
The OGFC mix will be designed using ASTM D 7064M-08(2013) - Standard Practice 
for Open-Graded Friction Course (OGFC) Mix Design. The outline of the OGFC mix design 
is given in Sections 4.3 through 4.10. The OGFC mix shall be compacted with 25 blows on 
each side using the Marshall procedure given in the Asphalt Institute MS-2 (Sixth edition). The 
designed mix shall meet the requirements given in Table 3.
4.3	
 Determination of Voids in Coarse Aggregates (VCA)
The coarse aggregate in OGFC of nominal sizes 9.5 mm (for OGFC mix design purposes only) 
as all material retained on the 4.75 mm sieve. This sieve is also referred to as the breakpoint 
sieve. Wash the coarse aggregate and determine its Dry Rodded Unit Weight in accordance with 
ASTM C 29 (see Annex D for the outline of the test). Calculate the dry-rodded VCA of the coarse 
aggregate fraction by the following equation:
               
     
     
Where,
	
VCADRC = voids in the coarse aggregate in the dry-rodded condition,
	
Gca = bulk specific gravity of the coarse aggregate,
	
γw = unit weight of water (998 kg/m3), and
	
γs = unit weight of coarse aggregate fraction in dry-rodded condition (kg/m2).

4.4	
Selection of Trial Bitumen Content
The initial bitumen content of the mix for the gradation selection phase of the design should be 
a minimum of 4.5%. It is suggested that a good starting point be 5.0% for mixes with aggregate 
specific gravities equal to or less than 2.75. If the bulk specific gravity of the aggregate exceeds 
2.75 the bitumen content can be reduced slightly. The VMA of the mix must still meet the specified 
minimum value.
4.5	
 Specimen Preparation and Testing
Twelve specimens’ needs are required; four specimens at each of the three trial gradations at the 
bitumen content selected above. The aggregates and fibres should be dry mixed before adding 
the bitumen. The mixing and compaction temperatures shall be arrived based on the viscosity 
temperature relationship. Three specimens from each trial gradation shall be compacted with 
25 blows on each face and used to determine the volumetric properties of Marshall specimens. 
The fourth specimen shall be used to determine the theoretical maximum specific gravity (Gmm) 
according to ASTM D 2041 (see Annex E for the outline of the test).
The bulk specific gravity of compacted OGFC specimens can also be measured by coating 
with paraffin wax in accordance with AASHTO T 275” after “Compact the specimens, allow it for 
overnight cooling and extrude from the mounds. Determine the bulk specific gravity, Gmb, of the 
specimens (ASTM D6752).
4.6	
Selection of the Job Mix Gradation
Compact the specimens, allow it for overnight cooling and extrude from the mould. Determine 
the bulk specific gravity, Gmb, of the specimens (ASTM D 6752 or AASHTO T 275). The 
uncompacted mix samples are used to determine the theoretical maximum specific gravity, 
Gmm (ASTM D 2041). See Annex E for the outline of ASTM D 2041. Using Gmb and Gmm, the 
per cent air voids (Va, VMA and VCAmix) are calculated by the following formulae:



======================================================================

Voids in Mineral Aggregates (VMA)

   ) 
Percent Air Voids, (Va)
        (     
   
) 
Voids in Coarse Aggregate Mix (VCAmix)
           (   
   
    ) 
Where,
	
Ps = Percent of aggregate in the mix
	
Pca = Percent of coarse aggregate in the total mix
	
Gmb = Bulk specific gravity of the compacted mix
	
Gmm= Theoretical maximum density of the mix
	
Gsb = Bulk specific gravity of total aggregate, and
	
Gca = Bulk specific gravity of the coarse aggregate fraction.
The blend that exceeds the minimum VMA requirement and has a VCAmix that is less than the 
VCADRC should be selected as the desired mix design aggregate blend. To ensure stone-on-
stone contact within the coarse aggregate it is very essential that VCAmix is less than VCADRC.
4.7	
 Determination of the Optimum Bitumen Content
The optimum bitumen content shall be determined corresponding to the design air void content, 
Va of 20.0%. The remaining mix properties should meet those specified in Table 4. A good 
starting point for the mix design is 5.0% bitumen content by weight of the mix.
4.8	
 Drain-down Test
Drain-down of the loose OGFC mix shall be determined according to ASTM D 6390 (see Annex B 
for the outline of the test) or by the Schellenberg Binder Drainage Test given in Annex C. The 
drainage test should be performed at the anticipated plant production temperature and should 
satisfy the specified maximum drain-down of 0.30%. If the mix fails to meet this requirement then 
the per cent fibres should be increased to a level that reduces drain down to the acceptable limit.
4.9	
Tensile Strength Ratio
Determine the Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR) in accordance with AASHTO T 283, "Resistance of 
Compacted Bituminous Mixtures to Moisture-Induced Damage" following the freeze and thaw 
option. See Annex F for the outline of the test.
4.10	
Cantabro Abrasion Test
Determine the Cantabro Abrasion loss for the aged & un-aged OGFC Marshall specimens, which 



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 40
======================================================================
IRC:129-2019
7
is to be carried out in the Los Angeles abrasion machine (IS:2386 (Part-IV)). The recommended 
maximum permitted abrasion loss is 20%. (See Annex G for the outline of the test.)
4.11	
Laboratory Permeability Test
The laboratory permeability testing of the compacted OGFC specimens using an approved 
method is optional. Laboratory permeability values greater than 100 m/day are recommended.
5. OGFC PRODUCTION
Mixing: For batch plant, the fibre will be added directly into the weigh hopper above the pugmill. 
Adequate dry mixing time is required to disperse the fibre uniformly throughout the hot aggregate. 
Dry mixing time will be increased by 5 to 10 seconds. Wet mixing time shall be increased by at 
least 5 seconds. For drum mix plant, a separate fibre feeding system shall be utilized that can 
accurately and uniformly introduce fibre into the drum at such a rate as not to limit the normal 
production of the mix through the drum. At no time shall there be any evidence of fibre in the 
baghouse/wasted baghouse fines.
6. OGFC PLACEMENT AND COMPACTION
6.1	
Preparation of Existing Bituminous Surface
The existing impermeable bituminous surface shall be cleaned of all loose extraneous matter 
by means of mechanical broom and high-pressure air jet from the compressor or any other 
approved equipment/method. Any potholes and/or cracks shall be repaired and sealed.
6.2	
Tack Coat
A bitumen emulsion complying with IS:8887-2004 of a type SS-2 shall be applied on the existing 
impermeable bituminous layer. Quantity of liquid bituminous material shall vary from 0.23 to 
0.45  kg/m2 in case of emulsion. In this regard IRC:16 may be referred. The tack coat shall 
be applied by a self-propelled or towed bitumen pressure sprayer equipped for spraying the 
bitumen binder uniformly at a specified rate. The emulsion tack coat shall be allowed to set (turn 
black from brown) before laying the hot mix.
6.3	
Transportation
The OGFC shall be transported in clean, insulated covered vehicles. An asphalt release agent, 
which does not adversely affect the bituminous mix may be applied to the interior of the vehicle 
to prevent sticking and to facilitate discharge of the material. The haul distance should be limited 
to 56 km or the haul time should be limited to 1 hour.
6.4	
Lift Thickness
The OGFC shall be placed in thin lift of 20 to 40 mm with a tolerance of ± 5 mm. The OGFC shall 
be compacted quickly after placement using an 8-Ton Static Steel-wheeled roller. The speed of 
roller shall not exceed 5 kmph. Pneumatic roller tyres shall be avoided with OGFC mixes.

6.5	
Laying
6.5.1	
Weather and seasonal limitations
The OGFC mix shall not be laid:
	
•	
In the presence of standing water on the surface.
	
•	
When rain is imminent and during rains, fog, or dust storm.
	
•	
When the base/binder course is damp.
	
•	
When the air temperature on the surface on which it is to be laid is less than 
10°C for a mix with conventional bitumen as a binder and is less than 15°C for 
a mix with polymer modified bitumen as a binder.
	
•	
When the wind speed at any temperature exceeds 40 km/h at 2 m height.
6.5.2	
Spreading
Except in areas where paver cannot access bituminous material shall be spread, levelled and 
tamped by self-propelled hydrostatic paver finisher preferably with the sensor. As soon as 
possible after arrival at the site, the material shall be supplied continuously to the paver and laid 
without delay. The rate of delivery of material to the paver shall be regulated to enable the paver 
to operate continuously. The travel rate of paver and the method of operation shall be adjusted 
to ensure even and uniform flow of bituminous material across the screen, free from dragging, 
tearing and segregation.
Restricted areas (such as confined space, footways, irregular shape and varying thickness, 
approaches to expansion joints etc.) where paver cannot be used, the material shall be spread, 
raked and levelled with suitable hand tool by trained staff.
6.6	
Compaction
6.6.1	
Compaction shall commence immediately after laying and shall be completed before 
the temperature falls below 100°C (higher temperature when PMB/CRMB is used). Rolling of the 
longitudinal joints shall be done immediately behind the paving operation. After this, the rolling 
shall commence at the edge and progress towards the centre longitudinally except at sections 
with unidirectional camber, where it shall progress from lower edge to upper edge parallel to 
centerline of the pavement.
6.6.2	
All deficiencies in the surface after laying shall be made good by the attendant behind 
the paver before initial rolling is commenced. The initial or breakdown rolling shall be done with 
the 8 to 10 tons static steel wheel roller. A vibratory breakdown roller may have to be operated 
at transverse joints and longitudinal joints at few occasions, to help knock down a high joint. 
Generally, the use of vibratory compaction should be discouraged. The intermediate rolling shall 
also be done with 8 to 10 tons deadweight or vibratory roller. Pneumatic rolling shall not be used 
on OGFC because of potential pickup problems. The finished rolling shall be done with 6 to 8 
tons smooth wheel roller. Rolling shall continue till all the roller marks are removed from the 
surface and the minimum specified field density is achieved.

6.6.3	
The OGFC mix shall be rolled in the longitudinal direction, with the roller as close 
as possible to the paver (within 15 m). The overlap on successive passes should be at least 
one-third of the width of the rear wheel. The roller should move at a speed of not more than 
5 km/h. The roller shall not be permitted to stand on the pavement, which has not been fully 
compacted. All precautions shall be taken to prevent dropping of oil, grease, petrol or other 
foreign material on the pavement. The wheel of the rollers shall be kept moist with the water or 
spray system provided with the machine to prevent the mix from adhering to the wheels. The 
minimum moisture to prevent adhesion between wheels and mix shall be used and surplus 
water shall not be allowed to stand on the partially completed pavement.
6.6.4	
The density of the finished paving layers shall be determined by taking 150 mm 
diameter cores. The density of finished paving layer shall not be less than 98% of the average 
(sample size N=2) laboratory bulk density (Gmb) obtained on that day in accordance with AASHTO 
T 275 or ASTM D 6752. However, the air voids shall not be greater than 22% in the field core 
when compared with the Gmm obtained on that day (ASTM D 2041).
6.7	
Joints
6.7.1	
Where joints are made, the material shall be fully compacted and the joint made flush 
in one of the following ways:
6.7.2	
All joints shall be cut vertical to the full thickness of the previously laid mix. All loosened 
material shall be discarded and the vertical face is coated with any viscosity grade bitumen or 
cold applied emulsified bitumen or rubberized bitumen tack coat (minimum thickness 3 mm), 
prior to laying the adjacent lane. While spreading the material along with the joint the material 
spread shall overlap 25 mm to 30 mm on the previously laid mix beyond the vertical face of the 
joint. 
6.7.3	
By using two or more pavers in echelon, where this is practicable and in sufficient 
proximity for adjacent width to be fully compacted by continuous rolling.
6.7.4	
By heating the joints with an approved infrared joint heater when the adjacent lane 
is being laid, but without cutting back or coating with the binder. The heater shall raise the 
temperature of the full depth of material, to minimum rolling temperature for a width of 75 mm. 
The temperature shall not exceed 175°C.
6.7.5	
For transverse joints, the method suggested in Section 6.6.2 can be adopted. In multi-
layer construction, the joint in one layer shall offset the joint in the underlying layer by about 
150 mm. However the joint in the top layer shall be along the centre line of the pavement.
6.8 
Arrangement for Traffic
It shall be ensured that traffic is not allowed on the OGFC surface until the paved mat has cooled 
to ambient temperature in its entire depth.

Annex B
Outline of ASTM D 6390, “Determination of Drain-Down Characteristics  
in Uncompacted Asphalt mixes”
A.	
Scope and Summary of Test
This method determines the amount of drain-down in an uncompacted asphalt mix sample when 
the sample is held at elevated temperatures, which are encountered during the production, 
transportation, and placement of the mix. This test is especially applicable to open-graded 
asphalt mixes.
A fresh sample of the bituminous mix (either made in the laboratory or from an asphalt plant) 
is placed in a wire basket. The wire basket is hung in a forced draft oven for one hour at a pre-
selected temperature. A catch plate of known mass is placed below the basket to collect material 
drained from the sample. The mass of the drained material is determined to calculate the amount 
of drain down as a percentage of the mass of the total asphalt mix sample.
B.	
Testing Equipment
	
1.	
Forced draft oven, capable of maintaining temperatures in a range of 120 to 
175°C with ± 2°C of the set temperature.

3.	
Standard wire basket meeting the dimensions shown in Fig. 8. A standard 
6.3  mm sieve cloth shall be used to make the basket. The dimensions shown in 
the figure can vary by ±10 per cent.
	
4.	
Balance readable to 0.1 gram
C.	
Testing Procedure
	
1.	
For each mix to be tested, the drain down characteristics shall be determined 
at two temperatures: at the anticipated plant production temperature and at a 
temperature 10°C higher than the anticipated production temperature. Duplicate 
samples shall be tested at each temperature. Therefore, a minimum of 4 samples 
shall be tested. 
	
2.	
Weigh the empty wire basket (W1).
	
3.	
Place in the wire basket 1200 ± 200 grams of fresh, hot asphalt mix (either 
prepared in the laboratory or from an asphalt plant) as soon as possible without 
losing its temperature. Place the mix loosely in the basket without consolidating 
it. Determine the mass of the wire basket plus sample to the nearest 0.1 gram 
(W2).
	
4.	
Determine the mass of the empty plate to be placed under the basket to nearest 
0.1 gram (W3).
	
5.	
Hang the basket with the mix in the oven preheated to a selected temperature. 
Place the catch plate beneath the wire basket. Keep the basket in the oven for 
1-hour ± 5 minutes.

Testing Procedure
	
1.	
Calibrate the measure and determine its capacity in mm3 by filling it with water and 
covering with plate glass to eliminate air bubbles and excess water. Determine 
the mass of water in the measure. Calculate the volume of the measure, V, by 
dividing the mass of the water by its density.
	
2.	
Use the dry rodding procedure to place and compact the oven-dry coarse 
aggregate in the measure. Fill the measure 1/3 full with aggregate and level 
the surface with fingers. Rod the layer of the aggregate with 25 strokes of the 
tamping rod evenly distributed over the surface. Fill the measure 2/3 full, level 
with fingers and rod as above again. Finally, fill the measure slightly overflowing 
the measure and rod again as before. Level the surface of aggregate with 
fingers in such a way that any slight projections of the larger pieces of the coarse 
aggregate approximately balance the larger voids in the surface below the top of 
the measure.

Annex E
Outline of ASTM D 2041, "Theoretical Maximum Specific Gravity and 
Density of Bituminous Paving Mix"
A.	
Scope and Summary of the Test
Method
This test method covers the determination of the theoretical maximum specific gravity and density 
of uncompacted bituminous paving mixes at 25°C. The theoretical maximum specific gravity 
(Gmm) is used: (a) to calculate air voids in compacted bituminous mixes, (b) to calculate the 
amount of bitumen absorbed by the aggregate, and (c) to provide target value for the compaction 
of paving mixes in the field.
A sample of loose paving mix is placed in a tared vacuum vessel. Water is added to completely 
submerge the sample. A specified amount of vacuum is gradually applied to remove the air 
bubbles entrapped between bituminous mix particles. After the vacuum is released, the volume 
of the sample of the voidless paving mix is obtained by either immersing the vacuum container 
with the sample in a water bath or weighing or by filling the calibrated vacuum container level full 
of water and weighing in air.
B.	
Testing Equipment
1.	
Container (either a or b below)
	
(a)	
Vacuum bowls: Either a metal or plastic bowl with a diameter ranging from 180 
to 260 mm and a bowl height of at least 160 mm. The bowl shall be equipped 
with a stiff, transparent cover fitted with a rubber gasket and a connection for the 
vacuum line. The hose connection shall be covered with a small piece of fine 
wire mesh to minimize loss of any fine material from the mix.
	
(b)	
Vacuum flask for weighing in air only. A thick-walled volumetric glass flask with 
a capacity of approx. 4000 ml, fitted with a rubber stopper with a connection for 
the vacuum line. The hose connection shall be covered with a small piece of fine 
wire mesh to minimize loss of any fine material from the mix.
2.	
Balance capable of being read to the nearest 0.1 g. If weighing is to be done under 
water, a suitable suspension arrangement shall be provided for weighing the sample 
while suspended from the center of the balance.
3.	
Vacuum pump, capable of evacuating air from the vacuum container to a residual 
pressure of 4.0 kPa (30 mm of Hg) or less. Provide a suitable trap between the pump 
and container to minimize water vapour entering the vacuum pump.
4.	
Residual pressure manometer or calibrated absolute pressure gauge with a bleed 
valve to adjust the vacuum level.
5.	
Water bath capable of maintaining a constant temperature of 25±10C and suitable for 
immersion of the suspended container.

C.	
Calibration of Containers
	
1.	
Bowls: Determine the mass (B) of the container immersed in water at 25±1°C. 
If the bowl is used for weighing in air, place the volumetric lid on the bowl while 
under water. Remove the water-filled bowl with the lid in place and dry prior to 
determining the combined mass of the bowl, lid and water. Repeat 3 times and 
average the 3 masses. Designate the average mass as D.
	
2.	
Flasks: Calibrate the volumetric flask by accurately determining the mass of the 
flask filled with water at 25±1°C. Use a glass cover plate to ensure the flask is 
completely full.
D.	
Testing Procedure
1.	
Separate the particles of the loose paving mix (while it is warm) by hand so that the 
particles are not larger than about 6 mm don’t fracture the aggregate. Place the mix 
sample directly into the tarred bowl or flask. Weigh the container with the sample and 
designate the net mass of the sample only as A.
	
[Note: The minimum sample size shall be 1500 g for mixes with nominal maximum aggregate sizes of 
12.5 mm or smaller; and shall be 2500 g for mixes with nominal maximum aggregate sizes from 19 to 
25 mm.]
2.	
Add sufficient water at 250C to cover the sample completely. Place the cover (bowls) 
or stopper (flasks) on the containers.
3.	
Place the container with the sample and water on a mechanical agitation device or 
agitate manually at frequent intervals (2 to 3 minutes). Begin removing entrapped air 
by gradually applying vacuum and increasing the vacuum pressure until the residual 
manometer reads 3.7+0.3 kPa (27.5+2.5 mm of Hg). After achieving this level within 
2 minutes, continue the vacuum and agitation for 15+2 minutes. Gradually release the 
vacuum with the bleed valve.
4.	
Weighing in water: Suspend the bowl (without lid) and contents in water for 10 + 1 
minute and then determine mass. Designate the mass under water of the bowl and 
sample as C.
5.	
Weighing in air
	
(a)	
Bowl: Submerge the bowl and sample slowly in the 25±1°C water bath. Keep 
it there for 10±1 minutes. Immerse the lid in water and slide it onto the bowl 
without removing water from the bowl so that no air is trapped inside the bowl. 
Remove the bowl with the lid in place from the water bath. Dry the bowl and lid 
with a dry cloth. Determine the mass of the bowl, sample, and lid and designate 
it as E.
	
(b)	
Flask: Fill the flask slowly with water ensuring not to introduce any air into the 
sample. Place the flask in water bath for 10±1 minutes to stabilize the temperature 
at 250°C without submerging the top of the flask. Completely fill the flask with 
water using a cover plate without entrapping air beneath the cover plate. Wipe 
the exterior of the flask and cover plate. Determine the mass of the flask, plate 
and its contents completely filled with water. Designate this mass as E.

Outline of AASHTO T 283 “Resistance of Compacted Asphalt Mixes  
to Moisture-Induced Damage”
A.	
Scope and Summary of Test Method
This method covers preparation of compacted bituminous mixes and the measurement of the 
change of diametral tensile strength resulting from the effects of water saturation and laboratory 
accelerated stripping phenomenon with a freeze-thaw cycle. The result may be used to predict 
long-term stripping susceptibility of bituminous mixes and evaluate liquid anti-stripping additives 
that are added to the bitumen or pulverized mineral materials such as hydrated lime, which are 
added to the mineral aggregate.
Each set of 6 compacted specimens is divided into two equal subsets. One subset is tested in 
a dry condition for indirect tensile strength. The other subset is subjected to vacuum saturation 
and a freeze-thaw cycle (thawing in a hot water bath) before testing for indirect tensile strength. 
Numerical indices of retained indirect tensile strength properties are calculated from the test 
data to obtain by testing the two subsets viz. dry and conditioned.

radius of the test specimen. The loading strips shall be 12.7 mm (0.5 inches) wide for 
specimens 100 mm (4 inches) in diameter. The loading strips for 150 mm (6 inches) 
diameter specimens shall be 19.05 mm (0.75 inches) wide. The length of the loading 
strips shall exceed the thickness of the specimens. Steel strips are provided at the top 
and bottom of specimens during indirect tensile testing.
C.	
Testing Procedure
1.	
Make at least 6 compacted specimens for each mix, 3 to be tested dry and 3 to 
be tested after partial saturation and moisture conditioning with a freeze-thaw cycle. 
Some extra specimens will need to be made to establish compaction procedures in 
order to obtain specified air void contents in the test specimens by trial and error.

2.	
Compact the 6 specimens with 25 Marshall blows on each face of the OGFC 
specimen so that the compacted specimens will have air voids of 20.0±0.5%. Air void 
content must be calculated from the bulk specific gravity of the compacted specimen 
(determined by the paraffin wax coating method [AASHTO T 275]).
3.	
Separate the 6 specimens into 2 subsets so that the average air voids of the two 
subsets are approximately equal.
4.	
One set will be tested dry. Keep it at room temperature and then place in a 25°C±0.5°C 
water bath for 2 hours prior to determining their indirect tensile strength.
5.	
The other subset will be conditioned as follows:
	
a.	
Place and submerge the 3 specimens in the vacuum container filled with water 
at room temperature. Apply a vacuum of 87.8 kPa absolute pressure (660 mm of 
mercury partial pressure) for 10 minutes to saturate the compacted specimens 
to the required saturation level (ASTM D 7064/D 7064M-08[2013]). Submerge 
the specimens in water during freeze cycles to maintain saturation. If the mixture 
fails to meet the moisture susceptibility requirements, hydrated lime, or liquid 
anti-strip, or both, additives can be used. If these measures prove ineffective, 
the aggregate source, or bitumen, or both, source can be changed to obtain 
better aggregate/bitumen compatibility.
	
b.	
Wrap a plastic film around each saturated specimen and place the wrapped 
specimen in a plastic bag containing 10 ml of water and seal the plastic bag. 
Place the plastic bag in a freezer at a temperature of 180C ± 30C for a minimum 
of 16 hours. Remove the specimens from the freezer.
	
c.	
Place the specimens in a water bath maintained at 600C±10C for 24 hours. 
Remove the plastic bag and the plastic film from each specimen after placing 
the specimens under water.
	
d.	
Remove the specimens from hot water bath and place in a water bath maintained 
at 250C+0.50C for 2 hours.
	
e.	
Remove the conditioned specimens and test for indirect tensile strength.
6.	
Determine the indirect tensile strength of the 3 dry and 3 conditioned specimens at 
250C ± 0.50C after removing from the water bath. First, measure their mean thicknesses 
(t). Then place the two steel loading strips on the bottom and top of the specimens 
across diameter and place in the Marshall testing machine or a compression-testing 
machine. Apply load to the specimens diametrically at a vertical rate of 50 mm per 
minute.
7.	
Record the maximum compressive strength noted on the testing machine and continue 
loading until a vertical crack appears in the specimen. Remove the cracked specimen 
from the machine and visually estimate the approximate degree of moisture damage 
(extent of stripped or bare aggregate) on the fractured faces of the specimen on a 
scale of 0 to 5 (5 being the most stripping).

Calculate the tensile strength of each specimen as follows in SI units:
        
    
Where,
	
St	
= tensile strength (kPa)
	
P	
= maximum loads (N)
	
t	
= specimen thickness (mm)
	
d	
= specimen diameter (mm)
9.	
Express the numerical index of resistance of bituminous mix to the detrimental effects 
of water as the ratio of the original strength that is retained after accelerated moisture 
and freeze-thaw conditioning.
	
Calculate the tensile strength ratio (TSR) as follows:
      
  
      
Where,
	
S1	
= average tensile strength of the dry subset (kPa)
	
S2	
= average tensile strength of the conditioned subset (kPa)

Outline of “Determination of Cantabro Abrasion loss  
for Open-graded friction HMA Course  
(for aged and unaged specimens)”
A.	
Scope and Summary of the Test
This method is used to determine the abrasion loss of compacted hot-mix OGFC specimen for 
aged and unaged specimens. This method is carried out in the Los Angeles abrasion machine, 
to measure the breakdown of compacted OGFC specimens. The per cent (%) of weight loss acts 
as an indicator for the durability of OGFC. This procedure is designed to determine the abrasion 
resistance of open-graded courses. 
A compacted specimen is placed in the rotating drum of a Los Angeles abrasion machine, 
and the drum is rotated for 300 revolutions (without the charge of steel balls), with a speed of 
30-33 rpm. After completion of Loss in the weight is calculated (in terms of percentage) for the 
compacted specimen.
A minimum of 5 aged and 5 unaged specimens are required.
B.	
Ageing
A minimum of 5 OGFC Marshall Specimens compacted with 25 blows on each face are placed 
in a heating oven maintained at 60°C for 168 hours (7 days). The specimens are then cooled to 
25°C and stored for 5 hours prior to testing for Cantabro Abrasion test.
C.	
Testing Equipment
1.	
A Los Angeles Abrasion Machine, capable of rotating at 30-33 rpm.
2.	
Balance or scale accurate up to 0.1 per cent of the test load. 
3.	
Plates to collect the material
D.	
Testing procedure
1.	
A compacted OGFC specimen (conforming to the gradation) is prepared with 
25 Marshall blows on each face of the OGFC specimen.
2.	
The mass of the specimen is weighed to the nearest of 0.1 gram and is termed as P1.
3.	
The compacted specimen is placed in the rattler of the Los Angeles Abrasion Machine 
and operated for 300 revolutions at a rate of 300 rpm.
4.	
After the operation is done, the specimen is removed and weighed to nearest 
0.1 gram and is termed as P2.
