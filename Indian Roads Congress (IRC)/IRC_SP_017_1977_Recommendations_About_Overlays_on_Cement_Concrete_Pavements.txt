vehicles per day). The measures that were tried out thereafter were as 
under: 
	
(i) Experimental stretches : Between km 66 to 66.4 and km 72.2 to 
76.4 overlaid in 1962; and in kms 135.2, 135.6, 135.8, 139.4, 
141.0, 142.6 and 161.8 overlaid in 1967. It was  reported that out of 
the various experiments conducted in 1962, the specification found 
to be satisfactory consisted of 7.5 cm thick bitumen coated metal, 
grouted with bitumen at the rate of 39 kg per 10 tq. m., and covered 
with 2.5 cm asphaltic concrete. 
	
(ii) In a length of about 18.4 km, treatment had been done between the 
years 1965 and 1968: 
Removing the badly cracked slabs in about 25 per cent of total 
area, re-filling these portions with broken pieces of concrete in about 
5 cm thickness and remaining 7.5 cm thickness filled with bituminous 
premixed metal, covering the full area with 6.25 cm B.M. and 4 cm 
A.C. (similar to the specifications followed on Agra-Bombay Road). 
	
(iii) Having regard to the excessive deterioration of concrete slabs 
in the remaining kilometres, the following specification was 
followed: 
Breaking the concrete slab completely in pieces, relaying the 
same, grouting it with 29.3 kg asphalt per 10 sq.m. covering it with 
7.5 cm B.M. and 4 cm A.C. wearing coat. 
Additional metal layer was reported to have been provided 
in some lengths before grouting to compensate for deficiencies in 
crust thickness wherever necessary as per C.B.R. requirement. 
	
(iv) In km 135.2 with distressed concrete slabs, the following 
specification was adopted: 
Providing 10 cm metalling with 32 kg per 10 sq.m. bituminous 
grout and 4 cm bituminous carpet followed by another layer of 4 
cm asphaltic concrete laid after monsoon. 
The performance of this specification beyond the ghats 
towards Poona laid some 5 years back was very satisfactory. The 
annual rain-fall here was 225-250 cm and drainage good. 
	
(c) Bombay City Roads 
	
On Dr. Ambedkar Road and at King’s Circle, fully bonded rigid 
overlays of 1:1½:3 concrete and 6-9 cm thickness were adopted.
M.S. reinforcement at the rate of 30 kg per 10 sq.m. was provided 
in the overlay. The existing concrete pavement was 15 cm thick and 
of 1:2:4 mix. At the time of overlaying, the condition of the existing
slabs was reported to be good. The condition of the overlay in 1917

under very heavy traffic and high rainfall (about 200 cm annually) was 
fair to good after 6.9 years of service. 
In Poibavdi junction, partially bonded rigid overlay was ad-opted over 
existing lean concrete base, which was of good quality, after removing 
the flexible crust. The overlay was of a total thickness of 12.5 cm out 
of which 7.5 cm was of 1:2:4 mix and top 5 cm of 1:11:3 mix. M.S. 
reinforcement of 30 kg per 10 sq.m. was provided in the overlay. The 
overlay was about 10 years old and its performance under very heavy 
traffic good. 
The particulars of the roads inspected in Maharashtra given in Anneeuire 
2 show that in contrast to the conditions to which the overlays were 
subjected to in Andhra Pradesh and U.P. those in Maharashtra were more 
severe, namely annual rainfall was of the order of 200-400 cm; subgrade 
was weak in most of the areas varying from black-cotton soil to marine 
clay to soft moorum having high P.I. values; pavement shoulder was 
either inadequate or completely absent in many portions; and drainage 
in many areas was unfavourable. in addition to these, the traffic on the 
overlaid sections was very heavy with 2000-7000 commercial vehicles 
per day. Considering these aspects, the general findings (limited to this 
inspection) were :

4.3.. Condition of Existing Pavement 
	
4.3.1. For the purpose of strengthening of concrete pavement with 
an overlay, the condition of the concrete pavement may be categorised 
in terms of total length of crack per unit area of the pavement. For this 
purpose, the following criteria may be used for guidance: 
	
Length of crack in m per 10 sq. m. 	
Category 
	
(i)	
0 to 1.0 	
sound
	
(ii)	
Exceeding 1.0 upto 2.5 	
slightly cracked
	
(iii)	
Exceeding 2.5 upto 5.5	
fairly cracked
	
(iv)	
Exceeding 5.5 upto 8.5 	
moderately cracked
	
(v)	
Exceeding 8.5 upto 12.0 	
badly cracked
	
(vi)	
Exceeding 12.0 	
very badly cracked
Notes :	
(a) Based on the above criteria, workable lengths with similar 
slab condition should be identified for arriving at the overlay 
measures needed. This classification should be done carefully 
to see that limited portions with exceptional degree of distress 
do not result in heavy overlays. 
	
(b) ‘Badly’ cracked and ‘very badly’ cracked slabs which arc 
rocking should be sorted out and removed. The removed slab 
material may be broken and the resulting aggregate used as 
base with bituminous grouting at the rate of 30 kg per 10 m’ 
or alternatively utilised as granular material for sub-base in the 
widening portion or for shoulders. 
4.3.2. As far as possible, existing cement concrete pavements 
requiring strengthening should be overlaid at first signs of distress, while 
the condition of the slab is still ‘slightly cracked.

locally (using powdered soap at the rate of 1 kg per 10 m2 of the 
pavement surface) along with scrubbing with wire brushes to remove 
oily and greasy material and subsequently the whole surface flushed
with water to remove all traces of the solution and other dust 
particles. 
	
4.5.6. In case of fully bonded rigid overlay, the thickness of the 
overlay may be taken as that required to make up the difference between 
the monolithic thickness of cement concrete pavement needed for the 
present day traffic and the existing pavement thickness. The monolithic
thickness may be designed as per IRC : 58-1974 “Guidelines for the 
Design of Rigid Pavements for Highways”. During construction, 
adequate care should be taken to ensure good bond between the 
overlay and the existing pavement. For this purpose besides the treatment 
specified for partially bonded over-lays in para 4.5.5, all bond-preventing 
materials such as joint sealing compound,. bituminous materials used for 
repair of cracks, paint markings, greasy and oily marks, etc., should be 
meticulously re-moved. Wherever necessary, light chiselling to scarify 
the surface for effective bond and to remove loose material at the surface 
should be done. These treatments should be followed by acid-etching (1:1 
dilute HC1 at the rate of 4 kg per 10 m2 of surface) in two applications.
The surface should be finally flushed with water to remove all traces of 
acid. On the saturated surface-dry-slabs. bonded rigid overlay should be 
laid immediately after applying a thin layer (about 1 mm thick) of 1:1 
cement sand slurry as bonding medium. 
	
4.5.7. In high rainfall areas, particularly where the drainage is not 
satisfactory and/or on pavements carrying very heavy traffic of more than 
1500 commercial vehicles per day, mild steel reinforcement at the rate 
of 3 kg per m2 should he provided in fully bonded and partially bonded 
overlays. Mild steel reinforcement mesh at the rate of 3 kg per m2 should 
also be provided in the overlay across cracks in the existing pavement, 
the width of the mesh being deter-mined from consideration of bond 
length required on either side of the crack. Such reinforcement may be 
provided as a general practice for fully bonded and partially bonded rigid 
overlay irrespective of rainfall, subgrade and climatic conditions.

should be matched with those in the existing cement concrete pavement 
both in regard to location and type. 
	
4.6. Flexible Overlay 
	
4.6.1. The following specifications may be adopted in areas where 
the annual rainfall is of medium intensity (exceeding 40 upto 125 cm) 
drainage condition favourable, and subgrade soil of low plasticity (P.1. 
not exceeding 14). 
 
(i) For very heavy traffic (exceeding 1500 commercial vehicles per 
day) 
	
  (1) 7.5 cm B.M. under 4 cm A.C. 
or 
	
  (2) 15 cm granular layer under 4 cm A.C. 
 
(ii) For heavy and medium heavy traffic (151-1500 commercial 
vehicles per day) 
	
  (1) 7.5 cm B.M. under 2 cm premix with seal coat 
or 
	
  (2) 7.5 cm B.U.S.G. under 2 cm premix with seal coat (for 
medium heavy traffic only) 
or 
	
(3) 15 cm granular layer under 2 cm premix with seal coat or 
	
(4) 7.5 cm granular layer under 4 cm A.C. 
Notes:(a) In case of very heavy traffic of more than 1500 commercial vehicles 
per day, the 15 cm granular layer should comprise 7.5 cm W.B.M. 
(lower layer-)-4- 7.5 cm built-up spray grout (B.U.S.G.). Instead of 
B.U.S.G., coated macadam consisting of more or less 40 mm single-
size aggregate mixed with 2.5-3 per cent bitumen may also be used. 
	
(b) Where W.B.M. is directly laid over the existing concrete slabs, either a 
bituminous tack coat or 1 cm layer of non-plastic soil may be provided 
in between so as to enable rolling and proper compaction of W.B.M. 
	
(c) In all cases, before the overlay work is undertaken, the locations 
of the rocking slabs and slabs affected by mud-pumping should 
first be identified and the same rectified using appropriate means. 
If rectification cannot be carried out, the treatment should be as 
indicated in the Note under para 4.5.31 
	
(d) The cracks in the existing cement concrete pavement should be 
cleaned and sealed properly with bituminous materials before the 
flexible over-lay is laid.
