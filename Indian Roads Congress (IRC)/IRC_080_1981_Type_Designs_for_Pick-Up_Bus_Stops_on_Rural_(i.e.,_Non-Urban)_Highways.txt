TYPE DESIGNS FOR PICK-UP BUS STOPS ON
RURAL (i.e. NON-URBAN) HIGHWAYS
[.
INTRODUCTION
1.1.
Buses
standing
indiscriminately
on
the carriageway to
drop
or
pick-up
passengers
can
seriously
affect capacity of the
roadway,
besides
bejng
a source
of
accidents.
It
is,
therefore,
desirable that on
all busy non-urban highways, consideration should
be given
to the construction
of
bus
laybyes
of
suitable
design at
required
locations
to
ensure
orderly
movement
of
the
through
traffic.
1.2-
Recognising the need for a standard
on
this subject, the
Specifications
and
Standards
Committee
has
evolved
the
type
designs given herein covering the siting and layout of
wayside
pick-
up bus stops, and ihese are recommended for general adoption.
1.3.
These type designs were considered by the Specifications
and Standards Committee in their meeting held at Gauhati
on
the
26th October, 1979.
The Committee after reviewing
the
standard
in their meeting held at Srinagar on the 20th August, 1980
set
up a
Working Group consisting of R.P. Sikka and Dr. N.S.
Srinivasan to
go
into
the test and finalise the same for further necessary
action.
The standard as finalised by the Working Group was processed and
approved by the Executive Committee and the Council in their meet-
ings held on the 11th August and 20th September, 1981 respectively.
2.
SCOPE
2.1.
The standard applies essentially
to wayside bus stops in
non-urban locations meant for quick loading and unloading of pass-
engers.
It does not deal
with more
elaborate
bus depots or termi-
nals which are sometimes provided by the
side of the road between
the
cities.
2.2.
As
regards
design
of
on-street
bus stops
in urban or
sub-urban
situations,
reference may
be made
to
IRC
:
70-1977
''Guidelines on Regulation and Control of
Mixed
Traffic in Urban
Areas".

NEED FOR LAYBYES
3.1.
The need for laybyes on
a particular road
will
depend
on factors like the volume of traffic, frequency of
buses stopping to
pick-up passengers, duration of bus stops etc.
3.2.
Normally, provision of
separate laybyes will be justified
on all important trunk routes such as
National Highways and State
Highways, when
:
(a) the volume of
traffic
is
such that
through
traffic movement will b
unduly disturbed by buses
stopping on the
carriageway
:
(b)
buses are required
to halt at
a particular
stop for considerable time
for rest or loading/unloading of passengers and goods; or
(c)
the
road
is
passing
through a
relatively
congested locality like a
village or a small town where
besides waiting passengers the roadway
is occupied by local
traffic as well.
3.3.
Usually,
bus
laybyes
will
not
be
required
on
lower
category roads like Other District
Roads
and Village Roads where
traffic
is comparatively
low
and
not many buses ply on the route.
However, from safety considerations
it may
be desirable to provide
separate laybyes at the bus terminal points.
4.
GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LOCATION
4.1.
The governing considerations when locating pick-up bus
stops are increased overall safety and minimum
interference
to the
through traffic.
4.2. Normally the' bus stops should be sited away from bridges
snd other important structures, also from embankment sections which
are more than four metres
high.
As far
as possible, these should
not be located on horizontal curves or at the top of summit vertical
curves.
Moreover,
the
need
for
good
visibility
alround
corres-
ponding to safe stopping sight distance
should be kept in view.
4.3.
Bus
stops
should
not be
located too close to the road
intersections. A gap of 300 metres from the
tangent
point of inter-
section to
start/end of
the laybye
will be
desirable, particularly at
junctions with main
roads.
In other
cases,
the
distance
may
be
relaxed to a certain extent having regard
to
the
local
conditions.
At minor intersection (e.g. junctions
with
village
roads),
distance
2



======================================================================
PAGE 7 of 14
======================================================================
IRC
: 80-1981
of 60 metres may be accepted as a special case. However,
if a subs-
tantial volume of buses is to turn right at the intersection,
it
is neces-
sary that
the bus
stop
should be
located
sufficiently ahead of the
intersection
so
that
the buses can
be manoeuvred easily from the
pick-up
stop
on
the
left
hand
side to
the extreme right lane for
turning.
4.4.
At
major four-way
intersections involving transfer of a
substantial number of passengers from one pick-up stop to the other,
it might
be
desjrable
to construct
a
single, composite bus stop of
suitable design to cater
to
all the bus routes collectively.
4.5.
In hilly areas, the bus stops should be located preferably
where the road
is straight on both sides,
gradients
are
flat and the
visibility
is
reasonably good (usually not less than 50 metres).
Sub-
ject to these
requirements,
it
will be advisable
to choose locations
where
it
is possible to widen the roadway
economically for accom-
modating bus laybyes, passenger shelters,
etc.
5. LAYOUT AND DESIGN
5.1.
Typical layouts of
laybyes
are
given
in figures
1
to 3.
Selection of layout at a particular location
should be based on local
factors
like
the
number of buses stopping
at
a time, the period of
halt, volume of
traffic on the
road, number of passengers alighting
at the
bus stop
etc.
To
determine
the
layout required, a careful
study of
various
factors
should
be made
and the bus authorities
also consulted.
5.2.
In the normal run, layout in Fig.
1 will be found suitable
for bus stops on busy sections of
the
highways. For
bus
stops
on
lightly trafficked routes, or
where the number of buses halting each
day
is nominal, the layout shown in
Fig. 2 will be better suited. For
hilly
areas
where there
is a
general
constraint on space, the more
simple layout indicated in Fig. 3 may be adopted. Length 'L' shown
in Figs.
1-3
should be usually
15 metres,
but
may be increased in
multiples of
1 5 metres
if more than one bus
is likely to halt at the
pick-up stop at one time.
5.3.
Normally
the
bus stops
should
be
provided on both
sides of
the road for each direction of travel
independently so that
the buses do not have to cut across the road. Bus stops
on
opposite
sides should
be staggered to a certain
extent
as shown in Fig. 4 to
avoid undue congestion on the highway.
At
intersections
it may be
preferable to locate the bus stops
for
up
and
down
directions on
farther sides of the intersection.

5.4.
Ordinarily no structure other than
sheds for passengers
should be
permitted
at the
bus stops. The sheds should be
struc-
turally safe and aesthetic in appearance, while also being functional
so as to protect the
waiting
passengers
adequately from sun, wind
and rain. If the shed
is constructed
on
the
hill side, slopes should
be properly dressed and suitably protected to avoid
slips. The sheds
should be set back from the kerb line by at least 0.25 metres.
5.5.
On important
bus stops,
temporary type of toilet faci-
lities
with necessary
arrangements
for
disposal
of effluents (for
instance with the help
of soak pits) may also
be provided close to
the road land boundary away from the passenger shelters.
6.
PAVING OF LAYBYE AREA
6.1.
The pavement in the laybye
area should have adequate
crust with respect to
the wheel loads expected.
Also, the surfacing
should be strong enough to withstand
forces due to frequent break-
ing and
acceleration
by the
buses.
The
colour and texture of the
laybye
surfacing
should be preferably
distinctive
from that of the
main carriageway.
6.2.
Shoulders close to
the laybyes should be paved to some
distance (see Figs.
1, 3& 4) to permit parking
of
occasional
vehi-
cles and facilitate drainage.
Brick-on edge;
lean cement
concrete,
lean cement-fly ash concrete and lime-fly ash concrete either cast-in-
situ or precast; precast tiles; stone slabs/blocks; water bound
maca-
dam
with
surface
dressing
etc.,
are some of the materials which
could be considered for this purpose.
Paved
shoulders
should
be
flush with the surface of
the adjoining carriageway and slope
away
from
it to enable drainage. Where the pavement and
the shoulders
are of the same colour,
it will be preferable to provide edge lines
at
their junction in accordance with IRC
: 35-1970 "Code of
Practice
for Road Markings (with paints)".
7. DRAINAGE
7.1.
Laybyes for pick-up bus stops should have
proper cross
slope
to
drain
off the
excess
water.
No water which
is likely to
splash on the
waiting
passengers
should
be
allowed
to
collect
near the bus shelters.
7.2.
Along all kerbed edges
it will be
desirable to provide a
suitable
kerb-gutter
section
with
requisite
longitudinal slope and
outlets at intervals to ensure quick disposal of water.

MARKINGS
8.1.
Pavement markings at the bus stops
should be provided
as shown in Figs.
1-3 with the word 'BUS'
written
prominently on
the pavement. Pedestrian crossings should be marked slightly behind
the standing position of
the
buses
in order
to reduce pedestrian
conflicts.
Moreover,
the kerbs
should be
marked with continuous
yellow line to indicate no parking.
8.2.
For more details about road markings reference may be
made to IRC
: 35-1970.
8.3.
Markings should be kept maintained
regularly.
