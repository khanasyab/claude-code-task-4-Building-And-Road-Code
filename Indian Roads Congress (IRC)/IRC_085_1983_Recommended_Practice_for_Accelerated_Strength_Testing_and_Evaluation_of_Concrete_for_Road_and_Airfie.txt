RECOMMENDED PRACTICE FOR ACCELERATED
STRENGTH TESTING AND EVALUATION OF
CONCRETE FOR ROAD AND AIRFIELD
CONSTRUCTIONS
1.
INTRODUCTION
1.1.
The quality acceptance criteria of most cement concrete
works including paving concrete works for roads and
airfields
are
based on the strength of specimens tested
at
the
age
of
28
days
after
curing
under
standard
moist
conditions.
An estimate of
28-day strength of concrete
is sometimes done from the correspond-
ing 7-day strength results for purposes of early quality
control.
In
case
of many
constructions,
the
time
lapse of even 7 days is too
long for the strength results to serve any
useful purpose
from
the
point of either quality control or predicting the 28-day strength.
1.2.
With a view to overcoming
this
problem,
accelerated
strength testing of concrete
has
been recommended
in this docu-
ment
that
would
provide
an
early
information,
say
in
about
a
day,
on
the concrete strength likely to be developed at 28 days.
Such an information may enable taking decision on removal of any
defective concrete very early while
it has still not hardened
much,
or before
it
is
covered
by
subsequent
layer.
It
will
thus
help
achieve better control of concrete quality economically with greatly
reduced chances of rejection.
1.3.
For predicting the compressive and
flexural strengths of
concrete at 7 or 28 days,
it will be desirable
to
obtain
in
advance
in
the
laboratory
along
with
the
mix
design
of
concrete,
the
correlations between the accelerated strength results
and standard
cured strength results at 7
or
28
days,
using
the
material
to
be
actually used in construction. For evaluation of 28-day compressive
strength
of
concrete
through
accelerated
testing,
the
Indian
Standards Institution has already laid
down
detailed
specifications
in
18:9013-1978.
The
present
Recommended
Practice
relates
1



======================================================================
PAGE 6 of 16
======================================================================
IRC
: 85-1983
particularly to the 7 and
28-day
flexural
strength
evaluation
of
concrete through accelerated
curing.
Since
flexural
strength
of
concrete is of
great
importance
to
the
paving
engineers,
this
document will have particular
significance
in
road
and
airfield
constructions.
1.4.
A draft for the Recommended
Practice
was
approved
by
the
Cement
Concrete
Road
Surfacing
Committee
in
their
meeting held at Lucknow on the
28th
January,
1980
(personnel
given
below).
This
was
considered
by
the
Specifications
and
Standards Committee in their meeting held on the 28th May,
1981,
when a
Working Group
consisting
of
P.C.
Bhasin
(Convenor),
Dr. R.K. Ghosh, one representative of I.S.l., one representative of
Cement Research Institute of India and
Member-Secretary, Speci-
fications and Standards Committee was set up to review the draft in
light of the discussion held during the meeting. The Working Group
held its meeting at New Delhi on the 5th August, 1981 and modified
the
draft,
and
later
it
was
approved by the Specifications and
Standards Committee in their meeting held on
the
11th
October,
1982.

This Recommended Practice was later approved by the Execu-
tive Committee and the Council in their meetings held on the
13th
and 24th December, 1982 respectively.
2.
SCOPE
2.1.
This
Recommended
Practice
covers
procedure
for
accelerated curing,
details
of
accelerated
strength
test
under
compression/flexure and evaluation
therefrom
of
strength
under
standard curing for 7 or 28 days, and
is recommended to
be
used
when evaluation of 7 or 28-day
flexural strength
or
both
flexural
and compressive strength
is required from the accelerated strength
tests.
2.2.
For
accelerated
evaluation
of
28-day
compressive
strength only, reference may be
made
to
18:9013-1978
''Method
of Making,
Curing
and
Determining
Compressive
Strength
of
Accelerated-cured Concrete Test Specimens'*, (para
5 -Accelerated
curing by Boiling Water Method).
3.
WORKING PRINCIPLE OF ACCELERATED CURING
The concrete
specimens
(cubes
or
beams)
are
cured
in
boiling water for 3.5 hours ±
5 min. after 23 i J hours
of
casting
them.
The specimens are tested after 2 hours
of
cooling
in
air
under wet gunny bags.
The total period elapsed
between
casting
and testing is 28.5 hours.
4.
APPARATUS FOR ACCELERATED CURING

When
it
is desired
to
conduct
accelerated
strength
test for both compression and flexure, the water bath
which
is
to
provide the accelerated curing conditions, shall consist of a
galva-
nised steel tank of appropriate capacity and
dimensions
and
shall
have a detachable top cover.
A tank should
accommodate
at

4.1.2.
The tank
is to be filled with water to a depth of 25 cm
for 90 cm x 75 cm x 40 cm deep tank so that when the specimens are
placed
in
it,
the
water
level
rises
to
about
7
cm
above
the
top of the moulds.
This level of water
is to be maintained
during
the heating period by adding small amount of water
(as
required)
into the tank from time to time in order to maintain constant
heat
capacity of
the
curing
medium.
Depending
on
the
ambient
temperatures prevalent
at
the
time
of
experimentation,
about
60-75 minutes are required to raise the temperature of water in
the
tank to its boiling
point
near
100°C.
The steam formed
during
heating
is allowed to escape
through
an
outlet
provided
in
the
tank cover, Fig.
2.
4 2.
Water Bath in the Field
At construction sites in the field, where electrical power may
not be available, water may be
brought
to
boiling
by
means
of
heating through coal
or
firewood.
The
dimensions
and
other
arrangements of the water bath should remain the same as describ-
ed in para 4.1.

4.3.
Mould for Concrete Specimens
The moulds for concrete specimens (cubes or beams) shall
be
as per 18:516-1959.
In addition, 6 mm thick mild steel plate (with
machined surface in contact with
concrete)
of
size
corresponding
to that of the moulds is required to cover the specimens
during the
period of curing in boiling water.
The moulds shall
have
suitable
handles for easy removal.
5.
PROCEDURE
5.1.
Concrete cube
and
beam
or
only
beam
shall
be
prepared in accordance with 18:516-1959.
The mould
flanges
are
wiped clean after the concrete
is trowelled level with
the
top
of
the mould.
The specimens are cured for 23 d= i hours under
wet
gunny
bags
at
standard
temperature
(27
±
l^'C).
After
such
curing, the specimens
still in moulds shall be
covered
with
cover
plates (with machined surface in contact with concrete) and placed
in boiling water in the tank.
The temperature of water
will
drop
slightly due to immersion of moulds
but
will
regain
the
boiling
temperature within 15 minutes.
5.2.
The specimens shall be kept in
the
boiling
water
for
3.5 hours ± 5 min.
After this period,
these
should
be
removed
from the tank with hooks having wooden handles,
demoulded and
left to cool in air for two
hours
under
wet
gunny
bags.
Imme-
diately after 2 hours of cooling of the
specimens,
these
shall
be
tested for compressive/flexural strength as per 18:516-1959.
6.
EVALUATION OF 7 OR 28-DAY STRENGTH
6.1.
Ordinarily,
the
correlation
between
the
accelerated
strength results as per procedure described in para 5 and
standard
cured strength results at 7 or 28 days
shall
be
obtained
in
the
laboratory along
with
the
mix
design
of
concrete,
using
the
materials to be actually used
in
the
construction.
These
corre-
lations should be supplied to the site engineer along
with
the
mix
design.

6.2.
Where such correlations are
not
made
available from
the laboratory, general guidance may be had from the
correlations
given in Figs. 3 and 4.
While Fig. 3 gives the statistical correlations
between
accelerated
and
7-day
standard-cured
compressive
strength, Fig.
4
shows
the
same between
accelerated
and
7
or
28-day
standard-cured
flexural
strength.
In
as
much
as
the
correlations
between
accelerated
and
28-day
standard-cured
compressive strength are concerned, Fig. 2 of 18:9013-1978
may be
followed. The correlations shown in Fig. 3 and 4 relate to concrete
mixes using ordinary
portland
cements
having
widely
different
physical and chemical properties
i.e.,
3-day
compressive
strength
varying between 160 and 235 kg/cm^ and 7-day compressive strength
varying between 225
and
330
kg/cm^,
specific
surface
varying
between 3150 and 3720 cm^ per gm (Blaine's), C3S content varying
between 28.4 per cent and 45.5 per cent
and
C2S
content
varying
between
41.5
per
cent and 31.5 per cent, and different aggregates
comprising Delhi
quarzite, dense variety
blast
furnace
slag
from
Bhilai and natural river gravel from Hardwar.
