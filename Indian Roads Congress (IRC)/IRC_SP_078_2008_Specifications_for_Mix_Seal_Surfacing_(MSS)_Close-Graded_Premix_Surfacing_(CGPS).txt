1. INTRODUCTION
1 . 1
The Flexible Pavement Committee of
the Indian Roads Congress in its meeting held
on r' August, 2003 decided to prepare a draft
on recommended
practice
of Mix
Seal
Surfacing under the
title "Development of
New Documents, Priority and Pragrammes."
A Sub-group consisting of S/Shri R.S. Shukla
and
S.K.
Nirmal
was
constituted
for
preparing the document. Accordingly S/Shri
R.S. Shukla and S.K. Nirmal prepared the
draft for the consideration of the Committee.
This draft was circulated to the members of
the
newly
formed
Flexible
Pavement
Committee as decided in the meeting held on
22"** April, 2006.
Subsequently, based on the
discussions in the second meeting held on 9*^
August, 2006, the Committee approved the
draft and authorized Shri S.K. Nirmal to send
the
final
draft
incorporating comments of
members to IRC. The draft document was
considered
in the Highways Specifications
and Standards Committee on 26* May, 2007
and approved. The draft was approved by the
IRC Council on
1 8* August, 2007 subject to
certain modifications, keeping in view the
comments of members and ap{)roval by the
Convenor,

Equipment
All equipment used
for
the
proper
construction of mix
seal surfacing shall be
available at site of the work and shall be in
good working condition,
4.3
Arrangement for Traffic
Adequate provision for the movement
of traffic shall be made in accordance with
IRC:SP:55, as
far as possible, so as not to
interfere
with
the
smooth
construction
operation on the road.
4.4
Preparation of Course
The
course
on
which
Mix
Seal
Surfacing
is
to be
laid
shall be prepared,
reshaped and conditioned to a uniform grade
and profile.
Any depressions or pot holes
shall be properly
filled and compacted
in
advance.
The
surface
of the
underlying
course shall be thoroughly swept clean and
made free from cow dung, dust and foreign
material. A prime coat shall be applied if the
course is granular.
4.5
Application of Tack Coat
Paving bitumen, if used for tack coat
binder,
shall
be
heated
to
its
appropriate
application temperature in bitumen boiler to
achieve desired viscosity of less than 2 poise.
The normal range of spraying temperature for
a bituminous emulsion shall be 20°C to 70°C
and
for
a cutback, 50°C
to 80°C
if
RC-70/MC-70
is
used. Tack
coat
shall be
applied uniformly at the rate given in Section
3.4 using bitumen/emulsion sprayer The tack
coat
shall
be
applied
just
ahead
of
the
spreading ofMix Seal Surfacing.
4.6
Preparation ofPremix
Mechanical mixer shall be used for
mixing the aggregate and bituminous binder
Improvised mixing drums may be used only
when the work is small.
The
bituminous
material
except
emulsion shall be heated to the appropriate
application temperature
in binder tanks, so
designed, as to avoid local overheating and
ensuring a continuous supply. The aggregates
shall be dry and suitably warmed or heated as
required before they
are passed on
to
the
mixer and mixed with the binder When they
are delivered in the mixer, they shall be at a
temperature
which
is
consistent
with
the
requirement ofproper mixing and laying.
After about
1 5 seconds of dry mixing,
the
hot
bituminous
material
shall
be
distributed over the aggregates
at
the
rate
specified in para 3.3 and at the temperature
specified
in Table
5. The mixing
shall be
continued
till
a homogeneous
mixture
is
obtained
where
all
particles
of
mineral
aggregates are uniformly coated.
The mixture shall be transported from
mixing plant to the site in suitable vehicles or
wheel barrows. The required temperatures of
binder,
aggregates
and
mixed
material
at
discharge from plant with different grades of
bitumen/ modified bitumen are given in Table 5.
4.7
Spreading
The mix shall be spread immediately
after
mixing,
preferably,
by
mechanical
paver, spreaders and graders. Uneven surface
if any shall be corrected while the mix is still
hot.

Rolling
As soon as sufficient length of Mix
Seal Surfacing has been laid, rolling shall be
resorted
to by
a
8-10 tonne power
roller.
Rolling
shall commence
at
the edges and
progress towards
the
centre
longitudinally
except
at
super
elevation.
Rolling
shall
progress from the lower to upper edge parallel
to centre
line of the carriageway and over
lapping uniformly each preceding track until
the entire surface has been rolled and all roller
marks
are
eliminated
and
no
more
compaction or crushing of aggregates takes
place. While rolling, the roller wheel shall be
kept damp to prevent picking ofthe mix.
When the roller has passed once over
the entire area, any high spots or depressions
shall be corrected by adding or removing the
extra mix, while the mix is still hot.
The edges along the longitudinal and
transverse joints of Mix Seal Surfacing laid
and compacted, shall be cut to its full depth so
as to expose a fresh surface which shall be
painted with thin coat of appropriate binder
before fresh mix is placed against it.
4.9
Quality Control
Quality Control shall be exercised in
all phases of construction as per IRC:SP:11
"Quality
Control
for
the
Construction
of
Roads and Runways".
4.]
Finished Surface
The
compacted
surface
shall
be
unifomi
and conform
to
grade
lines
and
typical cross section indicated on the plan and
shall present a satisfactory surface.
When
tested
with
a
straight
edge,
the
finished
surface
shall show no variation
greater than
6mm under a 3 metre straight edge.
4.11
Opening the Road to Traffic
The road shall be opened to traffic as
soon
as
the
mix
cools
down
to
ambient
temperature. Speed restrictions may be imposed
at initial stages to prevent the shift of the mix
under fast traffic.
