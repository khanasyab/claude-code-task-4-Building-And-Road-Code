Guidelines  for  Traffic  Safety  Barriers
1  Introduction
Traffic Safety Barriers, also known as Crash Barriers, are provided on high speed highways 
to prevent accidents when vehicles lose control and run off the road. Especially dangerous 
are road sections with sharp curves, approaches to bridges with restricted roadway, high 
embankments, hazardous obstacles such as poles, trees and bridge structural elements. 
Experience has shown that if suitably designed and properly located, it is possible to redirect 
the vehicle nearly parallel to the direction of the barrier, contain within tolerable limits the 
forces experienced by the vehicle occupants, minimize the severity of the accident and reduce 
the damage to property. In view of the highly cost-effective safety provided by these devices, 
they are being extensively used on modern high speed highways. The present guidelines 
have been prepared taking note of the best international practices.
The Road Safety and Design Committee (H-7) deliberated on the draft in a series of meetings. 
The H-7 Committee finally approved the draft document in its meeting held on 25th March, 
2014 and decided to send the final draft to IRC for placing before the HSS Committee.

The Highways Specifications & Standards Committee (HSS) approved the draft document 
in its meeting held on 9th August, 2014. The Executive Committee in its meeting held on 
18th August, 2014 approved the same document for placing it before the Council. The Council 
in its 203rd meeting held at New Delhi on 19th and 20th August, 2014 approved the draft 
“Guidelines for Traffic Safety Barriers” for publishing.
For preparing this document, literature published by Organisations like American Associations 
of State Highways and Transportation Officials, (AASHTO) has been consulted. Indian Roads 
Congress acknowledges with thanks the kind permission given by AASHTO to use some of 
their Figures and Annexures of this document.
2  Type of Traffic Safety Barriers
Two general types of Traffic Safety Barriers are commonly met with, viz:
 
1. 
Road Edge Barrier (also known as Roadside Barriers)
 
2. 
Median Barriers
Road Edge Barriers are those placed at the edge of the road (Fig. 1), whereas Median 
Barriers are those placed in the median of a divided carriageway (Fig. 2).
Fig. 1  Road Edge Barrier
Fig. 2  Median Barrier



======================================================================

IRC:119-2015

Road edge barriers usually consist of metal or concrete beams mounted 30-60 cm above 
the ground on strong posts of wood, concrete or steel. These posts are either driven into 
the ground to a depth of about 110 cm or inserted into holes which are then back filled. This 
serves the purpose of absorbing energy as the posts move in the ground upon impact. Wire 
ropes (Cables) attached to posts by means of spring brackets also are in use.
Median Barriers of the rigid type are popularly known as the New Jersey concrete barrier, 
because of its origin and popular usage in that State in USA. Other types are the double-
faced steel beams on posts and cable (wire).
Depending upon their mode of performance, traffic safety barriers can be classified generally 
as:
	
1.	
Flexible [e.g., Cable (wire) type barriers]
	
2.	
Semi-rigid [e.g., Steel beam type barriers]
	
3.	
Rigid [e.g., Concrete barriers]
The major difference among the various types is the amount of deflection that takes place in 
the barrier when it is hit. The flexible system is the most yielding type. Cable (wire) type barriers 
fall under this category. This system facilitates containment of the vehicle and also redirects 
it. It deflects considerably on being hit and thus requires considerable lateral clearance from 
fixed objects. The wire rope barrier has the minimum impact severity on the occupants of 
the vehicle. The semi-rigid system offers requisite resistance to control the deflection of the 
longitudinal member to an acceptable limit and the errant vehicle is redirected along the 
travel path. Steel beam barriers belong to this category. Rigid barriers do not deflect on 
impact, and cause the maximum severity of impact amongst the three types. The installation 
of a rigid system should be considered where small angles of impact are expected, such 
as along narrow medians or shoulders which could be expected in urban situations. As the 
system suffers little or no damage on impact, it requires the least maintenance effort. Fig. 3 
shows the three types.
Fig. 3  Types of Safety Barriers
3  Requirements of a Traffic Safety Barrier
A traffic safety barrier must meet the following requirements:
	
1.	
The space available behind the barrier must be adequate to permit the full 
deflection of the barrier.



======================================================================
PAGE 11 of 37
======================================================================
IRC:119-2015

2.	
The barrier system must contain and redirect the vehicle at design conditions, 
not allowing it to penetrate or vault over the barrier.
	
3.	
It must not cause sudden acceleration or spin of the vehicle.
	
4.	
The vehicle must remain upright during and after the impact and there should 
not be any loose elements which can penetrate the vehicle.
 
5. 
After impact, the final stopping position of the errant vehicle must intrude 
only minimally into the adjacent traffic lanes.
	
6.	
It must provide good visual guide to the road users.
 
7. 
It must not entail heavy maintenance expenditure.
	
8.	
It must be possible to terminate the system properly.
	
9.	
It must involve reasonably low initial cost, maintenance cost and accident 
cost to the motorist.
	
10.	 It must have an aesthetically pleasing appearance.
 
11. There must be documented evidence of barrier’s performance in the field.
	
12.	 Though in the past, roadside barriers were developed, tested and installed for 
vehicles with masses upto 2,000 kg, it is now being increasingly recognized 
that the barrier systems should be capable of redirecting larger vehicles such 
as buses and trucks.

4.3	
Warrants for Provision
4.3.1	
Barriers on Road Embankments
The warrants for the installation of road edge barriers on road embankments are governed 
by the height and slope of the embankment. These are given in Fig. 4. It may be noted 
that barrier is not warranted for embankment slope of 3:1 or flatter. For Expressways, it is 
necessary to provide roadside safety barriers on embankments where the recoverable slope 
upto a distance of clear zone applicable for the design speed is not available (see Fig. 5).
Fig. 4  Warrants for Fill Section Embankments
4.3.2	
Barriers for Shielding Roadside Objects
A clear, unobstructed, flat roadside is highly desirable. When these conditions cannot be met, 
barriers are needed. The roadside obstacles are classified as non-traversable hazards and 
fixed objects. Some typical examples of non-traversable hazards’ (Table 2) are: rough rock 
cuts, streams or permanent bodies of water (more than 0.6 m in depth) etc. Similarly some 
typical examples of ‘fixed objects’ (Table 1) are: sign posts, traffic signal posts, trees with 
diameter greater than 15 cm etc. The removal of these hazards should be the first alternative 
to be considered. If it is not feasible or possible to remove or relocate a hazard, then a barrier 
may be necessary. However, a barrier should be installed only if it is clear that the barrier offers

the least hazard potential. Fig. 6 shows the suggested criteria for determining the clear zone 
on fill and cut sections for three different vehicle-operating speeds for unrounded shoulder-
slope corner. Non-transversable hazards or fixed objects should be removed, relocated or 
shielded by a barrier if they are within the indicated minimum clear zone width. A “Clear Zone” 
is ‘that roadside border area, starting at the edge of the carriageway, available for safe use 
by errant vehicles’. Establishment of a minimum width clear zone implies that rigid objects 
and certain other hazards with clearances less than the minimum width should be removed, 
relocated to an inaccessible position or outside the minimum clear zone, remodelled to make 
safely traversable or breakaway or shielded. Fig. 6 shows the clear zone width, speed and 
slope criteria.
Fig. 5  Clear Zone
The warrants for typical non-traversable hazards and for fixed objects are given in Tables 1 
and 2 respectively.

Notes : (1)	
Fixed objects should be removed or relocated so that a barrier is unnecessary if 
	
practical.
	
 (2)	
Breakaway or yielding design is desirable regardless of distance from carriageway.
Large sign supports are formidable obstacles and require protective treatment. Where 
continuous guard-rail is not available, sections of barrier should be introduced in front of the 
supports, the length in advance of a sign being not less than 25 m and preferably 40 m. The 
approach end should be flared and anchored. The barrier should normally extend 25 m or 
more beyond the sign support when not anchored, and at least 8 m when anchored. The off-
set between the face of the barrier and the support should not be less than 0.6 m, or if the 
support has a concrete base, it should not be less than 0.5 m.
Protection against collision with lighting columns is difficult, because the columns are 
numerous and are located relatively close to the road edge. Where continuous barrier is 
not justified, columns may be installed without protection, if they are lightweight and are set 
atleast 0.75 or 0.9 m beyond the edge of the useable shoulders. Where barriers are provided, 
the lighting columns should be set not less than 0.5 m, and preferably 0.6 m behind the face 
of the barrier. Short sections of barriers are not recommended at each lighting column as a 
general practice.
4.3.3	
Bridge Rail Ends, Transitions and End Treatments
Fig. 7 summarises the warrants for an approach barrier to a bridge. The criteria for clear zone 
requirements given in Fig. 6 apply here also. If an approach barrier is warranted, adequate 
transition section between the approach barrier and the bridge railing is needed. If the end of 
the approach barrier terminates within the clear zone, a crash worthy end treatment is also 
warranted.

4.3.4	
Barriers for the Protection of Bystanders, Pedestrians and Cyclists
An area of concern in highway safety is the “innocent bystander”. In most such cases, the 
conventional criteria presented earlier cannot be used to establish barrier needs. For example, 
a major street, highway or expressway may adjoin a school yard, but the boundaries are 
beyond the clear zone. Conventional criteria would not require that a barrier be installed. 
However, if there is any reasonable probability of an errant vehicle encroaching on the school 
yard, a barrier would be warranted. If possible, a barrier could be placed near the school 
boundary to minimise the hazard. Special consideration should also be given to business 
and/or residences which are near the right-of-way. For protecting cyclists and pedestrians, 
when sidewalks and cycle tracks are near the carriageway of high speed facilities, safety 
barriers may be provided.
4.3.5	
Barriers for Protection from Ditches 
Ditches near the carriageway can be a significant hazard, if their cross-section cannot be easily 
traversed by an errant vehicle. Preferred ditch cross-sections are shown in the shaded area 
in Figs. 8 to 10. If the cross-section is outside the shaded area, barriers are warranted.

(a) Trapezoidal Ditch, Bottom Width = 1.22 m  to 2.44 m; or
(b) Round Ditch, Bottom Width = 2.44 m to 3.66 m
(Source: Ref. 1)
4.3.6	
Steep Grades
On steep grades, loss of brakes on a vehicle produces a dangerous situation both for the 
driver of the affected vehicle and also for other drivers. In such situations, special consideration 
should be given to the installation of a roadside decelerating device. A gravel bed attenuator, 
starting from the edge of the paved shoulder, comprising of 25 to 50 cm deep bed of graded 
gravel 6 to 10 mm size (rounded or angular) has shown good promise.
4.3.7	
Safety Barriers at Accident Black Spots
If the cause of accidents at black spots is the sharp radius of curve or presence of roadside 
fixed objects like piers, abutments, traffic sign supports, the provision of W-beam safety 
barriers will protect the vehicles from running off the road or colliding against the fixed objects. 
On sharp curves, the W-beam barriers should extend to 100 m beyond the beginning and end 
of the curves. For protection from colliding against fixed objects, the safety barriers length 
should be sufficient enough to protect the fixed objects from the impact of errant vehicles.
4.4	
Selection Guidelines for Edge Barriers
4.4.1	
Main Objective Criteria
Once established that a roadside barrier is warranted, the most appropriate roadside barrier 
system is the one that offers the required degree of shielding at the lowest cost.



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:119-2015

4.4.2	
Performance Capability
The selected design should show satisfactory performance, either through crash testing 
or favourable accident experience within the range of expected conditions. In the Indian 
context, it is to be borne in mind that locations with poor geometrics, high traffic volumes and/
or speeds and a significant volume of heavy truck traffic will warrant a higher performance 
level or stronger railing system in comparison to the situation where only passenger vehicles 
are to be considered.
4.4.3	
Deflection Characteristics
Having determined the performance capability, the type of the barrier to be selected will 
depend on the site characteristics. At sites where the distance between the barrier and the 
shielded object or terrain feature is large, a flexible barrier which deflects upon impact and 
imposes lower impact forces on the vehicle and its occupants is to be preferred. However, if 
the obstacle is immediately adjacent to the barrier, a semi-rigid or rigid barrier system is the 
only choice.
4.4.4	
Site Conditions
Where the distance between the barrier and edge of the carriageway is too wide, a flexible 
barrier is to be preferred over a rigid barrier. Also, if the barrier is to be placed on a slope 
steeper than 1:10, a flexible type barrier should be used. With narrow grade widths and 
corresponding narrow shoulders, the post will have to be embedded deeper and a closer 
post spacing required.
Between the carriageway end and the barrier, the terrain type can greatly affect the barrier’s 
impact performance. Kerbs and roadside slopes are two particular features which need to be 
considered. Crash tests show that use of any guard-rail/kerb combination where high speed, 
high angle impacts are likely, should be discouraged; where there are no feasible alternatives, 
the use of a low kerb (less than 100 mm) or stiffening of the guardrail (to reduce its deflection) 
usually proves satisfactory. On lower speed roads, a vaulting potential still exists, but the risk 
of occurrence being lessened, no design change is warranted. Kerb/barrier combinations 
should be crash tested if extensive use of the combination is envisaged.
4.4.5	
Compatibility
The fewer the different roadside barrier systems used on new construction and reconstruction 
of highway projects, the better it, is because the systems in use have proven effective over 
the years; construction and maintenance personnel are familiar with the systems; parts and 
inventory requirements are simplified and end treatments can be standardised. If, however, 
the site characteristics or performance requirements cannot be satisfied with a standard 
railing, then a non-standard or special barrier design may be resorted to.
4.4.6	
Life Cycle Costs
In the final selection of the most suitable barrier system, the total costs (initial plus maintenance 
costs) of alternate barrier systems play a very important role. As is true for most structures, 
for a high strength barrier, even though the initial cost will be high, the maintenance costs will 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:119-2015
12
be low. However, if the strength of a barrier is not upto the mark initially, it will require more of 
maintenance and, therefore even though the initial cost may be low, the maintenance costs 
will be high.
4.4.7	
Aesthetics and Environmental Considerations
Aesthetics are generally not the controlling factors in the final selection of a roadside barrier 
except that in recreational areas or parks, the barrier which blends well with the surroundings 
should be selected. However, the selected systems should be crashworthy. Certain types 
of railing may deteriorate in highly corrosive urban/industrial environments; in such harsh 
environments, use of galvanised steel and painting with anti-corrosive paints must be resorted 
to. Also, the possibility of using corrosion resistant materials like aluminium or cement 
concrete must be explored in such harsh environments. Where solid barriers are used, care 
must be taken to see that these barriers do not restrict sight distance of motorists. 
4.4.8	
Field Experience
Documented proof of a barrier’s field performance is of paramount importance. There is little 
reason, if at all, to install a barrier for which the performance record is not available. In the 
Indian context, impact performance and repair cost data must be maintained by the concerned 
highway agency and made available to engineers responsible for selecting and installing 
traffic barriers. A format for recording the performance details is enclosed at Annexure I.
4.5	
Types of Road Edge Barriers
The following types of Road Edge Barriers commonly used in the USA are recommended: -
 
i) 
Blocked out “W” beam type steel barrier
 
ii) 
Blocked out Thrie beam type steel barrier
 
iii) 
Wire rope barrier 
4.6	
Blocked-out “W” Beam type Steel Barrier
Blocked-out “W” beam type Steel Barrier with steel post is shown in Fig. 11. It consists of a 
steel post and a 3 mm thick “W” beam rail element attached to a steel block, which in turn is 
attached to the steel post. The barrier is of a semi-rigid type. The steel post and the blocked-
out spacer are channel section 75 mm x 150 mm size 5 mm thick. The rail shall be 700 mm 
above the ground and 1100 mm below the ground, and shall be spaced at 2 m centre to 
centre. The posts, beam, spacer and fasteners shall be galvanised by the hot dip process.
4.7	
Blocked-out Thrie Beam Type Steel Barrier
A Blocked-out Thrie-Beam type steel barrier is shown in Fig. 12. This design is costlier than 
the simple W beam type discussed earlier, but is less prone to damage by vehicle collisions, 
especially for shallow angle impacts. The post and spacer blocks are of steel channel section 
75 mm x 150 mm x 5 mm. The spacing of the posts is 2 m centre to centre. The post is 850 
mm above the ground and is driven into the ground to a length of 1150 mm. All the steel 
components and fasteners are galvanised by the hot dip process.

4.8 
Advantages of Using Channel Sections  vis á vis Ι-Section
It is interesting to observe that most of the American designs adopt channel sections in 
preference to Ι-sections for a variety of reasons. The channel sections make the connections 
with other components of the barrier system much more convenient than for Ι-sections. In 
general, the flat surface area exposed in channel sections is more than what can be made 
available with Ι-sections. Under the same load, a channel section will deform more than a 
corresponding Ι-section, thus reducing the magnitude of impact on the impacting vehicle. 
Lastly, channel sections are more economical than Ι-sections.
4.9	
Minimum Length of Safety Barriers and foundation Details
The minimum length of safety barrier shall be 50 m. For barriers at hazardous location 2/3rd 
of length shall be before the hazard and 1/3rd after hazard. The overall design, length and 
foundations shall be such that meet the specifications given in Annexure II.
4.10	
End Treatment for Steel Edge Barriers
An untreated end of the roadside barrier can be hazardous if hit, because the barrier beam 
can penetrate the passenger compartment and cause the impact vehicle to stop abruptly. 
End treatments should, therefore, form an integral part of safety barriers. An end treatment 
should not spear, vault or roll a vehicle for head-on or angled impacts.
The end treatment on approach shall be Modified Eccentric Loader Terminal (MELT) 
arrangement as shown in Fig. 13 and departure sides it shall be Trailing Terminal (TT) 
arrangement shown in Fig. 14. Following the same end treatments, Fig. 15 gives the typical 
layout of W-beam whether on raised median sides or on depressed/flushed median sides.

At road cross sections in cutting or if the road transitions from cut to fill, the safety barriers 
can be anchored in backslopes. The backslope covering the anchored portion of the barriers 
should be graded flat, with side slopes preferably not steeper than 10:1. The anchored portion 
should develop tensile strength in the rail element to prevent the rail from pulling out of the 
anchorage. The barrier can also be anchored in an earthen berm specially constructed for 
this purpose, provided the new berm itself is not a hazard to the traffic. The earthen berm 
should be made resistant to erosion.
4.11	
Placement of Road Edge Barriers of Steel
Placement recommendations determine the exact layout of the barrier and should be made 
by the design engineer keeping in view the lateral offset of the barrier and flare rate. The final 
layout shall be a site having specific combination of these factors. The barriers should be as 
far away from the traffic as possible and should preferably have uniform clearance between 
the traffic and the hazard.
As far as possible, the safety barrier should be placed beyond 2.5 m of the travelled way. 
For long and continuous stretches, this offset is not critical. The distance between the barrier 
and the hazard should not be less than the deflection of the barrier by an impact of a full 
sized vehicle. In case of embankments, a, minimum distance of 60 cm should be maintained 
between the barrier and the start of embankment slope or a hazard to prevent the wheels 
from dropping over the edge.
The W-beam and Thrie beam perform well on the outside of curves and even those of 
relatively small radius. When a kerb exists on the edge of road and on to close proximity 
to the travelled way, whether on shoulder or median edge lines, a distance of 100 mm shall 
be maintained between the vertical face of the kerb and the W-beam or Thrie beam face 
to ensure that the impacting vehicle does not vault over the safety barrier and at the same 
time reduces the nuisance hit. The steel barrier shall be placed in such a way so as not to 
be collided by the vehicle directly. Fig. 17 gives the lateral clearance to be maintained in 
different site conditions.

Wire Rope Barrier
Wire rope safety barriers have galvanized prestressed steel wire ropes (generally three or 
more in number) supported by galvanised steel posts at spacing of 2 – 4 m, depending upon 
the manufacturer’s design. The overall length of the post is 680-700 mm above the ground. 
The posts are driven to a depth of 400 mm into the ground. Typical details are shown in 
Figs. 18, and 19. The details in Figs. 20 and 21 show the transition from the wire rope to 
W-beam and wire rope to rigid barrier respectively. 
Wire rope barriers shall not be used:
	
a)	
where the length of the barrier at full height would be less than 24 m;
 
b) 
on horizontal curves of radius less than 200 m;
	
c)

5  Median barriers
5.1 
Definition 
As the name suggests, median barriers are those that are provided in the medians of 
highways. They accordingly protect the traffic on both the carriageways. They are intended 
to prevent head-on collisions, especially on highways with narrow medians, caused by out-
of-control vehicles jumping across the medians. They also shield fixed objects on the median 
from the traffic flow.
5.2	
Warrants
The requirements of a median barrier is a function of the width of the median and the traffic 
volume on the road. Fig. 22 indicates the warrants for provision of median barriers in terms 
of the combination of median width and Average Daily Traffic (ADT) in PCUs (Passenger Car 
Units). At ADT less than 20,000 PCUs and with medians wider than 9 m, the probability of a 
vehicle crossing across the median is relatively low and median barriers in such cases are 
optional. Medians with width between 9 and 15 m do not warrant a barrier unless there is an 
adverse history of median cross-overs.



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 37
======================================================================
IRC:119-2015
18
Fig. 22  Warrants for Median Barriers
(Source : Ref. 1)
Median barriers may be impractical, where a road has a large number of closely spaced 
median openings since the barrier needs to be terminated with an end treatment at these 
points.
For an existing highway, an evaluation of the number of median openings, accident history, 
alignment, sight distance, design speed, traffic volume and median width need to be made 
prior to taking a decision to install a median barrier.
Median barriers should also be provided to shield fixed objects in a narrow median. If 
necessary, median barriers should be flared to encompass a fixed object, which may be a 
lamp post, foundation of overhead signs, bridge pier etc.
On rural sections of highways where speeds are likely to exceed 50 km/ hr, raised and kerbed 
medians are conducive to accidents. Better alternative is to provide depressed medians. 
The minimum width of depressed median shall be 4 m, and median barriers shall be placed 
centrally.
However, several sections of highways in India exist with kerbed medians of a width of 
4-5 m In such cases, Blocked-out “W” Beam Type of Steel Barrier (Fig. 24) or Blocked-out 
thrie Beam Steel Barrier (Fig. 25) are to be provided behind the kerbs. Considering the 
vehicle trajectory over kerbs, when safety barriers are to be installed on kerbed medians, 
the safety barrier should be placed in such a way that the vehicle bumper would hit directly 
on the safety barrier than first with the face of the raised kerb, and the distance between the 
vertical face of the kerb and W-beam shall not be more than 100 mm. The placement details 
are given in Fig. 15.

5.3	
Selection Guidelines for Median Barriers
5.3.1	
Main Objective Criterion
The main objective criterion for the selection of the most appropriate median barrier system 
is that it must satisfy performance requirements at minimum total cost (i.e., initial construction 
plus maintenance costs).
5.3.2	
Barrier Capability
While in most situations, a standard barrier which can effectively re-direct passenger cars 
and light vans and trucks will suffice, for locations with poor geometrics, high traffic volumes 
and speeds and high proportion of heavy trucks, higher performance level barriers will be 
necessary.
5.3.3	
Barrier Deflection Characteristics
Flexible or semi-rigid barriers are suitable for relatively wide, flat medians provided that the 
design deflection distance is less than half the median width. Where the medians are narrow, 
within the heavily trafficked road, a rigid barrier will be appropriate, having practically no 
deflection when hit.
5.3.4	
Compatibility
The appropriate type of median barrier will also depend on its compatibility with other median 
features such as overhead sign supports, street light poles and bridge piers. If a non-rigid 
barrier is used in such cases, crashworthy transition sections must be available to stiffen 
the barrier locally, if the fixed object is within the design deflection distance of the barrier. 
Additionally crashworthy end treatment is also necessary, if the barrier begins or terminates 
in a location where it is likely to be struck by an errant motorist.
5.3.5	
Costs
As for roadside barriers, the initial cost of a median barrier increases with strength but 
maintenance costs decrease with increased strength. The costs of personal injuries to the 
driver and occupants as well as damage to impacting vehicle should also be considered. If 
a barrier is located in the centre of a median (where it is less likely to be struck by a vehicle) 
and during repairs, closing of a traffic lane is not required, flexible or semi-rigid barrier is to be 
preferred. If, however, the barrier has to be placed immediately adjacent to the traffic lane, a 
rigid barrier is to be preferred.
5.3.6	
Maintenance
The same considerations as applicable to roadside barriers also apply to the median barriers; 
however, collision maintenance is usually a more important factor for median barriers. In 
order to avoid closing down of traffic for repairs or replacement of damaged barriers, which 
poses a hazard both for the maintenance team and the motorists, a rigid concrete barrier is 
to be preferred for high speed, high volume expressways.
5.3.7	
Terrain
The type of terrain between the edge of the carriageway and the barrier can significantly affect 
the impact performance of the barrier. Kerbs and sloped medians (including superelevated 



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 37
======================================================================

IRC:119-2015
21
sections) are two important features to be considered. A kerb, either when used alone or 
when placed in front of a median barrier, should not be used for purposes of redirecting errant 
vehicles. For sloped medians, the recommendations are shown in Fig. 23.
5.3.8	
Aesthetic and Environmental Considerations
The same considerations as applicable to roadside barriers also apply to median barriers.
5.4	
Types of Median Barriers 
The following types of median barriers are recommended for use: 
 
i) 
Blocked-out “W” beam type Steel Barrier
 
ii) 
Blocked-out Thrie beam Barrier
 
ii) 
Wire Rope Barrier
5.5	
Blocked out “W” Beam type Steel Barrier
The blocked-out “W” beam type steel median barrier shall be similar to the road edge barrier 
described in para 4.6 earlier, except that the “W” beam shall be provided on both sides of the 
post with similar spacers. Typical details are given in Fig. 24.
Fig. 18  Typical details of Wire Rope safety Barrier
5.6	
Blocked-out Thrie Beam type Steel Median Barrier

described in para 4.7 earlier, except that the “W” beam shall be provided on both sides of the 
post with similar spacers. Typical details are given in Fig. 25.

Wire Rope Barrier Used in the Median
The wire rope barrier used in medians is the same arrangement as on the road edge barrier 
as the weaving of the ropes ensure the performance of the barrier is the same when impacted 
on either side. When used in medians, the wire rope barrier has been proven to be effective 
in containing and arresting heavier vehicles due to the embedding of the rope in the vehicles 
structure. Photo 1 and 2 illustrate the arrangement.

5.8	
End Treatment for Steel Median Barriers
The steel median barriers shall be provided with a “turned-down-guard-rail” end treatment as 
described in para 4.9 except that no flaring is to be provided.
5.9	
Concrete Median Barriers
Concrete median barriers are rigid barriers having a sloped front in each face. The barriers 
shall be constructed by one of the following methods: 
 
a) 
in situ between fixed forms
	
b)	
in situ between sliding forms
	
c)	
in pre-cast units.

The method of attaining the transition at the end of the installation is illustrated in Fig. 28. 
The barriers shall be terminated sufficiently away from the median openings with the twin 
objectives of preventing impact by the turning traffic and providing adequate sight distance 
to the turning traffic.
5.10	
Placement Recommendations for Median Barriers
At locations, where the two adjacent carriageways are at the same level, the barrier shall be 
placed in the centre of the median, duly taking into consideration the drainage requirements. 
The placement of median barriers, in cases where the two carriageways are at different 
levels is a function of the slopes between the two medians. Recommended placement for 
various combinations is indicated in Fig. 23.

Safety Barriers on Bridge Decks and Hill Roads
5.11.1	
Barriers on Bridge Decks
On grade-separated structures, the parapets and railings can be replaced by cement concrete 
safety barriers. A typical design is enclosed in Fig. 29. The reinforcing bars of the barrier can 
be as shown in Fig. 26, and these bars can be extended downwards into the structural RCC 
slab.
Fig. 29  Concrete Safety Barrier at Bridge Deck
5.11.2	
Safety Barriers on Hill Roads
The conventional method of providing safety on the valley side of hill roads is through dry 
stone masonry parapets with bands of masonry in cement mortar. This option is mainly 
because of cost consideration and the easy availability of stone obtained from blasting the 
hill face. However, a W-Beam metal barrier is a good option, though costlier. 
6  GENERAL  RECOMMENDATIONS
6.1	
Raised Kerbs or Drains
Raised Kerbs or drains should not be provided between the carriageway and the barriers. 
These destabilise the vehicle balance and disturb its equilibrium before it strikes the barrier, 
thus defeating the essential purpose of safety and redirection of the impacting vehicles. It is 
a good practice to avoid kerbed and raised medians in dual carriageways of highways.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:119-2015
28
6.2	
Maintenance
6.2.1	
Routine Maintenance
Routine maintenance comprises only occasional cleaning and painting; right-of-way mowing 
of grass and vegetation control. However, if preservative-treated wood posts and galvanised 
steel posts/ rail compartments are used, there is only a nominal routine maintenance 
requirement.
6.2.2	
Collision Maintenance
All repairs or adjustments to barriers that are necessitated by vehicle impact fall under this 
category of maintenance. Bulk of the maintenance costs are usually due to collision repairs 
and these costs, to a large measure, influence the selection of the most appropriate system. 
The number of impacts that may be expected to occur will depend on the traffic speed and 
volume, distance between the edge of carriageway and barrier and road geometrics. The 
extent of barrier damage naturally depends on the strength of the railing system, given a 
particular impact situation. On very high speed facilities like expressways where the rail 
repair is difficult and collisions with the barrier are frequent, a rigid traffic barrier is to be 
preferred. In flexible barriers, the possible re-use of the post and rail systems after a vehicle 
impact is to be considered; if beyond repair, only the salvage value is to be considered.
6.2.3	
Simplicity in Design; Material and Storage
The expertise required for the repairs on the part of the repair team of technicians should be 
an important consideration in the selection of a particular barrier system. The design of the 
barrier system should be such that it is easy to repair any damaged components or to replace 
them. It is always advantageous to use only a few barrier systems along the highways for 
which the various components are standardised, so that the needed repairs to a barrier, after 
being hit by a vehicle, can be carried out conveniently and expeditiously with the spare parts 
stored in adequate numbers/quantities.
