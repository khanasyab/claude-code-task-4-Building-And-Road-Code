INTRODUCTION
Quality control of construction
materials
and
product
is an
essential requirements for obtaining improved and uniform standard
of roads.
Towards this
end,
a three-day Symposium on 'Quality
Control in the Construction of Roads and Runways,' was organised
under the joint auspices
of the
Indian
Roads
Congress
and
the
Central Road
Research
Institute
in New
iDelhi
from
27th
to
29th February, 1968.
At the concluding Session of this Symposium,
the following resolutions were adopted
:
(1) that quality control of materials and
the end
product
together with
process
involved
should
form
an
integral
part
of
construction
specifications
of road and
runway
projects,
and
that
materials
survey be carried out for each project at the rough estimate stage;
(2) that wherever necessary, the
existing
specifications be
reviewed
so
as
to
be
realistic and
to
provide
for adequate
quality
control
measures fair to all concerned;
(3 )
that adequate financral outlay
be
provided
in
the form of
either a
basic
budgetary
provision
or
as
a
percentage
of each
project
estimate to meet the expenses of quality control;
(4) that a Committee of experts be set up to
prepare a handbook giving
all the details of
quality
control code and
that
the handbook
be
reviewed periodically based on experience gained;
(5) that short term training programmes
be
organised
to
provide the
requisite trained personnel for quality control.
In pursuance of Resolution No. 4, a
Committee consisting of
the following members was constituted for drafting the Handbook:
(1) Shri S.N. Sinha
Convenor
(2) Shri M.K. Chatterjee
Member
(3) Shri J. Datt
(4) Dr. M.P. Dhir
„
(5) Dr. R.K. Ghosh
(6) Shri T.K. Natarajan

Introduction
The above Committee, in turn,
constituted
four Subcommit-
tees to prepare drafts of various Sections.
Later,
the
Committee
decided that, before
finalising
the
Handbook,
its
main
tentative
.
recommendations
regarding
the quantum of testing, control tests,
acceptable tolerances and method of
interpretation
of results, in a
summarised form,
be
placed
before
the
National
Seminar
on
Roads and Bridges at Bombay
in
October, 1968
for wider discus-
sion.
For
this
purpose,
a
Working
Group
consisting
of
Dr. M.L. Puri, Dr. M.P. Dhir and Shri
R.P.
Sikka
was entrusted
with responsibility of preparing the
required summary for circula-
tion to the delegates attending the National Seminar.
The
Recommendations
of
the
National
Seminar
were
discussed by the Committee and in light of the
discussions, a draft-
ing
Subcommittee
comprising
Prof.
C.G.
Swaminathan,
Shri T.K. Natarajan and Dr. M.L.
Puri
was
formed
to complete
the draft.
The draft prepared by the
Subcommittee
was
discussed
by
the Committee
in
a
series
of
meetings
and
a
Working Group
consisting of Shri R.P. Sikka, Dr.
M.P.
Dhir and
Dr.
M.L. Puri
processed
the same.
It
was
then
considered
by
the
Executive
Committee of the Indian
Roads
Congress,
in
its meeting held at
Gandhinagar on 25-11-72.
Thereafter,
the
Council of the Indian
Roads Congress at its meeting
held
at
Gandhinagar
on the same
day finally approved the draft of this Handbook of Quality Control
for being published
as
a
Special Publication of the Indian Roads
Congress.
The Manual was revised in 1977 (First
Revision) to incorpo-
rate the new standards on surface evenness approved by the I.R.C.
Council at its Meeting
held
in
Madras
on
28.8.76.
The
second
revision
includes
the
prescribed
equipment
for different labora-
tories
and
the
forms
to
be
used
for
recording
the
results of
observation/test results by the field officers.

CHAPTER 1
GENERAL
1.1.
Need for Quality Control
1.1.1.
Quality control
is an essential
part of any production
process
and
highway
constructions
are no
exception.
Quality
control
is an important requirement
for highway
construction for
ensuring quality and
for creating
durable
national
assets.
The
need for quality control on these
constructions
has increased con-
siderably in recent
times
due
to a
significant
increase in traffic
intensities, and
the level of service
expected of highway facilities.
Improved level of service of the highways
will result in considera-
ble savings in vehicle operating
cost and in
favourable
road user
reaction and public opinion.
Quality
control
in the form of sen-
sory checks which are
intrinsically
subjective
and
qualitative
is
grossly inadequate for present-day needs and must instead be based
on proper objective and quantitative measurements.
1.1.2.
It
is common
knowledge
that quality control, besides
leading to constructions of
improved
quality end uniformity, and
ensuring a more economical
utilisation of materials, also affords a
significant reduction in user costs, in terms of lower costs of vehicle
operation,
transportation
and
maintenance.
The
extra
cost of
exercising
quality
control
being only a
fraction of the resulting
benefits,
is a
highly
economical
proposition, in as much as on an
average project
it is estimated
that
the
cost of
exercising quality
control
would be
just
1 J to 2 per
cent of
the
construction cost.
On the other hand, the
direct
and indirect
economic return from
quality control could be of the order of 5 to 10 per cent of the total
construction cost and even more.
1.2.
Pre-requisites for Quality Control
The prc-requisites for effective
control of highway construc-
tions are
:
(i)
Construction
specifications
and
estimates
should
provide
for
effective quality control.



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 144
======================================================================
4
General
(ii)
Adequately trained staff and
equipped
agency for exercising quality
control should be set up.
(iii)
Periodic appraisal
of the
quality
control
data should be made not
only for
implementation
during
construction
but also for effecting
possible
improvements
in
quality
control
and
construction
techniques themselves.
(iv)
Updating of knowledge by on job training
.
1.3.
Organisational Set-op for Quality Control
1.3.1.
The requirements of a quality control organisation will
obviously vary on different projects depending on the departmental
set-up of the concerned highway agency. For. example, the
organi-
sation of quality control work
at a
single
centrally situated large
project will need to be on quite different lines than at average sized
scattered projects.
In this
chapter
only the
broad guidelines for
the organisation
of
quality
control
work
at
road
projects are
discussed.
The actual set-up may
be evolved
in the background
of various factors
involved.
For the suggested
pattern
of quality
control set-up in this handbook a typical
Organisational set-up ha?
been drawn up and shown below:

General
5
1.3.2.
In any organisational
set-up,
che
central agency has
an important role
as
regards
implementation
of quality control
standards by way of
drafting
and
constant
review of the quality
control criteria included
in
the
construction
specifications.
The
implementation of quality control in the field would normally invo-
lve three sub-agencies viz. the construction staff of the
Engineer-in-
Chacge, the constructing agency ^nd the quality
control team. The
construction staff and quality
control teams
must
have distinctly
defined functions
and
inter-relationships
so as to
avoid possible
conflicts.
The quality control team may consist of staff of regional
laboratories and
field
laboratories
working
under the technical
direction of the Central Laboratory.
1.3.3.
As far as the field laboratories are concerned, the per-
iodic quality control data
collected
by them
should be promptly
fed to the site engineer,
as
the
latter is
responsible for ensuring
quality and speed of
construction.
In addition,
the data will also
be submitted to the
Superintending
Engineer/Chief
Engineer
as
well as to the Head of the
Central Laboratory;
to the former with
a
view
to
ensure
continuity
as
well
as
compatibility
of the
specifications in
practice, and
to the
latter for
purpose of feed-
back.
This may be
regarded
as
a
tentative
recommendation,
subject to review and
modification, as and
when experience accu-
mulates.
1.3.4.
The
expenditure
on quality control may be charged
to the works and the staff as well as equipment shifted from project
to project depending upon
the requirements.
The quality control
staff should not be on work-charged basis but form part
of regular
staff and be
properly
trained
for the
work they are required to
handle, for which suitable training
facilities
should be afforded by
the department,
either in
their
own
Central Laboratory or any
other Laboratory.
To provide for
the cost of quality control,
it is
suggested that this may be included as a distinct item in the various
work estimates.
1 .4.
Types of Quality Control
1.4.1.
Over the years, two types of
methods
have emerged
for exercising quality
control
during
the
construction of works.
One is generally known as *Process control'
and the other as 'End



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 144
======================================================================
6
General
rcsuU' type of
control.
In the
former,
the
designer makes the
decisions regarding the type of
equipment,
the procedure of con-
struction and the amount
of work
required
to obtain the desired
result.
In the *End result* type of control, the construction agency,
which may be a private contractor, has a free
hand in the selection
of construction methods and equipment to
achieve the desired end
product.
1.4.2.
The choice of either type of control
is largely a matter
of judgment, depending
on
the
magnitude
of the
job, different
environmental
factors
involved,
and
the available facilities.
In
India, gradually the trend
is
towards *End result*
type of working
on highway pavement and embankment
construction jobs.
But in
several situations, for
example
on small jobs, or where jnput type
of tests like material gradation and purity of lime are to be carried
out, expediency
would
be in
adopting
*Proccss type* of control.
Because of circumstances, a combination of the
* Process* and *End
result' types of control will continue to be adopted in India, depen-
ding on the nature and size of the job.
1.4.3.
In the 'End
result*
type
of
specification,
the
field
engineering personnel
carry out
tests on finished work at regular
intervals
to
evaluate
whether
it
meets
the specification require-
ments or not.
On
the other
hand, in
Trocess type' control, the
responsibility of field personnel
is to make sure that
the work in
its
different phases
is executed in the manner
predetermined and laid
down in specifications.
1.4.4.
The details given in
this Handbook arc for a combina-
tion of ^Process* and 'End result*
types of
quality control which
is
generally being practised in this country.
1.5.
SpecilBcations for Work
The handbook draws
heavily
upon
the
existing Standards/
Specifications
of
Indian
Roads
Congress by way of abstracting
essential
requirements
of
construction
for the
various items of
work.
Reference is given to the
relevant Standards at appropriate
places in the Handbook. A complete
list of all the standards refer-
red to with their full title
is included at Appendix 1.



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 144
======================================================================
General
1.6.
Control of Materials
1.6.1.
The quality control tests on
materials indicated in the
subsequent chapters, are
intended essentially
to be carried out on
the material
brought
to site.
However,
at times, from practical
and other considerations, some testing could be done advantageou-
sly at the material source.
In these
circumstances,
" e Engineer-
in-Charge may do additional testing at site as may be found neces-
sary to ensure that the materials being incorporated in the constru-
ction are of specified quality.
1.6.2.
All the materials
brought to the
site shall be stacked
and stored as specified so as to prevent
deterioration or
intrusion
by foreign matter
and
to ensure the
preservation of their quality
and fitness for work.
Materials which have been improperly stored
or have been stored for long periods shall be
re-tested where their
suitability for incorporation in the work is in doubt.
1.7.
Test Procedures
1.7.1.
The
procedure
for testing of different materials and
work shall be in accordance with the relevant
standards of Indian
Bureau of Standards where these are
available. Reference has been
drawn to these standards at appropriate places
in the
Handbook.
A consolidated
list
of
the
standards
with their
full
title is
at
Appendix 2,
1.7.2. Where specific procedure of testing
is not indicated, the
tests shall be carried out as per the prevalent
accepted engineering
practice to the direction of the Engineer-in-Charge.
1 .8.
Frequency and Extent of Testing
The frequency and extent of testing indicated in the Handbook
is the minimum considered necessary for
normal conditions.
It is
envisaged
that additional testing shall be carried out for abnormal
conditions where variations may be excessive or where circumstan-
ces so warrant otherwise.
1.9.
Acceptance Criteria
1.9.1.
Acceptance Criteria for different items of work where
sufficient
experience
was
available
have
been
setforth
in
the
Handbook
in
respective
chapters.
For
other items, acceptance



======================================================================
PAGE 18 of 144
======================================================================
8
General
may
be
based
on
minimum
values
or
statistical
analysis
as
is
considered judicious.
1.9.2.
For effective control on quality of materials and work,
it
will
usually be necessary
to lay down the acceptance criteria in
the contract documents.
1.10.
Range
of Equipment
for
a Central, Regional and Field
Testing Laboratory
1.10.1.
Range of equipment required for a central,
regional
and
field
testing
and
control
laboratories
is indicated in Appen-
dix 3
for
guidance.
The
list
includes
such
equipment
as
will
normally be required for quality control operations spelt out in the
Handbook.
Individually, quality control
units
could be suitably
equipped
with
the
help
of
this
list depending
on
the
type and
volume of work to be controlled.
Special equipment as given in the
appendix can be procured depending upon the requirement.
1.10.2.
Testing facilities
:
Testing facilities should comprise
Laboratories at Central, Regional and Field
levels.
The
Central
laboratory
located
at
headquarterswill
(a)
provide
testing
facilities for tests of specialized nature, (b) act
as
regional labora-
tory for works circle (s)
at
headquarters,
(c) act
as
the
nodal
laboratory for Research schemes
in the
State and
Central sectors,
(d) bring out manuals for testing procedures.
The Central labora-
tory headed by the Director, may have
for quality
control
work,
scientists from Geology, Chemistry and
Physics
disciplines.
The
list
of
suggested equipment to be provided
in Central laboratory
are avilable at Appendix 3.
The Regional laboratories
located at circle level will be hea-
ded by Executive Engineers (Quality Control)
assisted by scientists
from Geology, Physics and Chemistry disciplines.
Regional labor-
atories will provide testing support to
the (a) Engineers working in
the circles and (b) Research teams from Central and State Highway
R&D institutions.
In
addition they shall provide all
facilities for
training
of all the Quality Control staff in the Region.
The
list of
suggested
equipment
to
be
provided
in Regional laboratories is
given at Appendix 3.
It
is neither feasible nor advisable to send samples for routine

tests
all
the
way to the Regional laboratories and delay the work
for
want
of test results.
Setting up facilities for basic tests at the
level of Junior Engineer/Engineering subordinate is therefore neces-
sary.
Some
other
equipments
may
have
to
be provided at sub
Divisional/Divisional
level.
A
list
of equipment
suggested to be
provided
at
Site/Sub
divisional/Divisional
level
can
be
seen at
Appendix 3.
1.11.
Recording of the Test Results
The tests shall be carried out in accordance with the standard
procedures and the results shall be recorded in the proformae given
at Appendix 4.
It
is desirable
that of the
total
tests, 70 per cent
arc carried on by the Junior Engineer, 20 per cent by the
Assistant/
Deputy Engineer and the remaining 10 per cent by
the
Executive
Engineer.
The
test
result
record
registers
shall be
presented
with every third runnipg bill so that the payments
get
linked
with
the assured quality of work.
1.12.
Training for Quality Control
In order to bring awareness in the officers of department and
to up date their knowledge of methods of testing, regular workshops
on quality control should be held.
• To make the participants aware
of
basic
necessities
like
specifications,
required
test acceptance
criteria,
frequency
of
testing and methodology of tests for under-
standing
the quality control system and operation of regional/field
laboratories.
The
training
could
be
imparted
by
known road
research institutes or through on job training.
1.13.
Scope of the Handbook
1.13.1.
This
Handbook
is intended to be a handy reference
for the general work of quality control at various highway constru-
ctions.
It
is
not in any way meant to be a substitute for the rele-
vant departmental specifications for construction and materials, but
only
as
a
guide
to complement these.
For certain items, where
need was felt, broad guidelines on salient construction features have
been included in the Handbook.
These are for guidance only and
should not be taken to constitute specifications.
1.13.2.
Even
though
the Handbook
is intended mainly for
highway
constructions,
it will be found equally advantageous for a
number of facets of runway constructions as well.

EARTHWORK
2.1;
General
2.1.1.
It
is the responsibility of the field engineer
to
ensure
that
the
density
assumed
by
the
designer
is
achieved
at
the
expected moisture
content.
The
way
to
ensure
this
is
to
test
samples for moisture and density and to take
appropriate
correc-
tive measures, as necessary.
The rate of testing on a given project
would depend
on
several
factors,
such
as
the
homogeneity
or
otherwise
of
the
material
from
the
borrowpits,
the nature and
quantum of machinery or manual labour
employed,
and
terrain
conditions, so that the number of particular tests to
be
conducted
for say 1000 cubic metres of the material involved, would
entirely
be a matter of engineering judgment.
Therefore,
the
frequency
of testing indicated at the end of .this chapter should
be
regarded
as indicative of the minimum number of tests to be conducted with
full realisation of the fact that the rate of testing would have to
be
increased if
circumstances so warrant.
2.1.2.
Discussion of
other
aspects
such
as
the
minimum
densities to be obtained, selection of rolling
equipment,
thickness
of
layer,
etc.,
are
considered
to
be
outside
the
scope
of this
chapter.
For
guidance
in
this respect, reference should be made
to
the
relevant
specifications, IRC
:

"Recommended
Practice
for
Construction
of
Earth
Embankments
for

Works".
2.2.
Earthwork— Materials and Process Selection of Soils
2.2.1.
The soil to be used for making up
the
embankment
shall be free from stumps and root rubbish which might affect the
stability of the embankment.
2.2.2.
The selection of materials for construction of the em-
bankment shall be made after conducting
necessary
soil
surveys
and laboratory investigations, as set out in IRC
:
36-1970.

Earthwork
2.2.3.
Only approved
materials
should
be
utilised
in
the
body of the embankment.
2.2.4.
Processing and placement
:
To obtain adequate
com-
paction,
the
embankment
shall be constructed in
uniform layers.
Due
care
shall
be
exercised to
ensure
that
loose
thickness
of
each layer does not exceed the
specified
limits.
Successive
layers
of embankment
shall
not
be placed until the
layer
under
con-
struction
has
been
thoroughly compactedto
satisfy the
specified
requirements.
2.2.5.
After adjusting the moisture content
whether
at
the
road side or at borrow area, (making due allowance for
evapora-
tion losses), the
soil
shall
be
processed
by
means
of
graders,
harrows, rotary mixers, other suitable equipment or even manually
if no equipment
is available until the moisture distribution
is reaso-
nably uniform. Clods or hard lumps of earth where present shall be
broken down to sizes preferably of the order
of
5 cm
but
under
no
circumstances
shall
the
maximum size of clods exceed 15 cm
when soil is being placed in the body of the embankment and 6 cm
when
it is being placed in the top 50 cm of the embankment.
2.2.6.
Moisture content at the
time
of compaction
:
Unless
otherwise specified,
the
moisture
content of each layer of
soil at
the time of compaction except in the
case of highly expansive soils
should
be
at optimum moisture content subject to the
permitted
tolerances.
Highly
expansive
soils
such
as
black
cotton
soil
should
be
compacted
at
the
specified
moisture
content
which
is
usually
on
the
higher
side
of the
optimum
moisture
con-
tent.
The tolerance limits for variation
of moisture content from
the specified moisture content are normally +
1 per
cent and — 2
per cent.
2.2.*^.
Densities to be aimed at
in
the
compaction
process
shall be chosen with jdue regard to factors such as soil type,
height
of embankment, drainage
conditions,
position
of
the
individual
layers and type of plant available for compaction.
2.2.8.
Each compacted layer shall be tested in the
field
for
density and accepted
before
the
operations
for
the
next
layer
commence.

2.3.
Trial Compaction
2.3.1.
In
situations
where no previous record or experience
concerning
the
needed number of passes with a particular rolling
equipment
relating
to a particular soil type
is available,
it may be
desirable
to conduct field trials on compaction so as to obtain data
which would serve as an aid to planning of compaction operations.
2.3.2.
A test area about 20 m long and 5 m wide
is prepared
after removing the top soil.
The
fill material to be used
is spread
over
this
area,
the
depth
of the
loose layer being 25 cm.
The
mositure
content
of
the
soil should be as
specified subject to the
tolerance limits indicated.
2.3.3.
The
test
layer
is
then
compacted
with
the type of
compaction
plant
decided
upon, and the mean dry desnsity to the
full depth determined over the
range of about 4 to 16 passes.
The
number of passes required are dependent upon the weight and type
of rollers employed.
The dry density shall be determined in acco-
rdance with IS: 2720 (Part-XXVIII)
and the mean of 5 determina-
tion should be obtained for each compaction condition.
The mean
dry densities are plotted against the number of roller passes.
From
this graph, the approximate number of passes required for the com-
paction equipment to obtain the specified dry density is determined.
2.4.
Quality Control of Earthwork
2.4.1.
Quality
of
fill
material
and
its compaction shall be
controlled through exercise of checks on the borrow material, com-
paction
process,
or
the
end-product,
singly or in combination as
directed.
However, in every case, the end-product must conform
to the construction specifications.
2.4.2.
Details of control tests on borrow materials and com-
paction are dealt with in Clauses 2.5. and 2.6.
2.5.
Control Tests on Borrow Material
2.5.1.
The
particular
type of tests required to be conducted
on
the
borrow
material
and
their
frequency
would depend on
interplay
of several
factors
such as the nature of plant or machi-
nery
employed
on the project,
the quantum of manual labour in-



======================================================================

Earthwork
volved, the nature of specifications to be followed whether they call
for
particular
tests
on borrow
niat'^rials, the uniformity or other-
wise of materials coming out of borrowpits,
terrain conditions, etc.
The
recommended
frequencies
indicated
in the succeeding para-
graphs and in Table 2.1. are therefore only to be taken as applicable
to routine cases.
These tests are meant to verify during executior
of the work that the material coming to
site conforms to specificat-
ions, for
borrow material and should be regarded as distinct from
the test referred to in Clause 2.2.2. which relate to the initial selec-
tion of soils for embankment construction.
All the tests would not
be applicable on all projects.
Depending upon site conditions, etc.,
only
particular
tests may
be
found
necessary
for
a
particular
project.
The
frequency
of
testing indicated releates generally to
the minimum number of tests to be conducted.
The rate of testing
would
have to be
stepped up much more than
is herein indicated,
depending upon the heterogeneity of the
material and the compac-
tion technique adopted in any particular project.
2.5.2.
Gradation (IS: 2720—Part IV)-1965
: At least, one test
for each kind of soil.
Usual rate of testing,
1-2 tests per 8,000 m^
of soil.
The test would be necessary only
if specifications call for
checks
using
gradation
or grain-size distribution as a criterion for
selecting
the
soil.
However,
sand content determinations sliould
be carried out invariably, at the rate of 1-2 tests per 8000 m^
2.5.3.
Plasticity index (IS: 2720--Part V)-1970
: At least, one
test
for
each kind of soil.
Usual rate cf testing 1-2 tests per 8000
m^ of soil.
2.5.4.
Proctor
test
(IS: 2720— Part V1I>-1965
:
This test
is
performed
to
ensure that soil of requisite quality
is coming out of
borrow
areas as also to provide information on optimum moisture
content and maximum laboratory dry density.
Usual
rate of test-
ing,
1-2 tests per 8000 m^ of soil.
2.5.5.
Deleterious constituents
(IS: 2720—Part XXVII)-1968
:
The
soil
shall
be
free
of harmful salts like sodium sulphate and
organic matter
(permissible
limits)
of 0.2 and
1 per cent respec-
tively.
The tests will be done as and when required.

2.5.6.
Natural
moistare
coneent
(IS
: 2720—Part
11-1973)
(Second Reyision)
:
One test for every 250
of soil.
The natural
moisture content of the soil coming out of the borrowpits will have
to be determined in order to evaluate how far the natural moisture
content tallies with the optimum value and
whether
further addi-
tion or reduction of water content would be necessary.
2.5.7.
Table
2.1.
gives
a summary of the tests for borrow
materials discussed
above
along
with
minimum
desirable
fre-
quencies.
2.6.
Compaction Control
2.6.1.
Compaction
control
mairtly involves two operations,
namely, control of
moisture
content just before compaction and
density of compacted layer.
2.6.2.
Moistare
content
determinations:
Moisture
content
determinations for compaction control shall be in addition to those
on borrow material spelt out in Clause 2.5.6.
This test is necessary
for
ensuring
proper
moisture
content
at the time of compaction
which
significantly
influences
the
density
results.
Usual rate of
testing should be 2-3 tests per 250 m^ of soil.
2.6.3.
Density
measurements
:
Except
when
otherwise
directed, at the last one measurement
of density shall be made for
each
1000 m^
of compacted area.
Test locations shallbe chosen
only through predetermined random sampling techniques. Control
shall
not
be
based
on the result of anyone test but on the mean
value of 5-10 density determinations.
The
number
of tests in one
set
of
measurements
shall
be 5 as long
as
it is felt that sufficient
control
over borrow material and the method of compaction
was
being exercised.
But if there be any doubt about this
control,
or
considerable
variations
are
observed
between
individual density
results,
the
number of tests in one set of measurement shall
forth
with be increased to
10.
The acceptance of results shall be subject
to the condition that the mean dry density
equals
or exceeds
the
specified density and the standard deviation for any set of results
is
below 0.08 gm per cc.

Earthwork
2,6A,
In general, the control at top
subgrade layers
of the
formation shall be more strict than stated above with
density mea-
surements being carried
out at the
rate of
1
test per 500-1000 m^
of compacted area.
Further, for the determination of mean density
and standard
deviation
(refer Chapter 8),
the number of tests in
one set of measurements shall not be less than 10.
Acceptance of
the work
shall be
subject to the
same conditions as stipulated in
Clause 2.6.3.

StODe Soling
3.2.1.
General
3.2.1.1.
Stone soling, as a rule,
is
gradually
becoming out-
moded as a sub-base owing to its inferior
load
spreading
proper-
ties as well as the liability to
sink
into
poor or
slushy subgrades.
However, where
it is
still used, control on the materials and works
should be exercised as described hereunder.
3.2.2.
Materials
3.2.2.1.
Before incorporation in
the
work, the materials for
stone soling shall be checked for
specification
requirements either'
at the quarry or at the
site.
3.2.2.2.
The stones shall
be
granite,
limestone,

The following points shall be kept in
mind while executing the work
:
(i)
Stabilization
shall
be
carried
out
preferably by mechanical means.
If
single
pass
stabilisers are not available, rotavators or agricultural
machinery
like
ploughs and
disc harrows shall be made use of.
In
every
case,
it
shall
be
ensured
that
the
plant
used and methods
adopted
are
capable
of pulverising the soil to specified degree over
the
full
thickness
of
layer
being
processed
and
of
achieving the
mixing and uniformity of the stabilized material to desired degree.
(ii)
In the case of manual mixing,
it
shall be ensured that there has been
a
uniform
mixing
of lime and
soil
to
the
full depth of the layer
processed.
(iii)
Degree of pulverisation shall be as specified.
(iv)
Mixing shall be uniform and no streaks of free lime shall be visible.
(v)
After mixing, the lime content
of the mix shall be determined.
The
lime content values shall conform to the following (also see foot note
under Table 3.5)
:
(a)
Moving
average
of
10
tests
not
lo
be
less than the specified
lime content.
(b)
No
test
value
to
L*e
less than 75 per cent of the specified lime
content.
(vi)
Before compaction,
moisture content of the mixed material shall be
brought
to
the
desired
level,
which,
in
general,
is
the optimum
moisture content.
(vii)
It shall be ensured that the time interval between mixing of lime with
soil and compaction does not exceed three hours.
(viil)
Rolling
shall commence at the edges progressing gradually towards
the
centre
parallel
to the centre line of the road, except at superele-
vated
portions where
it
shall
proceed
from
the inner edge to the
outer.
Rolling
shall
be continued
till
the
specified
density
Is
achieved.
(Ix)
Care
shall
be
taken
to
ensure
that
during rolling the compaction
plant
does
not
bear
directly on
hardened
or
partially
hardened
treated
material
previously
laid
except
as may
be
necessary
for

BASE COURSES
4. 1
.
General
4.1.1.
The following
base
courses
are
dealt
with
in
this
Chapter
:
(a) Water bound macadam:
(i) Surfaced
(ii) Unsurfaced
(b) BitumiDous penetration macadam
(c) Built-up-spray
grout
(d) Bituminous macadam
(e) Soil-cement base
(f) Lean concrete
(g) Lime puzzolana concrete
(h) Sand- bitumen base
4.2.
Water Bound Macadam
4.2.1.
General
:
Water bound macadam may be
used
as a
base
course
under a surfacing or as a wearing course without any
surfacing.
In either case, the
construction
shall
generally
be
in
accordance with IRC: 19-1972.
4.2.2.
Materials
:
All materials used in WBM construction,
v/z., coarse aggregates, screenings and
binding
material
shall
be
checked
in
advance
of their incorporation in the works for speci-
fication requirements, either at the quarry or at site.
4.2.3.
Processing and construction
4.2.3.1.
Preparation
of
subgrade/sub-base
:
This
shall
be
checked
for line, grade and section in accordance with Chapter 7.
^uts or soft yielding places shall be corrected suitably
and
rolled
until firm.
Arrangement of lateral confinement of aggregate shall



======================================================================

Base Courses
be checked before starting to spread of materials.
If necessary, iht
surface
shall
be
scarified and reshaped to the required grade and
camber.
4.2.3.2.
The following points shall be
carefully
attended to
while executing the work
:
(i) Quantity and uniformity of spread of materials shall be
checked
by
template (see Chapter 7).
(ii) Segregation of coarse and fine aggregates shall be avoided.
(iii) Rolling operations shall begin from edges,
proceeding
gradually
to
the
centre
while
lapping
each
preceding
rear
wheel track by one
half width.
The weight and type of the
roller
shall
be
relevant
to
the
type
of coarse
aggregate.
At
horizontal
curves, rolling shall
proceed from
the
inner
edge
to
the
outer.
No
rolling
shall
be
carried out when
it causes a wave-like motion due to softness of
the
subgrade/sub-base.
Irregularities that develop
during
rolling
shall
be rectified either by
adding
or removing
aggregate.
In
no
case
shall screenings be added to make up depressions.
Rolling
shall
be
discontinued
when the aggregates are partially compacted with void
space suflScient to permit application of screenings.
However, where
screenings are not to be used, compaction
shall
be
continued
until
the aggregates are thoroughly keyed.
(iv) Screenings shall be
applied
in
three
or more
applicaions
to
fill
the
interstices
while
dry
rolling
is
continued.
Vehicles
carrying
screenings
shall
be
so
operated
as
not
to
disturb
the
coarse
aggregates.
(v)
It
should
be
ensured
that
the
sub-base/subgrade
does
not
get
damaged
due
to
addition
of
excessive
quantities
of water during
construction.
(vi) Binding material, if required, shall
be
added
after
the
application
of
screenings.
It
shall
be
introduced
at
a uniform rate in two or
more applications accompanied
by
copious
sprinkling
of
water so
as to form a slurry which
could
be
swept
with
brooms
to
fill
the
remaining
voids.
Rolling
shall
be continued
till full compaction is
achieved.
(vii) No traflBc shall be allowed
till the macadam sets.
In case of
surface
treated
water bound macadam ^
the
surfacing
shall
be
laid
only
after the macadam base is completely dried.
(viii) The finished surface shall be checked
for
line,
level and
regularity
in accordance with Chapter 7.

Bituminous Surface Courses
5.2.3.2.
Construction of bituminous surface
dressing:
While
executing the work, the following points shall be kept in mind
:
(i) No surface dressing work shall be carried out if
a.
atmospheric temperature in shade
is less than 16*C, or
b.
base is damp, or
c.
construction materials are damp, or
d.
the weather is fogey, rainy or dusty.
(ii) The work should be so Organised that no traffic or
dust
gets on
to
the cleaned or bituminous painted base.
(iii) The specified quantity of approved binder
shall
be
sprayed
at
the
appropriate
application
temperature,
preferably
using
mechanical
sprayers.
The ends of the stretch shall be covered with thick
paper
so
as
to
avoid
double
spraying
of
binder.
The rate of spray of
binder shall be frequently checked and regulated to be within 2J
per
cent of the specified rate of application.
Excessive deposits of binder
shall be immediately removed.
(iv) Immediately
after
application
of
the
binder,
cover
aggregates of
approved
quality
shall
be spread uniformly at the specified rate.
If
necessary, the surface shall be broomed to ensure uniform spreading
of aggregate.
(V) Cover aggregates shall be immediately rolled with roller of approved
weight.
Rolling shall commence at the ed^es progressing
gradually
towards
the
centre
paralle! to the centre line of the road except
at
superelevated portions where
it shall proceed
from
the
inner
edge
to the outer.
Rolling
operation
shall
continue
till
all
aggregates
particles are firmly embedded in the binder.
Excessive rolling resul-
ting in the crushing of aggregates shall be avoided.
(vi) The second coat,
if
specified,
shall
be
applied
immediately
after
laying of the first coat.
(vii) Generally, no traffic shall
be
allowed
on
the
finished
surface
for
24
hours.
If
allowed,
its
speed
shall
be
restricted to 16 km per
hour during this period.
If cut-back
bitumen
has
been
used,
the
finished surface shall be closed to traffic till the binder is
adequately
cured.

Rectification of surface irregularities
:
Surface dressing
by
itself
cannot
remove
any
undulations
present in the base or
the
surface
on
which
it
is applied.
It is therefore essential that
all operations of rectifications to meet the requirements
set
out
in
Chapter 7, be carried out on the receiving surface before the work
of surface dressing
is begun.
5.3.
Surface Dressing with Pre-coated Aggregates
5.3.1.
General
:
Construction
of
bituminous
surface
dres-
sing with pre-coated
aggregates
shall
generally
be
carried out in
accordance
with IRC
:
48-1972.
The
construction
is similar to
conventional surface dressing except that the cover
aggregates
are
lightly
pre-coated
with
binder.
As
such the quality of materials



======================================================================

the binder and cover aggregates shall be at
their app opriate temperatures.
(ii) Coaling of the aggregates with binder shall be unifoim.
(iii) The
aggregates
after
coating
shall
be aerated and cooled properly
before using them in work.
During cooling, these shall not be
piled
in big heaps and care shall be taken to protect them from dust.

:
(i) Mix proportion of constituent materials shall be as specified.
Binder
content
in
the mix
shall
be
checked periodically and regulated to
be within 2^ per cent of the specified quantity.
(ii) Tack
coat, where
necessary,
shall
be
applied
uniformly
over the
prepared base
at the specified rate.
(iii) Mixing shall preferably be done in mechanical mixers.
(iv) Where
straight-run

used, the aggregates should be suit-
ably
heated
prior
to
mixing
with
binder.
The
binder heated to
appropriate temperature should be mixed
with
aggregates

(vi)
Rolling
shall
start
immediately
after
the
material
is spread.
The
wheels
of
the
roller
shall be kept moist to prevent the premix from
adhering
to
the
wheels and being picked up but in no case shall the
use of fuel lubricating oil be permitted for this purpose.
(vii)
Where
specified,
a
seal
coat comprising premix sand or liquid seal
and fine aggregates shall be evenly applied and rolled.
The points to
be
attended
to
during
application
of seal coat shall be the same as
those
for
Surface
Dressing
(Clause 5.2.) and
Thin
Premix
Carpet
(Clause 5.4.) \yhen the seal is of liquid type and premix sand respecti-
vely.
(viii)
When
straight-run
bitumen
is
used,
traflSc may be allowed imme-
diately
after
the
carpet
has cooled down to the surrounding tempe-
rature
but
with
restricted
speed
of 16 KMH for the next 24 hours.
However, where cut-back bitumen
is used, traffic shall not be permit-
ted
till the binder is ciired.
(ix)
The
finished surface shall be checked for line, level and regularity in
accordance with Chapter 7.
5.4.4.
Control
tests
and
their
frequency
:
Quality
control
tests
on
materials
and
work
with
their
desirable frequency are
indicated in
I able 5.2.
5.4.5.
Rectification
of surface irregularities
:
Premix carpets
can
improve
the
evenness of an existing surface only in a limited
way.
Therefore,
if
there
are
large
irregularities
in the surface
these
should be
rectified just prior to laying of the carpet.
Where
the
surface
ii regularities
of
the
finished
carpet
are
outside the
tolerances
given
in
Chapter
7,
these
should
be
rectified in the
manner
described
here.
If the surface
is too high,
it shall be cut
out
and
replaced
by
fresh materials laid and compacted to speci-
fications.
Where the surface
is too low, the depressed portion shall
be filled up by fresh material laid and
compacted to specifications.
At
times,
it would
be
found advantageous/necessary to have an
enlarged area for the patch.

of materials
actually
available at
the site and shall be followed
to
the maximum
extent possible.
In
the event there is a change
in
the
material
available at site, a fresh
job mix formula shall be
arrived
at.
In
all
cases,
variations from
the job-mix formula shall be within the specified limits.
(iii) Tack coat where necessary
sha'l

measuring
unit, filler feeder unit and mixing
unit.
(v) Quantities of various
sizes
of
aggregates
shall
be
fed to the dryer
in such

complies with
the job-mix formula.
This shall be strictly followed
on
small plants
with no gradation contiol unit.
(vi) The temperature
of
binder
at
the
time
of mixing
shall
be in the
range 150°-177X and of aggregates
in the range 155"- 163'C.
Care
should be taken so
that
the
difference
in
temperature between the
aggregates and the binder does not exceed 14°C.
(vii) Mixing time should
be
shortest
possible
to
obtain
uniform
distri-
bution of the binder and a homogenous mix.
(viii) Binder
content
with
mix
shall
be checked
periodically to ensure
that the same
conforms
to

by tipper trucks and spread and
compacted to obtain a carpet of required thickness.
Spreading shall
be done by self-propelled mechanical
pavers
provided with
screeds
for spreading, tamping and finishing the mix
true
to grade, line and
cross-section.
The temperature
of
mix
at
the
time of laying shall
be in the range 121"— 163°C.
(x) Soon after laying of
the
mix,
rolling
shall
be
started
with 8 to 10
tonnes rollers
at
a
speed
not
more
than 5 km per hour.
Rolling
operation shall progress
with
the
drive
wheel
of
the
roller in the
direction of the
paving,
starting
from
the
low
side
of the spread
and proceeding towards
the
high
side.
The initial breakdown pass
shall be made as soon as possible,
i.e.,
as soon
as
the roller can be
operated without its wheels
picking
up
the
mix.
When
adjoining
lanes
are
placed,
the
same,
rolling
proceduj;^
shall
be
followed
after
compaction
of
the
fresh
mix at the longitudinal joint with 15
to 20 cm of the roller width (with
the
remaining
roller width on the
previously compacted lane).
The
mix
shall
be
further compacted

General
6.1.1.
Construction of concrete pavements
shall
in
general
follow
the
guidelines
given in IRC
:
15-1981 entitled "Standard
Specifications and Code of Practice for
Construction
of Concrete
Roads."
6.1.2.
For tools,
equipments
and
appliances
required
for
the work and for the proper upkeep thereof,
reference
should
be
made
to IRC
:
43-1972
entitled
"Recommended
Practice
for
Tools,
Equipments
and
Appliances
for

6.2.
Materials and Mix Proportions
6.2.1.
All
materials,
viz.,
cement,
coarse
aggregates,
fine
aggregates
and
water
shall
be checked for specification require-
ments in advance of their incorporation in the work.
6.2.2.
Proportioning of different aggregate fractions shall be
so controlled that the combined aggregate grading falls within
the
specified
limits
of gradation.
In
case
of
non-compliance,
the
proportioning of the various aggregate fractions
shall
be
suitably
adjusted
based
on
actual
gfadation
of
the
dififerent
fractions.
Statistical approach to this problem
is explained in Chapter
8.
6.2.3.
Mix proportions for concrete shall be
predetermined
on strength basis using representative samples of materials proposed
to be actually utilised in the work.
While proportioning, adequate
allowance should be made for the expected strength
variations
so
as to ensure the specified minimum strength
in
the
field,
subject
to
the
permitted
tolerances.
Guidance in this regard can be had
from IRC
: 44-1972 and IRC
: 59-1976 for
continuously
and
gap
graded mixes respectively.
6.2.4.
Where cement from more than
one
source
is
to
be
used,
proportions
for
the
mix
shall
be
determined
for
each
cement.
In
such

Processing and Construction
6.3.1.
Weather
and
seasonal
limitations
:
Unless
special
precautions
as
specified
are
taken,
concreting
shall
not
be
done
during
extreme
weather
conditions,
e.g.,
during monsoon
months,
and
when atmospheric temperature
in
shade
is
above
40"C
or
below
4''C.
For
guidelines for construction of cement
concrete
pavements
in
hot
weather,
reference
may
be
made
to IRC
: 61-1976.
6.3.2.
Preparation of base
6.3.2.1.
The
base
to
receive
the
cement concrete shall be
checked for line, grade and cross-section
as spelt out in Chapter
7.
All irregularities beyond the permitted tolerances shall be rectified
as specified.
6.3.2.2.
Where
concrete
is
to
be
laid
over
an absorbent
surface, the latter shall be kept
moist in saturated surface dry con-
dition or covered over by a water-proof kraft/polyethylenc
sheeting
as
specified so as to prevent absorption of water from the concrete
mortar.
6.3.2.3.
Where
required,
the
strength
of the base shall be
checked for 'k* value by carrying out plate bearing test.
6.3.3.
Fixing of formwork
6.3.3.1.
The
formwork
shall be of correct shape, free from
bends
and
kinks
and
sufficiently
rigid
to maintain
its shape and
position under the weight and working conditions of the laying and
compacting equipment..
It shall be set to true lines and levels and
securely
fixed
in
position
to
prevent any subsequent disturbance
during
compaction.
Trueness of the formwork from the specified
profile shall be checked and any deviation greater than 3 mm in 3 m
rectified.
No deviation shall, however, be permitted at the joints.
6.3.4.
Manufacture and placement of concrete
6.3.4.1.
Unless
otherwise
permitted,
the
coarse
and
fine
aggregates
shall
be
proportioned by weight in an approved weigh
batching plant.
The weighing mechanism shall be regularly chec-
ked
for
accuracy,
once
daily before the work starts, over the fuP
working range by means of a standard set of weights.

Concrete Pavements
6.3.4.2.
Cement
may
be
measured
either by weight or by
bags.
Where cement
is used in full bags,
frequent checks shall be
made to see that the bags contain the full specified weight of cement
and any shortage of weight made good.
Alternatively, 10 per cent
of
the
bags
in
a
consignment
shall
be weighed in advance and
batch-weight
of
materials
adjusted on the basis of average weight
for
the
consignment.
Water may be measured by volume using
standard
measures.
The
designated
water-cement
ratio shall be
strictly
adhered
to
and
due
adjustments made in the water to be
added on account of free moisture content in the aggregates.
Suit-
able
adjustment
in
the
weights
of aggregates, due to moisture in
them, shall also be made.
6.3.4.3.
Where
volume
batching
is
permitted,
every effort
should
be
made to minimise variations in batching by following a
standard filling procedure.
Also the volume of fine aggregates in a
batch shall be duly corrected for bulking.
6.3.4.4.
Mixing
of concrete
shall be done
in a power driven
batch
mixer
of approved type that will ensure a uniform distribu-
tion of materials throughout the mass.
The minimum mixing time
shall be fixed in relation
to the
mixer type and capacity and adhe-
red to strictly.
6.3.4.5.
Workability of concrete shall be checked as specified
by
performing
"slump
test" or "compacting factor test" in accor-
dance
with
IS
: 1199.
Frequency
of testing shall be as indicated
in Table 6.2.
The
permissible
tolerances from the specified value
for workability shall be
:
Slump
'
...
±
12 mm
Compacting factor
...
± 0.03
Necessary
adjustment
in
water
content, keeping the same water-
cement ratio, shall be made where variations beyond the permitted
tolerances are observed so as to
brihg workability within the speci-
fied limits.
6.3.4.6.
Immediately
after
mixing,
the
concrete
shall
be
transported
for
placement
in
such
a manner that segregation or
loss of constituent materials
is avoided in transit.

6.3.4.7.
Concrete
shall
be
placed
on
the
prepared
base
between
the
formwork
in
such a manner as to avoid segregation
and uneven compaction.
Concrete shall not be
dropped
from
a
height greater than 90 cm and shall be deposited within 20 minutes
from
the
time
of
discharge
from
the mixer.
It shall be
laid in
a horizontal layer as near to the final position
as
possible
thereby
avoiding all unnecessary rehandling.
6.3.4.8.
Adequate surcharges of concrete shall be given over
the
desired
finished
level.
The
amount
of
surcharge
shall
be
determined in
the
field
by
actual
trial.
The surcharge shall be
uniform over the entire area and the concrete
as
spread
shall
be
to the same camber and slope as the required finished surface.
6.3.4.9.
The concrete shall be compacted fully using
vibrat-
ing
screeds
and/or
internal vibrators as specified.
The vibrating
screeds
and
internal
vibrators
shall
conform
to
IS
: 2506 and
IS
: 2505 respectively.
Compaction shall be
so
controlled
as
to
prevent excess mortar and water working on to the top due to over-
vibration.
6.3.4.10.
During compaction, any low or high spots shall
be
made up by adding or removing concrete.
6.3.4.11.
After longitudinal floating has been completed
but
while
concrete
is
still
plastic,
the slab surface shall be tested for
trueness with a 3 m straight edge in accordance with the procedure
set forth in Chapter
7.
Any
depressions
or
high
spots
showing
departure
from
the
true
surface
shall
be immediately rectified.
High
spots
shall
be
cut down and refinished.
Depressions shall
be
enlarged
to
about
8-10 cm and filled up with fresh concrete,
compacted
and
finished.
All the above operations shall be com-
pleted within 75 minutes (60 minutes in hot weather) of mixing.
6.3.4.12.
After
correcting
the
surface
for
profile
but just
before the
concrete
becomes
non-plastic,
the
surface
shall
be
finished by belting, brooming and edging as specified.
6.3.4.13.
Where
the
slab
is
to
be
laid
in two layers, the
second
layer
shall
be
placed
within
30
minutes of compaction
of the lower
layer.

curing
shall be adopted as per details specified.
6.4.
Checking the Quality of Hardened Concrete
6.4.1.
Soon after the initial curing period (see Clause 6.3.7.),
the surface of the hardened
concrete
shall
be checked for surface
regularity in accordance with the procedure set forth
in Chapter 7.
Surface irregularities beyond
the
permissible
tolerences
shall be
rectified as indicated in IRC

15-1981.
6.4.2.
Where
the
strength
of
concrete
tested
vide
Clause 6.3.5. falls
below
the
specified limits or where the quality
of concrete or its compaction
is
suspected,
the
actual strength of
the hardened concrete shall
be
ascertained
by
carrying out tests
on cores cut from
the
hardened
concrete.
Frequency
of testing
shall be as indicated
in
Table

CONTROL OF ALIGNMENT, PROFILE AND
SURFACE EVENNESS
7.1.
General
7.1.1.
All works shall be constructed to
the
specified
lines,
grades,
cross-sections and dimensions.
The objective
is to achieve
a well
built pavement conforming to the
required
horizontal
and
vertical profile, design thickness of different pavement courses, and
stipulated standards of riding quality.
7.1.2.
Given
here
are
the
procedures
for
checking and
permissible tolerances in different cases.
7.2.
Honzootal Alignment
7.2.1.
The checking of horizontal alignment
shall
be
done
with' respect
to
the centre line of the road as shown on the plans.
It involves checking the geometry of the roadway as well as
edges
of the various pavement
layers
vis-a-vis
the
design
centre
line.
Horizontal alignment can be controlled 'properly only if the centre
line.of the road has been marked in the field by means of reference
pillars on both sides of the centre line located at frequent
intervals
along
the
straights
and
at
all
changes
of horizontal curvature.
Manner of doing so is explained in IRC: 36-1970.
To ensure com-
pliance with plans, edges of each pavement layer should be delinea-
ted with respect to the centre line before placement, with
the help
of pegs, strings or other tools.
7.2.2.
Except
for
hill
roads
the
allowable
tolerances
in
respect
of
horizontal
alignment
are
recommended
to
be
a
follows
:
(i) Carriageway edges
^
25 mm
(ii) Edges of the roadway and
lower layers of pavement
± 40 mm
For hill roads, the
tolerances
shall
be
as
specified
by the
Engineer-in-charge.

7.3.
Surface Levels of Pavement C ourses
7.3.1.
Surface levels of
pavement
courses
calculated
vvith
respect to tlie longitudinal and cross profiles shown on the drawings
shall be checked through grid levelling/spot levelling, etc., from the
subgrade upwards for each successive layer.
Actual levels
of
the
different courses shall not vary from the design levels
beyond
the
tolerances indicated below
:
Subgrade
±
25 mm
Sub-base
±
20 mm
Base course
±
15 mm
Bituminous wearing
course (of premix type)
and cement concrete
±
10 "i""'
7.3.2.
Care shall be taken that
the
negative
tolerance
for
wearing
course
indicated
in
Clause
7.3.1.
is
not
permitted in
conjunction
with the positive tolerance for base course
if the thic-
kness of the former
is reduced by more than 6 mm.
7.4.
Control on Layer Thickness
7.4.1.
Even though checks
on
surface
levels
of pavement
courses provide an indirect control on the
layer
thickness,
addit-
ional measures may be necessary to establish that the
thickness
of
constructed
course
is
in
accordance
with
specification.
These
measures could be in the form of thickness blocks, or cores as may
be applicable.
Control on the spread of
materials
also
provides
an indirect check on the layer thickness. Whereas small deviations
in thickness may be unavoidable, larger
deviations
would
unduly
vitiate the pavement designs.
7.4.2.
In general, the average thickness should
not
be
less
than the
specified
thickness.
In
addition,
the
spot
reduction in
thickness should not exceed
15 mm
in
the
case
of
bituminous
macadam
and 6 mm in the case of asphaltic concrete and cement
concrete.
7.5.
Standards of Surface Evenness
7.5.1.
The criteria
for surface
evenness,
both
for
longitu-
dinal and transverse profile,
have
been
reviewed
and
the
latest
recommendations
approved
by
the
Indian
Roads
Congress

7.6.
Control of Transverse
Profile
7.6.1.
The
checking
of transverse
profile should commence
right
from
the
subgrade
level
and continued for each successive
layer
upto
the
top.
Checking
is
done
with the help of camber
boards/templates,
a
few
typical
designs
of
which
are shown in
Figs.
1,2 and
3.
7.6.2.
The
template in
Fig.
1, has adjustable reference pods
so that the template can be
pre-set for any desired profile.
Fig. 2,
shows a template
in which the bottom piece for checking is replace-
able to correspond to the specified profile. These designs are meant
usually for checking the profile over a single-lane width.
For two-
lane
or
multi-lane
roads,
generally
the checking operations will
require to be carried out individually for each lane.
Fig.
3, depicts
a design of the scratch template
used for checking the regularity of
the base for concrete pavements.
7.6.3.
For obtaining correct transverse profile on the finished
surface
of
a
layer,
it
is necessary that the spread material (before
compacting/finishing)
should
conform
to the desired profile as far
as possible.
Therefore, the profile of the spread material should be
continuously
regulated
with template/camber boards (placed per-
pendicular to the road centre line).
Normally, a set of three tem-
plates
should
be
used
in series at an interval of about 10 metres.
Checking
of
the
finished
surface
subsequently
should be on the
same lines.
Additional checks may be
made where visual appear-
ance suggests an excessive variation.
7.7.
Control of Longitudinal Profile
7.7.1.
The
longitudinal
evenness
is specified in terms of the
maximum
permissible
irregularity
under
a 3 metre straight-edge.
Typical
designs
for
a metallic straight-edge and measuring wedge
are
given
in, Fig.
4.
The checking of surface evenness must also
commence right from the subgrade level.
7.7.2.
The procedure to be
followed for making surface un-
evenness measurements with a straight-edge is given at Appendix 6.
7.7.3.
Straight-edge measurements
are slow and rather tedi-
ous.

82 Control of Alignment, Profile and Surface Evenness
improved
devices have been developed in some other countries for
facilitating the work on control of surface evenness.
A device ava-
ilable in India for this purpose
is the
Unevenness Indicator develo-
ped
at
the
Central
Road Research Institute.
This is a travelling
straightedge
type
of device
which, when pre-set according to the
specification
for
the
surface
under check, performs the following
functions on being run by two workmen along the lines of measure-
ment at a walking speed of about 5 km per hour
:
(!) Instantaneously
indicates
the
size of irregularity through a pointer
moving on a graduated dial, to an enlarged scale.
(ii) Sounds
a
buzzer
at
locations
where
the
irregularity is
in
excess
of the maximum permissible (as pre-set).
(iii) Automatically
marks,
through
colour spray,
locations
where
the
irregularity
is in excess of the premissible maximum (as pre-set).
The unit is simple to operate and
is now
readily
available
in
the market.
This should be used wherever possible.
7.7.4.
The criteria in columns 4 to 8
of Table 7.1.
are
meant to ensure that there are not too many irregularities of a size
one lower than the permissible maximum.
This check
is exercised
by counting the related irregularities as they occur and then
seeing
whether there
is excessive occurrence over any 300 m length.
Each
depression/hump
is
to
be counted only once.
Both straight-edge
and
Unevenness
Indicator methods are amenable to exercising of
this control.

CHAPTER 8
STATISTICAL APPROACH TO QUALITY CONTROL
8. 1 .
Statistical Quality Control
8.1.1.
It
is to be appreciated that the road and runway
con-
struction, like most other construction process, has certain
amount
of variability inherent in the materials and
methods
involved.
It
will
thus
be
prohibitively
expensive
and rather impracticable to
have acceptance
criteria
for
quality
in
such
absolute
terms as
would imply the rejection of a piece of construction or
a
material
on
the
basis
of
single
sub-standard
sample.
Because of the in-
herent
variability,
the
aim
of
quality
control
is
to
limit
this
variability
as
much
as
practicable.
The
acceptance
criteria are
thus required to be based on statistical evaluations so that they
are
not only realistic, but
restrictive
and
as
required
by
the
design
and performance requirements of the structure.
8.1.2.
The statistical evaluations of the quality
data
provide
a scientific analysis of the entire production process with respect to
quality.
They not only point out the general trends in the
quality
variations
but
also
many
a
time
go
to
expose the unsuspected
causes of variation and thus lead to a striking improvement in con-
structional quality.
8.2.
Definition of Common Statistical Terms
8.2.1.
Arithmetic mean (also referred to as ttie average) is the
sum of observations (strength results, say) divided by their number:
8.2.2.
Standard deyfation
is
an
average
of the deviations of
the
observations
from
their
mean.
This is defined as the square
root of variance which
is the mean square deviation
from the
tme

the
difference
between
the largest and the
smallest values of the observations in the set

8.3.
Normal Distribution Curve and Control Limits
8.3.1.
It has been established that when values from a
large
number of tests are considered for any of the tests on
concrete
in
general, and its strength in particular, they conform to the
Normal
Gaussion Distribution Curve, Fig.
5, the spread
of
which,
for
all
practical purposes, may be taken as 3 times the standard
deviation
on either side of the mean value.
The value which will have only a
specified
number
(1
in N)
or percentage (p%)— termed as tolerance level— of test data falling
below
it,
is
given by Xmin=(x—rj), where r
is a factor dependent
upon the specified tolerance level.
The
values
of
r
for
various
tolerance
levels
are given in
Table 8.1.

On a plot of
the
stipulated
gradation zone, plot x.
In case x lies within the zone, plot
L.C.L. and U.C.L., as well.
If
both L.C.L. and U.C.L.
lie
within
the
stipulated zone, the specifi-
cation
is being met.
The actual plot is shown in. Fig. 7.
It
is seen
that the specification requirements
are
being met, except for sieve
Nos. 300 and 600 micron for which
U.L.C.
does not
lie within the
stipulated zone.

Cement Concrete
Note
:
Frequency
of
the
test to be carried out shall be as per the requirement
prescribed in the handbook.
The quality control records in the prescribed proformae should be
main-
tained
in
serially numbered
registers,
issued to personnel in charge of quality
control
tests
on
works
in
the same way
as
measurement books are issued.
These
registers
should
be
presented
with
every
third running
bill.
The pay-
ments of
bills should thus be linked with assured quality of work.

PROCEDURE FOR CERTAIN FIELD CONTROL TESTS
NOT COVERED BY PUBLISHED STANDARADS
A. TRAY TEST FOR CONTROL OF RATE OF SPREAD OF BINDER
Light
metal
trays
of
about 20 cm x 20 cm arid 3 cm deep
previously
weighed and numbered are placed at intervals along the road
in
the
path
6f
.he
binder
distributor
bet\\een
the
wheel tracks
After the distributor has
passed, the trays are removed one wrapped in weighed sheets of paper so
that
they can be handled, stocked and weighed as soon as convenient.
The spacing
and the number of trays can be varied to suit the circumstances
of
the
parti-
cular
site,
but at least five trays shall normally be used.
The tray test gives a
measure of the variation in rate of spread along the road and a good
approxi-
mation to the average rate of spread.
The
trays
shall
be
weighed
correct
to first place of decimal in gram.
The maximum Kingitudinal distribution error shall be within ± 10 per
cent
of
the specification.
Similarly,
transverse
distribution
by
the
machine can be checked by
placing a number of iravs to collect the binder sprayed over each 5 cm
of
the
width
of
the
spray
bar.
The variation in transverse distribution shall not be
more than ± 20 per cent from the mean (not counting the
extreme
15 cm
at
either side of the sprayed area).
B.
TRAY TEST FOR CHECK OF RATE OF
SPRtlAD OF
GRIT
IN
SURFACE DRESSING
i he
rate
of
spread of
grit by gritters can be checked by measuring the
area covered by each lorry load of known capacity.
This can also be checked by removing the chippings
from
small
areas
of
the
road
and
weighing
them.
A sm
til square metal frame is laid on the
new
dressing
and
all
the
chippings within trie enclosed area which is 10 cm
square are collected and washed in solvent to remove the binder, weighed
and
the rate
t f spread is measured at points along the road at intervals of between
1 metre to 4 metre.
The
transverse
variation
shall
be
less
than ± 20
per
cent
of
the
mean.
C. METHOD
Of
TEST
FOR
BINDER
CONTENT
FOR
PAVING
MIXTURES BY CENTRIFUGE
The test is intended for determination of binder content m
the
mix
by
cold
solvent
extraction.
The
mineral matter recovered from the test can be
used, for checking the gradation of the aggregates in the mix.

A
representative
sample
about
500 gm
is exactly weighed aod placed
in
tbt bowl
of
the
extraction
apparatus and covered with commercial grade
of
benzene.
Sufficient
time (not more than
1 hour) is allowed for the solvent
to disintegrate the sample before running the centrifuge.
The
filter
ring of the extractor is dried, weighed and the^i fitted around
the
edge
of
the
bowl.
The cover of the bowl is clamped tightly.
A beaker
is placed under to collect the extract.
The
machine
is
revolved
slowly and
then
gradually,
the
speed is
increased
to
a maximum
of
3600
r.p.m.
The
speed is maintained till the
solvent
ceases
to
flow from
the drain.
The machine is allowed to stop and
200 ml. of the benezene is added and the above procedure is repeated.
A
number
of 200
ml.
solvent
additions (not less than three) are used
till the extract is clear and not darker than a light straw colour.
The
filter
ring
from the bowl is removed, dried in air and then in oven
to
constant
weight
at
115^C, and
weighed.
The
fine materials that might
have
passed
through
the
filter
paper
are
collected
back from
the extract
preferably
by
centrifuging.
The
material
is washed and
dried to constant
weight
as
before.
The
percentage
of
binder
in
the sample is calculated as
follows
:
Percentage binder on the total mix
W\
where
weight of sample
f|^x=: weight of the sample after extraction
FF,=weight
of
fine
material,
recovered
from
the
extract
>f4= increase in weight of the filter ring
In
the
case
of road
tar
which
is
not
completely soluble in benzene,
necessary
correction
is made on
the basis of the per cent insoluble of the neat
road tar in the solvent.

PROCEDURE FOR CHECKING SURFACE
REGULATING USING A STRAIGHT-EDGE
The procedure to be followed for checking the surface
regularity with
a
straight-edge is as follows
•
(i) The 3-metre straight-edge may be made of steel
or
seasoned
hard
wood
When made
of wood,
it may be 75 mm wide and 125 mm
deep and its test
face
should
preferably
be
shod
with
a metallic
plate.
The
edge should
be perfectly straight and free from warps,
rots or
defects of any kind.
(ii) Periodically, the straight-edge should
be checked
for
its
truentss
with
a
string
or
a
metallic
master
straight-edge.
The straight-
edge should be rectified/replaced
as soon as the same
has
lost
its
trueness.
(iii) The depressions under the straight-edge are to be measured
with
a
graduated wedge.
The wedge
should
preferably be
metallic
but
may alternatively be
of seasoned
hard
wood.
These
should
be
graduated to read undulations upto 25 mm
with
a
least
count
of
at
least
3 mm.
Typical
designs
for
a
metallic staight- edge and
measuring edge are given in Fig.
4.
(iv) For recording undulations in the
longitudinal
profile
the
straight-
edge is to be placed
longitudinally
parallel
to
the
centre
line
of
the
road.
Measurements
along
two
parallel
lines may normally
be
sufficient
for
a
siggle-lane
pavement and along three lines for
the two-lane pavement.
One additional line may
be covered
for
each additional lane.
(v) The
straight-edge
has
limitations
as
regards
the
measurement
of undulations at
vertical
curves.
Additional
templates may
be
made for this purpose especially if the curves are sharp.
(vi) The
straight-edge may
be
placed
at
the
starting
point,
wedge
inserted between
it and the test surface where the gap
is maximum
and
reading
taken.
The
edge may
then
be
slided
forward
by
about J length, i.e., 1.5 m, and the wedge
reading
repeated.
This
process should be continued.
The straight-edge
need
not
always
be moved
forward
but may
be moved backward and forward to
record the maximum undulation existing at
a
location.
Locations
with
undulations
in
excess
of
the
specified magnitude should be
marked on the surface.

(vii) A
team
of
three
persons
consisting
of two
workmen
and
a
supervisor and equipped with one straight edge and
two
graduated
wedges would be
required.
The two workmen
will
operate
the
straight-edge while the supervisor will take measurements
with
the
wedges and do the marking on the surface.
