STANDARD FOR LATERAL AND VERTICAL
CLEARANCES AT UNDERPASSES FOR
VEHICULAR
TRAFFIC
1.
INTRODUCTION
This Standard
was
first
discussed
by
the
Specifications &
Standards
Committee in their meeting held at Gandhinagar on the
30th November 1972.
Later,
it was approved by that Committee in
their meeting held at New Delhi on the 31st January and
1st Febru-
ary 1974 and then by the
Executive
Committee
in
their meeting
held on
the 1st
May
1974.
Finally,
it
was
approved
by
the
Council in their 82nd meeting held on the 2nd May 1974.
2.
GENERAL
2.1.
Many times a
road has to
be taken through
an under-
pass below another road, railway line, pipeline or irrigation facility
like
aquaduct.
In order
that capacity, speed
and safety of travel
are not affected, the lateral and
vertical clearances
at underpasses
must be adequate.
2.2.
Desirable
practices in this
regard are indicated herein.
It
is recommended
that
these
may
be followed uniformly on all
roads throughout the country.
3.
SCOPE
3.1.
The Standard covers both rural and urban roads. Specific
cases of subways meant
for the exclusive
use of cyclists or pedes-
trians are, however, not dealt with.
Guidance about clearances on
cycle subways
is contained in IRC: 11-1962 "Recommended
Prac-
tice for the Design and Layout of Cycle Tracks'*.
For
pedestrian
subways, another standard
is proposd to be issued in due course.
4.
DEFINITIONS
The following definitions
will be applicable
for the purpose
of this standard
:
4.1.
Underpass
implies a short passage beneath a grade-sep-
arated structure to carry one or more streams of traflSc.
1



======================================================================
PAGE 6 of 14
======================================================================
IRC
: 54-1974
4.2.
Lateral clerance
is
the
distance
between
the
extreme
edge of the carriageway to
the face of the nearest support whether
it is a solid abutment, pier or column.
4.3.
Vertical clearance
stands
for
the
height
above
the
highest point of the travelled way,
i.e., the carriageway and part of
the shoulders meant for
vehicular
use, to the
lowest point of the
overhead structure.
4.4.
Rural roads stand for roads of non-urban character.
5.
OVERALL CONSIDERATIONS
5.1.
Conscious
effort
must
be
made
to
create a sense of
freedom for the drivers travelling through the
underpass. As far as
possible, the underpass
roadway
should
conform
to the natural
lines of the highway at the approaches as regards alignment, profile
and cross-section.
Road profile should not dip
too sharply under
the structure as that will produce a considerably enhanced sense of
restriction when compared with a
profile
that proceeds smoothly
through.
5.2.
To promote a feeling
of
openness
and
unrestrained
lateral clearance, preferably structures with open-end spans should
be
employed.
Fig.
1.
Where
it
becomes
inescapable
to
have
structures with solid abutments, these
should be set back from the
roadway edge as much as possible, Fig.
2. From considerations of
cost, these treatments are
meant for
higher
categories
of roads,
especially with divided carriageways.
5.3.
Since
width at an existing underpass
cannot be
easily
increased later on, initial
construction should be
sufficient for the
standards to which the underpass roadway would need to be impro-
ved within the near future.
This is
essential
especially
for impor-
tant routes like National and State
Highways to be
widened soon
from single-lane to two-lane standards, as also busy two-lane roads
which are in the planning stage for being
upgraded
to a four-lane
divided cross-section.
5.4.
Protect vehicles from accidents with abutments or piers.
Guard-rails must be provided at a sutitable height. These should be
of a robust design to effectively resist disturbance
of the support in
the event of a collision.
In addition, ends of the guard-rails should
be turned away from
the line
of approaching traffic, as shown in
Fig.
3, so as to deflect runaway vehicles
which may
otherwise hit
the underpass structure.
Asa
general rule,
guard-rails
must be
provided on both sides of the central piers or columns, though these

LATERAL CLEARANCE ON RURAL ROADS
6. 1
.
Single Carriageway
6.1.1.
Desirably
the
full
roadway width at the approaches
should
be
carried
through
the
underpass.
This implies that the
minimum lateral clearance on either side must equal
the
shoulder
width.
This
rule
should
be
relaxed only in exceptional circum-
stances.
Normal
and
exceptional
values of lateral clearance for
different classes of highways are given below (see Fig. 4a)
:
(i) National and State Highways
Normal 2.5 metres;
exceptional 2.0 metres
(ii) Major District and Other
District Roads
Normal 2.0 metres
exceptional 1.5 metres
(iii) Village Roads
Normal 1.5 metres
:
exceptional 1.0 metre

IRC

6.1.2.
If a footpath is needed on a rural road, lateral
clear-
ance
in
the underpass portion should be the width of the footpath
plus
one
metre,
Fig.4 (b).
Footpath width depends upon the ex-
pected
pedestrian
traffic
and
might
be
fixed
with
the
help of
following
capacity
guidelines,
subject
to
not being less than 1.5
metres

6.2.
Divided Carriageways
6.2.1.
When an underpass
is built for a divided highway, left
hand
side
clearance
shall
be
in
accordance
with para 6.1.1.
If
footpaths are provided in addition, para 6.1.2. should be applied.
6.2.2.
Lateral clearance on the right to a pier or column
in
the
central
median shall be 2 metres desirably, and
1.5 metres at
the
minimum.
Where the central median
is ker.bed, the carriage-
way
width
should
be
increased
by the side safety margin of 0.5
metre as shown in Fig. 4 (c).
Lateral clearance in that event could
be reduced to
1.5 metres (desirable value) or I metre (exceptional).
If the median
is not wide enough to permit these clearances,
either
it
should
be widened gradually at the approaches or a single span
structure provided across the full
cross-section thereby
avoiding
a
central pier.
7.
LATERAL CLEARANCE ON URBAN ROADS
7.1.
Single Carriageways
7.1.1. Usually roads in urban areas are bordered by kerbs on
both sides.
If so, these should be extended across
the
underpass.
However, to offset the effect of kerb shyness, the carriageway in the
underpass area should be widened on both sides by the
side safety
margin
of
0.25
metre
in the case of lower category urban roads

7.1.3.
Where
a
raised
footpath
is
provided,
it will not be
necessary
to
have
additional
clearance
beyond the width of the
footpath. Fig. 5 (b).
Footpath width could be fixed in
accordance
with para 6.1.2.
7,2.
Divided Carriageways
7.2.1.
Where
the
underpass
serves
a
divided facility, the
width
of
the
carriageway
should
be
increased on either side by
the side safety margin stated in para 7.1.1.
7.2.2.
Lateral clearances on the left hand
side
should
con-
form to paras 7.1.2. and 7.1.3.
Right lateral clearances to the face
of any
structure
in
the
central median over and above the side
safety margin shall be at least
1 metre in the case of higher category
urban
roads
and
0.5 metre
in the case of lower category urban
roads, Fig. 5 (c).
A single span structure will no doubt be prefer-
able as brought out in para 6.2.2.
8.
VERTICAL CLEARANCE
Vertical clearance at underpasses shall be
at least
5 metres.
However, in urban areas, this should be increased to 5.50 metres so
that double-decker buses could be accommodated.
