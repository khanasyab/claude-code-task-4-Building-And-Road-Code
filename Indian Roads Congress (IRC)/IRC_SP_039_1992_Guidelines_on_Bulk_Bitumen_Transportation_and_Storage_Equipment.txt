GUIDELINES ON BULK BITUMEN TRANSPORTATION
AND STORAGE EQUIPMENT
1
INTRODUCTION
1.1. The need for conserving natural resources of petroleum and
related products cannot be over-emphasised. Road construction and
maintenance practices
in
the country
also need
to be upgraded
to
achieve this objective. Bitumen
is used in large volumes and forms a
substantial part of the cost of road surfacing. The present method of
handling bitumen generally involves the use of non-reusable drums in
which bitumen is filled and sealed at the refinery and transported to
work site where they are emptied into bitumen boilers. Since one drum
carries only 155 to 162 kg. of bitumen, a large number of drums require
to be handled. The drums are of imported steel, which is an avoidable
burden on our foreign exchange.
1.2. The method of taking out bitumen from the drum is tedious
and cumbersome. Mud and dust get into the bitumen tank during load-
ing of bitumen from the drum, thereby consuming more fuel for heating
it and reducing the life of the fuel tubes and many times causing leakage
of bitumen at the joint
1 .3. Thus transportation ofbitumen in bulk in reusable containers
of large capacity eliminates the cost of drums and in addition gives
several other indirect advantages as listed below
(i)
Saving of considerable fuel used in reheating bitumen.
(ii)
Temperature of bitumen can be accurately controlled in the required range
for various applications.
(iii)
Contamination
and
leakage
losses
during
transport
and
storage
are
avoided.
(iv)
Better quality control can be achieved by controlling binder usage.
1.4. In order to derive the benefits mentioned above, the Highway
Construction and Mechanisation Committee (now
Mechanisation
Committee) in its meeting held on 24th September, 1987 had set up a
Working Group consisting of S/Shri R.C. Arora, D C. Shah, Anil Gadi
and HA. Sahazadpuri.The draft guidelines as prepared by the Working

October,
1990. The
modified
draft was
subsequently
approved by the Executive Committee in their meeting held on the 18th
November, 1990. Thereafter, the draft was considered by the Council in
their
meeting
held on
the
8th
December,
1990 and
the
Council
authorised
the Convenor of Highways
Specifications & Standards
Committee to do the necessary modifications and send to the IRC for
publication. Accordingly the draft was finally modified by the Con-
venor, Highways Specifications and Standards Committee for printing
as one of the IRC Publication.

2. SUPPLY SOURCE
2. 1 . Nearest refinery will naturally be the source of supply for bulk
bitumen. The
following
possible methods can be used
to
deliver
bulk bitumen:
(i)
Refinery to work site directly by road transport
(ii)
Refinery to work site by combination of road and rail transport, or
(iii)
Refinery to intermediate storage depot and from storage depot to work site
either by road or by rail and road.
2.2.
It has been estimated that bulk bitumen transported in tankers
by road is economical if the destination is upto 400 to 500 km away.
2.3.
Facility
for transporting bulk bitumen
in
rail wagons
is
currently available in a very limited scale in some selected pockets. For
longer hauls, in times to come, more wagons may be owned by con-
sumer
or
the
product may move
in
bulk
containers
placed on
railway flats.
..
3. EQUIPMENT REQUIRED
3. 1 . Equipment required for these operations will basically consist
of the following, depending on the type of construction method, loca-
tion of work site and any other local condition affecting the choice
of equipment:
(a)
Transport tankers,
(b)
Storage tanks at depot,
(c)
Storage tanks at work site,
(d)
Ancilliary equipment needed for handling bulk bitumen at depot, work site
and for unloading railway wagons.
3.2. A brief list of facilities required for five different anticipated
situations is given in Appendix 1 along with equipment details in brief.
Depending on local conditions, to suit specific situational requirement
the exact type of equipment, capacity of the tanks, pumps etc. can be
decided in consultation with
the manufacturers and
oil company
representatives,
4. DESCRIPTION OF TANKERS
Brief description of the tankers needed for efficient and economic
handling of bulk bitumen are given below
:



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 28
======================================================================
4
4.1 Bitumen Transportation Tanker
Bulk bitumen is delivered by refinery into bitumen transportation
tanker at a temperature of about 150° C to 170° C. At work site, bulk
bitumen is transferred to site storage tanks, bitumen boilers or bitumen
sprayers, so
that the transportation tanker
is
released
for the next
trip.
The transportation tanker is made of mild steel sheets and should
preferably be oval or elliptical in section to keep the centre of gravity low
for
stability. The
size, weight
etc., of the tank shall be determined
by stipulations
in
the Motor Vehicles Act. Current
rules permit a
net load of about 10 metric tonnes. Larger capacity tanks can be moun-
ted on
trailers. The
basic
design
features
include an
adequately
insulated metal tank mounted on a truck platform or a trailer chassis
horizontally or at a suitable inclination to facilitate gravity decantation.
The insulation shall be effective to control the drop of temperature
below one degree Celsius per hour.
Flue tubes with burners are provided for heating bitumen to take
care of any temperature drop. A dial type thermometer
is provided
on the tank to know the temperature of the bitumen at any point of time.
On the rear of the tank is mounted a positive displacement type pump
which is driven by power take-off from main engine or a separate prime
mover (usually a diesel engine). The pump
is used to pump out the
bitumen into the storage tank.
It could also be used for circulating
bitumen in the tank for uniform heating.
A small foam type fire extinguisher shall be kept for emergency.
The valves shall be plug type and pipe joints preferably flanged
and welded.
4.2 Stationary Storage Tanks
A set of insulated tanks of capacity 6 tonnes,
1 0 tonnes or
1 5 tonnes
depending upon the requirement are to be erected
at hot mix plant
sites. From these tanks, the daily requirement of bitumen
is
to be
met with. These tanks are provided with heating arrangement, pump,
valves etc. It is desirable to provide heating arrangement for a set of two
storage tanks. Bitumen should not be stored in empty drums at hot mix
plant sites. Hot mix plant sites may be provided with storage tanks to
keep stock for minimum three days requirements.



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 28
======================================================================
5
Storing bitumen in open vats is not a correct practice and should
not be allowed.
The temperature of the stored bitumen should not at any time be
allowed to
fall so low as to make the bitumen lose
its fluidity.
4.3
Mobile Storage Tank
Mobile storage tanks of 3 to 6 tonne capacity, towed type or self
prooelled, fitted with suitable burner and a pump, are quite useful to
work with mini hot mix plants, for filling the tanks of bitumen pressure
distributors, tar boilers
etc. Towed type mobile storage tanks should
have proper and effective towing arrangement, complying with the rules
and regulations of Transport Authority.
5. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
5.1. The Tank
All tanks should have 10 per cent extra volume above the rated
capacity. The tank which is just the receptacle for hot bitumen, can be
mounted in different ways on a truck permanently; on the back of a
trailer, on skids; or on a wooden platform. When the tank is permanently
mounted on a truck (Appendices 2 & 3)
it becomes essentially a trans-
portation equipment which
is temporarily immobilised at its parking
site for storage purposes. Usually large tanks with a capacity of 10 to 20
MT are mounted in this manner. The smaller tanks are usually moun-
ted in one of the remaining three ways. When it is trailer mounted, the
tank acquires mobility for easy transportation from one work site to
another. The skid mounting requires the tank to be provided with skid
tubes as base to facilitate easy loading into a truck or unloading from it,
whereas a tank mounted on a wooden platform requires the construc-
tion of a new platform at the new site. So, from the point of view of easy
transportation and easy availability for work at the new site, the moun-
tings rank as follows: truck mounting, trailer mounting, skid mounting
and platform mounting. The trailer should have a rubber tyres, a turn-
table with 90 degree turning angle, triangular tow bar, mechanical
brakes and other features required for use on public roads. It should be
of all steel construction with adequate steel sections for the chassis,
axles
etc. and semi-elliptical springs. The skid mounting consists of
tubular steel skids for the base. These skids should be of adequate



======================================================================

strength and welded construction. They may also be provided with tow-
ing arrangement
for low speed towing
for
short
distances
at
the
worksite.
The platform mounting requires the construction of adequately
strong platforms made of wooden sections or steel. They should be
erected on firm ground and on pillars or foundation for the steel plat-
form. It may be preferable to erect a new platform at the new worksite
from a set of new members instead of dismantling the platform from the
old worksite and reassembling the same at the new site. This would save
time in commissioning the plant at the new site.
5.2. Constructional Features of the Tank
The tank to hold liquid bitumen shall be all-welded mild
steel
(M.S.) construction with fuel pipes made of seamless pipes conforming
to I.S. 1239. It is recommended that the tank should be subjected to a
hydrostatic pressure of 5 p.s.i. (0.35 kg per sq. m.) to detect any leak and
should carry a certificate to this effect The flue tube shall run for full
length of the tank and then rise vertically upwards outside of the tank
and should be provided with a suitable cowl. Cast iron (C.I.) sleeves of
suitable dimensions should be fitted to the flue tube at the outer edge
while fitting
it in the tank for allowing the tube to expand due to heat
without deforming. The valves for product outlet/discharge etc. should
preferably be cast iron (C.I.) plug type, flanged and without any gland.
Suitable handle shall be provided to operate the valve. The pipe line for
pumping bitumen shall be of heavy duty steel with all joints welded and
well insulated. The joints/coupling shall be leak proof. Provision shall
be made for an outlet pipe of adequate diameter for gravity discharge
with galvanized iron (G.I.) valve bottom opening duly sealed for clean-
ing tank in emergency.
The tank shall have a manhole of suitable
size, provided with
hinged cover and rapid locking device on mild steel (M.S.) collar. A
non-slip platform at rear along with access ladder shall be provided.
Suitable
fire extinguishers shall be provided towards the rear of the
tank.
A catwalk to climb to the top of tank and for safe movement of
operator for inspection and measurement etc. shall be provided.



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 28
======================================================================
7
5.3. Insulation
The maximum permissible temperature drop in full load of tank
shall not exceed 20°C per day when charged at 150°C with ambient
temperature between 24°C and 30°C (tank and
its contents
at
rest).
Good quality insulation shall be provided for the tank to minimise heat
loss during transportation and use.
All exposed parts like pipes etc. shall be properly insulated.
5.4. Pump
For pumping the product in and out of the tank, the transportation
or storage tank shall be fitted with a pump. The pumps shall be driven
by a separate
diesel engine mounted on chassis or power take-off
from main engine of truck. Pump shall be able to dejiver 250 to 300 litres
per minute at a pressure of about
1 .8 kg/sq. cm. (25 psi). Pump shall have
necessary controls for single lever type of functions like filling tank, cir-
culation and delivery. The engine and pump shall be mouted on MS
base plate and V-pulleys or directly coupled. The pump shall have a
built-in bypass. The bearings and other parts of the pump shall be cap-
able of withstanding exposure to direct heating by open flame and to
transfer the bitumen having maximum temperature of 200°C.
5.5. Heating System
The tank shall have provision ,of suitable heating arrangement
for maintaining product temperature at desired level during transpor-
tation and at the time of delivery. To boost up the product temperature
as and when required, the tank shall be provided with diesel/LDO/
kerosene oil etc. twin burners suitable for supptying required amount of
heat for raising the temperature of rated volume from 32°C to
1 16°C in
not more than 2 hours conforming to 'IS. 2094-1962.
Separate engine provided for bitumen pump also drives a small
compressor which supplies air and fuel under pressure to the burners.
General arrangement in transportation tanker is indicated in pictorial
view in Appendices 2 & 3.
It will be worthwhile to mention that latest technology for heating
bitumen is by thermic fluid or by electrical heating. In case of thermic
fluid, hot oil
is heated separately by oil burner or electrically and the



======================================================================
PAGE 18 of 28
======================================================================
8
same is circulated through pipes fitted in the compartments of bitumen
tanks. Both the above systems are more efficient and economical.
5.6. Thermometer
To record product temperature, tank shall be fitted with a dial ther-
mometer, stem type or hand held digital temperature indicator. The
temperature range of the thermometer shall be 0-250°C.
5.7. Hoses and Connections
The tank
shall be equipped with two
flexible
metallic
hoses
45 cm long each with galvanized iron (G.I.) strip wound on hose made
up of asbestos cord. The hoses and joints shall be leakproof and capable
of withstanding product temperature of 180-20O°C. It shall have non-
spilling coupling in addition to positive mechanical valves.
Both
the ends of each hose
shall be provided with standard
steel flange for fixing the hose through brass couplings and steel hexa-
gonal nipple.
Tank connections
shall be done with
flexible hoses
to avoid
stresses induced/transferred due to piping.
5.8
Dip Rod
The tank shall have a graduated brass dip-rod, preferably square
in section, to measure the contents. The dip rod shall have calibration
for bitumen contents marked on both faces. Calibration of one face
will indicate contents from bottom to top whereas the other face will
have calibration of contents Jrom top
to bottom. Such
calibration
shall be both in cms and 1/2 tonne markings on each face. This will ena-
ble to find out quantity of bitumen in the tank at any time, whether the
product is hot or cold. The identification number of tank/tanker shall be
exhibited (engraved) on the dip-rod. The calibration chart shall be fixed
at an appropriate place on the chassis or in the drivers cabin.
6 DISTRIBUTOR
Bitumen pressure distributor, where available, can also be used for
transporting bitumen
if the source of supply
is not very far off.

7 SAFETY MEASURES
7.1. Bitumen
is
a hazardous
material
particularly when
in
a
heated condition. All the prescribed safety standards for transportation
and storage of such material shall therefore be followed. Requirements
of Rules 129 to 137 of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1989 shall be complied with
in respect of display of class label of the hazardous material, emergency
information panel, supplying information by consigner to the owner of
the vehicle and the driver regarding the material being carried etc. Every
driver of a goods carriage transporting such material shall observe at all
times all the precautions necessary for prevention of fire, explosion or
escape of hazardous goods carried by him while goods carriage is in
motion. When it is not being driven, he shall ensure that the goods car-
rier is parked in a place which is safe from fire, explosion or any other
risk and is at all times under the control and supervision of himself or
some other competent person above the age of eighteen years.
7.2.
Fire fighting equipment as per statutory safety standards shall
be installed wherever required.
7.3. All hot pipes shall be properly insulated and covered with
appropriate leggings.
7.4. Appropriate cautionary signboards shall be displayed at all
identified risky spots/places.
7.5. The crew/labourers associated with handling of bulk bitumen
shall be issued with hand-gloves and gum boots etc. In the interest of
their own safety
it shall also be ensured that these are used by them
while working.
