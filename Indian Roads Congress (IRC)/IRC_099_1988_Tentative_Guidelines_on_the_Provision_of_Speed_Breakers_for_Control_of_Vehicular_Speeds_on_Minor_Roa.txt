TENTATIVE GUIDELINES ON THE PROVISION OF SPEED BREAKERS
FOR CONTROL OF VEHICULAR SPEEDS ON MINOR ROADS
1
INTRODUCTION
1.1.
Development
of
suitable
recommendations
on speed
breakers have been under the consideration of the Traffic Engineer-
ing Committee of the Indian Roads Congress' for some time.
The
Traffic Engineering Committee
in
their meeting held at Bhopal on
the 4th February, 1986 entrusted the drafting of the Standard based
on
the
spot studies of suitable
speed breakers to the University of
Roorkee.
The
draft
prepared
by
them
was considered by the
Committee
in
their
meeting held at Hyderabad on the 17th Janu-
ary,
1987
and
it was decided that the draft could be finalised by
the
IRC
Secretariat
and
Member-Secretary, Traffic Engineering
Committee in light of the comments received.
Accordingly, the dratt was revised
by the Traffic Engineering
Committee (personnel given
below)
in their
meeting
held at New
Delhi on 12th June, 1987

1.2.
The
revised
draft was considered by the Specirications
& Standards Committee in their meeting held on the 9th November,
1987.
The
Committee
authorised
S/Shri J.B. Mathur, D. Sanyal
and
K.
Arunaehalam
to
jointly
modify
the draft
in light of the
comments- of the Specifications Sc Standards Committee.
1.3.
The
draft
as
revised
was
approved by the Executive
Committee in their meeting held in New Delhi on the
13th Novem-
ber, 1987.
Later on,
the document was placed before the Council
in their 121st meeting held at
Trivandrum on 6th December, 1987.
The Council approved the document subject to some minor changes
which have since been incorporated.
2
GENERAL
2.1.
Roads
of
different categories and under different situ-
tions
are
designed
for designated design speeds at which vehicles
can travel with convenience and safety.
However,
at certain loc-
ations,
such
as
approaches
to manned and unmanned level cros-
sings,
sharp
curves, congested/accident-prone locations, residential
streets, etc., control of speed may become
necessary
to
promote
orderly traffic movement and improved safety.
2.2.
A number of engineering measures are available to con-
trol
vehicular
speed.
Some
of
these
are
posting of mandatory
speed limit signs, use of
flashing
beacons
to
alert 'drivers,
road
markings of various types, etc.
2.3.
.
Yet,
there
may
be
cases,
particularly on secondary/
tertiary roads and on
residential
streets in urban areas, Where cer-
tain- physical
constraints may become necessary for effecting con-
trol
on
vehicular
speeds.
In
this regard, three types of devices,
namely,
speed
breakers, rumble strips and width restrictions have
been used successfully.
Choice among these
will depend on local
factors
such
as the type of area traversed, the type and volume of
traffic,
the
extent
of speed reduction desired, and other local fac-
tors.
However,
speed
breakers,
in
particular, are meant mainly
for
residential
areas,
minor
roads, and similar situations.
Their
use on major inter-city roads outside urban areas
is not considered
a
good
engineering practice, and the Indian Roads Congress does
not favour
it.
2.4.
Speed breakers, where
permitted to be installed, provi-
de visual, audible and tactile stimuli
which. alert drivers and cause
them
to
slow
down.
These
can
have different heights, lengths,
spacing*, signs, etc.
In fact, no particular design is suitable for al!
2



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC
: 99 1988
the types of vehicles using the road. For example, a speed breaker
designed
for
trucks
can
be
dangerous to motor cyclists and one
designed for motor cyclists will be ineffective for trucks.
The des-
ign
recommended
herein
is
a compromise design to suit average
Indian
road
traffic
conditions and
is based on field investigations
and research.
2.5.
Speed
breakers
are
not.intended as substitute for pro-
per
mandatory,
warning or informatory signs but are meant only
to draw attention of drivers to a possible hazard ahead.
2.6.
These
recommendations
may
require
revision
in the
light of future experience and
development in the field.
Towards
this end,
it
is suggested that a
record of speed and accident condi-
tions, before and after the installation of speed breakers, should be
kept.
3.
DEFINITION
A
speed breaker
is a hump surface across the roadway
hav-
ing
a
rounded,
shape
with
width
greater than the wheel base of
most of the vehicles using the road.
When there
is decreased
vari-
ation
in
sensory stimuli and at locations where speed controls are
desired, a
speed
breaker
acts
as
a
strong
stimuli
to
arouse
reaction
in
the
brain.
Since
the
driver reaction times arc fas-
ter
in
response to audible and tactile stimuli than to visual stimuli,
a
driver
subconsciously
reduces
his
speed.
An ideally designed
hump should satisfy the following requirements
:
(i)
There
should
be no damage to vehicles nor excessive discomfort to
the drivers and passengers when
passing
at
the
preferred
crossing
speed.
(ii)
The hump
should
not
give rise to excessive noise or cause harmful
vibrations
io
the
adjoining buildings or affect the other lesidents of
the area.
(iii)
Above the design speed, a driver should suffer increasing level of dis-
comfort (but without losing directional control and without any
vehi-
cle damage) depending
on the extent through which design speed
is
exceeded.
4.
SCOPE
4.1.
Warrants
Use of speed breakers
is
justified primarily under the follow-
ing three circumstances
:
(1)
T-intersections of minor roads with rural trunk highways,
characteri-
sed
by relatively low traffic volumes on the minor road but very high
average
operating
speed
and
poor sight distances.
Such locations
have a high record of fatal
accidents and as such a sperd breaker on
the minor road is recommended
;



======================================================================
PAGE 8 of 20
======================================================================
IRC
: 99-1988
(2)
Intersections
of
minor roads with major roads, and mid-block sect-
ions
in
urban
arras
where
it is desirable to brina down the soeeds;
and
(3)
Selected
local
streets
in residential areas, school, college or univer-
sity, campuses, hospitals, etc.
Also in areas where
traffic is ohserved
to travel faster than the regulated or safe soeed in the area.
4.2.
Other places *here these mav be ttsed include
:
(1)
Any situation where there
is a
consistent
record
of
accidents
pri
marily attributed to the speed of vehicles
e.g. when
hazardous
sec-
tions follow a long tangent approach;
(2)
Approaches to temporary diversions;
(3)
Approaches to weak or narrow bridges and culverts
requiring
speed
restriction lor safety;
(4) On the minor arms of uncontrolled
junctions
r?nd
at
railway
level
crossings;
(5)
Sharp curves with poor sight distances; and
(6)
Places
of
ribbon
development,
where road passes through built-up
areas and vehicles travelling at high speeds are a source of imminent
danger to pedestrians.
5.
DESIGN OF SPEED BREAKERS
5.1.
Speed breakers are
formed
basically
by
providing
a
rounded (of 17 metre radius) hump of
3.7 metre
width
and
0.10
metre height for the preferred advisory crossing speed of
25
km/h
for
general
traffic,
Fig.
1.
Trucks
and
buses
having
larger
wheel
bases
may
feel
greater
inconvenience
on passage at such
humps.
To
facilitate
appreciable
and
comfortable
passage
for
larger and heavier vehicles (where their
proportion
is
quite
high)
humps may be modified with
1.5 metre long ramps (1
: 20) at each
edge.
This design
will also enable these vehicles to pass the hump
at about 25 km/h, Fig.
2.
5.2.
In
certain
locations
speed
breakers
may
have to be
repeated
over
a
section
to
keep speeds low throughout.
More
humps
may
be
constructed
at
regular
intervals
depending
on
desired
speed
and
acceleration/deceleration
characteristics
of
vehicles.
The
distance
between
one hump
to another can vary
from 100 to 120 metres centre to centre shown in Figs. 3, 4 and
5.
6.
PLACEMENT OP SPEED BREAKERS
6.1.
The
pattern
of placement of speed breakers depends
upon
the
location
and
the type of treatment used.
Some of the
suggested
locations
have already been indicated in Clause 4.
At
T
intersections speed breakers should be installed on minor roads

or perpendicular arms about 10 metres away from the inner
edges
of major roads.
Proper sign boards and
markings
are
required
to
be
provided
at
such
locations,
Figs.
4 and
6.
On
sharp
curves, available sight distances guide the placement and number
of
speed
breakers, Fig.
5.
For other situations the Engineer-in-
Charge
should use his ingenuity and judgement.
6.2.
To
check
the
tendencies of
drivers
to
avoid
speed
breakers
and
using
shoulders,
it
is recommended that the speed
breakers should be extended through the entire width
of shoulder
supported on a proper base,
6.3.
For
undivided
carriageways
speed
breakers
should
invariably be extended over the entire carriageway
width
includ-
ing shoulders.
6.4.
On bridges
speed
breakers
should
not
be
provided.
However,
where
frequent
accidents
have
been
reported
or the
bridges are on curves or they
are
narrow,
either
approach
must
have two speed breakers each.
7.
SPECIFICATION FOR SPEED BREAKERS
7.1.
Speed breakers are laid by
first
marking
the
location
of hump
on
the
pavement
and
marking indents in this area for
proper
bonding.
Surface
is
then
cleared
of
all
dust and loose
particles and
a
tack
coat
applied.
Forms
of
requisite
heights,
shape and width are then
placed,
and
hot
premixed
bituminous
material
is
poured
to
the required depth and shape.
Forms are
then lifted and the surface finished to
required
shape,
and
edges
rounded by trowel.
The premixed material should be
well
com-
pacted
before
opening
to
traffic.
Allowance
should
be
made
for
compaction,
and
irregularities- should
be
corrected
using
bituminous
materials
having
fine
aggregate
or
by scrapping, as
necessary.
The material
is then allowed
to
cure
before
opening
to traffic.
7.2.
Arrangements for proper drainage of the speed breakers
must be made to prevent formation of ponds and puddles.
8.
SIGN POSTING AND MARKING
8.1.
Drivers Should
be
warned
of
the
presence
of speed
breakers by posting suitable advance
warning
signs.
The
warn-
ing signs, Fig.
6 should
be
of the
design 'HUMP OR ROUGH
ROAD'
detailed
in IRC
: 67-1977

MAINTENANCE
Care should be exercised to repair the hump at regular inter-
vals and also to rem^"c the dust or mud collected on either side
of
the
hump.
Repainting
o r
markings
on
the hump
is
the most
important siaiinten&n':
