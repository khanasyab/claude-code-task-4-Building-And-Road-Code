CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
It was discussed in the first meeting 07.03.2009 of newly constituted "Embankment, Ground
Improvement and Drainage Committee" (H-4) that following IRC guidelines which deals with soil
stabilization need revision in the light of current practices and latest technological developments
in the field. The identified guidelines were:
1)
IRC:28-1967: "Tentative Specifications for the Construction of Stabilized Soil Roads
with Soft Aggregates in areas of Moderate and High Rainfall"
2)
IRC:33-1969: "Standard Procedure for Evaluation and Condition Survey of Stabilized
Soil Roads"
3)
IRC:49-1973: "Recommended Practice for the Pulverisation of Black Cotton Soils for
Lime Stabilization"
4)
IRC:50-1973: "Recommended Design Criterion for the use of Cement Modified Soils
in Road Construction"
5)
IRC:51-1992: "Guidelines for the use of Soil-Lime Mixes in Road Construction"
6)
IRC:88-1984: "Recommended Practice for Lime-Fly Ash Stabilized Soils
Base/Sub-base in Pavement Construction"
All these guidelines were reviewed and it was found that IRC-33, 49, 50, 51 and 88 are related to
soil stabilization with admixtures. However, IRC-28 deals with soil and soft aggregates
stabilization. The revised guidelines presented through this document encompass the review of
soil stabilization which is the process whereby soils and related materials are made stronger
and more durable by mixing with a stabilizing agent. Although many stabilizing agents can be
used, cement and lime are by far the most important and the guidelines mainly concentrate on
use of Lime, Cement, Lime-fly ash/Lime-cement fly ash as stabilizer. The guidelines include,
general features of stabilization, guidelines for soil/granular material stabilization, specifications
and test requirements for stabilized materials, construction procedure, quality control and
limitations on the use of stabilized materials. These guidelines have been made considering
prevailing Indian and International practices.
The draft of the guidelines was prepared by Shri Sudhir Mathur, Member-Secretarey, H-4
Committee and his collegues namely S/Shri R.K. Swami, Mrs Uma Arun and U.K. Guru Vittal.
The guidelines were finalised by H-4 Committee under the Convenorship of Shri Mahesh Kumar,
Engineer-in-Chief, Haryana, Public Works (Building and Roads) Department.

1.1
Purpose
These guidelines suggest the criteria for improving the engineering properties of soils and granular
materials used for pavement base courses, sub-base courses and subgrades by the use of
additives/stabilizers, which are mixed into the soil/granular materials to effect the desired
improvement. A number of additives are available to improve the physical and engineering
properties of these materials; however, this document restricts itself to stabilizers such as lime,
cement, fly ash or a mixture of the above additives.
1.2
Scope
These guidelines prescribe the appropriate type or types of additives to be used with different
soil types, procedures for determining a design treatment level for each type of additive and
recommended construction practices for incorporating the additive into the soil. These criteria
are applicable to all type of roads and airfields having a stabilized pavement layer.
1.3
Definitions
a)
Soils: Naturally occurring materials that are used for the construction of all
except the surface layers of pavements (i.e., concrete and asphalt) and that
are subject to classification tests (IS 1498) to provide a general concept of
their engineering characteristics.
b)
Additives: Manufactured commercial products that, when added to the soil in
the proper quantities, improve some engineering characteristics of the soil
such as strength, texture, workability, and plasticity. Additives addressed in this
manual are limited to cement, Lime and Fly ash.
c)
Stabilization: Stabilization is the process of blending and mixing materials with
a soil to improve certain properties of the soil. The process may include the
blending of soils to achieve a desired gradation or the mixing of commercially
available additives that may alter the gradation, texture or plasticity, or act as a
binder for cementation of the soil.
d)
Mechanical Stabilization: Mechanical stabilization is accomplished by mixing
or blending soils of two or more gradations or mixing soil with aggregates to
obtain a material meeting the required specification. The soil blending may
take place at the construction site, a central plant, or a borrow area. The blended
material is then spread and compacted to required densities by conventional
means.
e)
Additive/Chemical Stabilization: Additive stabilization is achieved by the
addition of proper percentages of cement, lime, fly ash, or combinations of
these materials to the soil. The selection of type and quantity or the percentage



======================================================================
PAGE 10 of 46
======================================================================

IRC:SP:89-2010
of additive to be used is dependent upon the soil classification and the degree
of improvement in soil quality desired. Generally, smaller amounts of additives
are required when it is simply desired to modify soil properties such as
gradation, workability and plasticity. When it is desired to improve the strength
and durability significantly, larger quantities of additive are used. After the
additive has been mixed with the soil, spreading, sprinkling water and
compaction at OMC are achieved by conventional means.
f)
Modification: Modification refers to the stabilization process that results in
improvement in some property of the soil but does not, by design, result in a
significant increase in soil strength and durability.
1.4
Effectiveness of Stabilization
Pavement design is based on the premise that minimum specified structural strength will be
achieved for each layer of material in the pavement system. Each layer must resist shearing,
avoid excessive deflections that cause fatigue cracking within the layer or in overlying layers and
prevent excessive permanent deformation through densification. As the quality of a soil layer is
increased, the ability of that layer to distribute the load over a greater area is generally increased
so that a reduction in the required thickness of the pavement layers may be permitted. Some of
the attributes of soil modification/stabilization are indicated below.
a)
Quality improvement: The most common improvements achieved through
stabilization include better soil gradation, reduction of plasticity index or
swelling potential and increase in durability and strength. In wet weather,
stabilization may also be used to provide a working platform for construction
operations. These types of soil quality improvement are referred to as soil
modification. Stabilization can enhance the properties of road materials and
give pavement layers the following attributes:
•
A substantial proportion of their strength is retained even after they
become saturated with water.
•
Surface deflections are reduced.
•
Resistance to erosion is increased.
•
Materials in the supporting layer cannot contaminate the stabilized
layer.
•
The elastic moduli of granular layers constructed above stabilized layer
are increased.
•
Lime stabilized material is suitable for use as capping layer or working
platform when the in-situ material is excessively wet or weak and
removal is not economical.

IRC:SP:89-2010
b)
Thickness reduction: The strength and stiffness of a soil layer can be
improved through the use of additives to permit a reduction in design
thickness of the stabilized material compared with an un-stabilized or unbound
material.
c)
Possible problems: The increase in the strength of pavement layers is also
associated with the following possible problems:
•
Traffic, thermal and shrinkage cracks can cause stabilized layers to
crack.
•
Cracks can reflect through the surfacing and allow water to enter the
pavement structure.
•
If carbon dioxide has access to the material, the stabilization reactions
are reversible and the strength of the layers can decrease.
•
The construction operations require more skills and control than for
equivalent un-stabilized materials.
These issues have been further highlighted in Chapter 7.

CHAPTER 2
MECHANICAL STABILIZATION
2.1
Mechanical Stabilization
Mechanical stabilization is a process in which materials are proportioned to obtain desired
gradation and plasticity of the mix. Correctly proportioned material (aggregate and soil) can be
adequately compacted to form a mechanically stable pavement layer. This method is called
mechanical stabilization. Thus the basic principles in this method of stabilization are :
a) Proportioning and b) Compaction. If a granular soil containing negligible fines is mixed with a
certain proportion of binder soil, it is possible to increase the stability. Similarly the stability of a
fine grained soil can be considerably improved by mixing a suitable proportion of granular
material to get a desired gradation.
Mechanical stabilization has been successfully applied for sub-base and base course
construction. It has also been used as a surface course for low cost roads such as village roads
when the traffic and rainfall are low. The desirable properties of soil aggregates mixtures are
strength; incompressibility; fewer changes in volume and stability with variations in moisture
content; good drainage; less frost susceptibility and ease of compaction. It is generally believed
that the stability of a soil aggregate mix can be increased by increasing its dry density. Hence
proportioning of mixes is done to attain maximum dry density.
The factors to be considered in the design of mix are gradation, density, index properties and
stability. Of these, the gradation is the most important factor. The particle size distribution that
gives maximum density is generally aimed at. Fuller's formula may be used to obtain the
theoretical gradation for maximum density and is given by:
P = 100 (d/D)1/2
where
P = per cent finer than diameter 'd' (mm) in the material
D = diameter of the largest particle, mm
The following are the recommended values of the liquid limit and plastic index for the material
passing 425 micron sieve, to be used for mechanical stabilization.

IRC:SP:89-2010
2.2
Design of Mechanically Stabilized Mixes
When a few materials are available in the near vicinity of site, it is necessary to mix them in such
a proportion, which would produce a mix with highest density. As an example if coarse
aggregate, sand and fine soil are available from three deposits or borrow pits, it is first essential
to decide the proportion of these component materials. The most commonly adopted graphical
method for proportioning is the Rothfutch's method. Details of Rothfutch method are presented in
Section 2.2.3. The design based on combining two materials (soil and aggregates) on the basis
of their sieve analysis to achieve specified gradation is given below:
•
Column 2 and 6 in the Table give the particle size distribution of material A and
B which do not satisfy the gradation requirement of the specification.
•
Column 3 shows the standard sieve sizes, column 4 shows the recommended
limits for a particular pavement course and column 5 shows the average value
of corresponding limits shown in column 4.
•
The inverse ratio of the totals in columns 1 and 7 gives the proportion of the
materials to be mixed to obtain the desired mix.
A : B = 45 : 139 (1 : 3).
•
Mixing 25 percent of the material A and 75 percent of material B would give the
desired gradation as shown in the Table.

2.2.1
Stabilization using soft aggregates (Mehra's method of stabilization)
When hard variety of aggregates is not locally available, the local soft aggregates may have to
be used for construction in order to keep the construction cost as low as possible. The soft
aggregate have low crushing strength and low aggregate impact value. Still they have been
adopted in the construction of mechanically stabilized sub-base, base course and even in
wearing course layers. Commonly used soft aggregates for road construction are kankar, moorum,
laterite and broken brick aggregates. Because of the low strength, these aggregates are likely to
break down at their points of contact. If these aggregates are mixed with suitable proportion of
soil so that each particle of soft aggregate is enveloped by soil, there would not be any problem
of crushing of these aggregates during compaction or under traffic load.
Mehra's method of construction can be adopted for construction of low volume rural roads. In this
method, base course material consists of compacted soil with sand content (of size less than
0.425 mm and greater than 0.075 mm) being not less than 50 percent and plasticity index 5 to 7.
Wearing course material consists of brick aggregates and soil mixed in the ratio of 1:2. The
sand content in the soil should be less than 33 percent and plasticity index 9 to 12. However,
when bituminous surface treatment is required/desired, the plasticity index should be limited to
8 to 10. This method, proposed by Prof.S.R.Mehra, is briefly given below:
1)
Soil is collected from approved borrow pits and stacked on roadside.
2)
Water is added upto OMC and soil is mixed and spread to desired camber
and grade.
3)
11.5 cm thick loose base course material (sandy soil) is spread and rolled by
8 tonnes roller to a compacted thickness of 7.5 cm.
4)
Surface course material (brick aggregate and soil in the ratio 1:2) mixed with
adequate water is spread to 11.5 cm loose thickness and the layer is rolled by

The road is closed to traffic for 4-5 days and kept sprinkled with water. For next
few days, only rubber-tyred traffic is allowed and after about 2 weeks, the road
is opened to all traffic. Mehra's method of construction can carry 50 tonnes of
traffic per day in places of light rainfall. With bituminous surfacing, the road

micron sieve. Let these be SA and SB for the Soil A and Soil B respectively. Then the

Rothfutch method for design of soil-aggregate mixes:
Rothfutch method is adopted when a number of materials are to be mixed together to obtain a
combined material conforming to a desired gradation. It is to be noted that none of these
individual constituents of combined material would be able to satisfy the desired gradation. The
ratio of mixing these individual constituents is determined based on methodology proposed by
Rothfutch. In this process, the first step would be to determine the desired gradation. This may be
based on the specification limits or as per theoretical equation given by Fuller or other
researchers. The procedure involves drawing the gradation curves on graph paper and then
finding out optimum mix proportion as described below:
•
On a graph sheet percent passing is marked on Y axis in a suitable linear
scale. X axis represents the particle size distribution, which is to be marked,
based on desired gradation.
•
The corner O and O' are joined by straight line.
•
OO' represents required gradation line.
•
Sieve sizes are marked corresponding to percent passing of required
gradation. This can be done by locating the average percentage specified for
any particular sieve, locating that point on the Y axis and then proceeding to cut
the line OO'. At the point of intersection of this horizontal line and OO', a vertical
line is drawn to cut X axis. This intersection point on X axis represents the
sieve size selected for the desired gradation. In this manner, all the sieve sizes
are marked one by one on the X axis.
•
Gradation distribution of materials A, B and C are then drawn, by using the
sieve sizes marked on the X axis and the percentage finer marked on Y axis.
•
Balancing line for materials A, B and C are drawn in such a way that area on
either side of balancing line and gradation curve are equal. Balancing lines are
straight lines which represent the particle size distribution of respective
material in a best possible manner. This can be accomplished by using a
transparent plastic scale, moving it on either side of the material gradation
curve and counting the number of squares enclosed between balancing line
and material gradation curve. The balancing line should be drawn in such a
manner that number of squares (area) on either side of balancing line and the
selected gradation curve should be equal.

•
The opposite ends of the two adjoining balancing lines are then joined.
•
The points where these joining lines cut OO' represent the percentage of that
material in the mix.

CHAPTER 3
GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR SOIL/GRANULAR MATERIALS STABILIZATION
3.1
Factors to be Considered
In the selection of a stabilizer, the factors that must be considered are the type of soil to be
stabilized, the purpose for which the stabilized layer is used, the soil improvement desired, the
required strength and durability of the stabilized layer and the cost and environmental conditions.
The following parameters are required to be considered while selecting the type of stabilizer.
a)
Soil types and additives: There may be more than one candidate stabilizer
applicable for particular soil type. However, there are some general guidelines
that make specific stabilizers more effective based on soil granularity,
plasticity, or texture. Portland cement for example can be used with a variety of
soil types; however, since it is imperative that the cement be mixed intimately
with the fines fraction (less than 0.075 mm size), the more plastic materials
should be avoided. Generally, well-graded granular materials that possess
sufficient fines to produce a floating aggregate matrix (homogenous mixture)
are best suited for cement stabilization. Lime will react with soils of medium to
high plasticity to produce decreased plasticity, increased workability, reduced
swell and increased strength. Lime is used to stabilize a variety of materials
including weak subgrade soils, transforming them into a "working table" or
sub-base; and with marginal granular base materials, i.e., clay-gravels, "dirty"
gravels, to form a strong, high quality base course. Fly ash is a pozzolanic
material, i.e. it reacts with lime in powdered form in presence of water and is,
therefore, almost always used in combination with lime in soils that have little or
no plastic fines. It has often been found desirable to use a small amount of
Portland cement with lime and fly ash for added strength. This combination of
Lime-Cement-Fly Ash (LCF) has been used successfully in sub-base course
stabilization.
b)
General Guidelines: The following are general guidelines when considering
stabilization with different additives.
3.1.1
Lime stabilization
•
Clayey soils including heavy clays, moorum and other soils met within alluvial
plains can be effectively treated with lime. For effective stabilization, a soil
must have a fraction passing 425 micron sieve not less than 15 percent and
Plasticity Index (PI) should be at least 10 percent.
•
For effective stabilization, it is desirable that the percentage retained on 425
micron sieve should be well graded with uniformity coefficient not less than 5.



======================================================================
PAGE 18 of 46
======================================================================
12
IRC:SP:89-2010
•
Organic matter in the soil selected for soil stabilization should not be more than
2 percent and sulphate content should not exceed 0.2 percent.
•
pH value of 10 or 11 is desired for pozzolanic reaction to take place between
clay minerals and lime for the formation of cementitious compounds.
•
Soils having organic matter and soluble carbonate/sulphate contents in
excess of 2.0 percent and 0.2 percent respectively require special studies.
•
Some materials contain amorphous silica which although has low plasticity but
reacts with lime to form the necessary cementation products and should thus
be considered for stabilization with lime.
•
Materials containing high Kaolinite as the basic clay mineral usually have a
fairly low PI with a high liquid limit and in such cases lime should be
considered for stabilization.
•
In case of highly plastic soils, two stage stabilization is adopted. In this case
soil is first treated with a small quantity of lime. Later on the soil may be treated
with remaining quantity of lime or with cement to achieve the desired strength
and stability.
3.1.2
Cement stabilization
•
Generally granular soils free of high concentration of organic matter or
deleterious salts are suitable for cement stabilization. For checking the
suitability of soils, it would be advantageous to keep the following criterion
in view:
a)
Plasticity Product (PP), expressed as product of PI of soil and
percentage fraction passing 75 micron sieve should not exceed 60.
b)
Uniformity coefficient of soil should be greater than 5 and preferably
greater than 10.
c)
Highly micaceous soils are not suitable for cement stabilization.
d)
Soils that are having organic content higher than 2 percent and also
those soils having sulphate and carbonate concentration greater than
0.2 percent are not suitable for cement stabilization.
e)
Silty or fine sandy materials may exhibit a high liquid limit because of
the high surface area of the particles. This material generally will not
react with lime because of lack of clay particles and can be stabilized
with cement. However, cement stabilization with high doses of cement
may tend to make stabilization uneconomical.
3.1.3
Lime-fly ash (LF) and lime-cement-fly ash (LCF) stabilization
Stabilization of coarse-grained soils having little or no fines can often be accomplished by the
use of LF or LCF combinations. Fly ash, also termed coal ash, is a mineral residual from the



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 46
======================================================================
13
IRC:SP:89-2010
combustion of pulverised coal. It contains reactive silica and aluminium compounds that, when
mixed with lime and water, form a hardened cementitious mass capable of obtaining high
compressive strengths. Lime and fly ash in combination can often be used successfully in
stabilizing granular materials since the fly ash acts as an agent, with which the lime can react.
Thus LF or LCF stabilization is often appropriate for base and sub-base course materials.
3.2
Desirable Properties of Lime, Cement and Fly Ash for Stabilization
3.2 (a)
Lime: Lime is a broad term which is used to describe calcium oxide (CaO) - Quick
lime; calcium hydroxide Ca (OH)2 - Slaked or hydrated lime and calcium carbonate CaCO3 -
carbonate of lime. The relation between these three types of lime can be represented by the
following equations:
1)
CaCO3 + heat
=
CaO + CO2
2)
CaO + H2O
=
Ca (OH)2 + heat
3)
Ca (OH)2 + CO2
=
CaCO3 + H2O
The first reaction which is reversible does not occur much below 500ºC and is the basis for the
manufacture of quicklime from chalk or limestone. Hydrated lime is produced as a result of the
reaction of quicklime with water (equation 2). Quicklime (by the reversal of equation 1) and
hydrated lime (by equation 3) will both revert to calcium carbonate which is not used for stabiliza-
tion, although it is used in agriculture as a soil additive to adjust pH.
In dolomitic lime, some of the calcium is substituted by magnesium. These types of limes can
also be used for stabilization. Hydraulic lime also known as grey lime is produced from impure
forms of calcium carbonate which also contain clay. They, therefore, contain less "available lime"
to initiate effects on plasticity and strength. However, to compensate for this, they contain
reactive silicates and aluminates similar to those found in Portland cement. Thus, whilst their
immediate effect may be less than that of high calcium limes in the long term they may develop
higher strengths. Generally, use of dolomitic lime is not considered suitable.
Consequently in the context of this guidelines, lime stabilization refers to the addition of calcitic
dry lime, commercially available, slaked at site, or pre-slaked lime delivered at site in suitable
packing. Hydrated/Slaked lime comes in the form of a fine dry powder.
Quicklime is available either in granular form or as a powder. It reacts violently with 32 percent of
its own weight of water to produce considerable amounts of heat (approx 17 × 109 Joules
per kg of quicklime are released).
Hydrated lime and quicklime are both usually added to soil in the solid form but they may also be
mixed with water and added to the soil as slurry. The advantages and disadvantages of the three
methods of application are summarised below:
•
Dry hydrated lime
a)
Advantages: Can be applied two to three times faster than slurry and is
very effective in drying out soils.



======================================================================
PAGE 20 of 46
======================================================================
14
IRC:SP:89-2010
b)
Disadvantages: Produces a dust problem that makes it undesirable for
use in urban areas and the fast drying action of the lime requires an
excess amount of water during hot, dry weather.
•
Quicklime
a)
Advantages: More economical than hydrated lime as it contains
approximately 25 percent more available lime. Faster drying action
than hydrated lime on wet soils.
b)
Disadvantages: Field hydration is less effective, producing a coarser
material with poorer distribution in soil mass; quicklime requires more
water than does hydrated lime for stabilization, which may present a
problem in dry area and greater vulnerability of site personnel to skin
and eye burns.
•
Slurry lime
a)
Advantages: Dust free application is more desirable from an
environmental standpoint; better distribution is achieved with the slurry;
spreading and sprinkling operation are combined, thus reducing
processing costs and during hot and dry weather slurry application
pre-wets the soil and minimizes drying action.
b)
Disadvantages: Application rates are slower. High capacity pumps are
required to achieve acceptable application rates; extra equipment is
required and cost is therefore higher; extra manipulation may be
required for drying purposes during cool, wet, humid weather; not
practical for use with very wet soils and if prepared from quicklime
any benefits arising from the heat of hydration of quicklime are largely
lost.
The purity of lime affects the strength of lime-soil stabilization. The effectiveness of lime in
reaction with its clay minerals is dependent to a good extent on its chemical composition i.e.,
amount of calcium oxide present in the lime. The purity of lime is expressed as the percentage of
available calcium oxide present in the lime. It is generally recommended that the lime used for
soil stabilization should have purity of 50 percent or above. The addition of lime should be
correspondingly increased whenever the field tests show a lesser purity. Calcium oxide content
in lime should be determined as specified in IS 1514 or IS 712. Slaked lime supplied in airtight
bags should not be stored for more than three months. Since lime deteriorates with storage the
purity must be checked at site before use.
For effective stabilization with lime, uniform mixing is a pre-requisite and the degree of mixing
depends on the fineness of lime. When using fine powdered lime, there will be a quick and

effective reaction with clay minerals to form cementitious compounds. Lime for stabilization shall
conform to the fineness requirement of class C hydrated lime as specified in IS 1514 or IS 712,

Selection of Stabilizer
The selection of the stabilizer is based on plasticity and particle size distribution of the material
to be treated. The appropriate stabilizer can be selected according to the criterion shown in
Table 5. Some control over the grading can be achieved by limiting the coefficient of uniformity
to a minimum value of 5; however, it should preferably be more than 10. If the coefficient of
uniformity lies below 5, the cost of stabilization will be high and the maintenance of cracks in the
finished road would be expensive. If the plasticity of soil is high there are usually sufficient clay
minerals which can be readily stabilized with lime. Cement is more difficult to mix intimately with
plastic material but this problem can be alleviated by pre-treating the soil with approximately
2 percent lime.

Two Stage Stabilization Using Lime followed by Cement
Cement can be used to stabilize most of the soils. The principal exceptions are those that
contain organic matter in a form which retards the hydration of cement and soils which are



======================================================================
PAGE 23 of 46
======================================================================
17
IRC:SP:89-2010
difficult to mix with cement on account of their high clay content. In comparison with cement, the
potential use for lime in soil stabilization is more restricted; used in equivalent amount it generally
produces lower strengths than does cement and its main application is for use with clayey soils
which are difficult to stabilize with cement. For these reasons the use of a two stage lime/cement
stabilization process appears attractive as it offers the possibility of extending the range of soil
which can be effectively stabilized. To achieve the maximum effect the lime and cement would
not be blended but would be added separately. Lime would first be added to modify the
properties of soil and this would be followed by the addition of cement to bring out a long term
increase in strength, when lime treated soil is stabilized with cement.
3.5
Modification and Cementation
There is a distinction between a stabilized soil "modified" for subgrade improvement and
"cemented" (a cemented soil in this context can be one stabilized with lime as the clay-lime
pozzolanic reaction products can be regarded as a cement) for use as a sub-base or base. The
term "modification" and cementation are used in specifications to describe the degree and type
of treatment.
The rapid action of lime on soil, which brings about a reduction in plasticity and a marginal
increase in CBR is referred to as Modification. If conditions are favourable for the pozzolanic
action to proceed, the lime stabilized soil will develop significant compressive and tensile strengths
and it is then regarded as a "cemented" material.
If a very small quantity of cement is added to a soil, the properties may also be modified without
much hardening or the development of significant compressive or tensile strength. In such cases
the degree of cementation is relatively poor, but the properties of a material can nevertheless be
considerably improved in this way. This treatment is also referred to as modification in the
specifications.
When a material has developed sufficient tensile strength, it is regarded as a cemented material
but there is no clearly defined boundary between modification and the division between the two
is arbitrary. However, it has been suggested (NAASRA 1986) that a 7 day unconfined
compressive strength of 0.8 N/mm2 could be set as the boundary between the two.

CHAPTER 4
SPECIFICATIONS AND TEST REQUIREMENTS FOR STABILIZED MATERIALS
4.1
General Requirement
The pavement performance of a stabilized road will be largely governed by the gradation and the
type of soil/granular material used for the purpose of stabilization. The quality of material to be
stabilized should meet the minimum standard set out in specifications. Stabilized layers
constructed from such material is likely to perform satisfactorily even if, it is affected by
carbonation during its life time. Materials which do not comply with the requirements given in the
specifications can be stabilized but more additive will be required and the risk from cracking and
carbonation will increase. The strength of stabilized materials can be evaluated in many ways, of
which the most popular are the Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) test and the California
Bearing Ratio (CBR) test.
4.2
Stabilization with Cement
4.2.1
Requirement for soil modification/subgrade improvement
Cement stabilized materials can be used for soil modification or improvement of subgrade soil.
It is recommended from economic consideration that mix in-place methods of construction be
used for subgrade improvement and only granular materials and silty cohesive materials be
used. (The assumption being that more clayey materials would be more effectively stabilized
with lime). The main requirements for cement modification or stabilization of subgrade soil are
summarised in Table 6.

In case better mechanical equipment for spreading of cement, for breaking clods and blending is used, the

done to arrive at this minimum percentage. Sample at site of blended loose soil be collected and remoulded in
lab to confirm that the desired CBR can be achieved.

Requirement for bound sub-bases/bases
Granular materials, gravel, sand, lateritic soils, sandy silty material, crushed slag, crushed
concrete, brick metal and kankar, etc. stabilized with either cement or lime-fly ash-cement or
lime-fly ash, etc. may be allowed for use as capping layer over weak subgrade, as sub-base and
base layer of pavement. The main requirements of stabilized layers for different layers of a
pavement structure as indicated above are summarised in Table 7 and 8. The gradations indi-
cated in Table 8 are intended as tentative specifications. Gradation for cement bound
materials as per MoRTH specifications can also be adopted. However, thickness of different
stabilized layers, selection/choice for adoption of a particular grading and strength requirements
of these layers are to be decided on the basis of pavement design and with specific approval of
the Engineer-in-Charge.

Stabilization with Lime
4.3.1
Requirement for soil modification/subgrade improvement
The properties of soil-lime mixes is usually assessed on the basis of strength tests made
on the materials after the stabilizer has been allowed sufficient time to harden. The
strength of stabilized soils can be evaluated in many ways, of which the most popular is
California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test for lime stabilized soils. Lime stabilization is generally
recommended to improve the subgrade soils which are cohesive in nature. Lime is
recommended for such soils because of its beneficial effects on plasticity, workability and
strength gain. The main requirements for lime stabilized improved subgrade are summarised in
the Table 9.

Pulverised fuel ash (PFA) or fly ash has been recognised for many years as a valuable material
for modifying and enhancing the properties of soils. Stabilization of coarse grained soils having
little or no fines can be accomplished by the use of LF or LCF Combination. Fly ash also termed
as coal ash is a mineral residual obtained from the combustion of the pulverised coal. It contains
silicon and aluminium compound which, after mixing with lime and water forms a hardened
cementitious mass capable of obtaining high compressive strengths. Lime and fly ash in
combination can often be used successfully in stabilizing granular materials since the fly ash
provides an agent with which the lime can react. Thus LF or LCF stabilization is often
appropriate for base and sub-base course materials. Fly ash may be either from anthracitic coal
or lignitic coal. Fly ash to be used in lime and fly ash stabilization shall conform to the
requirements given in Table 3 and 4. Lime shall conform to the requirement as given in
Section 3.2.
Design of lime-fly ash stabilized mix is somewhat different from stabilization with lime or
cement. For a given combination of materials (aggregate, fly ash and lime) a number of factors
can be varied in the mix design process such as percentage of lime-fly ash, moisture content and
the ratio of lime-fly ash. It is generally recognised that engineering characteristics such as strength
and durability are directly related to the quality of the matrix material. The matrix material is that
part, which consists of fly ash, lime and passing 10 mm aggregates fines. Basically, higher strength
and improved durability is achieved, when the matrix material is able to fill the coarse aggregate
particles. For each coarse aggregate material, there is a quantity of matrix required to effectively
fill the available void spaces. The quantity of matrix required for maximum dry density of the total
mixture is referred to as the optimum fines content. In LF mixtures it is recommended that the
quantity of matrix be approximately 2 percent above the optimum fines content. At the
recommended fines content, the strength development is also influenced by the ratio of lime to fly
ash. Adjustment of the lime-fly ash ratio will yield different values of strength and durability
properties. The mix design process is described below:
Step 1:
The first step is to determine the optimum fines content that will give the maximum
density. This is done by conducting a series of moisture-density tests using different
percentages of fly ash and determining the mix level that yields maximum density. The initial fly
ash content should be about 10 percent based on dry weight of the mix. It is recommended that
material larger than 20 mm be removed and the test conducted on the minus 20 mm fraction.
Tests are run at increasing increments of fly ash, e.g. 2 percent, upto a total of about 20 percent.
Moisture density tests should be conducted following procedures indicated in IS 2720,

Part 7 or Part 8. The design fly ash content is then selected at 2 percent above that yielding
maximum density.
Step 2:
Determine the ratio of lime to fly ash that will yield highest strength and durability.
Using the design fly ash content and the optimum water content determined in Step 1, prepare
triplicate specimen at three different lime fly ash ratio. Use LF ratios of 1:3, 1:4 and 1:5. If desired
about 1 per cent of Portland cement may be added at this time.
Step 3:
Conduct durability test as per ASTM D 559 and compare the results of the unconfined
compressive strength and durability tests with the requirements shown in Table 8. The lowest LF
ratio content, i.e., ratio with the lowest lime content which meets the required unconfined
compressive strength requirement and demonstrates the required durability, is the design LF
content. If the mixture meet the durability requirements but not the strength requirements, it is
considered to be a modified soil. If the results of the specimens tested do not meet both the
strength and durability requirements, a different LF content may be selected or additional
portland cement be used and Steps 2 to 4 repeated to ascertain strength and durability
requirements as per stipulated specifications.
Gradation Requirements for LF or LCF stabilization for stabilized sub-base /bases may be as
indicated in Table 8.
4.5
Stabilization with Lime, Cement and Fly Ash
Portland cement may also be used in combination with LF for improved strength and durability. If
it is desired to incorporate cement into the mixture, the same procedures indicated for LF design
should be followed except that, beginning at Step 2, the cement shall be included. Generally,
about 1 to 2 percent cement is used. Cement may be used in place of or in addition to lime,
however, the total fines content should be maintained. Strength and durability tests must be
conducted on samples at various LCF ratios to determine the combination that gives best
results. Gradation requirements for LF or LCF stabilization for stabilized sub-base/bases should
be as indicated in Table 8.
4.6
Cement Stabilized Fly Ash
This work shall consist of laying and compacting a sub- base/base course of fly ash as treated
with cement on prepared subgrade/sub-base, in accordance with requirements of the
specifications. This technique can be adopted for improvement of poor subgrade also. Fly Ash
to be used for cement fly ash stabilization shall conform to Table 3 and 4. Pond ash or bottom
ash, which do not meet the requirements of Table 3 and 4 can also be used for cement stabiliza-
tion work. However, in all cases the cement stabilized fly ash/bottom ash/pond ash mix should
develop adequate strength.
The objectives of the mix design procedures, is to provide a pavement material having the re-
quired proportions of fly ash and cement to meet the following requirements:
1)
Provide adequate strength and durability

IRC:SP:89-2010
2)
Be easily placed and compacted
3)
Be economical
Amount of cement less than 2 percent is not generally amenable to proper mixing and hence not
recommended. After deciding cement and fly ash content for trial mix moisture density
relationship has to be determined in accordance with IS 2720 (Part-7 or 8). The unconfined
compressive strength test is done on samples compacted at maximum dry density and optimum
moisture content. The mix proportion should be designed to obtain minimum unconfined
compressive strength of 17.5 kg/cm2 after 7 days moist curing in a humidity chamber for samples
with a length to diameter ratio of 2:1. Curing may be carried out in the temperature range
30ºC to 38ºC. The design mix should not only indicate the proportions of fly ash and cement, but
also mention quantity of water to be mixed and a specified compacted density that is required to
satisfy specified strength.
Cement: Cement conforming to IS 269 or IS 8112 can be used. Portland pozzolona cement
should not be used for stabilization, when fly ash is used as an ingredient.
Water:
Water used for mixing and curing for stabilized mixes shall be clean and free from
injurious amounts of oils, salt and acid etc. It shall meet the requirement as IS 456.
Potable water is generally considered to be acceptable for stabilization works. The
permissible limits for solids in water should be as given in Table 10.

4.7.1
Unconfined compressive strength test
This test is carried out on cylindrical or cubical specimens prepared by mixing the soil at a pre-
determined moisture content and stabilizer content and compacting the mixed material into a
mould at either a pre-determined density or at a given compactive effort. The choice of
specimen size and shape depends on the grading of the soil; it is clearly desirable to keep
as small as possible the ratio of the maximum particles size to the smallest dimension of the
mould. The following sizes of specimen for different group of material are recommended
(Table 11).

Compressive strength results on identical materials from strength tests on cubical specimens
would be higher than those obtained from cylindrical specimens; and cylindrical specimens with
a height/diameter ratio of 2:1; have lower strength than cylindrical specimens with a height/
diameter ratio of 1:1. Allowance therefore has to be made for this when comparing results
obtained with specimens of different shapes. For the relatively low strengths encountered in
cement-stabilized soils the results on different sized test specimens may be multiplied by the
correction factors given in Table 12 to calculate the approximate equivalent strength of a
150 mm cube. However, there is no unique relation between the strengths of specimens of the
two shapes as the ratio depends primarily on the level of strength of the material.

Durability of stabilized materials
In order to check the durability of the stabilized mix for sub-base/base, the following two methods
are recommended. Method 1 is recommended for moderate temperature and climatic
conditions, whereas method 2 is recommended for those regions where there is large variation
in temperature and climatic conditions. The decision regarding the adoption of a particular method
should be as directed by the Engineer-in-Charge.
Method 1:
Prepare two identical set (containing 3 specimens each) of UCS specimen which
are cured in a normal manner at constant moisture content for 7 days. At the end of
7 days period one set is immersed in water while the other set is continued to cure
at constant moisture content. When both sets are 14 days old they are tested for
UCS. The strength of the set immersed in water as a percentage of the strength of



======================================================================
PAGE 31 of 46
======================================================================
25
IRC:SP:89-2010
set cured at constant moisture content is calculated. This index is a measure of the
resistance to the effect of water on strength. If this value is lower than 80 percent it
is considered that the stabilizer content is low and its value should be increased.
Method 2:
This test is done as per ASTM standard No. ASTM D 559. It is generally known as
Wetting and Drying test for determining durability of stabilized soil mixes, which
determines the weight losses, moisture changes and volume changes (swell and
shrinkage) produced by repeated wetting and drying of hardened stabilized soil
specimens. The other is a freezing and thawing test which follows a similar
procedure except that wetting and drying is replaced by cycles of freezing and
thawing.
In the wetting and drying test, the test specimens are subjected to 12 cycles of wetting and
drying, consisting of immersion in water for 5 hours followed by drying at 71ºC for 42 hours. After
each cycle the specimens are brushed in a standardised manner with a wire scratch brush (18-
20 strokes on the sides and 4 strokes at each end). The loss in weight of the brushed specimens,
after each cycle are determined. In a parallel test the volume and moisture changes of the
specimens after each cycle is recorded.
The freezing and thawing test is similar to the wetting and drying test but the test cycles consist of
subjecting the specimens to freezing conditions at -23ºC for 24 hours followed by thawing at
21ºC for 23/24 hours. The specimens are brushed, as in the wetting and drying test, after each
thawing cycle. For climatic conditions prevailing in India, durability under wetting and drying would
have to be taken into consideration and durability under freeze/thaw condition does not generally
apply.
The principal criterion set by the PCA is that the loss in weight of the specimens after 12 cycles
of both freezing & thawing and wetting and drying should not exceed certain limits, depending on
soil type. Granular soils of low plasticity are permitted to lose up to 14 percent of their original
mass and cohesive clay soils are permitted to lose only 7 percent of their original mass. The
reason of the difference is that granular materials abrade more readily than cohesive soils and
the wire brushing removes some material in addition to that loosened by the alternate cycles of
freezing and thawing and wetting and drying. However, as per some other studies, the above
requirements were found to be too stringent and following values have been recommended:
Base: Less than 20 percent
Sub-base: Less than 30 percent
Shoulder: Less than 30 percent

CHAPTER 5
CONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS
5.1
Procedure of Stabilization
The construction of stabilized road pavement layers follow the same basic procedures whether
the stabilizing agent is cement, lime or other hydraulic binder. The procedures can be divided in
to two main groups:
1)
Mix-in-place stabilization
2)
Plant-mix stabilization
5.2
Mix-in-Place Stabilization
The main advantage of the mix-in-place procedure is its relative simplicity and hence it is
particularly suitable for work in remote areas where plant mixing could prove logistically difficult.
Its disadvantages are not obtaining efficient mixing i.e. good distribution of the stabilizer,
constructing thicknesses of more than 200 mm and of poor levels.
In this process the material is stabilized in-situ which requires the stabilizing agent to be spread
before or during the pulverisation and mixing of the soil and stabilizer. This is generally carried
out with a purpose made machine although for small scale work in remote areas agricultural
machinery can be adapted for use. In-situ stabilization generally involves the following
operations:
Initial Preparation
This involves excavating down to the in-situ material to be stabilized or placing imported material
on the formation. The material to be stabilized then has to be graded to approximately the
required levels. After which it is usually necessary to plough to loosen the material, one or two
passes is normally sufficient.
Spreading the Stabilizer
Spreading the stabilizing agent at the required dosage rate can be carried out manually or by
machine. When manual methods are used bags of stabilizer are spotted at a set spacing, they
are then broken open and the stabilizer raked across the surface as uniformly as possible. Where
quicklime is being used, necessary precaution need to be taken to protect the operators. This is
especially true when the stabilizer is being spread by manual method.
Lime has a much lower bulk density than cement and it is possible, therefore, to achieve a more
uniform distribution with lime when stabilizers are spread manually. The uniformity of the layer of
stabilizer spread over the surface, before the mixing operation, determines the uniformity of the
mixed material produced.



======================================================================
PAGE 33 of 46
======================================================================
27
IRC:SP:89-2010
Mechanical spreaders automatically monitor the required amount of stabilizer to be spread on
the surface of the soil. Their use results in a much more uniform spread of stabilizer over the
surface than can be achieved by hand spreading. The equipment need to be calibrated before
use to ensure that the correct rate of spread is achieved and subsequently checked at regular
intervals to ensure that the rate of spread remains within specified tolerances.
Addition of Water
If it is necessary to add water to bring the moisture content to the required value this can either be
done as part of the mixing operation or after the material has been prepared prior to the addition
of the stabilizer. To ensure a thorough distribution of the added water, it is preferable to add water
as part of the mixing operation. Water added during the mixing process should be through a
spray system such that it is added in a uniform manner over the required area and mixed
uniformly to the required depth. Where the mixing plant does not enable water to be added or
where it is not possible to add enough water during mixing it should be added to the prepared
material using a spray system that enables the amount to be controlled over the whole area. The
material to be stabilized should then be mixed prior to the addition of the stabilizer to ensure the
distribution of the water throughout the layer.
Mixing Soil, Water and Stabilizer
Robust mixing equipment of suitable power for the layer being processed is required to pulverise
the soil and blend it with the stabilizer and water. The most efficient of the machines available
carry out the operation in one pass, enabling the layer to be compacted quickly and minimising
the loss of density and strength caused by any delay in compaction. Multi pass machines are
satisfactory, provided the length of pavement being processed is not excessive and each
section of pavement can be processed within an acceptable time.
The plasticity of the material is overriding factor in the ability of mixing plant to mix the soil with
stabilizer. A review of work showed that all plastic soil could be satisfactorily mixed with cement
using the plant. For cohesive soils a factor of the plasticity index of the soil multiplied by the
percentage of the fraction of the soil which was finer than 425 micron in particle diameter may be
used to suggest the values for the different types of mixing plant available, which are given in
Table 13.

======================================================================

IRC:SP:89-2010
Graders have been used to mix stabilized material but they are inefficient for pulverising
cohesive soil and even with granular materials a large number of passes are needed before
the quality of mixing is acceptable. For these reasons, the use of grader for mixing is not
suggested.
Compaction
Compaction is carried out in two stages:
a)
An initial rolling and trimming which may be carried out followed by a final
mixing pass of the rotovator.
b)
Final compaction and levelling in the case of cement stabilized material, must
be completed within two hours of mixing. Delay in lime stabilization are less
critical and for soil modification there may even be benefits in completing the
final mixing, levelling and compaction between one and seven days after the
initial mixing. This time gap allows for the reactions between the lime and clay
to take place and thus provide a more workable soil. However, for lime
stabilization as distinct from modification, the aim should be to complete
compaction within three hours after mixing lime with soil. This is particularly
true in hot climates where problems of evaporation and carbonation are more
likely to occur. In case of cement stabilization, this time period should be
reduced to two hours.
Curing
Proper curing is very important for three reasons:
a)
It ensures that sufficient water is retained in the layer so that the hydration
reactions between the stabilizer, water and the soil can continue
b)
It reduces shrinkage, and
c)
It reduces the risk of carbonation from the top layer.
In temperate climate curing presents few problems. It is usually carried out by sealing the
compacted surface to prevent escape of water during the curing period (usually seven days)
during which time all construction traffic must be kept off the stabilized material. Before spraying
is started the surface should be swept free of loose material and any damp areas should be free
of standing water. The following methods of curing are suggested:
a)
covering with an impermeable sheeting with joints overlapping at least
300 mm and set to prevent ingress of water.
b)
spraying with a bituminous sealing compound.



======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 46
======================================================================
29
IRC:SP:89-2010
c)
spraying with a resin based aluminous curing compound similar to those used
for concrete. This has particular application where it is desirable to reduce the
increase in temperature immediately under the surface which would result from
the use of a black (bituminous) seal.
In a hot dry climate, the need for good curing is most important but the prevention of moisture loss
is very difficult. If the surface is constantly sprayed and kept damp day and night the moisture
content in the main portion of the layer will remain stable but the operation is likely to leach
stabilizer from the top portion of the layer. If the spraying operation is intermittent and the surface
dries from time to time (a common occurrence if this method is used) the curing will be
completely ineffective.
Curing through spraying water can be much more efficient if a layer of sand 30 mm to 40 mm
thick is first spread on top of the layer. In this case, the number of spraying cycles per day can be
very much less and there is a considerable saving in the amount of water used.
When the stabilized layer is to be covered by other pavement layers the construction of the upper
sections will provide a very good curing seal but care has to be taken to ensure that this work
does not damage the top of the stabilized layer. During the period of time prior to the
construction of the next layer some system of curing is required because, this is the most critical
period in terms of shrinkage in the layer.
Primer can also serve as a curing membrane but, results have shown that a prime coat breaks
down when it penetrates into the surface and completely loses any ability to seal it. A portion of
any curing membrane must sit on the surface to achieve an effective seal if the top of the
stabilized layer is sprayed lightly with water followed by an application of a viscous cutback
bitumen, the loss of moisture is effectively reduced to zero. Similarly the top of the stabilized layer
can be sprayed with an emulsion to achieve the same result. It is essential, however, that all traffic
is kept off the curing membrane for several days at which time excess bitumen can be absorbed
by the surface.
5.3
Plant-Mix Stabilization
In this process, the materials are separately batched and mixed at a mixing plant. They are then
transported to the site where they are laid by a bituminous paver and compacted. The
advantages of the process are the good control on proportioning of the materials, multi-layer
work can be executed and good compacted levels are readily obtainable. The disadvantages
are that output is lower than in the mix in place process, cohesive materials cannot usually be
mixed and in the case of cement stabilization, the mixing plant has to be relatively close to the
site so that mixing, laying and compaction can all be completed within the stipulated two-hour
time limit. The process is not, therefore, applicable to small-scale projects unless there is a
mixing plant near at hand.
To ensure complete distribution of the relatively small quantities of stabilizer, mixing should be
carried out in a forced action mixer and except for non-cohesive granular materials, free fall



======================================================================
PAGE 36 of 46
======================================================================
30
IRC:SP:89-2010
mixes of the type used for mixing concrete should not be used. If it is proposed to use a mixer
other than one with a forced action preliminary trials should be made to ensure that satisfactory
mixing is achieved.
Vehicles transporting the mixed material should be of sufficient number and capacity to meet
both the output of the mixer and spreading and compaction operations. International standards
and specifications, for plant mixed cement stabilized material require it to be spread by a
bituminous paver and spreading by grader is not permitted. If graders are used for spreading,
much of the advantage of plant-mix stabilization is lost as it is difficult to control levels and
thicknesses of construction.
5.4
Compaction
Whatever method is used for mixing the soil with water and stabilizer material, the methods used
for compaction are the same. In the case of cement stabilized materials, once the cement has
begun to harden, it is important that the matrix is not disturbed; hence the requirement that
compaction must be completed within two hours of mixing. The compacted density of the
stabilized layer is a measure of the effectiveness of compaction and hence of its strength. The
degree of compaction to be achieved in the field can be specified in two ways. In an end product
specification, the density of the layer in the field is determined and compared with a specified
target density. Provided that the measured field density is greater than or equal to this limit the
compaction in the field is deemed to be satisfactory. The main disadvantages of an end product
specification are that a large amount of site testing is required and many of the methods in use
are time consuming. This means that the results of the tests may not be available in time to
remedy any deficiencies in compaction.

CHAPTER 6
QUALITY ASSURANCE
6.1
General
During the construction process regular checks are to be made on the stabilized material to
ensure that all the requirements of the specification are being met. Many of the checks carried
out are merely "good housekeeping" i.e. continual supervision to ensure that the construction
process allows the design objectives to be achieved in full. In addition to this there are production
control tests carried out to monitor the work in progress to ensure, for example, that the correct
thickness of stabilized layer is being laid and that a consistent product is being produced. Finally
compliance tests are to be carried out on the finished product to demonstrate that it meets all the
requirements of the specification.
This Chapter, therefore, describes the tests that may need to be carried out to check on the
quality of the material. It also discusses the various factors that influence the choice of a
particular test that is used to establish the values for parameters such as moisture content,
compacted density, strength, etc., set out in the specification.
6.2
Preliminary Trial
As part of the quality control and in order to make a final decision on moisture content and
stabilizer content, the information gained in the laboratory tests should be related to a preliminary
field trial. At least 10 days before the main work begins, a trial area should be laid using the
materials, mix proportions, mixing, laying and compaction plant to be used, to check the
suitability of the methods, etc.
6.3
Sampling and Testing Frequency
Samples for checking the moisture content, strength, etc. are most conveniently taken from the
laid material before compaction. Frequency of testing depends on the size of the project and the
facilities available on site but regular checks should, at least, be made on the moisture content,
strength and in-situ density. Whatever the frequency, sampling should be spread out over the site
so as to give a representative indication of the quality of the material within a given area. In order
to achieve the specification for stabilized sub-bases and road bases, it is suggested that samples
at equally spaced locations along a diagonal that bisects the area to be tested may be taken. For
satisfactory performance of soil stabilized road, strict quality control measures are essential. It is
prudent to conduct periodic testing during construction to confirm that the properties of materials
being used are within the range of value anticipated during the design. For each consignment of
cement, lime and fly ash; testing should be done to check quality. Quality control tests and their
minimum desirable frequency are as given in Table 14. Strict control should be excised during

the mix in-place operations, with frequent checks on mixing efficiency. This can be done by
trenching through the in-place material and inspecting the colour of the mixture. Unmixed streaks
or layers indicate poor mixing and the material in that area should be remixed until uniformity of
colour is achieved.

Storage and Handling of the Stabilizer
Unless cement and lime are properly stored and used in a fresh condition the quality of the
pavement layer will be substantially reduced. Cement must be stored in a sound water-tight
building and the bags stacked as tightly as possible. Doors and windows should only be opened
if absolutely necessary. The cement which is delivered first should be used first. According to a

Lime should be stored in sealed bags, tightly stacked and covered with a water proof tarpaulin.
The material which has been stored for more than three weeks should be tested for available
lime content before use. Lime which is older than 6 months should be discarded.
6.5
Control of the Moisture Content
Throughout the stabilization work, the moisture content should be maintained slightly above its
specified value. This means that rapid determination of the in-situ moisture content is necessary
to allow adjustments to be made so as to bring the moisture content of the stabilized material to
the required value.
The definitive oven-drying method is, in general, too time-consuming to be of much practical use
in the field and more rapid means have to be employed. Rapid heating methods may be used,
but where these are inappropriate, the calcium carbide method may be used to give rapid result.
The method depends on the reaction between calcium carbide and water in the stabilized
material to produce acetylene at the ambient temperature according to the equation:
CaC2 + 2H2O = Ca (OH)2 + C2H2
If the reaction is allowed to occur under standardised conditions in a closed container, the
pressure of the acetylene generated in the container is a measure of the moisture content of the
stabilized material.
Nuclear density gauges for the determination of the in-situ density of compacted materials
usually include a facility for the in-situ moisture content at the same time. This method can be
used to determine moisture content when construction starts and also during the processing.
6.6
Control of the Stabilizer Content
Whatever method of spreading the stabilizer is employed, it is important that a uniform spread
rate is achieved as this will affect the uniformity of the stabilized material. If the stabilizer is placed
in bags and spread by hand, the accuracy of the spotting of the bags must be checked and the
manual spreading of the stabilizer should be visually assessed. If a mechanical spreader is
used, metal trays or canvas sheets, one metre square, should be placed at regular intervals
along the road to check the application rate.

Determination of the stabilizer content, after mixing, is in principle easy to perform but in practice
is time consuming and needs to be carried out with care if meaningful results are to be obtained.
Both the methods described in the codes BS:1924:Part 2 and in ASTM D 806 involve a
comparison of the calcium contents of the stabilized material, the stabilizer and the material in an
un-stabilized condition. However, the method given for the determination of calcium in BS:1924
is to be preferred. Neither method is applicable if the calcium content of the un-stabilized
materials is high or variable.
6.7
Routine Strength Determinations
Continuous monitoring of the strength of processed material is required to ensure that the
specified strength is being achieved. Representative samples of the full depth of mixed material
should therefore be taken from the site immediately prior to compacting the material. As stated
previously, the frequency of sampling should be related to the size of the processed area and its
structural importance. In the case of cement stabilized materials, preparation of the test
specimens should be completed within two hours of mixing.
The moisture content to be used for the preparation of the test specimens will clearly be that of
the mixed material and precautions should be taken to ensure that no drying out of the material
occurs between taking the samples and completing the preparation of the test specimens.
The density at which the test specimens are to be compacted depends on the density
requirements of the specification and various methods which are in use. The test specimens
should be prepared at the same density as the compacted material in the field. This has some
logic because it means that there should be no differences in strength, which can be attributed to
differences of density, between the laboratory test specimens and the strength of the material in
the field. The difficulty is that an immediate measure of the in-situ density is required and this can
only be achieved if nuclear density gauges are used.

CHAPTER 7
PRECAUTIONS TO BE TAKEN WHILE USING STABILIZED MATERIALS
7.1
General
The two major problems that arise with the use of stabilized materials in road pavement layers
are cracking and the long -term durability of the material. The extent to which either of these is a
problem is intimately related to the purpose of the stabilized layer in the road pavement as a
whole and it is, therefore, difficult to divorce the two factors. However, in this Chapter the prob-
lems that can arise are discussed.
7.2
Cracking in Stabilized Layers
Many factors contribute to the cracking and crack -spacing of stabilized pavement layers. Some
of them are listed below:
1)
Tensile strength of the stabilized material;
2)
Shrinkage characteristics;
3)
Volume changes resulting from temperature or moisture variations;
4)
The subgrade restraint;
5)
Stiffness and creep of the stabilized material, and
6)
External loadings such as those caused by traffic.
As in the case of compressive strength, the tensile strength of stabilized materials takes time to
develop. On the other hand, stabilized material in a road pavement layer will be subject to volume
changes from at least one of the factors listed above as soon as it is compacted. Cracking in
stabilized layers due to changes in temperature or moisture content cannot, therefore, be avoided
and must be accepted as inevitable although steps can be taken to reduce the effect. Cracking
may also occur as a result of fatigue failure due to trafficking and is an entirely separate
phenomenon from the initial cracking due to environmental changes.
Cracks in stabilized layers used at capping and sub-base level are unlikely to cause significant
problems but at base level the cracks may be reflected through the surfacing. The existence of
cracks in a road surface may be assumed to indicate need for remedial action. The
consequences of not doing so, may range from no problems at all to loss of interlock or to
eventual failure when the stabilized layer has been reduced to unconnected blocks. Cracks may
also permit ingress of water leading to weathering of materials at crack faces, de-bonding
between pavement layers, or deterioration of moisture-susceptible layers beneath the
stabilized layer.

7.3
Primary Cracking
Cracks appear in cement-stabilized materials as a result of shrinkage and temperature
fluctuations. The initial crack pattern is dependent on the early strength of the material and the
properties of the material used. Materials which have low strength, normally also contain a higher
proportion of plastic fines. The stabilized materials with lower strength and with high proportion
of plastic fines have frequent but narrow cracks. Whether or not these frequent but fine cracks
prove to be a problem depends to a large extent on the mechanical interlock at the face of the
cracks. If the interlock is good the material performs satisfactory and the cracks are sufficiently
fine for them not to be reflected through the pavement layer above. However, the lower strengths
of these stabilized materials mean that they are generally only suitable for use in the lower layers
of the road where cracking is less of a problem anyway.
On the other hand, stabilized materials with high strength criteria and which have little, if any,
plastic fines have fewer but wide cracks. These cracks are often wide enough for them to be
reflected through the surface. In order to restrain the propagation of lateral reflective cracks, such
materials therefore have to be covered with a greater thickness of construction material than
would otherwise be required.
The temperature at which the material is laid also plays a part in the type of crack pattern that is
produced. Layers placed in cooler weather tend to develop fewer and narrower cracks as there
is less thermal shrinkage. The stabilized layer may subsequently be in compression, apart
perhaps from prolonged cold spells, so that cracks remain closed with good load transfer. Fewer
cracks develop when the temperature difference between day and night during construction is
not large, as thermal warping is reduced.
Lime- stabilized materials are also subjected to cracking for the same reasons. However, the
effects are not so pronounced; if the cracks occur before unreacted lime in the layer has been
used up, either in pozzolanic reactions or by carbonation, the continuing pozzolanic reaction of
the lime can result in self- healing (autogenous healing ) of the cracks.
Given that cracking is inevitable, the ideal condition is for materials to have low early strength
which lead to numerous fine cracks but high long- term strengths which mean good mechanical
interlock at the face of the cracks. As lime is slower to react than cement, this is another reason
for favouring lime, provided it can achieve high long- term strengths.
Another possibility is to use secondary additives to modify the hardening action of the cement to
reduce its early strength without affecting its long-term strength.
7.4
Traffic Associated Cracks
Quite separately and much more importantly than the primary transverse cracks, cracks may
appear in stabilized bases of inadequate strength or inadequate construction thickness in
relation to the traffic and the sub-grade strength. Such cracking takes the form of "map" cracking



======================================================================

IRC:SP:89-2010
which, in extreme cases, causes the stabilized material to deteriorate into small slabs with poor
load transfer. Once started, deterioration is likely to continue until the stabilized base becomes
little more effective than granular sub-base.
When extensive cracking has developed as a result of the combined action of free water and
traffic, then it often results in the "pumping" to the surface of fine material from the underlying
pavement layers where it is deposited in the cracks. The fines discolour the surface along the
cracks making them clearly visible.
Unlike the primary cracking, the appearance of traffic-associated cracks is not inevitable. It should
not occur if the road pavement has been properly designed to take account of the traffic likely to
be encountered during the design life of the road.
7.5
Durability of Stabilized Materials
The failure of stabilized materials by disintegration into a loose mass is not common. It is most
likely to be due to deficiency either in the amount of stabilizer, deficiency in the quality of the
stabilizer, or deficient compaction or curing. These problems should not occur if a good standard
of preliminary testing for suitability and of quality control are maintained.
It is reported that the most common type of failure of stabilized layers is the peeling-off of surface
dressings from stabilized layers. This is usually due to failure of top of the layers itself rather than
any of the shortcoming of the surface dressing. The surface of the layer tends to disintegrate
under traffic, the most likely cause of which is considered to be as a result of overstressing of the
surface layer during the compaction of the stabilized material at the time of construction. This
induces a series of shallow shear planes in the surface layer and result in a sharp falling-off
density of the material towards the upper surface. Overstressing is most prevalent with uniformly
graded non-cohesive sands. It can be avoided if special care is taken with the compaction and if
towed vibrating rollers are used.
A survey of known causes of lack of durability of stabilized layers confirmed that the most
common problem was surface disintegration of the primed layer during construction and
scabbing of the seal in service due to an inadequate bond with the stabilized material. These
problems are a result of inadequate compaction and curing and are more likely to occur in hot,
dry climates. Apart from the problem of surface disintegration, long-term durability may also be
impaired by the effects of sulphates and by carbonation.
7.6
Control of Reflective Cracking in Cement Stabilized Pavements
Although the potential exists for reflection cracking when a cement-stabilized base is used in a
pavement structure, proper construction and design techniques can minimize the potential that
the pavement will be adversely affected.Proper construction practices to minimize drying,
pre-cracking soon after construction, and designing for stress relief are all valid methods that will
reduce or eliminate the formation of reflection cracks in cement-stabilized bases.



======================================================================

IRC:SP:89-2010
There are several factors as discussed in the previous chapter, which contribute to the cracking
in a cement-stabilized base/sub-base. With regard to material characteristics, the type of soil,
cement content, degree of compaction and curing, and temperature and moisture changes
directly influence the degree of shrinkage.
There are a number of preventative measures and design concepts that can be used to minimize
shrinkage cracking in the cement-stabilized base, and to reduce the potential,that base cracks
will reflect through the asphalt surface. Methods of controlling reflective cracking include proper
construction and curing of the stabilized base, reduction of crack size through the use of
"pre-cracking", and relief of stress concentrations through the use of flexible layers in the
pavement structure.
A cement-stabilized base provides excellent support for asphalt surfaces. The stabilized base
material is stronger, more uniform and more water resistant than an un-stabilized base. Loads
are distributed over a larger area and stresses in the subgrade are reduced. However,
cement-stabilized bases can also be the source of shrinkage cracks in the stabilized base layer,
which can reflect through the asphalt surface. The cracks that develop are not the result of a
structural deficiency, but rather a natural characteristic of cement-stabilized bases. The surface
cracks tend to follow the same pattern as the cracks in the base, and are referred to as
"reflection" cracks.
In most cases, reflection cracks are narrow (less than 3 mm) and will not adversely affect the
performance of the pavement. However, wider cracks can result in a rough riding surface and
deterioration of the pavement. The wide cracks create an environment for water infiltration and
subsequent pumping of the underlying subgrade.
Several factors contribute to the cracking and crack spacing in a cement stabilized base which
include material characteristics, construction procedures, traffic and restraint imposed on the
base by the subgrade. With regard to material characteristics the primary cause of cracking is
due to drying shrinkage of the cement stabilized base. The degree of drying shrinkage is
affected by the type of soil, degree of compaction and curing, cement content , temperatures and
moisture changes.
Cement stabilized fine grained soils e.g. clays exhibit greater shrinkage than cement stabilized
granular soils. Although stabilized clay soils develop higher total shrinkage than granular soils,
the cracks are typically finer and more closely spaced often of hairline variety spaced 0.6 to
3.0 m apart. The granular soilsgenerally produce less shrinkage but develop larger cracks
typically spaced at 3.0 to 6.0 m apart.
Fine grain grained soils have large surface area than granular soils and typically require higher
moisture content for compaction purposes. In addition, cement content for fine grained soils are
generally 2 to 5 percent higher than granular soils in order to achieve adequate durability and
strength. Both these factor contribute to higher moisture contents for stabilized fine grained soils
and consequently higher drying shrinkage.

The effect of compaction on shrinkage characteristics of cement stabilized material plays an
important role. A well compacted mixture exhibits reduced shrinkage potential, because the soil/
aggregates particles are packed tightly together resulting in reduced voids. It has been reported
that compacting cement stabilized soil at modified proctor effort, reduces shrinkage significantly
as compared to stabilized soil compacted to standard proctor density. The reason for the same
can be attributed to the fact that the optimum moisture contents at modified proctor compaction
are typically less than at standard proctor compaction which helps to reduce shrinkage.The least
amount of shrinkage is obtained for the stabilized material at the highest density and lowest
moisture content.
Cement hydration contributes less to shrinkage than does many other factors. In fact, for soils
that exhibit volume change without cement, increasing cement will decrease total shrinkage.
However, excessive amounts of cement can exacerbate cracking in two ways: First, increased
cement contents cause greater consumption of water during hydration, thus increasing drying
shrinkage. Also, higher cement levels cause higher rigidity and excessive strength (both tensile
and compressive).
Methods of controlling reflective cracking basically fall into the two categories :
•
Pre-cracking
•
Providing for stress relief at the base-surface interface
Pre-cracking: Minimizing crack width with proper construction and curing procedures, as
discussed in the previous sections, will eliminate much of the potential for wide cracks. Another
method to reduce crack width is a relatively new procedure called "pre-cracking", where
hundreds of tiny micro-cracks develop instead of single transverse cracks. The method has been
successfully tried on several projects in the United States. The procedure involves several passes
of a large vibratory roller over the cement-stabilized base one to two days after final compaction.
This introduces a network of closely spaced hairline cracks into the cement-stabilized material,
which acts to relieve the shrinkage stresses in the early stages of curing, and provides a crack
pattern that will minimize the development of wide shrinkage cracks. In addition, since the
pre-cracking is performed shortly after placement, the "micro- cracking" will not impact the
pavement's overall structural capacity as the cracks will heal and the cement-stabilized material
will continue to gain strength with time.
Stress Relief: Another method of reducing the potential for reflection cracking is to relieve the
stress concentrations that result from cracks in the cement-stabilized base. The following three
methods have been successfully usedto reduce the stresses that cause reflection cracks:
1)
A bituminous surface treatment (chip seal) between the stabilized base and
the asphalt surface. The additional flexibility of the surface treatment layer will
help to reduce stress concentrations. This surface treatment also provides an
excellent temporary surface during construction for traffic control.

2)
A geotextile between the stabilized base and surface, or between the asphalt
binder and wearing courses. Similar to the surface treatment, the geotextile
provides flexibility and acts to intercept cracks without letting them pass through
the material.
3)
A 50 mm to 100 mm layer of unbound granular material between the stabilized
base layer and the asphalt surface. This use of a "sandwich" or "inverted"
pavement design adds additional structure to the pavement, and will prevent
the propagation of cracks through to the surface layer.
