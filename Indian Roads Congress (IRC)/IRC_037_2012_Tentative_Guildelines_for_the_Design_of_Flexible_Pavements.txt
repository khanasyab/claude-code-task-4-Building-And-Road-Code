IRC:37-2012
TENTATIVE GUIDELINES FOR THE DESIGN OF FLEXIBLE PAVEMENTS
1 INTRODUCTION
1 .1
The guidelines on design of flexible pavement were first brought out in
1 970, which
were based on California Bearing Ratio (CBR) of subgrade and traffic
in terms of number
of commercial vehicles (more than 3 tonnes laden weight). These guidelines were revised
in 1984
in which design traffic was considered in terms of cumulative number of equivalent
standard axle load of 80 kN
in
millions of standard axles (msa) and design charts were
provided for traffic up to 30 msa using an empirical approach.
1.2
The guidelines were revised again
in 2001 when pavements were required to be
designed for traffic as high as 150 msa. The revised guidelines used a semi-mechanistic
approach based on the
results of the MORTH's research scheme R-56 implemented
at
NT Kharagpur. The software, FPAVE was developed for the analysis and design of flexible
pavements. Multilayer elastic theory was adopted for stress analysis of the layered elastic
system. A large number of data collected from different parts of India under various research
schemes of MORTH were used for the development of fatigue and rutting criteria from field
performance data.
1.3
The traffic pattern has changed since then and so has the technology. The volume
of tandem, tridem and multi-axle vehicles has increased manifold and heavier axle loads are
common. Experience has been gained on the use of new form of construction and materials
such as stone matrix asphalt, modified bitumen, foamed bitumen, bitumen emulsion, warm
asphalt, cementitious bases and sub-bases since the publication of the last revision of the
guidelines. Conventional as well as commercially available chemical soil stabilizers are being
successfully used in trial sections. Attention
is focused on fatigue resistant bituminous mixes
with high viscosity binders for heavy traffic with a view to construct high performance long
life bituminous pavements. The guidelines contained
in
this document reflect the current
knowledge in the subject.
1.4
Conventional
construction
material
like
aggregates
is becoming
progressively
scarce on account of environmental concerns as well as legal restrictions on quarrying while
the construction activity has expanded phenomenally. This has shifted focus from large scale
use of conventional aggregates to use of local, recycled and engineered marginal aggregates
in construction.
1.5
It
is recognized that research as well as performance
trials have not been very
extensive in India for some of the new materials but these have been included in the guidelines
in the light of extensive performance reports and current practice in Australia, South Africa
and other countries with due safeguards in design for heavy axle loads. Some trials in India
have performed well (Annex XI).

IRC:37-2012
Accordingly, this guidelines of IRC:37 incorporates some of the new and alternate materials in
the current design practices. A designer can use his sound engineering judgment consistent
with local environment using a semi-mechanistic approach for design of pavements.

The
initial
draft was
prepared
by
Prof.
B.B.
Pandey
of
NT
Kharagpur
and
presented before the Flexible Pavement Committee (H-2) of IRC during
its meeting held on
4.6.2011. There after the draft, after further revision, was presented at the joint meeting of
Flexible Pavement Committee and Composite Pavement Committee (H-9) under the joint
convenorship of Shri A.V. Sinha and Shri PL. Bongirwar held on 12.9.2011 and the draft
was finally approved
in the joint meeting. The name of the personnel of Flexible Pavement

IRC:37-2012
by the Highways Specifications and Standards Committee (HSS)
in
its meeting held on
23.9.2011
. The Executive Committee in its meeting held on 7.1 0.201 1 approved the document
for placing before Council. The document was approved by the IRC Council
in
its meeting
held on 3.11.2011 at Lucknow. The DG (RD) & SS authorized the Convenor of the Flexible
Pavement Committee (H-2) to incorporate the comments offered by the Council members.
The comments have been incorporated and the document has been finalized as one of the
revised Publications of IRC.
2 SCOPE OF THE GUIDELINES
2.1
The Guidelines shall apply to the design of new flexible pavements for Expressways,
National Highways, State Highways, Major
District Roads and other categories of roads
predominantly carrying motorized vehicles. These guidelines do not form a
rigid standard
and sound engineering judgment considering the
local environment and
past pavement
performance
in the respective regions should be given due consideration while selecting a
pavement composition.
2.2
For the purpose
of the guidelines,
flexible pavements
include pavements with
Bituminous surfacing over:
(i)
Granular base and sub-base
(ii)
Cementitious bases and sub-bases with a crack
relief layer of aggregate
interlayer below the bituminous surfacing
(iii)
Cementitious
bases
and
sub-bases
with
SAMI
in-between
bituminous
surfacing and the cementitious base layer for retarding the reflection cracks
into the bituminous layer
(iv)
Reclaimed
Asphalt Pavement
(RAP)
with
or
without
addition
of
fresh
aggregates treated with foamed bitumen/bitumen emulsion
Use of deep strength long life bituminous pavement is also included.
2.3
These guidelines
shall
not be straightway applied
to overlay design
for which
IRC:81-1997(31) or a more suitable procedure based on evaluation of in situ properties of
pavement layers by Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) should be used (25,56).
2.4
The
guidelines may
require
revision
from
time
to
time
in
the
light
of
future
developments and experience
in the
field. Towards
this end,
it
is suggested that
all the
organizations intending
to use the guidelines should keep a detailed record
of the year
of construction, subgrade CBR,
soil characteristics including
resilient modulus, pavement
composition and
specifications,
traffic, pavement performance,
overlay
history,
climatic
conditions etc. and provide feedback to the Indian Roads Congress for further revision.

IRC:37-2012
3 GENERAL
3.1
The
IRC:37-2001
was
based
on
a
Mechanistic
Empirical
approach,
which
considered the design
life of pavement to last
till the fatigue cracking
in bituminous surface
extended to 20 per cent of the pavement surface area or rutting in the pavement reached the
terminal rutting of 20 mm, whichever happened earlier. The same approach and the criteria
are followed
in these revised guidelines as well, except that the cracking and rutting have
been restricted to 10 per cent of the area for design
traffic exceeding 30 million standard
axles. The cracking and rutting models
in IRC: 37-2001 were based on the findings of the
research schemes of the
Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, Government of
India,
under which pavement performance data were collected from
all over India by academic
institutions and Central Road Research Institute to evolve the fatigue and rutting criteria for
pavement design using a semi-analytical approach.
In the absence of any further research
in the field to modify or refine these models, the same models are considered applicable in
these guidelines as well. These revised guidelines, however, aim at expanding the scope of
pavement design by including alternate materials
like cementitious and reclaimed asphalt
materials, and subjecting them to analysis using the software IITPAVE, a modified version
»i
| RAVI
developed under the Rese irch Scheme R-56
for layered system analysis. The
material properties of these alternate
materials, such as
Resilient/Elastic Modulus, were
extensively tested
in
laboratories
in the
country,
especially
I IT,
Kharagpur. Conservative
values of material properties are suggested
in these Guidelines because of variation
in test
results on materials from different sources and based on National Standards of Australia,
South Africa and MEPDG of the USA as well as those adopted
in some of the satisfactorily
performing
pavements
constructed
in
the
country
using
cementitious and RAP bases
(Ref. Annex XI). The material properties should be tested in laboratory as per test procedures
recommended in Annex IX and X.
3.2
The experience on a number of high volume highways designed and constructed
during the last decade using the guidelines of IRC: 37-2001 as reported
in various literature
shows that the most common mode of distress has been flushing and rutting in the bituminous
layer (49, 51 and 61). Surface cracking of the bituminous layer (i.e. the top down cracking)
within a year or two of traffic loading
is also reported from different parts of India (39, 53 and
63). Heavy Vehicle Simulator at the Central Road Research Institute exhibited similar surface
cracking. Published literatures on fatigue and rutting of different types of bituminous mixes
have helped
in better understanding of these problems (20, 24, 27, 38, 42, 43, 47 and 51).
The present guidelines strongly recommend that these problems need serious consideration.
Bituminous mix design needs to be considered an integral part of pavement design exercise
with a view to provide
(i) fatigue resistant mixes in the bottom bituminous layer to eliminate
bottom-up cracking
(ii)
rut resistant bituminous layers of high tensile strength to eliminate
rutting and surface cracking.
3.3
The guidelines also recommend cementitious sub-bases and bases. Such bound
layers would display shrinkage and
traffic induced cracks after the construction and the
4

long term effective moduli would be much lower than those determined
in the laboratory by
unconfined compression test.
Elastic Moduli of such layers are to be judiciously selected,
which can ensure long term performance as a structural layer in the pavement. Their fatigue
fracture behaviour is analyzed on the same principles that are applied to concrete pavements.
Only low strength cementitious bases are recommended for use since high strength
rigid
bases develop wide shrinkage cracks which reflect to the bituminous surface rapidly. Due to
lower strength requirement of the cemented sub-bases and bases, the required compressive
strength can be easily achieved even by stabilizing local and marginal materials. While their
strength may be low,
it is essential to ensure a reasonable level of durability by 'wetting' and
'drying' test.
3.4
The Guidelines recommend that the following aspects should be given consideration
while designing to achieve better performing pavements:
(i)
Incorporation of design period of more than fifteen years.
(ii)
Computation of effective CBR of subgrade for pavement design.
(iii)
Use of rut resistant surface layer.
(iv)
Use of fatigue resistant bottom bituminous layer.
(v)
Selection of surface layer to prevent top down cracking.
(vi)
Use
of
bitumen
emulsion/foamed
bitumen

Pavements in base course.
(vii)
Consideration of stabilized sub-base and base with locally available soil and
aggregates.
(viii)
Design of drainage layer.
(ix)
Computation of equivalent single axle load considering (a) single axle with
single wheel (b) single axle with dual wheels (c) tandem axle and (d) tridem
axles.
(x)
Design of perpetual pavements with deep strength bituminous layer.
Each of the items listed above has been discussed in these guidelines at appropriate places.
3.5
Load associated failure
is considered as the mode of failure in these guidelines as
environmental effects on bituminous layers are built-in in the calibration of rutting and fatigue
equations from pavement performance.
4 TRAFFIC
4.1
General
4.1.1
The recommended method considers design
traffic
in terms
of the cumulative
number of standard axles (80 kN) to be carried by the pavement during the design
life.
Axle load spectrum data are required where cementitious bases are used for evaluating the

fatigue damage of such bases for heavy traffic. Following information is needed for estimating
design traffic:

(iv)

(V)
Vehicle Damage Factor (VDF).
(vi)
Distribution of commercial traffic over the carriageway.
4.1.2
Only the number of commercial vehicles having gross vehicle weight of 30 kN or
more and their axle-loading
is considered for the purpose of design of pavement.
4.1.3
Assessment of the present day average
traffic should be based on seven-day-
24-hour count made in accordance with IRC: 9-1972 "Traffic Census on Non-Urban Roads".
4.2
Traffic Growth Rate
4.2.1
The present day traffic has to be projected for the end of design life at growth rates
(V) estimated by studying and analyzing the following data:
(i)
The past trends of traffic growth; and
(ii)
Demand elasticity of traffic with respect to macro-economic parameters (like
GDP or SDP) and expected demand due to specific developments and land
use changes likely to take place during design
life.
4.2.2
If the data for the annual growth rate of commercial vehicles is not available or
if
it
is less than 5 per cent, a growth rate of 5 per cent should be used (IRC:SP:84-2009).
4.3
Design Life
4.3.1
The design
life
is defined
in terms of the cumulative number of standard axles
in
msa that can be carried before a major strengthening, rehabilitation or capacity augmentation
of the pavement is necessary.
4.3.2
It
is recommended that pavements
for National Highways and State Highways
should be designed for a minimum
life of 15 years. Expressways and Urban Roads may be
designed for a longer life of 20 years or higher using innovative design adopting high fatigue
bituminous mixes. In the light of experience in India and abroad, very high volume roads with
design traffic greater than 200 msa and perpetual pavements can also be designed using
the principles stated in the guidelines. For other categories of roads, a design
life of 10 to 15
years may be adopted.
4.3.3
If stage construction
is adopted, thickness of granular layer should be provided for
the
full design
period.
In case of cemented bases and sub-bases, stage construction may
lead to early failure because of high flexural stresses in the cemented layer and therefore, not
recommended.

4.4
Vehicle Damage Factor
4.4.1
The guidelines use Vehicle Damage Factor (VDF) in estimation of cumulative msa
for thickness design of pavements. In case of cemented bases, cumulative damage principle
is used for determining fatigue life of cementitious bases for heavy traffic and for that spectrum
of axle loads is required.
4.4.2
The Vehicle Damage Factor (VDF) is a multiplier to convert the number of commercial
vehicles of different axle loads and
axle configuration
into the number of repetitions
of
standard axle load of magnitude 80 kN.
It is defined as equivalent number of standard axles
per commercial vehicle. The VDF varies with the vehicle axle configuration and axle loading.
4.4.3
The equations for computing equivalency factors for single, tandem and tridem
axles given below should be used for converting different axle load repetitions into equivalent
standard axle load repetitions. Since the VDF values
in AASHO Road Test for flexible and
rigid pavement are not much different, for heavy duty pavements, the computed VDF values
are assumed to be same for bituminous pavements with cemented and granular bases.

VDF should be arrived at carefully by carrying out specific axle load surveys on the
existing roads. Minimum sample size for survey is given in Table 4.1
. Axle load survey should
be carried out without any bias for loaded or unloaded vehicles. On some sections, there may
be significant difference in axle loading in two directions of traffic. In such situations, the VDF
should be evaluated direction wise. Each direction can have different pavement thickness for
divided highways depending upon the loading pattern.

4.4.5
Axle load spectrum
The spectrum of axle load
in terms of axle weights of single, tandem, tridem and multi-axle
should be determined and compiled under various classes with class intervals of 10 kN,
20 kN and 30 kN for single, tandem and tridem axles respectively.
4.4.6
Where sufficient information on axle loads is not available and the small size of the
project does not warrant an axle load survey, the default values of vehicle damage factor as
given in Table 4.2 may be used.

Distribution of Commercial Traffic Over the Carriageway
4.5.1
Distribution of commercial
traffic
in each
direction and
in each lane
is required
for determining the total equivalent standard axle load applications to be considered
in the
design.
In the absence of adequate and conclusive data, the following distribution may be
assumed
until more reliable data on placement of commercial vehicles on the carriageway
lanes are available:
(i)
Single-lane roads
Traffic tends to be more channelized on
single-lane roads than two-lane
roads and to allow for this concentration of wheel load repetitions, the design
should be based on total number of commercial vehicies in both directions.
(ii)
Two-lane single carriageway roads
The design should be based on 50 per cent of the total number of commercial
vehicles in both directions.
If vehicle damage factor in one direction is higher,
the traffic in the direction of higher VDF is recommended for design.
(iii)
Four-lane single carriageway roads
The design should be based on 40 per cent of the total number of commercial
vehicles in both directions.
(iv)
Dual carriageway roads
The
design
of
dual
two-lane
carriageway
roads
should
be
based
on
75 per cent of the number of commercial vehicles in each direction. For dual
8



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:37-2012
three-lane carriageway and dual four lane carriageway, the distribution factor
will be 60 per cent and 45 per cent respectively.
4.5.2
Where there is no significant difference between traffic in each of the two directions,
the design
traffic for each direction may be assumed as half of the sum of traffic
in both
directions. Where significant difference between the two streams exists, pavement thickness
in each direction can be different and designed accordingly.
For two way two lane roads, pavement thickness should be same for both the lanes even
if VDF values are different
in different directions and designed for higher VDF. For divided
carriageways, each direction may have different thickness of pavements
if the axle load
patterns are significantly different.
4.6
Computation of Design Traffic
4.6.1
The design traffic in terms of the cumulative number of standard axles to be carried
during the design
life of the road should be computed using the following equation:
Where,
365 x
[(1 +

N =

is estimated using the following formula:

Where,
P =
Number of commercial vehicles as per last count.

5 SUBGRADE
5.1
Requirements of CBR for Subgrade
The subgrade
is the top 500 mm of the embankment immediately below the bottom of the
pavement, and
is made up of in-situ
material,
select
soil, or stabilized
soil that forms the
foundation of a pavement.
It should be well compacted to limit the scope of rutting in pavement
due to additional densification during the service life of pavement. Subgrade shall be compacted
to a minimum of 97 per cent of laboratory dry density achieved with heavy compaction as per
IS: 2720 (Part 8) for Expressways, National Highways, State Highways, Major District Roads
and other heavily trafficked roads. IRC: 36 "Recommended Practice for the Construction of
Earth Embankments and Sub-grades for Road Works" should be followed for guidance during
planning and execution of work. The select soil forming the subgrade should have a minimum
CBR of 8 per cent for roads having
traffic of 450 commercial vehicles per day or higher The
guidelines for preparation of samples, testing and acceptance criteria are given
in sub-paras
given below. The in-situ CBR of the sub grade soil can also be determined from the Dynamic
Cone Penetrometer (60° cone) from the following relation (ASTM-D6951-09) (11).
Log 10 CBR = 2.465 - 1.12 log 10 N
5.1
Where N = mm/blow
5.1 .1
Selection of dry density and moisture content for test specimen
5.1.1.1
The laboratory test conditions should represent the field conditions as closely as
possible. Compaction
in the field
is done at a minimum of 97 per cent of laboratory density
at moisture content corresponding to the optimum moisture content.
In actual field condition,
the subgrade undergoes moisture variations depending upon
local environmental factors,
such as, the water table, precipitation, soil permeability, drainage conditions and the extent to
which the pavement is waterproof, which affect the strength of the subgrade in terms of CBR.
In high rainfall areas, lateral infiltration through unpaved shoulder, through defects in wearing
surfaces or through cracks may have significant effect on the subgrade moisture condition.
As a general
practice, the worst field moisture
is simulated by soaking the specimens
in
water for four days.
5.1.1.2
Number of tests, design value and tolerance limit
Where different types of soils are used in subgrade, a minimum of six to eight average CBR
values (average of three tests) for each
soil type along the alignment will be required for
determination of design CBR. The 90th percentile of these values should be adopted as the
design CBR (such that 90 per cent of the average CBR values are equal or greater than the
design value) for high volume roads such as Expressways, National Highways and State
Highways. For other categories of roads, design can be based on 80th percentile of laboratory
CBR values. Method of computation of 90th percentile CBR is given in Annex IV. Pavement

thickness on new roads may be modified at intervals as dictated by the changes in soil profile
but generally
it will be found inexpedient to do so frequently from practical considerations.
The maximum permissible variation within the CBR values of the three specimens should be
as indicated in Table 5.1.

Where variation
is more than the above, the average CBR should be the average of test
results from at least six samples and not three.
5.2
Effective CBR
Where
there
is
significant
difference
between
the CBRs
of the
select subgrade and
embankment soils, the design should be based on effective CBR. The effective CBR of the
subgrade can be determined from Fig. 5.1. For other compacted thickness of subgrade, ref
4 may be consulted for guidance.

In case the borrow material is placed over rocky foundation, the effective CBR may be larger
than the CBR of the borrow material. Use of the CBR of the borrow material may be adopted
for pavement design with proper safeguards against development of pore water pressure
between the foundation and the borrow material.
5.3
Determination of Resilient Modulus
The behaviour
of the subgrade
is
essentially
elastic under the
transient
traffic
loading
with negligible permanent deformation
in a single pass. Resilient modulus
is the measure
of
its elastic behaviour determined from recoverable deformation
in the laboratory tests.
The modulus
is an important parameter for design and the performance of a pavement.
This can be determined
in the laboratory by conducting tests as per procedure specified
in
AASHTO T 307-99(2003) (1 ). Since the repetitive triaxial testing facility is not widely available
and
is expensive, the default resilient modulus can be estimated from generally acceptable
correlations which are as follows:
The relation between resilient modulus and the effective CBR is given as:
The CBR of the subgrade should be determined as per IS: 2720 (Part 16) (36) at the most
critical moisture conditions
likely to occur at
site. The test must always be performed on
remoulded samples of soils
in the laboratory. The pavement thickness should be based on
4-day soaked CBR value of the soil, remoulded at placement density and moisture content
ascertained from the compaction curve.
In areas with
rainfall less than 1000 mm, four day
soaking is too severe a condition for well protected subgrade with thick bituminous layer and
the strength of the subgrade soil may be underestimated.
If data
is available for moisture
variation
in
the
existing
in-service pavements
of a
region
in
different seasons, moulding
moisture content for the CBR test can be based on field data. Wherever possible the test
specimens should be prepared by static compaction. Alternatively dynamic compaction may
also be used. Both procedures are described in brief in Annex IV.
(Users of these guidelines are advised to read this section in conjunction with Annexs
I to XI
for a better appreciation of the context and the requirements of pavement design)
A flexible pavement
is modelled as an elastic multilayer structure. Stresses and strains at
critical locations (Fig. 6.1) are computed using a linear layered elastic model. The Stress
analysis software IITPAVE has been used for the computation of stresses and strains
in
flexible pavements. Tensile strain, C

subgrade strain, 6V
, on the top of the subgrade are conventionally considered as
critical
parameters for pavement design to
limit cracking and rutting
in the bituminous layers and
non-bituminous layers respectively. The computation also indicates that tensile strain near
the surface close to the edge of a wheel can be
sufficiently large to
initiate longitudinal
surface cracking followed by transverse cracking much before the flexural cracking of the
bottom layer
if the mix tensile strength
is not adequate at higher temperatures.

Different Layers of a Flexible Pavement
6.2
Fatigue in Bottom Layer of Bituminous Pavement and Fatigue Life
6.2.1
With every load repetition, the tensile strain developed at the bottom of the bituminous
layer develops micro cracks, which go on widening and expanding
till the load repetitions
are large enough for the cracks to propagate to the surface over an area of the surface
that is unacceptable from the point of view of long term serviceability of the pavement. The
phenomenon
is called fatigue of the bituminous layer and the number of load repetitions
in
terms of standard axles that cause fatigue denotes the fatigue life of the pavement.
In these
guidelines, cracking
in 20 per cent area has been considered for traffic up to 30 msa and
10 per cent for traffic beyond that.
6.2.2
Fatigue model
Fatigue model has been calibrated in the R-56 (54) studies using the pavement performance
data collected during the R-6 (57) and R-19 (58) studies sponsored by MORTH. Two fatigue
equations were fitted, one
in which the computed strains
in 80 per cent of the actual data
in the scatter plot were higher than the limiting strains predicted by the model (and termed
as 80 per cent
reliability level
in these guidelines) and the other corresponding to 90 per
cent reliability level. The two equations for the conventional bituminous mixes designed by
Marshall method are given below:
N
f = 2.21

Where,
N
f
=
fatigue
life in number of standard axles,
£
t
=
Maximum tensile strain at the bottom of the bituminous layer, and
M R =
resilient modulus of the bituminous layer.
As per the then prevailing practice, the mixes used
in the pavements under study sections
were generally designed for 4.5 per cent air voids and bitumen content of 4.5 per cent by
weight of the mix (which
in terms of volume would come to 11.5 per cent). Most literature
recommend a factor 'C to be introduced
in fatigue models to take into account the effect of
air voids (Va ) and volume of bitumen (Vb ), which is given by the following relationships
Corresponding to the values of Va and Vb as stated above, introduction of 'C in Equation 6.2
leads to Equation 6.3 below.
Many well known fatigue models also (3, 8 and 60) include the above approach to take into
account the effect of volume of bitumen and air voids
in the bituminous mix. Equation 6.3
would demonstrate that slight changes in volume air voids (Va ) and volume of bitumen (Vb )
will have huge impact on the fatigue
life. For example
If bitumen content
is increased by
0.5 per cent to 0.6 per cent above the optimum bitumen content given by Marshall test and air
void
is reduced to the minimum acceptable level of 3 per cent, volume of bitumen increases
to the level of 13 per cent and the fatigue life would be increased by about three times. The
recommendation in these guidelines is to target low air voids and higher bitumen content for
the lower layer to obtain fatigue resistant mix.
Equation
6.1
is recommended
for use for traffic up to 30 msa where normal bituminous
mixes with VG 30 bitumen can be used. Equation 6.3
is recommended for use for traffic
greater than 30 msa where richer bituminous mixes with stiffer VG 40 binder should be used.
Volume of stiffer grade bitumen
is possible to be increased by slightly opening the grading.
The guidelines recommend that the designer should consider these aspects with a view
to achieving a high fatigue
life of bituminous mixes. A discussion on effect of modulus of
mixes, air voids and volume of bitumen on fatigue behaviour of bituminous mixes are given
in Annex
I.
6.3
Rutting in Pavement
6.3.1
Rutting
is the permanent deformation
in pavement usually occurring longitudinally
along the wheel path. The rutting may partly be caused by deformation in the subgrade and
other non-bituminous layers which would reflect to the overlying layers to take a deformed
shape. The bituminous mixes also may undergo rutting due to secondary compaction and

IRC:37-2012
shear deformation under heavy traffic load and higher temperature. Excessive rutting greatly
reduces the serviceability of the pavement and therefore,
it has to be limited to a certain
reasonable value.
In these guidelines the
limiting
rutting
is recommended as 20 mm
in
20 per cent of the length for design traffic up to 30 msa and 10 per cent of the length for the
design traffic beyond.
6.3.2
Rutting model
Like the fatigue model,
rutting model also has been calibrated
in the R-56 studies using
the pavement performance data collected during the R-6 (57) and R-19
(58) studies
at
80 per cent and 90 per cent reliability levels. The two equations are given below:
N = 4. 1 656 x
1 0"08
[1 /g 4 5337
... 6.4
N = 1.41x 10"8x[1/£v ] 45337
... 6.5
Where,
N = Number of cumulative standard axles, and
ev = Vertical strain in the subgrade
As can be seen, the model considers the vertical strain
in subgrade as the only variable for
rutting, which,
is a measure of bearing capacity of the subgrade. Rutting
in granular layer
also
is lower when the vertical subgrade elastic strains are given by Equations 6.4 and 6.5.
A granular layer founded on a strong subgrade has a high
resilient modulus and
resists
rutting when not highly stressed. Rutting
in the bituminous layers also occurs due to the
secondary compaction and shear deformation apart from that in the subgrade. This needs to
be addressed. The recommendation in these guidelines is to provide rut resistant bituminous
mixes using higher viscosity grade bitumen or modified bitumen.
6.4
Top Down Cracking in Bituminous Layer
While fatigue cracking
is conventionally considered as a 'bottom-up cracking' phenomenon,
'top down cracking' has also been observed on high volume roads
in the country, because
of excessive tensile stresses developing at the top surface due to heavy axle loads. These
guidelines recommend a high modulus
rut as well as fatigue resistant mix to prevent top
down cracking.
6.5
Cementitious Sub-base and Base
6.5.1
Cementitious materials normally crack due to shrinkage and temperature changes
even without pavement being loaded. Slow setting cementitious materials having low cement
content develop fine cracks and have to be preferred to high cement content mixes producing
wider cracks. While making a judgment on the strength values for design, the reduction
in
strength due to the cracked condition of these layers need to be fully recognized. The Elastic
Modulus (E) recommended for design
is much lower than their respective laboratory value

obtained from unconfined compression
test. The extent of reductions proposed has been
generally in agreement with practices followed in the national standards of other countries like
Australia, South Africa, MEPDG of the USA etc. There are limited data
in the country on the
field performance of such type of construction to understand and model their performance
in
the field. Therefore, the new pavements constructed with these materials need to be closely
monitored by Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) for the evaluation of material properties
for future guidance. These guidelines
strongly recommend
construction
with cementitious
materials in the interest of saving the environment and using the iocal and marginal materials
after stabilization. Validated
results of cemented pavement layers from other countries and
use of a sound analytical tool are likely to give good performing pavements at an affordable
cost consistent with environmental requirement, and the
availability of limited data of field
performance in India need not be considered a handicap. Locations where the cemented layers
were used in India are given in Annex XI and some of them were evaluated by FWD also.
6.5.2
Fatigue cracking in cementitious layers
In these guidelines, the treatment of fatigue cracking of cement treated layers is recommended
at two levels. Thickness of the cemented layer is firstly evaluated from fatigue consideration in
terms of cumulative standard axles. At the second level, the cumulative fatigue damage due
to individual axles is calculated based on a model which uses 'stress ratio' (the ratio of actual
stresses developed due to a class of wheel load and the flexural strength of the material) as
the parameter. The computation of stresses due to the individual wheel load
is done by the
IITPAVE program. An excel sheet can be used to calculate the cumulative fatigue damage of
each class of wheel loads and sum up the cumulative damage for the entire axle load spectrum.
The design requirement is that the cumulative damage of all wheel loads should be less than
1
during the design
life of a pavement.
If
it is greater than
1
, the section has to be changed and
iteration done again. The first model is taken from the Australian experience, while the second
one
is suggested
in MEPDG. The second level analysis
is necessary only when very heavy
traffic is operating on the highways. The two fatigue equations are given below:

Fatigue Equation for Cumulative Damage Analysis
In fatigue analysis of cementitious bases, the spectrum of axle loads has to be compiled
under various axle load classes. Axle weights of tandem and tridem axle may be taken as
equivalent to two and three single axles respectively because axles located at distances more
than
1 .30 m apart are not considered as causing any significant overlapping of stresses.The

======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:37-2012
The sub-base and the base layer can be unbound
(e.g. granular) or chemical stabilized
with stabilizers such as cement, lime, flyash and other cementitious stabilizers.
In case of
pavements with cementitious base, a crack
relief layer provided between the bituminous
layer and the cementitious base delays considerably the reflection crack
in the bituminous
course. This may consist of crushed aggregates of thickness
1 00 mm of WMM conforming to
IRC/MORTH Specifications or Stress Absorbing Membrane Interlayer (SAMI) of elastomeric
modified
binder
at the
rate
of about 2
litre/m 2 covered with
light application
of 10 mm
aggregates to prevent picking up of the binder by construction traffic(AUSTROADS).
The unbound base layer may consist of granular layer such as Wet Mix Macadam (MORTH
Specification for Road & Bridge Works) and water bound macadam. The base layer may
consist of granular materials treated with bitumen emulsion of SS2 grade or foamed bitumen.
Fresh aggregates or aggregates obtained from reclaimed asphalt pavements when treated
with foamed bitumen or bitumen emulsion should have the required indirect tensile strength
to be considered as a base layer.
The sub-base layer serves three functions, viz., to protect the subgrade from overstressing,
to provide a platform for the construction traffic and to serve as drainage and filter layer. The
design of sub-base, whether bound or unbound, should meet these functional requirements.
7.2
Sub-base Layer
7.2.1
Unbound sub-base layer
7.2.1.1
Sub-base materials may consist of natural sand, moorum, gravel,
laterite, kankar,
brick metal, crushed stone, crushed slag and reclaimed crushed concrete/reclaimed asphalt
pavement or combinations thereof meeting the prescribed grading and physical requirements.
When the sub-base material consists of combination of materials, mixing should be done
mechanically either using a suitable mixer or adopting mix-in-place method. The sub-base
should have sufficient strength and thickness to serve the construction traffic.
7.2.1.2
Specifications
of
granular
sub-base
(GSB)
materials
conforming
to MORTH
Specifications for Road and Bridge Works are recommended for use. These specifications
suggest close and coarse graded granular sub-base materials and specify that the materials
passing 425 micron sieve when tested in accordance with IS:2720 (Part 5) should have liquid
limit and plasticity index of not more than 25 and 6 respectively. These specifications and the
specified grain size distribution of the sub-base material should be strictly enforced
in order
to meet strength,
filter and drainage requirements of the granular sub-base
layer. When
coarse graded sub-base
is used as a drainage
layer, Los Angeles abrasion value should
be less than 40 so that there
is no excessive crushing during the rolling and the required
permeability is retained and fines passing 0.075 mm should be less than 2 per cent.
7.2.1.3
The sub-base
should
be composed
of two
layers,
the
lower
layer forms
the
separation/filter layer to prevent intrusion of subgrade soil into the pavement and the upper
GSB forms the drainage layer to drain away any water that may enter through surface cracks.
18



======================================================================
PAGE 29 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:37-2012
The drainage layer should be tested for permeability and gradation may be altered to ensure
the required permeability.
Filter and drainage layers can be designed as per IRC: SP: 42-
1994 (33) and IRC:SP:50-1 999(34).
7.2.1.4
Strength parameter
The relevant design parameter for granular sub-base
is
resilient modulus (M R ), which
is
given by the following equation:
M
=0 2h° 45 * M
7
1
lvl Rgsb
u -^"
lvl Rsubgrade
Where h = thickness of sub-base layer in mm
M R value of the sub-base is dependent upon the M R value of the subgrade since weaker subgrade
does not permit higher modulus of the upper layer because of deformation under loads.
7.2.2
Bound sub-base layer
7.2.2.1
The material for bound sub-base may consist of soil, aggregate or soil aggregate
mixture modified with chemical stabilizers such as cement, lime-flyash, commercially available
stabilizers
1 etc. The drainage layer of the sub-base may consist of coarse graded aggregates
bound with about 2 per cent cement while retaining the permeability. In case the soil modified
with cementitious material is used as a sub-base and granular material is not easily available,
commercially available geo-composites possessing the necessary permeability can be used
to serve both as a drainage and filter/separation layer. Drainage and separation layers are
essential when water is likely to enter into pavements from the shoulder, median or through
the cracks in surface layer.
7. 2. 2. 2
Strength Parameter
The relevant design parameter for bound sub-bases is the Elastic Modulus E, which can be
determined from the unconfined compressive strength of the material. In case of cementitious
granular sub-base having a 7-day UCS
of
1.5
to 3 MPa, the laboratory based E value
(AUSTROADS) is given by the following equation:
Ecgsb = 1000* UCS
...7.2
Where UCS = 28 day strength of the cementitious granular material
Equation 7.2 gives a value in the range of 2000 to 4000 MPa. Since the sub-base acts as a
platform for the heavy construction traffic, low strength cemented sub-base
is expected to
crack during the construction and a design value of 600 MPa is recommended for the stress
analysis. Poisson's ratio may be taken as 0.25.
If the stabilized soil sub-bases have 7-day UCS values
in the range 0.75 to 1.5 MPa, the
recommended E value for design is 400 MPa with Poisson's ratio of 0.25.
Where commercially available stabilizers are used, the stabilized material should meet additional requirements of
leachability and concentration of heavy metals apart from the usual requirements of strength and durability.

7.3
Base Layer
7.3.1
Unbound base layer
The base
layer may consist of wet mix macadam, water bound macadam, crusher run
macadam, reclaimed concrete etc. Relevant specifications of IRC/MORTH are to be adopted
for the construction.
When both sub-base and the base layers are made up of unbound granular layers, the
composite resilient modulus of the granular sub-base and the base is given as:
M R_g ra nular =^ "0.45 M R subgrade
... 7.3
Where
h = thickness of granular sub-base and base, mm
Poisson's ratio of granular bases and sub-bases is recommended as 0.35.
7.3.2
Cementitious bases
7.3.2.1
Cemented base layers may consist of aggregates or soils or both stabilized with
chemical stabilizers such as cement, lime, lime-flyash or other stabilizers which are required to
give a minimum strength of 4.5 to 7 MPa in 7/28 days. While the conventional cement should
attain the above strength
in seven days(iRC:SP-89-2010(30)), lime or lime-flyash stabilized
granular materials and soils should meet the above strength requirement
in 28 days since
strength gain in such materials is a slow process. Though the initial modulus of the cementitious
bases may be in the range 10000 to 15000 MPa, the long term modulus of the cemented layer
may be taken as fifty per cent of the
initial modulus due to shrinkage cracks and construction
traffic (65, 66). Australian guidelines recommend use of Equation 7.2 for the cemented layer.
Curing
of cemented bases
after construction
is very important
for achieving the required
strength as described in IRC:SP-89 and curing should start immediately by spraying bitumen
emulsion or periodical mist spray of water without flooding or other methods.
7.3.2.2
Strength parameter
Flexural strength
is required for carrying out the fatigue analysis as per fatigue equation.
Ml
PI *G suggest
thai the modulus of rupture
for chemically stabilized bases csn be taken
as 20 per cent of the 28 day unconfined compressive strength. The same
is recommended
in these guidelines. The following default values of modulus of rupture are recommended for
cementitious bases (MEPDG).
Cementitious stabilized aggregates
-
1.40 MPa
Lime—flyash-soil
-
1.05 MPa
Soil cement
-
0.70 MPa
Poisson's ration of the cemented layers may be taken as 0.25.

======================================================================
IRC:37-2012
7. 3. 2. 3
Durability criteria
The minimum cementitious material
in the cementitious base layer should be such that in a
wetting and drying test (BIS: 4332 (Part IV)
- 1968) (17), the loss of weight of the stabilized
material does not exceed 14 per cent after 12 cycles of wetting and drying. In cold and snow
bound regions like Arunachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh etc.,
durability should be determined by freezing and thawing test and the loss of weight should
be less than 14 per cent after 12 cycles (BIS: 4332 (Part IV) - 1968) (17). The cementitious
layer meeting the strength requirements of IRC:SP:89-2010
is found to meet the criteria of
durability requirement (14).
7.3.2.4
Strength gain with time
The cementitious materials keep on gaining strength over a long time period and a 28 day
strength gives a conservative design.
It should be recognized that the cemented materials
may possibly degrade also with time depending upon the loads, temperature and moisture
conditions, freeze-thaw cycles and quantity of chemical stabilizers.
7. 3. 2. 5
Crack relief layer
A SAMI layer using elastomeric modified bitumen provided over the cementitious layer delays
the cracks propagating into the bituminous layer. A crack relief layer of wet mix macadam of
thickness 100 mm sandwiched between the bituminous layer and treated layer is much more
effective in arresting the propagation of cracks from the Cementitious base to the bituminous
layer (14, 22, 65 and 66). The aggregate layer becomes stiffer under heavier loads because
of high confining pressure.
If there
is shoving and deformation
in the unbound layer caused
by the construction
traffic, the granular layer may be treated with
1
to 2 per cent bitumen
emulsion of grade MS to avoid reshaping.
7. 3. 2. 6
Modulus of crack relief layer:
The resilient modulus of a good quality granular layer provided between the cementitious
and
bituminous
layers
is dependent upon
the confinement pressure under wheel
load
(3, 14, 26, 65 and 66). The modulus may vary from 250 to 1000 MPa and a typical value of
450 MPa (14, 65 and 66) may be used for the sandwiched aggregate layer for the analysis
of pavements. Strong support from the cementitious base, results
in higher modulus than
what is given by Equation 7.3. Poisson's ratio of the aggregate relief layer may be taken as
0.35. A brief description on strength and resilient modulus of cementitious materials is given
in Annex VIII.
7.3.3
Bitumen emulsion/foamed bitumen treated aggregates/reclaimed asphalt base.
If the base is made up of fresh aggregates or milled material from reclaimed asphalt pavements
treated with foamed bitumen or bitumen emulsion, the value of resilient modulus of the material
may be taken as 600 MPa while the laboratory values may range from 600 to 1200 MPa
(50, 59). The above mentioned resilient modulus value can be ensured
if the Indirect Tensile
Strength (ASTM: D7369-09) (12) of the 100 mm diameter Marshall specimen of the Emulsion/
21



======================================================================
PAGE 32 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:37-2012
Foamed Bitumen treated
material has a minimum value of 100 kPa
in wet condition and
225 kPa in dry condition under a rate of loading of 50 mm/minute (59) at 25°C. Poisson's ratio
is recommended as 0.35. Mix design and test methods are given in Annex IX.
7.4
Bituminous Layers
i/A/i
The recommended
resilient modulus
values
of the
bituminous
materials
with
different binders are given
in Table 7.1. These are based on extensive laboratory testing
modern testing equipments following ASTM Test procedures. The tests carried out were
"Indirect "Tensile Teste" (ASTM: D7369-09) (12) and "Standard Test Method for Determining
Fatigue Failure of Compacted Asphalt Concrete Subjected to Repeated Flexural Bending"
(ASTM: D7460-10) (13), a 'Four Point Bending Test' at 10 Hz frequency
in constant strain
mode. A loading pulse of 0.1 second followed by a rest period of 0.9 second were adopted
for Indirect Tensile Test.
It can be seen that modulus of mixes with modified binders do not
necessarily give a higher resilient modulus at 35°C despite their apparent advantages
in
terms of higher viscosity at higher temperatures, higher softening point and lower penetration.
Some modified binders tested give almost the same M R as that with VG 30 bitumen. These
findings are in agreement with those given
in some other literature as well, e.g., Monismith
et al (20), AUSTROADS and others. The guidelines, therefore recommend that the modulus
values of mixes with modified binder should be determined from
Indirect Tensile Strength
or four point bending tests and used
in design because the modulus values of these
will
vary greatly depending upon the base bitumen, modifiers and their dosage. Notwithstanding
lower modulus values, the modified mixes are known to give improved fatigue lives.
7.4.2
Higher viscosity of bituminous binders, which can be achieved either by using higher
viscosity grade bitumen or modified bitumen will improve both fatigue and rutting behaviour
of mixes as compared to mixes with normal bitumen (20, 38, 42 and 69). Fatigue life can be
further improved by reducing the air voids and increasing the volume of binder (both modified
and unmodified). Low air voids and higher bitumen content may, however, induce bleeding
and rutting, the chances of which are minimized
if higher viscosity binder is used in the mix.
These guidelines, therefore, recommend that these factors should be taken
into account
while designing bituminous mixes.
The
Poisson's
ratio
of bituminous
layer depend
upon
the pavement temperature and
a value of 0.35
is recommended for temperature up to 35°C and value of 0.50 for higher
temperatures. Stress computation
is not very sensitive to minor changes
in Poisson's ratio.
Fatigue equation
at any pavement temperature from 20°C to 40°C can be evaluated by
substituting the appropriate value of the resilient modulus of the bituminous mix, air void and
volume of bitumen. Catalogue of designs has been worked out for a temperature of 35°C.
It is noted that the bituminous mixes harden with time and modulus may increase to higher
values in upper layers due to ageing than what is given
in the Table 7.1. Deterioration also
occurs due to heavily loaded vehicles. Hence field performance is to be periodically recorded
for future guidance. Annex VII gives various considerations for the selection of binders and
mixes in the light of Indian and international experience.

8 PERPETUAL PAVEMENT
The pavement having a
life of 50 years or longer is termed as a perpetual pavement.
If the
tensile strain caused by the traffic in the bituminous layer is less than 70 micro strains, the
endurance limit of the material, the bituminous layer never cracks (Asphalt Institute, MS-4,
7th edition 2007). Similarly
if vertical subgrade strain
is less than 200 micro strains, there
will be
little rutting
in subgrade. Design of such a pavement
is illustrated
in the guidelines.
Different layers are so designed and constructed that only the surface layer is the sacrificial
layer which
is to be scrapped and replaced with a new layer from time to time. There is now
enough evidence worldwide that deep strength bituminous pavements suffer damage only at
the top and nowhere else.
9 PAVEMENT DESIGN PROCEDURE
9.1
Using IITPAVE
Any combination of traffic and pavement layer composition can be tried using IITPAVE. The
designer will have
full freedom
in the choice of pavement materials and layer thickness.
The traffic volume, number of layers, the layer thickness of individual layers and the layer
properties are the user specified inputs in the Program, which gives strains at critical locations
as outputs. The adequacy of design is checked by the Program by comparing these strains with
the allowable strains as predicted by the fatigue and rutting models. A satisfactory pavement
design is achieved through iterative process by varying layer thicknesses or,
if necessary, by
23



======================================================================
PAGE 34 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:37-2012
changing the pavement layer materials. (See Section 13 for outline of procedures for using
IITPAVE and Annex
II for worked-out examples)
9.2
Using Design Catalogues
These Guidelines provide a Design catalogue giving pavement compositions for various
combinations of traffic, layer configuration and assumed material properties.
If the designer
chooses to use any of these combinations and is satisfied that the layer properties assumed
in the design catalogue can be achieved
in the field, the design can be straightway adopted
from the relevant design charts given in the catalogue. (See Section 10 for details)
9.3
Material Properties
Regardless of the design procedure,
it
is essential that the material properties are adopted
only after conducting relevant tests on the materials. Where all test facilities are not available,
at least those tests must be carried out, which can validate the assumed design properties. In
Table X-2 the type of tests required as well as the range of values for material properties are
given based on typical testing and experience
in other countries. The values as suggested
may be adopted for pavement design as default but not without validation by subjecting the
materials to such tests which can be easily carried out
in any laboratory (e.g. Unconfined
Compressive Strength) to validate the assumed design values.
10 PAVEMENT DESIGN CATALOGUES
Five different combinations of traffic and material properties have been considered for which
pavement composition has been suggested in the form of design charts presented in Plates
1
to 24. Each combination has been supported with
illustration to compare the proposed
design thickness in the design catalogue with that given by IITPAVE (Clauses 10.1 to 10.5).
The five combinations are as under:

(2)
Cementitious Base and Cementitious Subbase with aggregate
interlayer

base and subbase and the subgrade. The granular layers are treated as a single layer. Strain
and stresses are required only for three layer elastic system. The critical strains locations are
shown in the figure. For traffic > 30 msa, VG 40 bitumen is recommended for BC as well as DBM
for plains in India. Thickness of DBM for 50 msa is lower than that for 30 msa for a few cases due
to stiffer bitumen. Lower DBM is compacted to an air void of 3 per cent after rolling with volume
of bitumen close to 13 per cent (Bitumen content may be 0.5 per cent to 0.6 per cent higher
than the optimum). Thickness combinations up to 30 msa are the same as those adopted in
IRC: 37-2001. GSB consists of a separation/filter (F) in the bottom and a drainage layer (D)
having the gradation 4 of Table V-1
in Annex V. Coarse graded GSB of MORTH with fines
less than 2 per cent may also be used.

Fig. 10.2 shows a five layer elastic structure consisting of bituminous surfacing, aggregate
interlayer layer, cemented base, cemented subbase and the subgrade.
Material properties
such as modulus and poisson's ratio are the input parameters apart from loads and geometry
of the pavement for the IITPAVE software. For traffic > 30 msa, VG 40 bitumen
is used for
preventing
rutting. DBM has air void of 3 per cent after rolling (Bitumen content
is 0.5 per
cent to 0.6 per cent higher than the optimum). Cracking of cemented base
is taken as the
design
life of a pavement. For traffic greater than 30 msa, minimum thickness of bituminous
layer consisting of DBM and BC layers is taken as 100 mm (AASHTO-1993) even though the
thickness requirement may be less from structural consideration. Residual life of the bituminous
layer against fatigue cracking
is not considered since
it cracks faster after the fracture of the

.
Minimum thickness of 100 mm has been adopted even though there
is no tensile stress at
the bottom as per AAHSTO 93 Guidelines. The Pavement Composition is safe.The reduction
in thickness of the cemented base increases the bending stresses considerably because
it
is inversely proportional to the square of the thickness. Design should be checked against
fatigue damage.

Reclaimed asphalt pavement, cemented sub-base and the subgrade. VG 40 bitumen is used
for traffic > 30 msa. Even bitumen emulsion/foamed bitumen treated fresh aggregates can be
used to obtain stronger base of flexible pavements as per the international practice. DBM has
air void of 3 per cent after rolling (Bitumen content is 0.5 per cent to 0.6 per cent higher than
the optimum). Fatigue failure of the bituminous layer is the end of pavement
life. Cemented

In a two layer
construction of bituminous layer, the bottom layer should have an air void of 3 percent after
the compaction by incorporating additional bitumen of 0.5 to 0.6 per cent. This would also
resist stripping due to water percolating from the top to the bottom of the bituminous layer

relief layer should meet
the specifications of Wet Mix Macadam and
if required,
it may contain about
1 to 2 percent
bitumen emulsion
if the surface of the granular layer is likely to be disturbed by construction
traffic. Emulsion can be mixed with water to make the fluid equal to optimum water content and
added to the WMM during the processing. The granular sub-base should consist of drainage
(grading 4 of Annex V, Table V-1) as well as filter/separation layer. Upper 100 mm of GSB is
drainage layer having a permeability of 300 metre/day. A reliability of 80 per cent is used for

Other Pavement Compositions
There can be
large number of combinations
for a good pavement depending upon the
availability of materials. A strong subgrade and a strong subbase which are non-erodible
over a period of time due to pore water pressure are very important for a good performing
pavement. Use of cemented subbase of lower strength having strength from
1.5 MPa to
3 Mpa with thick bituminous layer is common in South Africa (66) in dry area.
In wet regions,
such low strength cemented subbases with granular layer and wearing course of bituminous
concrete
is used up to 30 msa. Though PLATES for combinations are not provided, two
examples are presented below
illustrating how to work out thickness of such pavements
with a cemented subbase, Wet Mix Macadam base and bituminous surfacing. NH-8 from
Ahmedabad to Jodhpur has cemented layer below the Wet Mix Macadam. Fig. 10.6 shows
a combination of bituminous pavements with WMM base and cemented granular subbase
with strength
1 .5 MPa to 3.0 MPa. Cement bound granular subbase Grading IV of IRC:SP-89
having strength
in the range 0.75-1 .5 MPa
is not recommended for major highways as per
South African practice but
it can be used for others
if the design traffic less than 10 msa.

11 INTERNAL DRAINAGE
IN PAVEMENT
11.1
The performance of a pavement can be seriously affected
if adequate drainage
measures to prevent accumulation of moisture in the pavement structure are not taken. Some
of the measures to guard against poor drainage conditions are maintenance of transverse
section in good shape to reasonable crossfall so as to facilitate quick run-off of surface water
and
provision of appropriate surface and sub-surface drains where necessary. Drainage
measures are especially important when the road is in cutting or built on low permeability soil
or situated in heavy rainfall/snow fall area.
11.2
On new roads, the aim should be to construct the pavement as far above the water
table as economically practicable. The difference between the bottom of subgrade level and
the level of water table/high flood level should, generally, not be less than 1.0 m or 0.6 m
in
case of existing roads which have no history of being overtopped.
In water logged areas,
where the subgrade is within the zone of capillary saturation, consideration should be given to
the installation of suitable capillary cut-off as per IRC:34 at appropriate level underneath the
pavement.
11.3
When the traditional granular construction is provided on a relatively low permeability
subgrade, the granular sub-base should be extended over the
entire formation width
in
order to drain the pavement structural section. Care should be exercised to ensure that
its
exposed ends do not get covered by the embankment soil. The trench type section should
not be adopted
in any case,
in absence of special drainage measures
it would lead to the
entrapment of water in the pavement structure.
11.4
If the granular sub-base
is of softer variety which may undergo crushing during
rolling leading to denser gradation and low permeability, the top 100 to 150 mm thickness
should be substituted by an open graded crushed stone layer of Los Angeles abrasion value
not exceeding 40 to ensure proper drainage.
The filter layer must have enough permeability to prevent development of undesirable pore
water pressure and
it should drain away any free water that enters into
it albeit at much lower
rate as compared to the drainage layer.
The filter/separation layer should satisfy the following criteria:

IRC:37-2012
The permeable sub-base when placed on the erodible subgrade soil should be underlain by
a layer of filter material to prevent the intrusion of soil fines into the drainage layer (Fig. 11.2).
Non-woven geosynthetic also can be provided to act as a filter/separation layer. Some typical
drainage system
is illustrated in Figs. 11.1, 11.2 and 11.3.

IRC:37-2012
11.5
When large inflows are to be taken care
of, an adequately designed sub-surface
drainage system consisting of an open graded drainage layer with collection and outlet pipes
should be provided. The system should be designed on a
rational basis using seepage
principles to estimate the inflow quantities and the outflow conductivity of the drainage system.
It should be ensured that the outflow capabilities of the system are at least equal to the total
inflow so that no free water accumulates in the pavement structural section.
If granular sub-
base is not required because of strong subgrade, commercially available geocomposite can
be used for drainage and separation. A design example is given in Annex V.
11.6
Very often, water enters the base, sub-base or the subgrade
at the junction of
the verges and the bituminous surfacing. To counteract the harmful effects of this water,
it
is recommended that the shoulders should be well-shaped and
if possible, constructed of
impermeable material. Major highways should have paved shoulder to keep away water from
the subgrade and for other roads also with design traffic of 20 msa or less; the base should
be constructed 300-450 mm wider than the required bituminous surfacing so that the run-off
water disperses harmlessly well clear off the main carriageway.
11.7
Shoulders should be accorded special attention during subsequent maintenance
operation
too. They should be dressed
periodically so that they always conform
to the
requisite cross-fall and are not higher than the level of carriageway at any time.
11.8
Drainage Requirement
Heavy axle loads commonly ply on major roads in India and therefore,
it should be ensured
that the unbound layers do not undergo unacceptable permanent deformation under repeated
loading. The subgrade and the granular layers with entrapped water would be subjected to
large pore water pressure under heavy loads causing erosion of the unbound
layer.
It
is
necessary to provide a drainage layer to drain away the water entering into the pavement.
The coarse graded
granular sub-base
(62) would
have
the
necessary
permeability
of
300 m/day with per cent fines passing 0.075 mm sieve less than 2 per cent. Laboratory test
should be conducted for the evaluation of the permeability of the drainage layer.
If the surface
of the open graded drainage layer is likely to be disturbed by the construction traffic the layer
may be treated with 2 per cent cement/2-2.5 per cent of bituminous emulsion without any
significant loss of permeability. Field test by Ridgeway in USA indicated that
it is the duration
of low intensity sustained rainfall rather than high intensity rainfall that is critical for infiltration
of water into the pavement.
It was found that the
infiltration
rate through the cracks was
0.223 m 3/day/m and this value can be used for design of drainage layer in the absence of
field data. The infiltration rate per unit area q, in m 3/day/m2 can be expressed as:
Wp
+ C sWp
+ K p

12 DESIGN
IN FROST AFFECTED AREAS
2
!
In areas susceptible to frost action, the design will have to be related to actual depth
of penetration and severity of the frost. At the subgrade level, fine grained clayey and silty
soils are more susceptible to ice formation, but freezing conditions could also develop within
the pavement structure
if water has a chance of ingress from above.
1 2.2
One remedy against frost attack is to increase the depth of construction to correspond
to the depth of frost penetration, but this may not always be economically practicable. As a
general rule,
it would be inadvisable to provide total thickness less than 450 mm even when
the CBR value of the subgrade warrants a smaller thickness.
In addition, the materials used
for building up the crust should be frost resistant.
1 2.3
Another precaution against frost attack is that water should not be allowed to collect
at the subgrade
level which may happen on account of infiltration through the pavement
surface or verges or due to capillary rise from a high water table. Whereas capillary rise can
be prevented by subsoil drainage measures and cut-offs,
infiltrating water can be checked
only by providing a suitable wearing surface.
13 SUMMARY OF PAVEMENT DESIGN PROCEDURE
|
AND USE OF IITPAVE SOFTWARE
The analysis and design of pavement may be carried out by the following approach:
A.
For traffic lower than 2 msa, recommendation of IRC:SP:72-2007 may be used.
B.
In case of higher traffic, IITPAVE software may be used.
It
is a multilayer elastic
layer analysis programme. This software
is included along
with the Pavement
46



======================================================================
PAGE 57 of 108
======================================================================
!RC:37-2012
Design Guidelines in a CD. Details and method of data inputs are self explanatory
CD. The necessary steps required to use this software are:
(i)
Open the folder IRC_37_IITPAVE.
(ii)
Double-click IITPAVE_EX
file
in
the IRC_37_IITPAVE
folder.
This
is an
executable jar file. A home screen will appear.
(iii)
From the Home screen user can manually give input through input window
by clicking on 'Design New Pavement Section'. User can also give
input
through properly formatted input file by clicking on 'Edit Existing File' option
then browsing and opening the input file.
(iv)
Next an
input window
will come. All the inputs required have to be given
through that input window.
(v)
First, number of layers to be selected from drop down menu to fix up input
boxes for different layer inputs.
(vi)
Next, Elastic modulus (E) values of the various layers in MPa, Poisson's ratio
and thickness of various layers in mm excluding the subgrade thickness are
to be provided.
(vii)
Single wheel load and the tyre pressure are to be provided (tyre pressure of
0.56 MPa has been used for calibration of the fatigue equation and the same
pressure can be used for stress analysis. Change of pressure even up to
0.80 MPa has a small effect upon stress values in lower layers.)
(viii)
Then the number of points for stress computations is to be given through the
drop down menu for analysis points.
(ix)
Then corresponding to different points, the values of depth Z in mm and the
corresponding value of radial distance from wheel centre (r) in mm are to be
given.
(x)
Provide whether analysis
is for single wheel
load
or dual wheel
load by
selecting
1 or 2 from drop down menu beside "Wheel Set". Only dual wheel
load may be needed in most cases.
(xi)
The output of the programme will provide stresses, strains and deflections
at the desired
points.
Next check
if the computed
strains are
less than
the permissible
strain.
If not then
run the program with a new thickness
combinations
till the permissible strain values are achieved. epT, epR and
epZ will be the outputs that will be of interest. For cemented base tensile
stress below the cemented layer SigmaT/SigmaR are needed for cumulative
fatigue damage analysis.

(xii)
In most cases the tensile
strain
at the bottom of the bituminous layer
is
higher in the longitudinal direction (epT) rather than in radial direction (epR).
If tensile strain
in the bituminous layer is high, increase the thickness of the
bituminous layer.
(xiii)
Tensile strains in the cementitious bases also are to be computed for design.
If the
tensile
strain/stress
in
the cemented
layer
is
higher,
increase the
thickness of the cemented layer.
(xiv)
Vertical subgrade
strain (epZ) should be
less than the permissible value
for the design
traffic.

ANNEX-I
(Refer Clause 6.2.2)
Considerations in Design of Bituminous Pavements
1-1
:
The IITPAVE software is capable of analyzing a multilayer layer elastic system with
rough interfaces. Vertical subgrade strain, Gv
,
is an index of bearing capacity of the subgrade
and
it needs to be kept below a certain value for a given traffic to limit rutting in the subgrade
and granular layers of a well constructed pavement. Research findings indicate that the
plastic vertical
strain, Gp,
in pavement materials depends upon the magnitude of elastic
vertical strain, Gv
, given as
Gp/G v = K x (N) c
... (1-1)
Where G
p and Gv are plastic and elastic strains respectively, N = number of repetition of axle
loads, K and c are constants
If the computed Gv on the subgrade for a given wheel load
is low, the vertical strain
in the
upper granular layers also is low. Hence limiting the subgrade strain controls the rutting in the
subgrade as well as in the granular layers. Bituminous layer must have a rut resistant mix.
The elastic tensile strains, G
t
, at the bottom and at the top of the bituminous layer should not
exceed a certain limit for a given design traffic to control development of cracks during the design
period. Surface crack may develop on either side of the wheel path as shown in Fig. 1-1. Tensile
stains near the edge of the tyres can be higher than that at the bottom and surface cracks may
develop much earlier than those at the bottom particularly at higher temperatures. Though a
number of cases of Top Down Cracking within a year or two of opening to traffic has been found
at many locations (39, 53 and 63)
in the BC and the DBM layers
in
India, surface bleeding
and rutting (49, 51 and 61) rather than surface cracking has been very common because of
secondary compaction owing to the softer bitumen for the climate and traffic.
Surface transverse surface cracks may also develop due to horizontal shear stresses applied
by wheels of heavy commercial vehicles during acceleration and braking
if the mix does not
have sufficient tensile strength. The surface cracks responsible for top down cracking shown
in Fig.
1-1 can be delayed by using high viscosity binder such as VG 40 or polymer/Crumb
rubber modified binder because of higher tensile strength
in the top layer of the bituminous
surfacing at higher temperatures. Low temperature transverse cracking associated with stiffer
binders
is not a problem
in plains of India. Bitumen of lower viscosity controls transverse
surface cracking
in colder regions as per international experience.
In the light of the above,
the approach discussed in the following is recommended for design of bituminous pavements.

i=2:
Rutting in Subgrade and Granular Layer
Large amount of field data for rutting in flexible pavements were collected and analyzed during
several research projects of MORTH; and a relationship between limiting surface rutting of
20 mm and the vertical
elastic subgrade strain was developed for different repetitions of
standard axle loads and
it was subsequently adopted in IRC:37-2001
. The bituminous layers
were not very thick
in
India
in eighties and
nineties when
rutting data was collected and
most of the rutting took place in the subgrade and the granular layers only. The equations for
rutting for 80 per cent and 90 per cent reliability respectively are given (46, 54) as
Equation
I-2 was used as the rutting
criterion
in IRC:37-2001
for controlling
rutting
in the
subgrade and granular layers, arid the rutting in the bituminous layer was to be taken care of
by selecting appropriate binder and mix design.
A more correct approach would be to estimate permanent deformation
in
different layers
by spectrum of axle loads adopted
in mechanistic-empirical pavement design method as
recommended in MEPDG (3) but this would require massive coordinated research effort in the
laboratory as well as in the field in different regions of the country so that laboratory equations
can be calibrated and validated from field performance. Data from other countries can not
directly be used due to different types of traffic and climate. Equation
I-2 having a reliability
of 80 per cent is based upon a good data base for limiting rutting
in granular layers and the
subgrade soils. Equation I-3 is recommended for 90 per cent reliability for high volume roads
with traffic greater than 30 msa. Providing large thickness of granular layer does not cause
any marked reduction
in the thickness of bituminous layer from fatigue considerations. The
thickness of the sub-base should be sufficient to stand the construction traffic and the granular
base also should be thick enough so as not to cause the damage to GSB. These factors
were considered
in developing the design charts of IRC:37-2001. Field performance data of
pavements designed as per IRC:37-2001
indicated unacceptable rutting
in the bituminous
layer rather than
in the granular layer within a year or two of construction of highways (49,
51 and 61) because of use of softer bitumen for the climate, higher temperatures and heavy
axle loads. This problem
is now addressed by the selection of high viscosity binder for the
bituminous mix in line with the European practice.
i-3:
Rutting in the Bituminous Layer
Fhic! ness of bituminous layers
in India for flexible pavements with granular bases can be
close to 200 mm or higher for heavy volume roads. The rutting
in the bituminous layer is to
be controlled by selecting a mix using binder of appropriate viscosity considering the traffic,
climate and field experience. Rut resistant mixes for high volume traffic with air temperatures
of 40°C and above can be obtained by using high viscosity binders. Laboratory
rut tests
using IITKGP RUT tester on mixes with VG 40 bitumen, and some modified binders indicated
N = 4.1656 x 10-08 [1/eJ 4.5337
N = 1.41x 10-88 x[1/g 4.5337

IRC:37-2012
almost equal performance
at 50°C. VG 30 bitumen gave much
higher
rutting
in the
rut
tester, a phenomenon observed in the field also though
it meets the superpave specification
requirement (5, 38) of 1 kPa for G*/sin 5 at 64°C using Dynamic Shear Rheometer. Analysis
by MEPDG model
(3) also predicted 50 per cent rut depth
in mixes with VG 40 bitumen
as compared to that with VG 30 (50). Even when modified bitumen
is used
in the wearing
course, the rutting may occur
in the DBM layer made with VG 30 just below the wearing
course (51). Hence a higher grade of binder
is recommended for the mix both for the BC
and the DBM layer below the wearing course under heavy traffic conditions for the maximum
air temperatures of 40°C and higher, very common on plains of India. Recommendation of
IRC: 111-2009 (29) for use of VG 40 bitumen in BC as well as DBM layer may be adopted
if
the pavement carries over 2000 commercial vehicles per day. Stone Matrix Asphalt (IRC: SP:
79-2008) (32) is another wearing course that is known to be rut as well as fatigue resistant.
Marshall Method of mix design is recommended for determination of optimum binder content.
1.4:
Fatigue Resistant Bituminous Layer
Laboratory tests and
field performance indicate
(3, 20, 27, 38 and 40) that fatigue
life of
a bituminous layer depends to a great extent on the bitumen content for a given
mix. A
bituminous layer with higher modulus develops lower tensile strain by a wheel load at the
bottom of the
layer. To ensure that the bottom Dense Bituminous Macadam has a higher
fatigue
life,
it should contain
higher bitumen
content. But softer grade bitumen such as
VG 30 may give an unstable mix with higher bitumen content
if exposed to construction
traffic. For a bituminous layer thickness of 1 50 mm and higher, the temperature of the bottom
DBM is lower than the top and there is little chance of rutting in the bottom layer
if the air void
is close to 3 per cent. Higher bitumen content in the bottom layer makes the mix resistant to
stripping and
it also provides a strong barrier for entry of moisture into the upper bituminous
layer (20). Computations further shows that the tensile strain in the wearing course near the
edge of the tyre can be even higher (3, 50 and 63) than that at the bottom of bituminous layer
particularly at higher temperatures and therefore, the wearing course also must be fatigue
resistant
in addition to being
rut resistant. Surface longitudinal cracking was also noticed
during Heavy Vehicle Simulator testing at the Central Road Research Institute also.
In a two
layer bituminous construction consisting of BC and DBM, VG 40 should be used for both the
layers with DBM having 0.5 per cent to 0.6 per cent higher bitumen content so that the air void
after the compaction
is close to 3 per cent. Mixes with Polymer and Crumb Rubber Modified
binders have fatigue lives which can be two to ten times higher than the normal mixes (38,
44 and 69) depending upon the binder content and designers can
utilize this property
in
designing high fatigue
life bituminous pavements after carrying out laboratory tests both on
normal and modified bituminous mixes for the evaluation of their relative fatigue lives.

in IRC: 37-2001. Equation
I-5 gives fatigue
life which
is about one
third of that given by Equation
I-4 for a given strain and modulus and the thickness of the
bituminous layer would be much higher for a given
traffic leading to very high cost. High
volume highways demand a reliability level of 90 per cent and higher. This practice is followed
in
all international guidelines to avoid frequent maintenance. Mix design
is the key factor to
enhance the fatigue life without any marked increase in thickness.
I-6:
Mix Design and Fatigue Life
The bitumen content of the DBM mixes used in major highways in India varies generally from
a minimum of 4 per cent to a maximum of about 5 per cent depending upon the gradation
and the specific gravity of the aggregates; and the recommended air void content range
is
3 to 6 per cent (62) with an average of air void content of about 4.5 per cent.
In a two layer
DBM, the fatigue life of bottom layer needs to be enhanced by increasing its bitumen content
so that the cracks do not propagate from the bottom during the design
life of the pavement.
Though softer bitumen can be used
in lower layers since the temperature may not be too
high below 100 mm depth, use of such bitumen would require thicker DBM layer because of
its lower modulus. Asphalt Institute (6), Shell (60) and MEPDG (3) have given equations for
determination of fatigue
life of bituminous mixtures for different values of volume of bitumen
(Vb ) and the air voids (Va ) and same basic approach was used to modify the calibrated fatigue
equations to obtain high fatigue mixes. The fatigue Equation
I-5 having a reliability level of
90 per cent
is modified to include the mix design variables such as air void and volume of
bitumen as given below,
Va = per cent volume of air void and Vb = per cent volume of bitumen
in a given volume of
bituminous mix.
If Va = 4.5 per cent and Vb =
1 1 .5 per cent (corresponding to bitumen content of approximately
4.5 per cent by weight of total mix), Equation
I-6
is reduced to Equation
I-5

IRC:37-2012
considering the mix design variable Va and Vb will have a reliability of 80 per cent. Effect of
bitumen content can thus be considered to determine the fatigue life of a bituminous mixture
in colder areas at 80 per cent reliability using VG 30 bitumen or softer bitumen depending
upon the climate as recommended
in IRC:1 11-2009.(29)
Equations I-4 and I-5 give fatigue lives for 20 per cent cracked area of the bituminous layer at
a reliability level of 80 and 90 per cent respectively at the end of the design period.
In other
words, only 10 per cent of the area may have 20 per cent cracks
if 90 per cent reliability
is
used for high volume highways. To avoid frequent maintenance, a reliability level of 90 per
cent
is recommended for highways having a design traffic exceeding 30 msa. Since most
places on plains of India have maximum air temperatures equal to 40°C or higher, VG 40
bitumen
is recommended for higher traffic and hardly any additional thickness of bituminous
layer other than what is specified as per IRC:37-2001 will be required
if the bottom bituminous
layer is made fatigue resistant by increasing the binder content by 0.5 per cent to 0.6 per cent
so that the air void
is around 3 per cent. Mix design exercise
is required to be done to get a
durable mix. The thickness requirement
is less when stiffer binder
is used. Mix design and
pavement design should be integrated to get an optimum design. Using the principle outlined
above, a pavement can be designed so that the bottom rich bituminous layer has a very long
fracture
life and only the wearing course
is subjected to distress such as surface cracks,
rutting, raveling, pot holes etc. due to traffic and ageing and
it would need replacement from
time to time. On a close examination of Equations I-6 and I-7,
it is found the Equation I-6 with
a reliability level of 90 per cent reduces very close to Equation
I-4
if air void of the bottom
DBM layer is 3 per cent and volume of bitumen
is about 13 per cent.
The modified fatigue equation having a 90 per cent reliability with air void around 3 per cent
and the volume of bitumen of about 13 per cent is given as
N
f = 2.021
* 10-04 x[1/£
t]
3 89 *[1/M R]
0 854
... (I-8)
Constants of Equations
1.4 and
1. 8 are almost same and hardly any additional thickness of
the bituminous layer
is needed for a better performing pavement using Equation
I-8. The
constant 2.021
of Equation
I-8 can be increased further by increasing volume of bitumen
by opening the grading and even 2 per cent air void
in deep bituminous layer has been
recommended (27) for long
life pavements.
Fig. I-2 illustrates the effect of mix design variables on fatigue life.
It can be seen that for a mix
modulus of 3000 MPa,
if Va
is decreased from 5 per cent, to 3 per cent and Vb
is increased
from 10 per cent to 13 per cent, the fatigue life at the tensile strain of 200E-04 increases from
1.00E + 07 to 5.00E + 07. Similarly, the fatigue
life of the mix with a modulus of 1700 MPa
increases from 1.7 E + 07 to 8.0E + 07 for identical change of mix variable. Mix design thus
plays a very important
role
in design
of bituminous pavements.
It can also be seen that
the fatigue
life
of the
softer mix (M R - 1700 MPa)
is
higher than
that
of the
stiffer mix
(M R = 3000 MP a ) but thickness also will be greater for the less stiff mix. Designers can develop
better thickness combinations than what are given in different PLATES using innovative design

Flexural Fatigue of Thin Wearing Course
When a thin wearing course of bituminous layer
is provided over a granular layer, there
is
compressive bending strain due to a wheel load at the bottom of the bituminous layer which
decreases with increasing thickness and becomes tensile with higher thickness as can be
seen from Fig. I-3. Only when thickness reaches to about 50 mm, there is reduction in tensile
strain with further increase in thickness of the bituminous layer.

in Table 7.1 were obtained by repeated bending
test as per ASTM D7460-10 (13) under constant strain mode at 10 Hz frequency. The elastic
modulus values for bituminous mixes were also obtained by Indirect Tensile strength test
method as per ASTM D7369-09 (12) with a loading time of 0.1 seconds and a rest period of
0.9 seconds and modulus values were comparable .These moduli were used
in calibration

Fatigue
behaviour
and
resilient
modulus
of
a
bituminous
material
depend
upon
its
temperature and
its variation within
it. Hourly temperature data for consecutive three years
were collected from Indian Meteorological Department for Mumbai, Guwahati, Hyderabad,
New Delhi, Chennai and Kharagpur and Average Annual Air Temperatures were computed
(54) respectively as 27.10°C, 23.87°C, 26.16°C, 24.53°C, 27.97°Cand 28.1 6°C. A number of
correlations have been developed relating Average Monthly Pavement Temperature (AMPT)
and Average Monthly Air Temperature (AMAT) (69, 19) as well as Average Annual Pavement
Temperature (AAPT) and Average Annual Air Temperature (AAAT) (18).
Equations given by Witczak and Brunton et al. are given as
AMPT(°C) = (1 .05 x AMAT (°C)) + 5.0 (Witczak)
.

AMPT(°C) = (1.15 x AMAT (°C)) + 3.17 (Brunton et al.)

In the absence of any co-ordinated study
in
India, the AAAT values for different locations
in India as mentioned above are substituted
in Equations
I-9 and 1-10 and Average Annual
Pavement Temperature comes to about 35°C recognizing that the above equations may not
be strictly valid for Indian conditions. Hence resilient modulus of bituminous layer at 35°C
has been considered
in the guidelines for pavement analysis. This needs updation through
a well coordinated pavement performance study in India. High summer temperatures dictate
selection of binder for the upper layers. Similar approach can be adopted for temperature of
the bituminous layer for pavement design in regions such as Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand,
Jammu and Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh.
1-10:
Design Charts
Based on the fatigue and
rutting equations, bituminous pavements can be designed
for
different subgrade modulus (CBR values). Design
is to be optimized considering different
options such as availability of aggregates, use of foamed bitumen/bitumen emulsion modified
reclaimed asphalt pavements, foamed bitumen/bitumen emulsion modified fresh aggregates,
cementitious base and cementitious sub-base. Reclaimed Asphalt Pavements (RAP) contains
best quality aggregates and their use in GSB amounts to its under-utilization. The top 40 mm
to 50 mm of the bituminous layer would suffer damage due to traffic and weathering and
it

would require renewal from time to lime,
! lot recycling cam be an alternative to conserve the
materials. Since every region
is unique from the consideration of traffic, cost and availability
of materials, engineers have to develop pavement design to suit the region since the IRC-37
guidelines do not constitute a rigid standard, and sound engineering judgment based on local
environment and pavement performance in the region is needed in developing a good design.
In case of heavy rainfall area, proper internal drainage also should be provided to increase
the pavement
life. Local experience should be made use of while selecting the pavement
layers. A few examples of pavement designs are illustrated for different subgrade modulus
values corresponding to CBR of 3 per cent to 15 per cent and design traffic ranging from
2 msa to
1 50 msa. Examples are also given for (a) a pavement having a design life of 300 msa
and (b) a perpetual pavement in the light of international experience. For design traffic less
than 2 msa, IRC:SP:72-2007 (35) would be applicable. City streets should be designed for
the minimum design traffic of 2 msa because of frequent heavily loaded construction traffic.
Beyond the subgrade CBR of 10 per cent, pavement thickness
is affected only marginally.
Temperature effect is taken care of by assigning appropriate value of resilient modulus to the
bituminous layer depending upon the AAPT. 35°C is the most appropriate AAPT for plains of
India (54).

fracture of the

like cemented base due to higher axle loads using cumulative
damage principle. One tandem axle
is taken as two single axles and one tridem axle is taken
as three axles carrying equal weight since the interference of stresses at the cemented base

It can be seen that total fatigue damage is greater than
1
. Hence the pavement is unsafe and
cemented layer will crack prematurely.
It can also be noticed that the Tandem axle weighing
400 kN causes maximum fatigue damage followed by Tandem axle of 380 kN.
It can also be
seen that stress variation
is linear due to linear stress analysis.
If the load
is halved, stress
also is halved.
If the heavy axle loads are not allowed, the pavement would be safe.
If the cemented layer
thickness is increased from 1 20 mm to 1 60 mm Cumulative Fatigue Damage (CFD) is computed
as 0.92 and for 165 mm CFD is 0.89 cumulative fatigue damage is and hence the pavement is
safe.
If the modulus of rupture is
1 .20 MPa, a thickness of 220 mm is needed. Such checks are
to be made on cemented layer because of heavy loading over the highways in India.

Checks must be done for cumulative fatigue damage as explained in the previous example.
The upper 100 mm of the cemented sub-base should be open graded so that its permeability
is about 300 mm/day or higher for quick removal of water entering from the surface in high

The upper 100 mm of the cemented/granular sub-base should be open graded so that
its
permeability
is about 300 mm/day or higher for quick removal of water entering from the
surface.
Design of Flexible Pavement for 300 msa of Traffic
Many highways have heavy volume of traffic and the design traffic at the end of concession
period can be as high as 300 msa.
If the pavement design and mix design are integrated, only
the top wearing course of 40 mm to 50 mm suffer damaged by the traffic and ageing. Low life
cycle cost may justify use of thicker bituminous layer in which only the top 40 mm to 50 mm
is milled and replaced with a fresh bituminous wearing course or a hot in-situ recycled mix to
remove the cracked and deformed spots and restore the riding quality. The design has to be
done for 90 per cent reliability to eliminate frequent interruption for repair.
Assumed Design Parameters
Resilient modulus of subgrade = 75 MPa (corresponding
to
Effective subgrade CBR of
10 per cent).
Thickness of Granular Sub-base = 350 mm for separation and drainage

Lower 200 mm of GSB
is close graded (MORTH) to act as separation layer and the top
150 mm GSB
is an open graded granular material treated with 1.5 to 2 per cent bitumen
emulsion to have a permeability of 300 m/day or higher to act as a drainage layer.
Its Los
Angele's abrasion value must be less than 40 to avoid crushing during rolling.
Bituminous layer must be bottom
rich, that
is, the bottom layer should have an air-void of
3 per cent after the compaction by traffic. This
is achieved by having additional bitumen of
0.5 to 0.6 per cent higher than the optimum bitumen content. This can be established from
the laboratory tests and a field trail. The bitumen should be of grade VG 40 for the plains in
India to control rutting, where temperatures are much higher. In case of non-availability of VG
40 bitumen, PMB/CRIvlB has to be used to obtain rut resistant mixes.
Resilient Modulus of Bituminous layer = 3000 MPa (As per IRC: 37)
Thickness of the Pavement is Worked out as:
Thickness of the bituminous layer = 225 mm.
Thickness of Granular Sub-base = 350 mm.
Strains in different layers for a design traffic of 300 msa,
Allowable tensile strain in the bitumen rich bottom bituminous layer =131 uG
Allowable vertical subgrade strain = 250 uG. (Computed maximum vertical subgrade strain
= 239 uC).
Perpetual Pavements
The pavements which have a
life of 50 years or longer are termed as perpetual pavements.
If the tensile strain caused by the traffic
in the bituminous layer
is less than 70 micro strains,
the endurance limit of the material, the bituminous layer never cracks (Asphalt Institute, MS-4,
7th edition 2007).
Similarly
if vertical subgrade strain
is less than 200 micro
strain,
rutting
in
subgrade will be negligible (Fig. 11-1). Design of such a pavement is illustrated in the guideline.
(Computed maximum tensile strain = 125 uG).

180 mm DBM with VG 30
180 x (1700/3000)° 333 = 150 mm DBM with VG 40 bitumen
Though bending behaviour may be comparable, rutting in the bituminous layer will be reduced
with stiffer bitumen. Analysis indicates that rutting of mixes with VG 40 bitumen
is half of that
with VG 30 bitumen.

Preparation of Laboratory Test Specimens for CBR Test and Selection of Subgrade
CBR for Pavement Design
Sample Preparation
(1)
Wherever possible, the test specimens should be prepared by static compaction,
but
if not possible, dynamic method may be used as an alternative.
Static Compaction
(2)
The weight of wet soil at the required moisture content to give the intended density
when occupying the standard test mould
is calculated as follows:
Volume of mould = 2209 cc
Weight of dry soil = 2209 d gm
Where,
Weight of the Wet Soil =
^1Q° +
x 2209 d gm
y
100
d = Required dry density in gm/cc
m = Required moisture content in per cent.
(3)
The
soil lumps are broken down and stones
larger than 20 mm are removed.
Sufficient quantity of the
soil
is mixed with water to give the required moisture
content. The correct weight of wet soil
is placed
in the mould. After initial tamping
with a steel rod, a
filter paper
is placed on top of the soil, followed by the 50 mm
displacer disc, and the specimen compressed in the compression machine until the
top of the displacer is flush with the top of the collar. The load
is held for about 30
seconds and then released.
In some soil types where a certain amount of rebound
occurs,
it may be necessary to reapply load to force the displacer disc slightly below
the top of the mould so that on rebound the right volume is obtained.
Dynamic Compaction
(4)
The
soil
is mixed
with water
to
give
the
required
moisture
content, and then
compacted
into the mould
in three
layers using a standard
soil rammer. After
compaction, the soil
is trimmed flush with the top of the mould with the help of a
metal straight edge. The mould
is weighed full and empty to enable determination
of wet bulk density, and from
it, knowing the moisture content, the dry density
is
calculated.
(5)
Further specimens, at the same moisture content, are then prepared to different dry
densities by varying the number of blows applied to each layer of soil so that the
amount of compaction that will
fill the mould uniformly with calculated weight of wet
soil (vide para 2 above) is known.

Selection of Subgrade CBR for Pavement Design
The CBR values of the subgrade soil varies along a highway alignment even on a homogeneous
section. 90th percentile CBR
is recommended
in the guidelines. Method of determination of
the 90th percentile
is given below The following example illustrates the procedure for finding
the design.
16 CBR values for a highway alignment are as follows:
3.5, 5.2, 8.0, 6.8, 8.8, 4.2, 6.4, 4.6, 9.0, 5.7, 8.4, 8.2, 7.3, 8.6, 8.9, 7.6
Arrange the above 16 values in ascending order
3.5, 4.2, 4.6, 5.2, 5.7, 6.4, 6.8, 7.3, 7.6, 8.0, 8.2, 8.4, 8.6, 8.8, 8.9, 9.0
Now calculate the percentage greater than equal to each of the values as follows:
For CBR of 3.5, percentage of values greater than equal to 3.5 = (16/16) * 100 = 100
For CBR of 4.2, percentage of values greater than equal to 4.2 = (1 5/1 6) *
1 00 = 93.75 and
so on.
Now a plot is made between percentages of values greater than equal and the CBR values
versus the CBR as follows.

and the same procedure followed.
Special Points Relating to Design of Pavement on Expansive Soils
Potentially expansive
soils, such as, black cotton
soils are montmorillonite clays and are
characterised by their extreme hardness and deep cracks when dry and with tendency for
heaving during the process of wetting. Roadbeds made up of such soils when subjected
to changes
in moisture content due to seasonal wetting and drying or due to any other
reason undergo volumetric changes leading to pavement distortion, cracking and general
unevenness.
In semi-arid climatic conditions, pronounced short wet and long dry conditions
occur, which aggravate the problem of swelling and shrinkage. Due recognition of these
problems at the design stage
itself
is required so that counter measures could be devised
and
incorporated
in the pavement structure. A proper design
incorporating the following
measures may considerably minimise the problems associated with expansive soils.
The amount of volume change that occurs when an expansive soil road bed
is exposed to
additional moisture depends on the following:
(a)
The dry density of the compacted soil.
(b)
The moisture content.
(c)
Structure of soil and method of compaction.
Expansive soils swell very little when compacted at low densities and high moisture but swell
greatly when compacted at high densities and low moisture. Hence, where the probability
of moisture variation
in the subgrade
is high,
it
is expedient to compact the soil slightly wet
of the field optimum moisture content (+2 per cent) determined on the basis of a field
trial.
Experience shows that generally,
it
is not practicable to compact expansive soils at OMC
determined by Laboratory Proctor Test.
It
is, therefore, necessary to study
its field moisture
density relationship through compacting the
soil at different moisture contents and under
the same number of roller passes. A minimum density corresponding to 95 per cent of the
standard proctor density should be attained
in the field and recommended moisture content
should be 1-2 per cent wet of optimum moisture content.
Buffer Layer
There
is a
definite gain
in
placing the pavement on
a non-expansive impermeable
soil
cushion of 0.6-1 .0 m thickness.
It prevents ingress of water in the underlying expansive soil
layer, counteracts swelling and secondly even
if the underlying expansive soil heaves, the
movement will be more uniform and consequently more tolerable. However, where provision
of non-expansive
buffer layer
is
not economically feasible,
a
blanket course
of suitable
impermeable material and thickness as discussed below must be provided.
68



======================================================================
PAGE 79 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:37-2012
Blanket Course
An impermeable blanket course of at least 225 mm thickness and composed of coarse/
medium sand or non-plastic moorum having
PI less than five should be provided on the
expansive soil subgrade as a sub-base to serve as an effective intrusion barrier.
It must have
very low permeability. The blanket course should extend over the entire formation width.
Alternatively, lime-stabilised black cotton sub-base extending over the entire formation width
may be provided together with measures for efficient drainage of the pavement section.

Drainage Layer
Improvement of drainage can significantly reduce the magnitude of seasonal heave. Special
attention should, therefore, be given to provision of good drainage measures. The desirable
requirements are:
(a)
Provision must be made for the lateral drainage of the pavement structural
section. The granular sub-base/base should accordingly be extended across
the shoulders
(b)
No standing water should be allowed on either side of the road embankment.
(c)
A minimum height of
1 m (or 0.6 m
in case of existing road having no history
of being overtopped) between the subgrade level and the highest water level
should be ensured.
Example of Design of a Drainage Layer
Design a granular drainage layer for a four lane heavy duty divided highway for an annual
precipitation of 1200 mm. Longitudinal slope = 3 per cent, Camber = 2.5 per cent.

is doubled, the permeability requirement is half.
For major highways
in which thick bituminous layer are provided, very
little water
can enter in the initial period of four to five years due to absence of cracking. Rain
water may however enter through the pervious median
if not designed properly. The

ANNEX-VI
(Refer Clause 5.3)
Recommendation for Bituminous Wearing Courses for Flexible Pavements
VI-1:
India
is a large country with vastly different climate
in different areas and regional
agencies have developed specifications suited to the local conditions.
In wet climate, the
wearing course has to be impermeable to prevent entry of water to lower layers.
VI-2:
It
is the long duration low intensity
rainfall that damages the road rather than a
low duration heavy downpour which drains away fast. High annual rainfall
is not always the
indicator of the wet weather damage though extensive damage may occur by water ponding.
Even areas having rainfall less than 1000 mm suffer extensive damage during the rain when
the bituminous surface is porous, and surface and sub-surface drainage does not drain away
the water fast.
VI-3:
Pavements with granular bases and sub-bases having a design
traffic of 5 msa
or higher have a minimum thickness of 50 mm of DBM with a good quality wearing course
of SDBC or BC. Properly designed mixes of DBM and SDBC/BC having an air void content
of about 4 per cent after the compaction by traffic are practically impermeable. They are
expected to prevent entry of water into the lower layers even in high rainfall area
if shoulders
are protected and lateral entry of water from high ground
is prevented. All care is to be taken
to see that ravelling
is avoided by ensuring good bond between aggregates and bitumen by
using lime or anti-stripping compound particularly in wet area.
VI-4:
The wearing course of premix carpet and seal coat has given mixed performance
in built-up area because of poor drainage while
it has performed reasonably well on well
drained roads in rural area having a rainfall around 1500 mm. Applying seal coat is a manual
operation and has to be done very carefully for proper sealing. Mixed Seal surfacing
is the
preferred alternative by most field engineers in Eastern India having a heavier rainfall because
of better sealing property.
VI-5:
Roads in high rainfall area are expected to have adequate provision for subsurface
drainage as laid down in the guidelines so that the bituminous wearing course is not damaged
due to stored water in the lower layers.
VI-6:
Thickness charts in the guidelines with BC and SDBC wearing courses are valid for
all rainfall area
VI-7:
Two coat surface dressing has been used with success
in South Africa (22) with
traffic up to 5 msa even
in wet region. The bitumen film
in surface dressing
is thick and
makes the pavement completely impervious to ingress of water. Thick film does not undergo
fatigue cracking also.
In wet area such as North-East where clear days are fewer, bitumen
emulsion can be used since the aggregates need not be dry and even windy conditions will
help
in evaporation of water from the emulsion and necessary bond
is created among the
aggregates used in the surface dressing.
72



======================================================================
PAGE 83 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:37-2012
VI-8:
Bituminous wearing course laid over Water Bound Macadam (WBM) has performed
very well
in South Africa. WBM bases consist of a coarse single-sized aggregates together
with fines added during the construction to
fill the voids. Such bases are recommended by
South Africa (66) for pavements carrying heavy traffic under wet weather condition. Tests in
South Africa by Heavy Vehicle Simulator (48) found that WBM resists deformation better than
the crushed stone base courses even under wet condition because of good interlocking of
larger aggregate size of WBM. The work is labour intensive, but
it can be one of the options
in areas where there is serious problem with construction equipment.

ANNEX-VII
(Refer Clause 7.4.2)
Selection of Grade of Binders and Mixes for Bituminous Courses
VIM:
IRC: 111-2009 (29) recommends VG-40 bitumen
if commercial vehicle exceeds 2000
per lane per day. Mix design, selection of grade of bitumen, gradation of aggregates and traffic
loading are interrelated as explained in the guidelines. Local experience is the best guide.
VII-2:
The British practice (23) is to use high modulus bases having bitumen of 50 penetration
which allows 10-15 per cent reduction in thickness for equivalent performance or an extended
life for the same thickness.
It is to be noted that the summer temperatures are much lower in
UK and other European countries where harder grade of bitumen (15, 25, 35 penetration) also
is used
in bases for very heavily trafficked highways. The filler content in DBM
in UK (grading
is same as that of IRC: 111-2009) (29) is increased from 2-9 per cent to 7-11 per cent in high
modulus mixes and the resulting high modulus mix
is designated as Heavy-duty Macadam
(HDM). Higher filler content stiffens the HDM mix increasing
its load spreading capacity.
VII-3:
SUPERPAVE Mix design recommends binder which is one grade higher than required
from temperature consideration
for heavy
traffic.
For signalized
intersection, two grades
higher binder is recommended.
If the most suitable binder is VG 30 for 450 to 1500 CVPD,
VG 40 should be selected for higher volume of commercial vehicles. For areas on intersection
and traffic signals, mixes like SMA and those with VG 40/polymer or crumb rubber modified
bitumen would be suitable.
VII-4:
Research Scheme R-55 of MORTH
(55), Use of Rubber and Polymer Modified
Bitumen in Bituminous Road Construction) by Central Road Research Institute indicates that
wearing course of polymer and rubber modified bituminous mixes have longer lives and the
intervals of resurfacing can be increased by two to three years than the bituminous mixes
with normal bitumen. This could result in savings though initial cost may be marginally higher.
The layer of DBM below the wearing course should have stiffer binder such as VG 40 for
highway of heavy traffic where air temperature may be 40°C or higher in summer.

Resilient Modulus of Granular Materials
The guidelines for the resilient modulus of granular materials over subgrade recommend use
of widely used Shell's equation given by Equation 7.1, which somewhat gives a conservative
value. There
is now increasing trend of using a more scientific approach for determination
of resilient modulus, M Rgm
, by triaxail test since
it is dependent upon the sum of the principal
stresses as well as the octahedral stress as given below (14).

ANNEX-IX
(Refer Clause 3.1)
Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement and Mix Design
Recycling
of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavements (RAP)
is
required
to be used
for technical,
economical, and environmental reasons. Use of RAP has been favoured all over the world over
virgin materials in the light of the increasing cost of bitumen, the scarcity of quality aggregates,
and the pressing need to preserve the environment. The use of RAP also decreases the
amount of waste produced and helps to resolve the disposal problems of highway construction
materials. Reclaimed Asphalt Pavements contain best quality aggregates and they can be
effectively improved with foamed asphalt/bitumen emulsion along with fresh aggregates and
crusher dust to impart necessary strength for a durable pavements.
If only the surface layer
is weathered or damaged, hot recycling can be an attractive proposition.
Several recycling techniques, such as hot mix plant recycling, hot in-place recycling, cold
mix plant recycling, cold in-place recycling, and
full depth reclamation, have evolved over
the past 35 years.
In-place recycling not only reduces the use of new materials but also
reduces emissions, traffic, and energy associated with the transport and production of these
materials.
Hoi Mix Recycling
is the most common method of recycling asphalt pavements in developed
countries.
It involves combining RAP with new or "virgin" aggregate, new asphalt binder, and
recycling agents
in a central hot mix plant to produce a recycled mix. The amount of RAP
allowed
in a recycled mix and guidelines as to where the recycled mix can be used
in the
pavement structure varies from agencies to agencies
. Some routinely allow 15 per cent or
less RAP while others permit larger amounts of RAP. Higher RAP concentrations require
adjustments in mix design and binder selection. Agency's recommendations and international
guidelines such as those given by Asphalt Institutes may be used
in different trials because
of lack of experience in India.
Cold Mix Recycling
is a method of recycling where RAP, new aggregate
(if needed), and
emulsified bitumen or foamed bitumen without the need for heat are mixed
in a centrally
located cold mix plant. Many old road alignment having thick bituminous layers are being
abandoned in four and six laning projects and the entire RAP and aggregates can be salvaged
by milling machine and reused
in new construction. Even cement treated aggregates have
been milled and reused in South Africa and China. Since the components of a cold mix plant
are fairly portable,
it can be assembled
in
satellite locations close to a project
site. Cold
recycled mix
is hauled to the job site with conventional dump trucks or belly dump trucks.
Placement and compaction
of cold recycled mixes are done with the same conventional
pavers and rollers used for hot mix asphalt construction. Cold recycled mixes are normally
overlaid with hot mix asphalt or surface dressing (chip seal) depending on the anticipated
traffic level for the finished pavement.

======================================================================
PAGE 87 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:37-2012
Cold recycling (21 ) also involves rehabilitation of the existing asphalt or granular road surface.
The existing surface is pulverized and the material
is mixed on the site with foamed bitumen
or Bitumen emulsion. The process of in-situ recycling of distressed pavement using cold-
mix technology
is referred to as cold in-place recycling(CIPR). CIPR thus
is a pavement
rehabilitation measure that typically consists of the following operations, often all are carried
out in one-pass of a recycling machine and badly distresses pavement is transformed into a
stronger nice looking pavement
(1 )
Milling the existing pavement layers upto a depth of 300 mm;
(2)
Treatment with bitumen emulsion or foamed bitumen, often
in combination
with
addition
of crusher
dust,
fresh aggregates
if required, and a
small
percentage of active filler such as cement;
(3)
Adding compaction water; and
(4)
Repaving the mix.
(5)
Compaction
In a CIPR process as described above, the top bituminous layer (Reclaimed asphalt pavement)
as well as a part or whole of the granular or stabilised base layer are recycled. The residual
binder content added to the mineral aggregates
in the process of CIPR
is generally lower
(<4 per cent) in comparison to hot bituminous mixtures. The recycled product is not used as
final surfacing layer but used as base or sub-base layer. CIPR is an attractive alternative for
highway rehabilitation operations because of its economic and environmental advantages.
Major economic advantages involve the recycling of existing road surface aggregates and
reduced haul requirements for incorporating new aggregates. In India, there are many regions
where aggregates resources are limited or will be depleted
in the near future. Aggregate
haul
in these regions
is quite expensive. By recycling existing in-place road materials and
providing
additional strength with mixing
of different emulsions or strengthening agents,
new aggregates and bitumen requirements are reduced.
In addition, impacts on adjacent
haul roads are minimised or eliminated because of reduced new aggregate requirements. A
major environmental advantage involved in the use of cold in-place recycling
is that there is
no requirement for heat during construction work. CIPR
is an energy efficient process that
does not produce harmful emissions and does not require the bituminous mixtures to be
transported to an off-site plant.
In addition, transportation of large amounts of aggregate are
reduced and hence
it is fuel efficient also.
Design for Bitumen Emulsion RAP Mixes
Gradations of Aggregates
The aggregates from RAP may not have the required gradation for a good mix. RAP alone
has poor internal
friction and
its CBR may be as low as 30 though a fresh close graded
aggregates may have CBR as high as 200. Addition of crusher dust containing particle size
from 6 mm to 0.075 mm and fines passing 0.075 mm adds to angle of internal friction as well
77



======================================================================
PAGE 88 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:37-2012
as some cohesion to the RAP mixes. The crusher dust requirement can be 15 to 30 per cent
and
1 per cent cement or lime or both by weight of dry aggregates helps in dispersion of the
bitumen emulsion
in the mix. Lime modifies the clay that may have contaminated the RAP
may need re-crushing
if they have lumped up during storage.
If milled aggregates are from
those of Bituminous Macadam,
it may be open graded and some additional fresh aggregates
may be necessary for the adjustment of gradation. The grading of the blend of RAP/fresh
aggregates and crusher dust should meet the requirement shown in Table IX-1 adopted from
the South African Standard TG2 (64) CSIR
Built Environment,
Pretoria. The grading has
been slightly adjusted to correspond to the sieve size designation in MORTH.

Some RAP may be contaminated with clay which might have risen from the subgrade during
the wet weather. Addition of 2 per cent lime would modify the clay and the mix becomes
suitable for use.
Bitumen Emulsion Type
Since the blend of RAP and crusher dust consists of plenty of fine particles, only slow setting
emulsion (SS2) with minimum residual bitumen content of 60 per cent
is recommended to
prevent the emulsion from breaking during the mixing and construction.
Determination of Optimum Fluid Content
A RAP bitumen emulsion mix can be compacted to maximum density only at optimum fluid
content. Compaction tests are to be done at different fluid content to arrive at the optimum
I
fluid content. Procedures given
in Manual 14 The design and Use of Granular Emulsion

South Africa (64) have been suggested for mix design. Users may adopt other methods of
mix design given
in 'Cold Mix Recycling' and 'Asphalt cold Mix Manual (MS-14)' Published
by Asphalt Institute, USA.
Step
1 Prepare a 50:50 blend of bitumen emulsion and water by volume. Water is added to
bitumen emulsion and not the emulsion to water for dilution to prevent premature breaking.
Compatibility for dilution may be checked.
Step 2 Actual water content of the blend of RAP, crusher dust and filler may be determined
by oven drying and fluid increment of
1 per cent by weight of the blend may be added and
thoroughly mixed .The mix is transferred to a standard 100 mm diameter Marshall mould and
compacted by 75 blows on each face at ambient temperature. A minimum of three samples
are cast at each fluid content.
Step 3 Dry density should be computed at each fluid content as per the following:
D dd =
D bulk
... IX-1
1 + FC
Where D dd = Dry density
in kg/m 3
, D bU
| k = Bulk density in kg/m 3
, FC = Fluid content by dry
weight of aggregates in decimal.
A plot is made for dry density vs. fluid content as shown below and maximum dry density and
the corresponding optimum fluid content is determined. Optimum fluid content is necessary
for the compaction of the RAP mixes to the maximum density.

Step 4 Marshall samples are prepared at different emulsion content starting from 3 per cent
to 4 per cent by weight of the total mix in increment of 0.5 per cent. Additional water is added
first and mixed then the bitumen emulsion
is added and mixed again. The total fluid
is close
to the optimum. The sample is compacted in a Marshall mould by applying 75 blows on each
face. Six samples are prepared at each fluid content.

Step 5 The samples should be left in the mould for 24 hours and then placed in an oven for
72 hours at 40°C for curing after the extraction. The sample should be kept on a tray. Most of
the moisture will be lost through evaporation.
Step 6 Laboratory tests: Indirect tensile strength tests are to be carried out on dry samples
in a standard Marshall loading frame which applies load at rate of nearly 50 mm per minute
(50.8 mm per minute) and the maximum load is determined at 25°C. Three samples are also
tested at 25°C after 24 hours of soaking
in water

Design of Foamed Bitumen RAP Mixes
Foamed bitumen
is produced by injecting water into hot bitumen resulting
in instantaneous
foaming. The injected water turns into steam which
is enclosed by finely divided bitumen
bubbles. The foamed bitumen
is injected into the cold RAP mixes or even fresh aggregates
containing optimum amount of moisture for compaction. Such operation is highly specialised
and agencies expertise may be used for the production and construction of RAP mixes or
fresh aggregates treated with foamed bitumen. The gradation of aggregates can be same
as that given in Table IX-1.The properties such as maximum expansion ratio (ERm), half-life
(HL), type of binder used for foaming, viscosity of foamed bitumen etc play important role in
quality of mix production.
Mixing Moisture Content: The Mixing Moisture Content (MMC) of a foamed bitumen mix is
moisture content in the RAP mix when foamed bitumen
is injected which
is practically same
as Compaction Moisture Content (CMC) required for maximum compaction. A few trials are
needed to determine the MMC. Methods of sample preparation and curing are same as

that of the bitumen emulsion mixes. Mixes are prepared with different amount of foamed
bitumen and that which meets the minimum strength requirement in dry and wet condition
is adopted for production of foamed mixes. 75 blow compaction on each face of 100 mm
diameter Marshall samples is adopted for sample preparation.Test procedures and strength
requirement are also identical as given earlier for bitumen emulsion mixes. Foamed asphalt
mixes need less water and cure faster but
in hot weather prevalent
in most parts of India,
emulsion mixes also may cure fast due to migration of moisture from high vapour pressure
region in the interior to low vapour pressure region on the surface. Recommendation of TG-2
published by Asphalt Academy, South Africa may be used.
One of the advantages of the cold mixes are that they can be stock piled and used later when
needed. Wet weather damage of RAP due to lack of an impermeable wearing course as well
as due to poor drainage can be a serious problem.

A modulus of 600 MPa is recommended for RAP mixes for pavement design considering the
variability of RAP mixes though laboratory tests under controlled conditions give modulus
values ranging from 600-1200 MPa under a haversine loading pulse of duration 0.1 seconds
with a rest period of 0.9 seconds. FWD tests on in-service pavements having RAP mixes
can help the designers to determine the
in
situ modulus values over a period of time and
compute the remaining
life of the pavement. RAP mixes keep on gaining strength with loss
of moisture but high modulus determined
in the laboratory is not sustainable due to tensile
stresses caused by heavy traffic on highway in India.

ANNEX-X
(Refer Clause 3.1)
Pavement Layers with Chemical Stabilized Materials
X-1:
Chemically stabilized soils and aggregates may include
all kinds of stabilization
such as cement,
lime,
lime-flyash,
or their combination,
proprietary chemical
stabilisers,
enzymes, polymers and any other stabilizer provided these meet the strength and durability
requirements. While cement, lime, lime-flyash stabilized materials are well known for their
strength, performance and durability, the commercially produced stabilizers should meet the
additional requirements of teachability and concentration of heavy metals. Where stabilized
materials are used
in the pavement, only mechanized method of construction for laying and
compaction should be used. The equipment should be capable of administering the design
doses of stabilizer and quantity of water and producing a uniform and homogeneous mix.
Such materials are also termed as cemented or cementitious materials.
X-2:
IRC:SP:89-2010
Guidelines
for
Soil and
Granular
Material
Stabilization
using
Cement,
Lime &
Fly Ash'
has
very comprehensively
described
the
entire
process
of
stabilization. High strength chemically stabilized layer having a 7-day unconfined strength of
6-12 MPa given Table 8 of IRC:SP:89-2010 is not recommended because of wide shrinkage
and thermal cracks that may occur during the service. Cementitious materials having lower
strength can be used in bases and sub-bases. Since a cementitious base is required to act as
an important load bearing layer, a minimum strength of 4.5 MPa for bases of cement treated
aggregate at seven days
is necessary for long term durability as measured by Wetting and
drying/freezing and thawing tests (BIS: 4332 (Part IV) - 1968). Specimens having a strength
of 5 MPa and above are generally stable under durability tests. Cement stabilised aggregate
specimens should be stored
in a moist curing room/curing chamber undisturbed for seven
days before tests. Modulus of rupture of cementitious bases may be taken as 20 per cent of
the 28 day UCS (MEPDG) for flexure strength evaluation.
X-3:
Lime-Soil and Lime-flyash-aggregate mixes develop strength at a slow rate and
strength for their acceptability should be determined at 28 days. These slow setting stabilizers
develop fine cracks unlike cement treated materials in which the rate of strength gain is high.
These binders need less water for compaction which indirectly reduces shrinkage also. Long
term strength of lime-soil or lime-flyash-soil mixtures can be determined by curing sealed
samples at 40°C (ASTM D51 02-09 'Standard Test Methods for Unconfined Compressive
Strength of Compacted Soil-Lime-Mixtures'). Accelerated curing may be use to provide a
correlation between between normal and accelerated curing strengths for the material-binder
combination. Three day curing of lime of lime-flyas soil at 50°C
is found to be equivalent to
about 33 to 38 days of moist curing at ambient temperature of about 30°C (16). Some typical
values of unconfined compressive strength and modulus of rupture of lime-flyash concrete

The proportions may vary depending upon the quality of materials and laboratory tests are
required
to be done
prior to construction to ensure that the materials have the minimum
strength. Different trials are necessary to arrive at a good mix proportion for a base and a
sub-base. Construction procedure is explained in IRC:SP:20-2002. Table X-1 indicates that
even for lime-fly ash stabilized materials, flexural strength can be about 20 per cent of the
UCS. Published literature also (16) shows that flexural strength may be as high as 35 to 40
per cent of the UCS of lime or lime-flyash stabilized
soil. The recommendation of MEPDG
(3) taking the flexural strength as 20 per cent of the UCS
is very reasonable
if laboratory
data
is not available. Long term strength gain for slow setting stabilizers can be considered
in design.

Laboratory tests: A number of laboratory tests such as flexure tests, direct tension
testjongitudinal resonant frequency test,
indirect tensile strength
test, direct compression
test
etc. can be used
to measure
elastic modulus of cementitious
material. Unconfined
compression tests give high values of modulus. AUSTROADS recommend flexure load test
since this is considered to closer to stress/strain in the cemented base layer caused by traffic
loading. Relation between UCS and elastic modulus was recommended (14) as
E (cemented base) = k x UCS
... X-l
UCS = Unconfined strength at 28 days, MPa; k = 1000 to 1250.
E value of the cemented bases containing 4 to 6 per cent Ordinary Portland and slag or
Pozzolanic cements
is recommended as 5000 MPa.
If field evaluation by FWD indicates
higher modulus, fresh estimate of pavement life can be made.
Poisson's ratio of the cemented layer may vary from 0.2 to 0.25. A value of 0.25 may be
adopted. Stresses are not very sensitive to Poisson's ratio.
Cemented granular sub-base may have cement from 2 to 4 per cent to get a 7-day strength
of 1.5 to 3.0 MPa.
Its modulus as determined
in laboratory may range fom 2000 MPa to
3000 MPa. Since H Forms the platform for the construction traffic,
it cracks and cannot retain
the
initial modulus. A value of 600 MPa
is recommended and
its fatigue behaviour
is not
considered because of cracks.

soil sub-bases have 7-day UCS values

IRC:37-2012
the range 0.75 to 1.5 MPa, the recommended E value for design
is 400 MPa. Field tests by
FWD should be routinely done to collect data for obtaining pavement design parameters.
Cement requirement for a given strength is much higher for soils than for granular materials.
For the commercially available propriety cementing materials, the binder contents have to be
determined from laboratory tests to meet the strength requirement.
X-5:
Cemented bases should be compacted in a single layer to a maximum compacted
thickness of 200 mm. Layers laid at different times may not have the strength because of lack
of interface bond unless special care is taken.
X-6:
After the construction, curing as recommended
in IRC:SP:89-2010 must be done
immediately to aid
in development of strength and prevent drying shrinkage. Spraying of
bitumen emulsion
is a very effective method of curing. Exposing the compacted layer to sun
damages the stabilised layer and
it does not develop strengths as intended.
X-7:
Cemented
layers
normally develop
transverse and
longitudinal
cracks due
to
shrinkage and thermal stresses during hydration and during the service life. Hence a layer of
Stress Absorbing Membrane Interlayer (SAMI) of elastomeric modified binder (AUSTROADS
2004)
is to be provided over the cemented base to
resist reflection cracking. The rate of
spread
of the binder
is about 2
litres/m 2 followed by
light coating
of aggregates of size
10 mm to prevent pick-up of the binder by the wheels of construction machinery. Geotextile
seal and many other commercially available synthetic products available commercially have
the promise to retard crack propagation
in the bituminous layer. SAMI
is not very effective
if
the crack opening
is more than 3 mm.
X-8:
Another method of arresting the cracks from propagating to the upper bituminous
layer
is to provide an interlayer of good quality aggregates between the bituminous layer
and the cemented base. The aggregate layer should extend beyond the cemented base by
about 0.5 m so that moisture,
if any, travels down to the porous sub-base. Wet Mix Macadam
(WMM) meeting the IRC/MORTH specification can form a good aggregate interlayer. Being
sandwiched between two stiff layers, the aggregate behaves as layer of high modulus under
heavy load while
its modulus
is lower when lighter loads act. Priming and tack coating are
required before laying of the bituminous
layer. Use of
1
to 2 per cent bitumen emulsion
in WMM
is needed only when the construction
traffic
is
likely to deform the compacted
WMM requiring regrading.
It does not improve the crack resistance of the aggregate layer.
Thickness of 75 mm to 150 mm has been used for the inter layer by different organisations.
The Guidelines propose a thickness of 100 mm.
X-9:
Behaviour of cemented base after traffic associated cracking: The cemented layers
may get numerous cracks due to fatigue cracking and its modulus may be reduced drastically
from 5000 MPa to 500 MPa. Falling Weight Deflectometer can be a good tool to examine the
condition of the cemented base at any time during
its service
life. The bituminous layer has
little tensile strain before cracking of the cemented base but the value becomes very high
after the cracking of the base and fatigue failure of the bituminous layer also
is imminent.
If
85



======================================================================
PAGE 96 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:37-2012
the thickness of the bituminous layer
is higher 175 mm (14), the bituminous layer also has
considerable remaining
life and the total
life of the pavement is the sum of the fatigue
life of
the cemented layer and that of the bituminous layer.
If the sum of the thickness of bituminous
layer and 75 per cent of the thickness of aggregate interlayer is greater than
1 75 mm (14), the
pavement life
is again equal to the fatigue lives of the cemented and that of the bituminous
layers.
X-10:
Maximum size of the aggregate of the granular base and sub-base should be
53 mm
for obtaining a homogeneous mass
in mechanised
construction. Close graded
granular sub-base
of MORTH can be used
in the construction
of cemented bases and
sub-bases while coarse graded granular sub-base with percent passing 0.075 mm sieve less
than 2 per cent can be used as a porous cemented drainage layer laid above the coarse
graded cemented sub-base. Grading 4 of Table V-l can also be used.
I
Procedure for the mix design method for cementitious granular bases and sub-
bases can be same as adopted for Dry Lean Concrete (MORTH) except that the cementitious
stabilizer content is much lower due to low strength requirement. Optimum moisture content
has to be determined by trial. Since maximum size of aggregates can be 53 mm, 150 mm
cubes have to be made at different moisture content and compacted by vibratory hammer
with square plates. Details are given in MORTH Specifications for determination of optimum
moisture content, method of curing and evaluation of strength. The properties of cementitious
bases and sub-bases are given in Table X-2.
X-12:
For stabilized soils, even 50 mm diameter, 100 mm high samples can be used for
UCS after curing. Beam size can be 50 mm x 50 mm x 300 mm for flexure tests after curing.
Field condition may be simulated during the curing.
X-13:
If the soil is modified by addition of small percentage of lime/cement/other stabilizers,
( .BR tests can be done to evaluate the quality of the modified
soil.
If the cement content
is
2 per cent or higher, unconfined compressive strength should be determined to determine
the strength of the stabilized soil.
