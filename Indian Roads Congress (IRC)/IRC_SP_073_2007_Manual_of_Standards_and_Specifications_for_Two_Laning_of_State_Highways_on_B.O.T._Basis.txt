FOREWORD
There
is an urgent need to improve the existing State Highways, at least to 2-lane standards,
to ensure balanced road network connectivity in the country. Availability of funds,
to undertake
this gigantic task, by the States has remained a serious constraint so far.
With a view to attracting
private investment
for the development of State
roads,
the Planning Commission has
recently
brought out a "Model Concession Agreement for Public Private Partnership. Schedule-D of the
Model
Concession Agreement
prescribes
for
preparation
of
a Manual
of
Specifications
and
Standards by State PWDs for compliance by the Concessionaire.
It was felt that a Standard Manual
of Specifications and Standards should be brought out by the Indian Roads Congress (IRC)
to
ensure uniformity of approach and to facilitate easy implementation by various State Governments.
Accordingly,
the Planning Commission, Govt,
of India entrusted
the work
to IRC.
An Expert Group comprising the following was constituted by the IRC
for preparation of
the Manual.
(i)
Shri
D.P. Gupta
:
Former Director General (Road Development)
(ii)
Shri
S.C. Sharma
:
Former Director General (Road Development)
(iii)
Shri N.K. Sharma
:
Technical Advisor, IRC
The
first
draft
document
prepared
by
the
Expert Group
was
submitted
to
the
Project
Preparation,
contracts
Management &
Quality
Assurance
(G-I)
Committee
of
the
IRC
in
September, 2006. The Committee constituted a Sub-Group comprising of S/Shri S.K. Nirmal, K.
Venkata Ramana and Pranavant,
General
Managers,
National Highways Authority
of India
to
examine the draft document in greater detail. The Expert Group subsequently modified the draft
by
incorporating
the comments of G-1
Committee. The modified
draft was approved by G-1
Committee
in
its meeting held on
7th January, 2007. This
draft was considered and approved
by
the General
Specifications and
Standards (GSS) Committee
with some
observations
in
its
meeting held on 31st January, 2007. The amended draft was approved by the Executive Committee
of the IRC on 6th February, 2007 with the direction
that the same should be got reviewed by
the Stakeholders. The
draft was reviewed by
the Stakeholders
at
a Workshop held
in the IRC
on 12th February, 2007 and a few suggestions were made. Considering the urgency in the matter,
a Special Council Meeting of the IRC was convened on 24th February, 2007
for consideration
of the
draft.
The Council discussed the draft at length and directed the Secretary General, IRC to examine
the comments and get the
draft modified by the Expert Group. This modified draft was further
discussed by a Committee comprising of Shri V.K. Sinha, Secretary General, IRC; Shri G. Sharan,
Additional
Director
General, MOSRTH
(Convenor, GSS
Committee);
Shri
Nirmaljit
Singh,

Member (Tech.), NHAI (Co-Convenor, GSS Committee); Shri S.K. Puri, Chief General Manager,
NHAI (Convenor, G-1
Committee);
Shri A.P. Bahadur, Chief Engineer, MOSRTH;
along with
Shri R.K.
Jain,
Shri
G.S.
Khinda,
Shri M.V.B. Rao, Technical Advisors, IRC and
Shri Sharad
Varshney, Additional Director (Tech.), IRC. After detailed deliberations and number of modifications,
the above
draft was
finally approved
for publication by IRC.
IRC
finally
expresses
its
thanks
to
all who have
taken
great
pains
and
contributed
in
finalisation
of
this
Manual.
The
efforts
made
by
the
officers
and
staff
of IRC
are
also
acknowledged. The efforts put in by Shri D.R Gupta, Shri S.C. Sharma, Shri R.S. Sharma, former
Secretary
General,
IRC
and
Shri
Gajendra
Haldea,
Adviser
to
Deputy
Chairman,
Planning
Commission
are acknowledged.
An attempt has been made to adopt a balanced approach to bring
in the
latest technology
and
specifications,
at the same time, keeping
the cost of projects within manageable
limits so
as to
attract more entrepreneurs. A document of this nature cannot remain
static
in view of the
continuous up-gradation of technology over the years. Users of this Manual are going to be the
best judge of the deficiencies,
if any,
in the document.
Their feedback and suggestions will be
greatly valued by IRC to keep this document updated measuring upto the expectations of the users.
I am
confident
that
this Manual
will
serve
its
intended purpose
as
part
of the Model
Concession Agreement
for Public
Private Partnership
in
State Highways.

Two-laning
(without paved shoulders) may be undertaken
and further widening to Two-laning Plus (Two-
lane
carriageway
with
paved
shoulders)
undertaken in the second stage on the basis of
the following
criteria:
(a)
In case, the average daily traffic at the
time
of
bidding
is
less
than
8,000
PCUs
in plain
terrain or 6,500 PCUs
in
rolling
terrain,
initially
2-lane
wide
carriageway
with
granular
shoulders may be provided as per Para
2.5.2(ii).
(b)
The carriageway may be widened by
providing
1.5 m wide paved shoulders
on either side when the average daily
traffic exceeds
10,000 PCUs
in
plain
terrain or 8,000 PCUs in rolling terrain
on
the
basis
of
the
twelve
months'
average
in
an
accounting
year.
The
paved
shoulders
shall
be
provided
within
six months from
the
close
of
the accounting year in which average
daily traffic exceeds the specified value.
The crust thickness and composition in
the widened portions (paved shoulders)
shall
be
the
same
as
in
the
main
carriageway.
(Refer
to para
5.9.9).

In case the average daily traffic at the time
of bidding is more than 10,000 PCUs in plain
terrain
or
8,000
PCUs
in
rolling
terrain,
widening
to
Two
laning
Plus
(Two
lane
carriageway
with
paved
shoulders) may
be
undertaken
straightaway

======================================================================
SECTION 2
GEOMETRIC DESIGN AND GENERAL FEATURES
2.1
General
(i) This
Section
lays down
the
standards
for
geometric
design and
general
features
for
upgrading
the
existing
state highways/major
district roads to two-lane with or without paved
shoulders.
(ii) (a)
Stretches passing through built up areas
shall normally be provided with 4-lane
divided carriageway
(Fig.
2.2). Such
stretches shall be indicated in Schedule-
B
of
the
Concession Agreement.
Additional land, if any, required for 4-
laning
shall
be
acquired
by
the
Government and where the land
is yet
to be acquired, the date of handing over
the land to the Concessionaire shall be
indicated.
(b) Where there are constraints of existing
ROW width or difficulty
in acquiring
land along
the
existing
alignment
in
built up
areas,
the Government may
specify construction of a bypass instead
of 4-laning. The
alignment
of
the
bypass
shall
be
specified
by
the
Government. The land for the bypass
shall be acquired by
the Government
and where the land is yet to be acquired,
the date of handing over the land to the
Concessionaire shall be indicated. The
bypass shall be access controlled, unless
specified
otherwise.
In
case,
the
Government decides
to provide two-
lane carriageway
for
the bypass,
the
same shall be placed eccentrically with
respect to the ROW to facilitate proper
widening to four lanes in future.
(iii) The
geometric
design
of the
Project
Highway
shall conform
to
the
standards
set
out
in
this
Section
as
a minimum. The
Concessionaire
shall
ensure
that
liberal
geometric standards are followed to the extent
feasible within the given Right of Way.
(iv) As
far
as
possible,
uniformity of design
standards
shall be maintained throughout
the
length.
In
case
of any change,
it
shall be
effected
in a gradual manner.
(v) Where
the
existing road geometries
are
deficient with respect to minimum requirements
and its improvement to the prescribed standards
requires
acquisition of additional
land,
such
stretches
shall be
specified
in Schedule-B
of
the Concession Agreement. Additional
land
as
required
shall
be
provided
by
the
Government.
(vi) Existing horizontal curves, which are found
deficient in radius, layout, transition lengths or
superelevation
shall
be
corrected
to
the
specified
standards.
(vii) Any deficiencies in the vertical profile in
respect of grades, layout of vertical curves and
sight distance
shall be corrected
to meet the
minimum
specified requirements.
2.2
Design Speed
2.2.1
The design speeds given
in Table
2.1
shall
be
adopted
for
various
terrain
classifications
(Terrain
is
classified by
the
general slope of the ground across the highway
alignment).
2.2.2
Short stretches (say less than
1 km) of
varying
terrain met with on
the road
stretch
shall not be
taken
into
consideration while
deciding the
terrain classification for a given

2.7.2
The two-lane roads
shall be provided
with
a crown
in
the middle. On
horizontal
curves, the carriageway shall be superelevated.
2.7.3
The camber for earthen shoulders on
straight portions shall be
at least 0.5 per cent
steeper than
the
slope
of the pavement and
paved shoulder subject
to a minimum of 3.0
per
cent. On
super
elevated
sections,
the
shoulders shall have the same crossfall as the
carriageway.
2.8
Horizontal Alignment
2.8.1
While
designing
the
horizontal
alignment, the following general principles shall
be kept in view:
(i)
Alignment
should be
fluent and
it
should blend well with the surrounding
topography.
(ii)
On new
roads,
the curves
should be
designed
to have
largest
practical
radius, but in no case less than ruling
value corresponding
to
ruling design
speed.
(iii) As a normal rule, sharp curves should
not be introduced
at the end of long
tangent
since
these can be extremely
hazardous.
(iv)
The curves should be sufficiently long
and
they
should
have
suitable
transitions
to
provide
pleasing
appearance.
(v)
Reverse curves shall be avoided as far
as
possible.
Where
unavoidable,
sufficient
length between two curves
shall be provided
for introduction of
requisite transition curves.
(vi)
Curves in the same direction, separated
by short tangents known as broken back
curves,
should be avoided
as
far
as
possible.
(vii) To avoid distortion in appearance, the
horizontal
alignment
should
be
coordinated
carefully
with
the
longitudinal
profile.
(viii) Hairpin bends on
hilly
terrain should
be avoided as far as possible.
2.8.2
All horizontal curves
shall consist of
circular portion flanked by spiral transitions at
both ends.
2.8.3
Superelevation
(i)
Superelevation
shall be provided on
curves as per details given in IRC: 73
corresponding
to
the
design
speed
adopted.
(ii)
Superelevation shall be limited to 7 per
cent.
(iii)
Superelevation
shall not be
less than
the minimum
specified
cross
fall/
camber.
2.8.4
Radii of Horizontal Curves
The desirable minimum and absolute minimum
radii of horizontal curves
for various
classes
of terrain are given in Table 2.5.

GEOMETRIC DESIGN AND GENERAL FEATURES
The
radius
of horizontal curves
for various
terrain
conditions
shall
not be
less
than
the
desirable
values
given
in Table
2.5
except
where
site
conditions
are
restrictive
and
adequate
land
is
not
available. Where
such
restrictions exist, the radius of curve shall not
be
less than
the
specified absolute minimum
value.
2.8.5
Transition Curves
Minimum length of transition curve
shall be
determined
from
the
following
two
considerations and the larger of the two values
adopted for design:
(i)
The
rate
of change
of
centrifugal
acceleration
should
not
cause
discomfort
to
drivers. From
this
consideration,
the length of transition
curve
is given by:
Ls = 0.0215 VVCR,
Where:
Ls = Length
of transition curve
in
metres,
^\
V
= Speed
in km/hr,
R
= Radius
of
circular curve
in
metres,
C
= 80/(75
+
V)
(subject
to
a
maximum of 0.8 and minimum
of 0.5)
Table 2.6
: Sight Distances for Various Speeds
(ii)
The
rate of change of superelevation
should
be
such
as
not
to
cause
discomfort to travelers. Further, rate of
change should not be steeper than
1
in
150
for roads
in
plain/rolling
terrain,
and
1
in 60
in
mountainous/steep
terrain. The
formula
for minimum
length of transition on this basis
is:
Ls =
2.7 V2/R
2.9
Sight Distance
2.9.1
Visibility
is an important requirement
for the safety of travel on roads. For this,
it
is
necessary that sight distance of adequate length
is
available
in
different
situations,
to permit
drivers enough
time and
distance
to
control
their vehicles so that chances of accidents are
minimized.
2.9.2
On
two-lane
roads,
normally
intermediate sight distance should be available
throughout. The attempt should, however, be
to provide overtaking sight distance in as much
length
of the road
as
possible.
In
stretches
where even intermediate
sight distance
is not
available,
the
safe
stopping
sight
distance
should be provided as a last resort. Traffic signs
depicting
"Overtaking
Prohibited:"
shall be
installed
at
all such locations.
2.9.3
The recommended
sight distances
for
various speeds are given in Table
2.6.

INTERSECTIONS AND GRADE SEPARATORS
3.1
Introduction
3.1.1
Subject
to
the
provisions
of
this
Manual, properly designed intersections
shall
be provided at all road crossings/junctions. The
types and locations of Interchanges and Grade-
separated Intersections without ramps shall be
specified
in Schedule-B
of the Concession
Agreement. The
intersections
to be provided
shall be one of the following types:
(i)
At-grade
intersections
(ii)
Grade
separated
intersections
without
ramps
(iii)
Interchanges
3.1.2
The
existing
intersections, which
are
deficient
with
respect
to
the minimum
requirements
shall
be
improved
to
the
prescribed
standards. Additional
land,
if any,
required for improving the existing intersections
shall be provided by the Government.
3.2
At-grade Intersections
3.2.1
General
(i)
The
majority
of the
intersections
to be
encountered
will be of At-grade
type. These
are most economical and
are
provided
at
crossing
locations, where the
traffic on cross
roads
is low to moderate. These intersections
should be
properly designed
as
per
details
below.
(ii)
Type of intersections to be adopted shall
be decided on
the
basis of parameters
like
number of intersecting
legs,
traffic volume/
speed,
available
right of way, type of
traffic
control
(signalized/non-signalized)
etc.
Necessary traffic surveys for the design of road
junctions shall be carried out as per IRC:SP: 19.
(iii) Normally,
the
type of intersection
shall
be:
(a)
Three leg intersection.
(b)
Four leg intersection.
(c)
Multi
leg
intersection/rotary.
(iv) The
design
of
different elements
of
intersection
shall be done
as per IRC:SP:41
including
other design
criteria given
in
the
subsequent
paras. MOSRTH
- Type Designs
for Intersection on National Highways,
1992
may also be referred to, wherever required, to
develop suitable lay out and design of At-grade
Intersections.
(v) The
design
shall aim
at
simplicity and
uniformity
in
design
standards. Complex
designs which may
involve
complicated
decision making by drivers
shall be avoided.
(vi) The intersection control
shall be of 'Stop
Control' unless specified otherwise.
This will
mean that traffic on the minor road must stop
prior to entering the major road. Where roads
of equal importance
intersect, priority will be
given to the
traffic on the
right.
(vii)
At the intersection, the alignment should
be
as
straight and
the
gradient
as
flat
as
practicable. Gradients in excess of 2 per cent
will normally not be allowed
at intersections.
(viii)
Any
deficiency
in
the alignment and
grade of intersecting roads
shall be corrected
to improve
traffic conditions and
safety.

IRC:SP:73-2007
(ix)
The
sight
distance
to be adopted
shall
normally be
intermediate
sight
distance
as
specified in Section 2. However, in exceptional
situations
it should not be less than minimum
stopping sight distance specified in Section
2.
At
such
locations,
cautionary
speed
limit
signboards
shall be displayed.
(x)
At multi
leg
intersections,
the points of
conflict
should
be
studied
carefully
and
possibilities of realigning one or more of the
intersecting
legs
and
combining
some
movements
to
reduce
the
conflicting
movements
shall be examined. The objective
shall be to simplify the design and appropriate
control devices added to ensure more efficient
and safe operation.
3o2.2
Design Standards
Design
standards
shall be
as per IRC:SP:41.
Salient features are given below:
(i)
Design Speed: The approach speed
shall
be taken
as the design speed adopted for the
section
of Project Highway on which
the
intersection
is
located. The design speed
for
various elements of the
intersection
shall be
taken as 60% of the approach speed.
(ii)
Design Traffic Volume: The traffic volume
for the design of intersection and its distribution
at peak hours
shall be
assessed, up
to
the
operation period, taking into consideration the
past
trend,
likely new development of land,
socio-economic changes,
etc.
(iii)
Design Vehicle: Semi-trailer combination
(refer IRC:
3)
shall be used
in
the design of
intersections.
(iv) The number of lanes to be provided at the
intersection
shall be governed by peak hour
traffic volume in each direction of travel. For
single lane movements, a minimum width of
5.5 m
is
to be adopted.
For two-lane roads
between kerbs, a minimum 7.5 m width shall
be provided.
Widening of carriageway
shall
be achieved by a taper of not less than

relatively cheaper as compared to Interchanges.
These could preferably, be provided at locations
where
traffic on
cross
roads
is moderate
to
heavy and segregation though essential, cannot
be provided by an Interchange due
to
cost
constraints. Under
this
type, two cross roads
separate
at
different grades
(as Road Under
Bridge or Road Over Bridge) and
all turning

3.4
Interchanges
3.4.1
General
(i) An
Interchange
is
a
grade-separated
intersection with connecting roadways (ramps)
for turning traffic between highway approaches.
Such an Interchange
will be necessary
at
all
crossings
of
a highway,
which
is
to
be
developed
to completely
access
controlled
standards. An Interchange may also be justified
at
locations where
traffic on
cross
roads
is
heavy and when an At-grade intersection fails
to handle the heavy volume of turning, merging
and diverging traffic leading to excessive delays
and
fatal
and
major
accidents.
Cost
effectiveness
will decide whether
to provide
full Interchange or grade separated intersection
without ramps.
(ii)
An
Interchange may be justified
at
the
crossing of the Project Highway with another
highway, and where the total traffic on
all the
arms of the intersection
is in excess of 10,000
PCUs
in peak hour.
(iii)
The decision
to provide Interchange
at
such
locations
shall
be
taken
by
the
Government and
the requirement
shall be
clearly
spelt
out
in
Schedule-B
of
the
Concession Agreement,
which
shall
also
indicate
specifications and
traffic
streams
to
be grade separated.
(iv)
The
detailed design and
layout of the
Interchange shall conform to broad parameters
and requirements specified by the Government
in Schedule-B of the Concession Agreement.

3A.2
Types of Interchanges
(i)
Interchanges
are
generally
described by
the pattern of the various turning roadways or
ramps,
which
determine
their geometric
configuration.
The
common
geometric
configurations of Interchanges are the trumpet,
diamond,
cloverleaf,
rotary and
directional.
Within each type of Interchange, there can be
several variations such as split diamond, partial
cloverleaf,
etc.
depending
on
the ramp
arrangements.
(ii)
The type of Interchange,
the shape and
pattern of the Interchange ramps and loops and
their designs shall be governed by factors such
as the importance of the intersecting highway,
the number of intersecting
legs,
the
design
volumes
of through
and
turning
traffic
movements
including
their composition,
the
design
speeds,
available
right
of way and
topography.
The
Interchange
site
shall be
studied in detail and alternative designs made,
to determine the most suitable arrangement of
structures and ramps
satisfying
the
specified
requirements.
3.4.3
Geometric
Design
Standards for
Interchange Elements
The geometric design standards shall be as per
IRC:
92
appropriate
for
the
design
speed
adopted for the Project Highway. The design
speed for ramps shall not be less than 40 km
per
hour. The
desirable
values
of various
parameters given in IRC: 92 shall be adopted,
unless there are severe
site constraints.
3.4.4
Design
Traffic
The
traffic volume for the design of various
elements of Interchange including ramps shall
be assessed up
to the end of the Concession
Period
or twenty
years, whichever
is more,
taking into consideration the past trends, likely
new development of
land,
socio-economic
changes,
etc.

SECTION 4
ROAD EMBANKMENT
4.1
General
4.1.1
The
design and
construction
of road
embankment
and
cuttings
shall
meet
the
requirements,
standards
and
specifications
given in this Section. This Section also covers
specifications
for
subgrade
and
earthen
shoulders.
4.1.2
Where
the
Project Highway
involves
improvement to an existing road, efforts should
be made to remove the inherent deficiencies in
plan, profile and the roadway width.
It shall
be ensured that the final centre line of the road
and the road levels are fixed with great care,
duly
considering
all
the
relevant
factors
covering
structural
soundness,
safety
and
functional
requirements.
4.1.3
The existing roadway, where deficient,
shall be widened
to
the roadway
width
in
accordance with para 2.6.
4.2
Road Embankment
4.2.1
The width of the embankment shall be
in accordance with the cross-sectional
details
specified in Section 2 of this Manual.
4.2.2
The height of the embankment shall be
based on the final road
levels. The following
principles
shall be kept
in view while
fixing
the road
level:
(i)
For ImprovementAVidening of the existing
road;
(a)
In case, bottom of the existing subgrade
is 0.6 m above the HFL, the existing
height of embankment can be retained.
(b)
In case,
it
is
less, then the bottom of
subgrade should be raised to ensure a
minimum
1 m clearance of the bottom
of the subgrade from HFL.
If raising
of any
section
(s)
of
the
Project
Highway
is
required,
that
shall
be
specified
in
Schedule-B
of
the
Concession Agreement.
(c)
In
case.
Project Highway
is
passing
through an area not affected by floods
and is free from any drainage problem/
water ponding/over-topping
situations
with water table being quite deep,
to
the extent that subgrade is not likely to
be affected by the capillary saturation,
then
the employer may avoid
raising
in
larger
stretches
to save
cost, even
though the minimum clearance of 0.6
m
from
existing
ground
level
is
desirable.
(ii)
New two lane road;
(a)
Bottom of subgrade is
1.0 m above the
high
flood
level/highest water
table/
ponded water
level. The HFL should
be decided by
intelligent
inspections,
local
observations,
enquiries
and
studying the past records.
(b)
Portions
forming
approaches
to
structures
provide smooth
vertical
profile and
fulfil
the minimum
free
board requirement.
4.2.3
Portions
forming
approaches
to
structures provide smooth
vertical
profile.
4.2.4
Deficiencies
in
the
existing
vertical
profile of the road shall be corrected.

PAVEMENT DESIGN
5.1
General
5.1.1
The
existing
roads
in
the
States
are
generally flexible pavements and their capacity
augmentation
by way
of widening
and
strengthening would therefore generally be by
provision of flexible pavements only.
5.1.2
Situations may,
however,
also
arise
where the Government may require provision
of cement concrete pavement depending upon
specific
site
conditions. Such
a requirement
shall
be
specified
in
Schedule-B
of
the
Concession Agreement and
indicated
as
a
deviation
in Schedule-D of the Concession
Agreement.
The
minimum
design
and
maintenance requirements for cement concrete
pavement shall be specified by the Government
and Schedule-K of the Concession Agreement
shall be modified accordingly.
5.1.3
Design of new pavement
sections
or
widening
and
strengthening
of
existing
pavements shall take into account
all relevant
factors
for assuring
reliable performance
that
satisfies
the
specified minimum performance
requirements.
5.1.4
The pavement condition and other data
furnished by
the Government
are based on
preliminary investigations. The Concessionaire
shall undertake the necessary soil, material and
pavement investigations and traffic volume and
axle load studies in accordance with the good
industry practice for preparing detailed designs.
5.1.5
The materials, mixes and construction
practice shall meet the requirements prescribed
herein and MOSRTH
Specifications
/ IRC
Specifications,
unless
specified otherwise.
5.1.6
Where problematic conditions such as
expansive soils, swamps or marshes, flooding,
poor drainage, etc. are found to exist, adequate
measures
shall be adopted
to deal with such
site conditions.
5.2
Method
of
Design
of
Flexible
Pavement
The design of flexible pavement is covered in
two
parts
namely, new
pavements,
and
widening
and
strengthening
of
existing
pavements. New pavements shall be designed
in accordance with
the method prescribed
in
IRC:37
or any
other
international
standard
method/guideline for pavement design, subject
to
the
condition
that
the
overall pavement
composition shall not be less than the minimum
requirement specified in IRC:37. Strengthening
of existing pavements shall be designed on the
basis
of the
procedure
outlined
in IRC:81,
except where specified otherwise.
5.3
Method of Design of Rigid Pavement
Rigid pavement shall be designed for a period
of not
less than 30 years,
in accordance with
the method prescribed
in IRC:58.
5.4
Design of New Pavements
5.4.1
Flexible Pavement
- Design Period and
Strategy
(i) Pavement shall be designed for a minimum
design period of
15
years. Stage construction
shall be permissible subject to the requirement
specified in para
(ii) below.
37



======================================================================
PAGE 58 of 168
======================================================================
IRC:SP:73-2007
(ii) Alternative
strategies
or combination
of
initial
design,
strengthening and maintenance
can be developed by
the
Concessionaire
to
provide
the
specified
level
of pavement
performance over the operation period, subject
to
satisfying
the following minimum design
requirements;
(a)
The thickness of sub-base and base of
pavement
section
is
designed
for
a
minimum design period of 15 years and
the
initial bituminous
surfacing
for
a
minimum design period of 8 years.
(b)
The pavement shall be strengthened by
bituminous
overlay,
as
and when
required,
to extend
the pavement
life
to full operation period. Strengthening
in stages for not less than five years at
a time can be done. The thickness of
bituminous overlay shall be detemiined
on the basis of IRC:81.
5.4.2
Rigid Pavement
Strategy
Design Period and
(i) The
stage
construction
shall
not
be
permitted
in
case
of
rigid pavement. The
pavement shall be constructed
in
10 m width
(7 m
carriageway
plus
2X1.5 m
rigid
shoulders).
(ii) The Pavement Quality Concrete (PQC) shall
be designed
as
per para
5.3.1,
based on
a
flexural
strength of 4.5 MPa. The PQC
shall
rest over Dry Lean Concrete (DLC) sub-base
of 150 mm thickness.
(iii) The DLC will be of Ml 0 concrete (7 days'
strength)
as
prescribed
in
IRC:SP:49. DLC will be extending beyond the
PQC (including that in shoulder, if any) by Im
on either side.
(iv) A properly designed drainage layer (GSB)
of thickness
150-200 mm
shall be provided.
The drainage layer shall be properly designed
so that a drainage coefficient of 20 m per day
is obtained.
(v) The construction of rigid pavement should
normally be done by Slip-form Paver. Stringent
quality control
is absolutely essential for long
term performance of the
rigid pavement and
therefore,
the same should be executed with
utmost
quality
control and
as
per procedure
laid down
in IRC: 15.
(vi) The details of axle load surveys, for trucks
only,
shall be used in computing stress ratios
as per IRC:58.
5.4.3
Pavement Performance Requirements
i)
ii)
The pavement structure shall be capable
of giving
the
specified performance
over the entire operation period.
The new pavement surface shall satisfy
the following standards:
Roughness
In each lane
measured by
calibrated BI
Rutting, cracking
or any other
distress
Not more than
2000 mm/km for
each lane in a km
length
Nil
(iii) During
the
operation
period,
the
pavement
surface
roughness
or any
structural/functional
distress
shall
not
exceed
the
values
specified
in
Schedule-K
of
the
Concession
Agreement. Any treatment in the form
of renewal/overlay
carried
out
or
required to restore/correct/improve the
riding quality or any distress
shall be
of such thickness and specification that
will
restore
the
riding
quality
to
2000 mm/km.

PAVEMENT DESIGN
5.5
Design Traffic
5.5.1
The design traffic shall be estimated in
terms of cumulative number of standard axles
(8160 kg) to be carried by the pavement during
the design period.
5.5.2
Estimate
of the
initial
daily
average
traffic flow
shall be based on
atleast 7
days',
24 hour classified traffic counts. IRC: 9 may be
used
as guidance
for carrying
out
the
traffic
census.
5.5.3
Any
likely change
in
traffic due
to
proposed improvement
of the
facility
and/or
future development
plans, land
use,
shall be
duly considered in estimating the design traffic.
5.5.4
Traffic growth rate shall be established
for each category of commercial vehicles to be
considered for design of pavement. For traffic
projections, the procedure outlined in IRC: 108
may be
followed. The Concessionaire
shall
adopt
a
realisdc
value
of the
rate
of
traffic
growth, provided that annual rate of growth of
commercial vehicles
shall
not be assumed as
less than 5 per cent.
5.5.5
Axle load surveys shall be carried out
to estimate the vehicle damage
factor (VDF)
for each category of commercial vehicles. The
axle load equivalency factors recommended in
Annexure-2
of IRC:37
shall
be
used
for
converting different axle road repetitions into
equivalent standard axle load repetitions. VDF
values
so
determined
shall
be
used
for
estimating
design
traffic
in
standard
axles.
Provided that
if the Concessionaire envisages
the possibility of controlling the severity and
incidence
of
overloading
with
better
enforcement of
legal
load
limits
as
also
of
increase
in
the
proportion
of Multi Axle
Vehicles over the years,
it may,
at
it own risk
and cost adopt a lower VDF value than
that
determined on
the
basis
of
the Axle
load
spectrum
survey.
5.5.6
Lane
distribution
factors
given
in
IRC:37
shall be adopted.
5.5.7

of individual deflection
corrected
for temperature
and seasonal
variation)
a
=
Standard Deviation
5.10.3
Design
Period
and
Minimum
Requirements
(i) Pavement strengthening shall be done for a
design
period
of
10
years
or equal
to
the
operation
period,
whichever
is
more.
Strengthening
in
stages
shall be
permissible
subject to the requirements given
in para
(ii)
below.
(ii) The
Concessionaire
shall
ensure
the
following requirements
as
a minimum
for
design of strengthening measures:
(a)
Initial strengthening for a design period
of not less than eight years.
(b)
Subsequent overlay
at the end of the
initial design period, or
earlier,
if the
surface roughness exceeds
the
value
specified
in
Schedule-K
of
the
Concession Agreement
or
if any
structural
distress
is
observed. The
overlay shall be designed to extend the
pavement life for at least five years at
a time.
(c)
The riding quality of the pavement shall
be measured
periodically and
if the
roughness exceeds the specified value,
the
pavement
strength
shall
be
evaluated based on
current
deflection
measurements and
traffic
projections
for the next five years, at least. In case
any strengthening treatment is required,
the
same
shall
be
implemented,
otherwise
the
wearing
course

renewed by providing a minimum 25
mm
thick
bituminous
surfacing
conforming
to
the
existing wearing
course
specifications.
5.10.4
Design
Traffic
The design
traffic
shall be estimated in terms
of the cumulative number of standard
axles
(8160 kg) to be earned by the pavement during
the design period as per the procedure described

5.10.6 The
overlay,
so determined
for
the
existing pavements
in terms
of Bituminous
Macadam can be modified to provide for other
compositions,
including
the combination
of
granular layers of WBMAVMM and bituminous
treatment. The equivalent overlay thickness can
be determined using the following equivalency
factors as per Clause 7.4 of IRC:
81;
100 mm of BM = 150 mm of WBMAVMM
100 mm of BM = 70 mm of DBM/SDBC/BC

type
of material
to be used
in
overlay construction will depend upon several
factors
such
as
design
traffic,
thickness,
condition and
type
of existing bituminous
surfacing and convenience of construction.
If
it
is proposed to strengthen an existing weak
pavement structure with granular construction
followed
by
bituminous
surfacing,
the
following requirements
shall be
satisfied:
(i)
The existing bituminous surfacing shall
be completely removed by scarifying /
milling
before
laying WBM/WMM
layers.
It
will
be
ensured
that
the
underlying layer
is not disturbed.
(ii)
If the thickness of the scarified/milled
layer
is 40 mm or more,
the
existing
pavement thickness
shall be made up
by
increasing
the
overlay
thickness
correspondingly.
(iii) The
thickness
and composition
of
bituminous surfacing over the granular
layer
shall
conform
to
the
recommended surfacing and thickness
in
para
4.2.3
(Bituminous
Surfacing)

9.4.
Roadside Safety Barriers
There
are two
types
of
safety
barriers
viz.,
longitudinal roadside safety barriers and median
safety
barriers.
9.4.1
Warrants
The longitudinal roadside barriers are basically
meant to shield two types of roadside hazards
i.e. embankments and roadside obstacles and
also for preventing the vehicles veering off the
sharp curves. The warrants for a
fill section in
terms of the height and slope needing protection
with
roadside
barriers
are shown
in
Fig.9.1.
The barrier
is not warranted for embankment
having a fill slope of 3:
1 or flatter. The warrants
for roadside objects are mainly dependent upon
the type of obstacle and the probability of their
being
hit. A barrier
shall be
installed only
if
the result of vehicle striking the barrier is likely
to be less severe than the severity of accident
resulting from
the
vehicle
impacting
the
unshielded
obstacle. Some of the commonly
encountered roadside obstacles are bridge piers,
abutments and railing ends, roadside rock mass.
culverts,
pipes and headwalls,
cut
slopes,
retaining walls, lighting supports, traffic signs
and signal supports, trees and
utility poles.
9.4.2
Types of Roadside Safety Barriers
There
are broadly three types of longitudinal
roadside
safety
barriers:
(a)
Flexible type
(like wire-rope fencing)
(b)
Semi Rigid type, hke
(i)
"W beam type steel barriers
(ii)
Thrie beam type
steel barriers
These steel barriers are of strong post type and
usually remain
functional
after moderate
collisions,
thereby
eliminating
the need
for
immediate
repair.
(c)
Rigid type (like concrete crash barriers)
9.4.3
Roadside Steel Barriers
(i)
Design Aspects: The "W" beam type
safety
barrier consists of a
steel post
and 3 mm thick "W" beam rail element
which
is spaced away from the posts.
The
spacer
minimizes
vehicular
snagging and reduces the likelihood of
a vehicle vaulting over the barrier. The
steel posts and the blocking out spacer
shall both be channel section of 75 mm
X
150 mm
size and 5mm
thick. The
rail shall be 700 mm above ground level
and posts shall be spaced 2 m center to
center. Typical details are shown in Fig.
9.2.
The thrie beam safety barrier shall have
posts and spacers
similar
to the ones
mentioned above
for "W" beam type.
The rail shall be placed 850 mm above
80



======================================================================
PAGE 101 of 168
======================================================================
TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES AND ROAD SAFETY WORKS
the ground level. This barrier has higher
initial cost than the "W" beam type but
is less prone to damages due to vehicle
collisions especially for shallow angle
impacts. Typical
details of thrie beam
barrier are shown
in Fig.
9.3.
The "W" beam,
the
thrie beam,
the
posts
spacers and
fasteners
for
steel
barriers shall be galvanized by hot dip
process.
End
treatment
for
steel
barrier: An
untreated end of the
roadside
barrier
can be hazardous,
if
hit, because
the
barrier
beam
can
penetrate
the
passenger compartment and cause the
impact
vehicle
to
stop
abruptly. End
treatments
should
therefore form
an
integral
part
of safety
barriers. End
treatment should not spear vault or roll
a vehicle for head-on or angled impacts.
The two end treatments recommended
for
steel
barriers
are
"Turned down
guardrail and Anchored in back slope".
Turned down guardrails have the "W"
or
thrie
sections, reduced from
full
height
to ground
level,
with
a
gentle
slope over a distance of 8 to 9 m. The
turned down rail is intended to collapse
on impact, allowing the vehicle to pass
over
it without becoming
airborne
or
unstable. In order to locate the barrier
terminal away from the travelled way
and to minimize
driver's reaction to a
hazard
near
the
road, by
gradually
introducing a parallel barrier installation
or to transition a roadside barrier nearer
the roadway, such as a bridge parapet
or a railing, the turned down rail should
be
flared away from
the
roadway.
Suggested flare rates depend upon the
design speed and
the
type of barrier
(Table
9.3).

The posts
in the end treatment should
have
the
same
cross
sections
as
provided
in the main barrier.
At road cross-sections
in cutting or
if
the road transitions from cut to
fill, the
safety barriers can be anchored in back
slopes. The back
slope covering
the
anchored portion of the barrier should
be
graded
flat
wi-th
side
slopes
preferably not steeper than
10:1. The
anchored
portion
should develop
a
tensile strength
in the
rail element to
prevent the rail from pulling out of the
anchorage. The
barrier can
also be
anchored
in an
earth berm
specially
constructed for this purpose, provided
the new berm
itself is not a hazard to
the
traffic. The
earth berm should be
made impervious
to erosion.
(iii)
Placement:
Placement recommend-
ations determine the exact layout of the
barrier and should be made keeping in
view
the
lateral
offset of the
barrier
and flare rate. The final layout shall be
a
site-specific combination
of these
factors. The
barriers should be
as
far
away from the
traffic as possible and
81



======================================================================
PAGE 102 of 168
======================================================================
IRC:SP:73-2007
should
preferably
have
uniform
clearance between
the
traffic and
the
hazard.
As
far
as
possible,
the
safety
barrier
should be placed beyond 2.5 m of the
travelled way. For long and continuous
stretches, this offset is not critical. The
distance between
the
barrier and
the
hazard should
not be
less
than
the
deflection of the barrier by an impact
of a
full
sized
vehicle.
In
case
of
embankments, a minimum distance of
600 mm should be maintained between
the barrier and the start of embankment
slope of a hazard to prevent the wheels
from dropping over the edge. Typical
details are shown in Fig.
9.4.
Flatter
flare
rates may
be
used,
particularly where
extensive grading
would be
required
to
ensure
a
flat
approach from
the
travelled way,
subject
to
the
availability of right of
way.
9.4.4
Roadside Concrete Barriers
(i)
Design Aspects:
Roadside
concrete
safety barriers are rigid barriers having
a sloped front face and a vertical back
face. The recommended designs of the
cast
in-situ and
pre-cast
barriers
are
shown in Figs. 9.5 and 9.6 respectively.
Based
on
evaluation
of
vehicle
direction,
sight
distance,
structural
stability and
the psychological
effect
of barrier height on driver reaction, the
most
desirable height of the median
barrier
is 800 mm. Variations upto 50
mm in height of barrier can be made in
the total height of the barrier to meet
the
site requirements.
It
is, however,
important
to maintain
the
height of
lower slope between 200 mm and 350
mm
so
as
to reduce
the chances
of
overturning of the vehicles.
The concrete
barrier may be pre-cast
in lengths up to 6 m, depending upon
the
feasibility of transport and
lifting
arrangements. Concrete grade
for
the
barriers should not be leaner than M30.
The minimum thickness of foundations
shall be 25 mm cement concrete or hot
mix asphalt placed at the base of barrier,
to provide lateral restraint. Where more
than 75 mm thick overlay on the road
pavement is anticipated, the foundation
step may be increased
to
125 mm.
However,
longitudinal
roadside
concrete barrier should have elaborate
footing design which
is
structurally
safe, unless
sufficient earth support
is
available.
(ii)
End Treatment: Safety barrier shall be
provided with an end treatment, which
shall be obtained by tapering the height
of terminating end of the median barrier
within a length of 8 m to 9 m.
(iii)
Placement:
Placement recommend-
ations for roadside steel barriers, given
in para 9.4.3 above, are applicable to
concrete barriers as well.
9.4.5
General
(i)
Raised curbs
or
drains
shall
not be
provided between the travelled way and
the
barriers. These
destabilize
the
vehicle
balance
and
disturb
its
equilibrium before it strikes the barrier,
thus defeating the essential purpose of
safety and redirection of the impacting
vehicle.
(ii)
In
rural
situations, both
the roadside
and the median barriers shall preferably
be steel barriers. Concrete barriers shall
be preferred in urban situations.

10.6
Road works
Vehicles
are
required
to
decelerate
while
entering
the
toll
lane,
stop
for payment and
then
accelerate and merge
in
the main
line
traffic of the highway. All these operations of
vehicles
at
Toll Plaza
are prone
to oil/POL
spillage on the surface, which may have cut-
back action on bituminous surface. Therefore,
concrete pavement would be preferred in the
Toll Plaza area including tapering zone, from
durability
and
long
term
serviceability
consideration. The
rigid pavement
shall be
designed as per IRC:58. For this work, use of
paver shall not be
insisted.

Signs
should
be
placed
along
the
Project Highway, roadway
of Toll
Plaza
to
guide and render
assistance
to
the
drivers
approaching
Toll
Plaza.
It
is
necessary
to
remind the driver about the existence of Toll
Plaza one km ahead
with
a
repeater
sign
500 m ahead. Stop sign shall always be used in
combination with certain road markings such
as stop line and the word 'STOP' marked on
the pavement.
10.7.3 The
Toll
Plaza
sign
should
be
supplemented by the sign advising the users of
the
notified
toll
rates
for
various
types
of
vehicles. Typical details of road signs required
for toll purpose are given in Figs. 10.3 to 10.8.
10.8

10.8.1 The
road
markings
shall
be
in
accordance with Section 9 of this Manual. The
road markings
for
the
Toll
Plaza area
shall
consist of lane markings,
diagonals, chevron
markings. Single centre line
is provided at the
centre of carriageway at toll gate to demarcate
each service lane. Diagonal markings for central
traffic
island and chevron markings
at
side
traffic
island
shall be provided
to guide
the
approaching and separating
traffic.
10.8.2 The
road
markings
shall
be
in
accordance
with
provision
of
IRC:35.
Thermoplastic paint with reflective glass beads
shall be used as road marking material. Typical
details of road markings at Toll Plaza are given
in Fig
10.9.
10.9
Toll Plaza Complex
10.9.1
The size of the office complex depertds
on the minimum requirement of facilities such
as toilet, bathroom, store, rest room, traffic aid
post, medical aid post, etc. All these depend on
the size of Toll Plaza and may vary as per the
need of a particular location/ area.
10.9.2 The
following
facilities
shall
be
provided
at Toll Plaza complex :-
(i)
Office complex
with
toilet, bathroom
and rest room.
(ii)

IS: 1944 (Part
I &
II) recommends 30 Lux of
average illumination on road surface and ratio
of minimum
to average
illumination
as' 0.4.
Normal low light poles are not able to give the
required
lighting
conditions.
It
is,
therefore,
necessary to install high mast. The 30 m height
of the mast
is
considered
suitable
to have
uniform spread of desired level of illumination
in
the
Toll Plaza
area
for frequent and
safe
movement of vehicles.
10.11.5 Highway Lighting
Lighting
in
100 m

A higher level of illumination upto 100 Lux by
providing
150-watt metal
halide lamps
shall
be provided
at the
toll gate and
at
toll booth
locations.
1000-watt halogen lamps
shall be
provided at the selected nodes of space frame
of the canopy
to ensure uniform illumination
of the area.
10.12

11.4
Roadside
Railings
/
Pedestrian
Guard Rails
11.4.1
Pedestrian Guard Rails
(i)
Pedestrian guardrails are an important
design
element
to
prevent
indiscriminate
crossing and
spilling
over
of
pedestrians
on
to
the
carriageway.
Their judicious
use can
help
to ensure
that
pedestrians
cross
the highway at predetermined and safe
locations.
As
the
guardrails would confine
the
movement
of
pedestrians
to
the
footpath,
it
is obligatory that sufficient
width of footpath be made
available
for the use of pedestrians.
(ii)
Design: The design
shall be such that
the
guardrails
are
neat and simple
in
appearance. The
height
of guardrail
shall be 1.2 m from footpath level. The
visibility
of the approaching
vehicles
by
the
pedestrians
as
well
as
the
visibility
of the
pedestrians by
the
drivers
of the approaching
vehicles
shall be adequate. The railings shall not
have
any
thick
horizontal member,
other than the baluster to achieve the
desired objective.
Pedestrian
guardrails may
be
of
reinforced cement concrete, iron tubes,
steel channeled sections and pipes, or
steel
sections
appropriate
for
the
environment. Refer to IRC: 103.

======================================================================
PAGE 135 of 168
======================================================================
SECTION
12
LANDSCAPING AND TREE PLANTATION
12.1
General
The Concessionaire shall plant trees and shrubs
of required number and type at the appropriate
locations within the Right of Way and
in the
land earmarked
by
the Government
for
afforestation. The Government shall specify the
number of
trees which
are
required
to be
planted by the Concessionaire as compensatory
afforestation. The Concessionaire
shall
also
maintain the trees and shrubs in good condition
during
the
Operation
Period
as
per
the
maintenance schedule. The guidelines given in
this Section shall be followed in plantation of
trees and shrubs.
12.2
Design Considerations
in various
locations
12.2.1
Set-back Distance of Trees and Other
Plantation
Trees on the roadside shall be sufficiently away
from the roadway so that they are not a hazard
to road
traffic
or
restrict
the
visibility. Most
vulnerable locations in this regard are the inside
of curves, junction comers and cut slopes. Trees
shall be placed at a minimum distance of 10-
12 m from the centre line of the extreme traffic
lane, to provide recovery area for the vehicle
that runs off the road. A second row of trees 6
m
further away
will
also be
desirable and
planted, wherever possible. Preferably, the first
row of trees shall consist of species with thick
shade and other rows of vertical growth type
providing thin shade. Expansion of the Project
Highway
to
4-lanes
shall
be
taken
into
consideration while locating the
trees so
that
land is free of trees when widening takes place.
The distances for alternative rows of trees shall
be reckoned from
the
nearest edge
of
the
pavement. No plantation
shall be allowed on
the embankment
slopes.
12.2.2
Set-back of Trees on Curves
In
plain
terrain,
a stopping
sight
distance of
180 m corresponding
to
the design speed of
100 km per hour shall be ensured on all curved
sections of state highways along the innermost
lane. However, where there are site restrictions,
their requirement may be reduced
to
120 m
corresponding
to the design speed of 80 km
per hour as a special case. The existing
trees
and vegetation on the sides have to be suitably
thinned/trimmed or even removed, if necessary,
and
a
regular programme of pruning of the
offending trees
shall be undertaken as part of
the maintenance operations.
In the urban section of the Project Highway,
trees can be planted on
the
raised
footpaths,
provided the distance between the edge of kerb
and the nearest edge of tree
is not
less than
2 m.
In
all cases, location of trees shall be checked
to ensure that to the motorists, clear visibility
of all highway signs/signals
is available
at
all
times. Also, the foliage or trees shall not come
in the way of roadway
lighting.
12.2.3
Vertical Clearance of Trees and Other
Plantations
For safe traffic operation, the vertical clearance
available across the roadway shall be minimum
5 m. From this angle, the probable size of all
115



======================================================================
PAGE 136 of 168
======================================================================
IRC:SP:73-2007
plants
shall be anticipated
in advance,
at the
time of initial planting.
To allow for the effects of growth, wind and
rain, trees shall be trimmed to 6 m and 6.5 m
above the pavement
in
rural and urban areas
respectively.
12.2.4
Spacing of Avenue Trees
The spacing of avenue
trees
will depend on
the
type and growth
characteristics of trees,
requirement of maintenance,
penetration
of
distant views,
etc. A range of 10-15 m would
meet the requirement for most
varieties.
12.2.5
Choice of Trees
The following guidelines shall be kept in view
while
selecting
the
species
of
trees
to be
planted:
(i)
Trees shall be selected with due regard
to soil, rainfall, temperature and water
level.
(ii)
Trees which become very wide
shall
be avoided as their maintenance would
cause interference with
traffic flow.
(iii) The
species
must
be
capable
of
developing
a
straight and
clean bole
upto a height of 2.5 to 3.5 m from the
ground
level.
(iv)
The selected trees shall, preferably, be
fast growing and wind-firm. These shall
not be thorny or drop too many leaves.
(v)
The
trees
shall
be
deep
rooted
as
shallow roots injure pavements.
(vi)
In urban areas, the species selected shall
be of less spreading type, so that these
do not interfere with overhead services,
clear view of signs and efficiency of
roadway
lighting.
12.3
Maintenance of Plants
The Concessionaire
shall
submit scheme
for
plantation and maintenance of plants and trees
to
the Independent Engineer
for review and
comments,
if any.

PROJECT FACILITIES
13.1
General
The requirement of the project facilities to be
provided
shall be indicated
in Schedule-C of
the Concession Agreement. This shall include
information regarding location and size of the
facilities. Land
required
for provision
of
facilities shall be acquired by the Government
and the date of handing over of the land to the
Concessionaire
shall
be
indicated
in
the
Concession Agreement.
13.2
Pedestrian
Facilities
13.2.1
General
Pedestrians are vulnerable to being involved in
accidents.
Therefore,
adequate
consideration
shall be given to their safety through provision
of facilities. The facilities for pedestrians given
in this Section shall be provided on the Project
Highway.
13.2.2
Footpath (Sidewalk)
(i)
The sidewalks shall be provided in the
built-up
sections, on
both
sides, by
barrier type (non-mountable) kerbs of
height 200 mm above the adjacent road
surface.
(ii)
The width of sidewalks depends upon
the expected pedestrian flow and shall
be fixed subject to land availability, but
shall not be less than
1.5 m.
13.2.3
Pedestrian Guard Rails
Pedestrian guardrails
shall be
as
specified
in
Section
II
of this Manual.
13.2.4
Pedestrian Crossing
Where complete
segregation
of pedestrians
from
vehicular
traffic
is
not provided, some
form of planned road sharing
principle
shall
be
applied.
Pedestrian
crossings
shall
be
provided where
they
will
be
well
used.
Pedestrian crossings shall be suitably integrated
with the overall design of the intersection.
The
following
criteria
shall
be
followed
regarding selection of pedestrian crossing:
(i)
At-Grade
Pedestrian
Crossing
(Pedestrian
Crosswalk):
Pedestrian
crosswalks
shall
be provided
at
all
important intersections and such other
locations where
substantial
conflict
exists between vehicular and pedestrian
movements. Wherever
possible,
the
crosswalks
shall be
at right angles
to
the carriageway and properly marked
so that the pedestrians are subjected to
minimum
inconvenience. Crosswalks
shall not substantially increase the walk
distance
of pedestrians. Adequate
visibility, freedom from
obstructions
and sufficient space for waiting are the
other
important
requirements
for
location of crosswalks.
At-grade
pedestrian
crossings can be
uncontrolled
or
controlled.
Uncontrolled pedestrian crossings shall
be provided only where the intersection
itself is left uncontrolled because of low
volumes
of
both
vehicular
and
pedestrian
traffic even
during peak
hours and where
accident records do
119



======================================================================
PAGE 140 of 168
======================================================================
IRC:SP:73-2007
not
indicate any need
to
segregate
vehicular traffic from cross pedestrian
traffic.
Uncontrolled
pedestrian
crosswalk shall be marked by studs or
paint hne.
Controlled form of crossing
shall be
achieved through
provision
of Zebra
Crossings, whether
at an unsignalized
or signalized intersection.
(ii)
Zebra Crossing: A Zebra Crossing shall
not be
sited within
150 m of another
such crossing. The Zebra Crossing shall
be
somewhat
set
back
from
the
carriageway line. However, the set back
distance
shall not be
so much
as
to
cause
an
appreciable
increase
in
walking
distance
for
the
pedestrians.
Pedestrian guardrails may be necessary
where
the
setback
distance
is
appreciable or
at the skew crossings.
The width of the Zebra Crossing shall
be
adequate and
shall
generally
lie
within a range of 2.0 m to 4.0 m. The
crossing
shall,
as
far
as
possible,
proceed
uninterrupted
through
the
median strip. In the event of the median
strip being used
as pedestrian refuge,
adequate
width
of median
shall be
provided.
In case of raised medians,
such
portion
could
be
suitably
depressed
with
kerb
height
not
exceeding 150 mm.
In
the
vicinity
of Zebra
crossing,
guardrails of sufficient length shall be
provided
to
deter pedestrians from
crossing the road at any arbitrary point
along the road. Fig. 13.1 gives a typical
layout
of
Zebra
Crossing
at
an
intersection
controlled
by
channelization
only.

Alternatively, photo
voltaic lamps may be used.
13.5
Bus Bays and Bus Shelters
13.5.1
General
The buses shall be allowed to stop for dropping
and picking up passengers only at the bus bays.
The Government shall indicate
in Schedule-C
of the Concession Agreement, the number and
broad location of bus bays to be provided by
the Concessionaire. The bus bays shall conform
121



======================================================================
PAGE 142 of 168
======================================================================
IRC:SP:73-2007
to the specifications and standards given in this
Section. In cases where bus stands are provided
by the concerned State Government Transport
Authorities,
the Concessionaire
shall provide
only access road within the right of way.
13.5.2
Location
The location of the bus bays shall be fixed on
the basis of following principles:
(i)
The bus stops shall be sited away from
bridges and other important structures
and embankment sections more than 3
m high.
(ii)
As far as possible, bus bays
shall not
be located on horizontal curves or
at
the summit of vertical curves.
(iii) The location shall have good visibihty,
not
less
than
the
safe
stopping
sight
distance.
(iv)
The bus bays
shall not be located too
close
to the road intersections. A gap
of 300 m from
the
tangent point of
intersections to start/end of the bus bay
shall
be
desirable.
At
minor
intersections (e.g. junctions with village
roads),
distance
of 60 m may
be
adopted. However,
if
a
substantial
volume of buses
is to turn right at the
intersection,
it is necessary that the bus
bay shall be located sufficiently ahead
of the intersection so that the buses can
be manoeuvred
easily from
the
pick-
up
stop on
the
left hand
side
to
the
extreme
right
lane
for
turning. The
location of the bus bays may be fixed
after due
consultation
with
the
local
communities
expected
to
use
such
facilities.,
(v)
At
major
four-way
intersections
involving
transfer
of
a
substantial
number of passengers from one pick-
up
stop
to
the
other,
it might
be
desirable
to
construct
a
single,
composite bus stop of suitable design
to cater to all the bus routes collectively.
(vi)
In
hilly
areas,
the bus bays
shall be
located,
preferably, where
the road
is
straight on both sides, gradients are flat
and
the
visibility
is reasonably good
(usually not less than 50 m). Subject to
these requirements,
it will be advisable
to choose locativ.iis where
it is possible
to widen the roadway economically for
accommodating bus bays.
13.5.3
Layout and Design
(i)
For plain
area,
typical
layouts of bus
bays given in Fig. 13.2 shall be adopted.
The length "L" shown in Fig. 13.2 shall
be
15 m, which
shall be increased
in
multiples of 15 m if more than one bus
is
likely to halt at the bus bay
at one
time.
(ii)
For hilly areas, where there is a general
constraint on space, the layout indicated
in Fig.
13.3 may be adopted.
(iii)
Bus bays
shall be provided on both
sides of the Project Highway for each
direction of travel independendy, so that
the buses do not have to cut across the
road. Bus bays on opposite sides shall
be staggered to a certain extent to avoid
undue congestion on the highway. At
intersections, the bus bays for up and
down

shall
be
undertaken
and
appropriate
remedial
measures
shall
be
provided
as per guidelines given

14.1.3 Where
any
new
construction/
realignment
is
involved,
the alignment
shall
avoid
large
scale
cuttings and
fillings and
follow the profile of land, as far as possible.
Areas having potential landslide or settlement
problems shall be avoided. Adverse impact on
the environment shall be reduced by adopting
proper mitigation measures.
Refer to guidelines
given
in IRC:SP: 48.
14.1.4

of protective
structures
for
traffic such as parapets, railings, roadside safety
barriers, boulder nets,
etc.
shall be provided,
where necessary.
14.2
Set back
distance
at
horizontal
curves
Requisite
sight
distance
should be
available
across the inside of horizontal curves.
Lack of
visibility in the lateral direction may arise due
to obstructions like walls, cut-slopes, wooded
areas,
etc.
Set back distance from the central
line
of the
carriageway,
within which
the
offending
obstructions
should be cleared
to
ensure the needed visibility, can be determined
using the Equation given
in IRC:52.
14.3
Grade compensation at curves
At horizontal curves, the gradient shall be eased
by applying the grade compensation correction
for gradients
steeper than 4%
in accordance
with IRC:52.
14.4
Hairpin Bends
Hairpin
bends, where
unavoidable, may be
designed
either
as
a
circular curve
with
transition curves at each end or as a compound
circular curve.
Design criteria given in IRC:52 shall be adopted
for the design of hairpin bends. At hairpin bends
the full roadway width should be surfaced.
