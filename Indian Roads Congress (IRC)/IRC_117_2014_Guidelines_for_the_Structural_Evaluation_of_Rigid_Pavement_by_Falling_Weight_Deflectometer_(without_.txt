Guidelines  for  the  Structural  Evaluation   
of  Rigid  Pavement
by
Falling Weight Deflectometer
1  Introduction
1.1	
A large number of cement concrete pavements have been constructed in India on 
all categories of roads in order to have durable maintenance free roads even under adverse 
moisture and heavy traffic conditions. The moduli of subgrade reaction (k) are usually adopted 
from their correlation with CBR values recommended in Portland Cement Association 
(PCA) Manual of USA. A stiff subbase of DLC covered with a plastic sheet has a very high 
modulus of subgrade reaction not found in any international guideline. The modulus of 
subgrade reaction (k) over the layer recommended in IRC:58-2011 has been computed 
based on a theoretical approach given in AASHTO Guide for Design of pavement structures, 
1993. Its validity is yet to be established. The pavement might be over designed or under 
designed. It is necessary to determine the actual pavement design parameters such as 
strength of concrete and modulus of subgrade reaction by back calculation from field tests 
after the construction and reassess actual life of the pavement. Properties of different layers 
also can be determined by using analytical tools. One of the most difficult exercises for a 
pavement engineer is analyzing deflection data collected with a falling weight deflectometer 
though FWDs have been in use for over 30 years, the methods to process the data are far 
from perfect. Engineers, based on the deflection, their experience and judgement, can take 
appropriate measures to prevent continuing damage to concrete pavements.
The draft “Guidelines for the Structural Evaluation of Rigid Pavement by Falling Weight 
Deflectometer” was prepared by the Sub-group comprising Shri R.K. Jain, Shri Satander 
Kumar, Dr. B.B. Pandey and Col. V.K. Ganju.  The Committee deliberated on the draft 
document in a series of meetings.  The H-3 Committee finally approved the draft document 
in its meeting held on 19th June, 2014  and authorized the Convenor, H-3 Committee to 
send the final draft for placing before the HSS Committee.  The Highways Specifications & 
Standards Committee (HSS) approved the draft document in its meeting held on 9th August, 
2014. The Executive Committee in its meeting held on 18th August, 2014 approved the same 
document for placing it before the Council. The Council in its 203rd meeting held at New Delhi 
on 19th August, 2014 approved the draft “Guidelines for the Structural Evaluation of Rigid 
Pavement by Falling Weight Deflectometer” for publishing.

1.2	
A good number of panels of concrete pavements display cracks at corners and 
along longitudinal and transverse joints within five years of their construction (Photos 1 
and 2) though the thicknesses were large enough to prevent flexural cracking caused by 
combined effect of stresses due to heavy axle loads and temperature gradients. A major 
cause of damage to a concrete pavement is due to the permanent deformation caused to 
granular layers and the subgrade due to the heavy vehicles operating on highways. The 
location of voids below the pavement caused by the settlement of the lower layers must 
be found out and filled up as early as possible. Conditions of dowel bars at the transverse 
joints and tie bars at longitudinal and shoulder joints should be evaluated from time to time 
to determine the load transfer efficiency of joints by FWD so that retrofitting of the dowel and 
tie bars can be done before the pavement slabs are damaged.
1.3	
It is desirable to carry out theoretical analysis of multi layer rigid pavements by 
finite element method to determine pressure on the subgrade soils and estimate the extent 
of voids formation below the concrete pavements due to heavy loads. Since a Dry Lean 
Concrete cannot be treated like Winkler’s foundation, a more refined method considering a

concrete pavement and DLC resting on Winkler foundation is more appropriate for checking 
the safety of the pavement.
Photo 1  Longitudinal Cracks
Photo 2  Corner Cracks
2  Scope
2.1	
These guidelines are meant for evaluating the structural condition of in-service 
rigid pavements using Falling Weight Deflectometer and for estimating the strength of the 
pavement concrete as well as the modulus of the subgrade reaction so that the capacity of 
the pavement to with stand future traffic loading i.e. balance life of the pavement, can be 
determined using cumulative fatigue damage principle as laid down in IRC:58-2011.
2.2	
Structural evaluation exercise should include load transfer at the transverse 
and longitudinal joints so that necessary measures may be taken to retrofit dowel and tie 
bars before extensive damage occurs. The deflection data can be used to detect voids at 
transverse joints, longitudinal joints, interiors as well as at the corners so that actions can be 
taken to fill up the voids by grouting to prevent large scale damage to pavements.
2.3 
Method for filling of voids detected by FWD testing or by any other means like 
GPR etc. by cement grouting and for retrofitting of dowel bars/tie bars has been described in 
Appendix - I.
2.4	
These guidelines may require revision from time-to-time in the light of experience 
and developments in the field. Towards this end, it is suggested that to all the organizations 
using the guidelines should keep a detailed record of periodical measurements, performance, 
traffic, climatic condition, etc. and provide feedback to the Indian Roads Congress for further 
revision.
3  Construction  History
Before the evaluation process begins, following types of data are to be collected:
	
i)	
Month and the year of construction
 
ii) 
Traffic considered in pavement design
	
iii)	
Thickness and strength of pavement concrete

Traffic data for the highway under consideration should be collected since its characteristics 
may change after the completion of the project.
4.1	
Axle Load Survey
Pattern 
of 
commercial 
vehicles 
has 
undergone 
a 
sea 
change 
during 
the 
last decade. Number of tandem and tridem axles on major highways have 
increased considerably while share of single axle load with dual wheel has decreased. The 
legal axle load limits in India are fixed as 10.2, 18 and 24 tonnes for single axles, tandem 
axles and tridem axles respectively. Each of the axles have dual wheels on either side. A 
large number of axles operating on National Highways carry much higher loads than the 
legal limits. Data on axle load distribution of the commercial vehicles is required to compute 
the number of repetitions of single, tandem and tridem axles carrying different loads. Axle 
load survey may be conducted for 48 hours both in day as well as in night hours, covering 
a minimum sample size of 10 percent in both the directions as laid down in IRC:58-2011. 
Heavy axle loads induce very high flexural stresses in the pavement slab resulting in large 
consumption of fatigue resistance of concrete. They also transmit very high pressure on 
the subgrade and subbase causing permanent deformation in the granular and subgrade 
soils.
4.2	
Axle Load Spectrum
Spectrum of axle load should be determined for single, tandem, tridem and multi-axle loads 
for the evaluation of safety of pavement from cracking and evaluation of the remaining life 
of a concrete pavement from the consideration of cumulative fatigue damage. The following 
load intervals for each class of axle load, as prescribed in Clause 5.2 of IRC:58-2011 should 
be as follows:
	
Single axle	
---	
10 kN
	
Tandem axle	
---	
20 kN
	
Tridem axle	
---	
30 kN
After the collection of axle load data, they may be tabulated as per the format shown in 
Table 1 for the computation of fatigue damage till the time of the test and the remaining life 
of the pavement. Additional columns have to be added for including the fatigue damage 
analysis for each category of axle loads.

The buses and light vehicles like pickups will not contribute to fatigue damage and hence 
they be ignored in the analysis.
The cumulative number of repetitions of axles at the time of structural evaluation of the 
pavement may be computed from the following formula:
	
	
	
C = 

... 1
Where,
	
C	
=	
Cumulative number of axles, for estimating fatigue damage at the time 
	
of FWD test. C can be determined for different values of n to determine 
 
the remaining life. C has to be further classified into repetitions of axle 
	
loads based on their weight as shown in Table 1.
	
A	
=	
Initial number of axles per day in the year when the road is operational.
 
r 
= 
Annual rate of growth of commercial traffic (expressed in decimals) from 
	
actual data collected after the construction.
	
n	
=	
Period in years after the construction.
Expected number of applications of different axle load groups at the time of evaluation can 
be estimated from the axle load spectrum.
5  Falling  Weight  Deflectometer
5.1 
Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) is an impulse-loading device in which a 
transient load is applied to the pavement and the deflected shape of the pavement surface 
is measured. The working principle of a typical FWD is illustrated in Fig. 1. D0, D1, D2 
and D3 mentioned in Fig. 1 are surface deflections required at radial distances of 0 mm, 
300 mm, 600 mm and 900 mm for determination of pavement design parameters. Impulse 
load is applied by means of a falling mass, which is allowed to drop vertically on a system of 
springs placed over a circular loading plate. The deflections are measured using displacement 



======================================================================

IRC:117-2014

sensors as shown in Fig 1. Trailer mounted as well as vehicle mounted FWD models are 
available commercially. The working principle of all these FWD models is essentially the 
same. A mass of weights is dropped from a pre-determined height onto a series of springs/
buffers placed on top of a loading plate. The corresponding peak load and peak vertical 
surface deflections at different radial locations are measured and recorded.
Fig. 1  Working Principle of Falling Weight Deflectometer
5.2	
Different magnitudes of impulse load can be obtained by selection of a suitable 
mass and an appropriate height of fall. Under the application of the impulse load, the 
pavement deflects. Velocity transducers are placed on the pavement surface at different 
radial locations to measure surface deflections. Geophones or seismometers are used as 
displacement transducers. Load and deflection data are acquired with the help of a data 
acquisition system.
5.3 
A typical Falling Weight Deflectometers (FWD) include a circular loading plate of 
300 to 450 mm diameter. 300 mm diameter load plate is recommended in these guidelines 
for evaluation of rigid pavements. A rubber pad of 5 mm minimum thickness is glued to the 
bottom of the loading plate for uniform distribution of load.
5.4	
A falling mass in the range of 50 to 350 kg is dropped from a height of fall in the 
range of 100 to 600 mm to produce load pulses of desired peak load and duration. Heavier 
models use falling mass in the range of 200 to 700 kg. The target peak load in the range of 
40 kN to 60 kN or higher may be applied on concrete pavements to get a reasonable deflection 
of the order of 0.50 mm since pavements of major highways in India consisting of 150 mm 
DLC and 300 mm PQC are very stiff and a higher load may be required to get a deflection of 
about 0.15 mm.
5.5	
Calibration of the FWD: For producing reproducible results, the FWD should be 
calibrated. The calibration procedure has been described in details in the IRC:115-2014.
6  Pavement  Evaluation  Process
6.1	
Pavement condition survey of the entire project length shall precede the actual 
deflection test by FWD. A suggested format for Pavement Condition Survey is given in

Appendix - II. It will consist of visual observations of cracking and faulting if any. Ground 
Penetrating Radar (GPR) may be used to determine the thickness of pavements in a short 
time and to locate approximately the areas where voids may have formed below the pavement 
slab which can be confirmed by FWD deflection tests at a later stage. FWD deflection data 
may be collected at interiors, corners, transverse joints and longitudinal joints in the outer 
lane at intervals of 500 m. Heavy loads travel mostly in outer lanes and very often greater 
distresses also are found in the outer lanes. If there are distresses in the inner lanes also, 
FWD test should be done in those lanes also. The loading positions are shown in Fig. 2.
Fig. 2  Load Positions for Corner, Interior, Transverse and Longitudinal Shoulder Joints
For two way two lane roads, both lanes have to be tested for corner, edge, interior, transverse 
and longitudinal joint loading. Single lane roads are usually provided on low volume roads and 
FWD test on such pavements are not necessary. Spacing for tests can be lower depending 
upon the condition of pavements. For the evaluation of the modulus of subgrade reaction 
as well as strength of pavement concrete, it is necessary that the test be carried out at the 
interior when the temperature gradient is zero or negative when top surface is cooler than 
the bottom and the central portion of the pavement slab is in full contact with the foundation. 
During the day time, the surface is hotter than the bottom and the slab will curl up forming a 
convex surface with raised central region as shown in Fig. 3(a). The test in the raised part 
will show high deflection. The edges will be resting on the foundation. Similarly, edges will get 
raised during the night and test at the edge will give large deflections as shown in Fig. 3(b). 
These factors should be considered while carrying out the test.

For two lane roads without concrete shoulder, test should be carried out at the corner, interior 
and edge positions. When there are no dowel bars, tests as the transverse joints should be 
carried out in the morning hours to determine the load transfer due to aggregate interlock 
when the joint opening will be higher because of contraction of slabs at lower temperatures.
6.2	
Surface Temperature Measurement
Ideally, the pavement temperature will be recorded directly from temperature holes at each 
test location as the FWD test is being performed. While this is the preferred approach for 
research projects, it is not practical for production level testing (network level or maintenance 
and rehabilitation projects). Therefore, for production level testing the economic and practical 
approach is by measuring the surface temperature at each test location. This can be easily 
done using an infrared thermometer. The FWD can automatically measure and record the 
pavement surface temperature to the FWD file. If the FWD is not equipped with an Infrared 
thermometer, then the FWD operator can use a hand held thermometer and record the 
temperature to a file. By measuring and monitoring the surface temperature during testing, 
the FWD operator can suspend testing if the pavement becomes too hot (>40ºC).

Evaluation of Subgrade Modulus, Elastic Modulus of Concrete and Strength 
of Pavement Concrete
Step by step procedure:
 
1. 
FWD test should be done and deflection at 0 mm, 300 mm, 600 mm and 
900 mm radial distances from the centre of loading point should be 
measured.
 
2. 
The area parameter of deflection basin should be calculated using following 
formulae-

D1

Deflection in mm at 300 mm from centre of the loading plate
 
D2 
= 
Deflection in mm at 600 mm inch from centre of the loading plate
 
D3 
= 
Deflection in mm at 900 mm from centre of the loading plate
	
	
The value of A is about 11.8 for a single layer elastic half space (pavement 
and soil has the same elastic modulus) while for an extremely rigid layer 
with a very high elastic modulus (D0=D1=D2=D3),the value of A is 36. For a 
concrete pavement, A will be less than 36.
 
3. 
From area of deflection basin, Radius of relative stiffness (l) can be evaluated 
from the charts given in References 1 and 2. The excel sheet provided with 
the guidelines uses the chart in equation form and it gives directly the value 
of l.

After finding the Radius of relative stiffness, normalised deflections (di) 
are calculated using various equations formed from the charts given in 
References 1 and 2. The excel sheet directly gives the values of the 
normalised deflections.
	
5.	
Subgrade modulus value can be found by following formulae for different 
normalised deflections and average of all should be taken as subgrade 
modulus.

Note: The concrete properties (Ec, fc, fmr) estimated are for the age of concrete at the time of FWD 
test. The strength values obtained from the computed elastic modulus are based on statistical 
correlation from laboratory tests and they are approximate. Exact values of strength of concrete 
may be determined from cores for verification.

Fatigue Behaviour of Cement Concrete
IRC:58-2011 gives the fatigue equations (Cl 5.8.6) that should be used for the evaluation of 
fatigue life. Computed values for modulus of rupture and modulus of subgrade reaction are 
to be used in fatigue damage analysis.
The relation between fatigue life (N) and stress ratio is given as:

... 9
The computation indicates that contribution to CFD for bottom up cracking is significant only 
during 10 A.M to 4 P.M because of higher stresses due to simultaneous action of wheel load 
and positive temperature gradient. For the top down cracking, only the CFD during the period 
between 0 A.M to 6 A.M is important. Various locations may have different behaviour and 
designers may examine this aspect.
Stress ratio can be obtained from the ratio of axle load stress and the computed modulus 
of rupture from the FWD test as illustrated in the Appendix I. Excel Sheet format given in 
IRC:58-2011 can be used for the evaluation of the fatigue life consumed till the date of the 
test and the remaining life of the pavement can easily be estimated. Sum of the fatigue lives 
consumed for bottom up cracking as well as for top down cracking should be less than 1.0 to 
ensure that the estimation of the pavement life is more conservative since cracks appearing 
on the surface could have started from the top or from the bottom.
7  Causes  of Early  Cracking  of  Concrete  Pavements
7.1	
Single axle loads cause higher bending stresses in pavement slabs while tandem 
and tridem axles carrying double and triple load of that carried out by singe axle cause lower 
bending stresses due to superposition of positive and negative bending moments. But vertical 
stresses on the granular and the subgrade soil are very large due to heavily loaded multi-axle 
vehicles. Tandem axles weighing as much as 400 kN (legal limit = 19 tons i.e. 186.2 kN) and 
tridem axles far above the legal limits are common on heavy duty corridors. The pavement 



======================================================================
PAGE 18 of 27
======================================================================

IRC:117-2014
11
slabs designed as per IRC:58-2011 are safe for cracking due to flexural tensile stresses 
against overloaded trucks since this is considered in the fatigue damage analysis.
Heavy axle loads, cause high vertical stresses on the granular layer and the subgrade resulting 
in accumulation of permanent deformation with time forming voids below the slabs. The voids 
can be at the corner edge, transverse and longitudinal joints or in the interior of cement 
concrete slab. The stresses can be very high when a part of the slab is unsupported near a 
void. More water can accumulate in the voids and fast moving heavy loads may cause high 
pressure in the confined water causing serious erosion of soil and granular material which 
will increase the size of the voids further. Cracks will appear in those places due to repeated 
bending of unsupported slab causing early damage to pavement slabs. It is necessary to 
detect the voids early and grout it with cement mortar to fill up the voids. If GPR is available, 
locations identified by GPR can be tested with FWD to confirm the existence of voids since 
interpretation of GPR data may not be very precise.
8  Detection of  Voids  Underneath  the  Rigid  Pavement
Detection of voids below a pavement slab can easily be done by a Falling Weight Deflectometer. 
Deflections are measured along the wheel path and a plot of central deflection vs distance 
has to be made.
The locations where the deflections are much higher (Fig. 4) than the normal may indicate 
presence of voids. Drilling and grouting with cement-mortar slurry may make the pavement 
safe.
Fig. 4  Deflection Data Along a Highway
FWD Tests should be done during the period when the pavements are not in curled conditions. 
In winter, time available for test may be longer. Conditions in India vary markedly with 
geographical locations and local experience should be the guiding principle for tests. If FWD 



======================================================================

tests are done on a pavement slab over a void and a slab without any void at different load 
levels such as 40 kN, 50 kN, 60 kN and 70 kN or 80 kN and the results may appear as shown 
in Fig. 5. The Y-axis shows the maximum deflections under different loads. This is another 
way to differentiate Pavement slabs with and without voids below it.
Fig. 5  FWD Test on Area with and Without Void
9  Evaluation  of  Load  Transfer  Efficiency  of  Joints
Transverse as well as longitudinal joints deteriorate with traffic due to continuous loading. 
The proper load transfer at joints has to be maintained for a good functioning of pavements. 
For a new pavement, the joint efficiency is nearly 100 percent since the deflections on 
either side of joint under a wheel load are almost equal and the ratio decreases as the joints 
deteriorate under repeated loading. Photo 3 shows loading plate of an FWD stationed close 
to a longitudinal joint near the shoulder of a four lane highway in India.
When deflection sensors are at the either side of a joint with deflections D1 and D2 on the 
loaded and unloaded sides as shown in Fig. 6, the Load Transfer Efficiency (LTE) is defined 
as:
	
	
LTE = 100 (D2/D1)

Condition of joints
For a new pavement, D1 = D2 but D2 becomes less and less as the joints deteriorate.
If	
D2/D1 < 0.5 transverse joints in critical condition
If	
D2/D1 < 0.4 longitudinal joints in critical condition
Where,
	
D1 is the deflection on the loaded side of the slab
	
And D2 is the deflection on the unloaded side of the slab
If the above conditions are reached, retrofitting of dowel and tie bars are recommended, as 
prescribed in IRC:SP:83. The above deflections can be measured by FWD.
If the deflection sensors are 300 mm apart during the FWD tests as shown in Fig. 7, the Load 
Transfer Efficiency is determined from equation given as:
	
	
	
LTE = 100 B (D2/D1)
... 11
Where,
	
B lies between 1.05 and 1.15. A typical value of 1.05 may be adopted (2). If the 
LTE values are too low, retrofitting of dowel bar and tie bars are recommended 
before large scale deterioration occurs. Tests should be carried out across the 
cracks also to examine the load transfer across them. This will help in establishing 
whether the cracks extended to full depth.

Extract of Typical test results of FWD testing for load transfer efficiency of transverse joints 
conducted by Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) on NH-2 are given in Appendix - IV.

10  Frequency  of  Test
Tests for structural evaluation should be repeated between three and five years for assessing 
the health of the rigid pavements so that appropriate action is taken timely to prevent 
distress.

Filling of Voids in Rigid Pavement
1.1	
General: A major cause of damage to the concrete pavement is due to the 
permanent settlement/deformation caused to granular layers and the subgrade due to 
heavy vehicles operating on highways within 3 to 5 years of its construction. Although the 
design thickness of pavement can withstand the combined effect of stresses due to heavy 
axle loads and temperature gradient, but the voids created due to permanent settlement 
of the lower layers and curling of pavement create additional stresses causing longitudinal 
transverse cracking during day time and corner cracking during the night time. It is therefore 
recommended that detection of voids underneath the Rigid Pavement is done as described 
in Section 8 on a regular interval of 3 to 5 years or when such longitudinal/transverse/corner 
cracks start appearing on the rigid pavement.
1.2	
Grouting Process
	
i)	
Holes of 12 to 15 mm dia are drilled up to the bottom of the DLC at 1 m 
square interval over the whole area of voids to be filled under the slab.
	
ii)	
Compressed air is blown into the holes to remove loose debris and water 
etc.
	
iii)	
The holes are temporarily plugged and the slab surface is swept to clean.
	
iv)	
Grout material is injected in each hole at a pressure of 0.35 N/mm2 until the 
voids accept no more grout or flow up through an adjacent hole.
 
v) 
For early and fast flow of grout and to minimise air beneath the PQC two 
holes are drilled, vacuum pump may be used for sucking air from second 
hole.
	
vi)	
Sides of injection holes are roughened and cleaned and filled with 	
polymerized fine concrete or epoxy mortar.
 
vii) 
Traffic is opened only after minimum appropriate curing time for the grout.

Pavement in IRC:SP:83-2008.

Example: An FWD test was conducted on a 300 mm thick concrete pavement. The radius of 
FWD plate is 150 mm and recorded maximum load is 50 kN. Sensors were located at 0, 300, 
600 and 900 mm and corresponding deflections recorded are 0.080, 0.075, 0.065, 0.055 mm. 
It is assumed that concrete has Poisson’s ratio of 0.15. Determine subgrade modulus and 
elastic modulus of concrete when subgrade is considered as liquid (Winkler) foundation.
Solution: Changing the following values in excel sheet specified for subgrade modulus 
calculation we can easily get the subgrade and elastic modulus of concrete:
Radius of loading plate (a), mm 	
=	 150
	
Load (P),kN

Poisson ratio for subgrade (µr)	
=	 0.45
	
Thickness of the concrete slab h (mm)

Deflection measured at 0 mm distance from the center of the load area 
=  0.08 mm
Deflection measured at 300 mm distance from the center of the load area  = 0.075 mm
Deflection measured at 600 mm distance from the center of the load area = 0.065 mm
Deflection measured at 900 mm distance from the center of the load area = 0.056 mm
Using excel sheet.
The modulus of Subgrade reaction	
=	 78 MPa/m
K value for design is to be taken as 50% of 78 MPa/m as per the AASHTO 93 since only static 
k value is to be used or design, k = 39 MPa/m
Elastic modulus of concrete in MPa	
=	 32908 MPa
Compressive strength of concrete (cube)	
=	 43.32 MPa
Flexural strength
