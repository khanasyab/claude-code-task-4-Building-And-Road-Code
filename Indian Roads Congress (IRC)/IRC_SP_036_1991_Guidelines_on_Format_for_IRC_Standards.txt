GUIDELINES ON FORMAT FOR IRC
STANDARDS
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1.
It has been felt that Standards and Specilications brought
out by the Indian Roads Congress should follow an uniform for-
mat and be consistent in contents. The following general guidance
shall be followed unless there are definite reasons to the contrary.
In preparing the draft, care shall be taken to ensure that the Stan-
dard is not at variance with the contents of other published IRC
Standards Qn linked subjects. In case, for good reasons, a depar-
ture from
earlier practice becomes necessary,
action
shall be
initiated to examine and reconcile the difference and carr>' out
amendments to the earlier standards also.
1.2. Standards shall cover the necessary technical provisions
relating
to
the
subject
and
avoid
unnecessary
details
and
repetitioa
1 .3. The Guidelines on Format for IRC Standards was initially
prepared by IRC Secretariat and placed before the Highways
Specifications and Standards Committee and Bridge
Specifi-
cations and Standards Committee in their meetings held on 7th
April, 1989 and 5th and 6th April, 1990 respectively. The Highways
Specifications and Standards Committee had suggested^ slight
modifications
and
the
same
were
incorporated.
The
draft
guidelines were then placed before the Executive Committee in
their meeting held on 30th August, 1990 and approved subject to
certain
modifications
suggested
by
Shri
N.V.
Merani.
The
Guidelines were finally approved by the Council in their meeting
held on 8th December, 1990 at Calcutta.
1.4. The following suggested format may be adopted by all the
drafting Committees. The actual contents of the Standards ie.
Codes/Speciflcations/Guidehnes/Special
Publications
will
be
decided by the Committee depending on the applicability of the
particular item listed in the suggested format

======================================================================
4. INTRODUCTION
It should contain the following:
(a)
The origin of the request for the Standard
(b)
Brief history relating to the preparation of the standard, composition
of Committees, Sub Committees and Panel constituted with specific
work. The membership of the Committees shall be based on the date
of finalisation of the Standard. IRC Secretariat will normally 4ook
after the work of listing the Committee Members.
(c)
Any special features in the Standard,
(d)
Other matters relevant to the Standard, such as source ofinformation
on which the Standard is based, the relevant Standards which have
been referred to including IRC Standards and the other Standards on
the same or similar subjects published earlier.
5. SCOPE
A clear statement of the scope of the Standard shall be made
indicating the field covered by the Standard The subject matter of
the Standard shall be kept strictly within the limits so outlined To
avoid ambiguity in the interpretation of the scope, it is sometimes
useful to state explicitly what is excluded
6. NOTATIONS
The Notations contained in the Standard should conform to
the IRC
: 71-1977 ^Recommended Practice for Preparation of
Notations*.
7. TERMINOLOGY/DEFINITIONS
Technical terms and abbreviations used in a Standard shall be
those defined in the relevant Indian Roads Congress/Indian Stan-
dards on terminology of the particular subject in question, if such
exists, otherwise, they should follow the best trade practices in
India, keeping in mind international standards and accepted
usage abroad.
When definitions of terms and abbreviations are included in a
Standard they shall be prefaced by the words Tor the purpose of
this standard, the following definitions and/or abbreviations shall
apply'.
Terms and
definitions
shall be
listed
in the
alphabetical
order.
3



======================================================================
PAGE 10 of 16
======================================================================
Definitions shall be unambiguous, precise and given in des-
criptive form.
8. SPECIFICATIONS
Specification clauses shall be as self-contained as possible. The
language to be used should be such as to distinguish whether a
particular provision is 'obligatory', 'optional' or 'recommendatory'
and 'informative'
e.g. 'preferable', 'as far as possible', 'shall be',
'may be' etc. The sequence of their appearance in a standard and
their grouping
shall be decided according
to
actual
require-
ments.
9. PARAGRAPHING AND NUMBERING
For convenience in reference, the text of a Standard shall be
numbered in the international form of Indian numerals and
subdivided
For the purpose of numbering, the Standard shall have the
following divisions:
(i) Item: A major subdivision of the subject matter ofthe Stan-
dard. Items of a Standard shall be numbered in numerals in con-
secutive order.
(ii) Clause: A subdivision of the item. Clauses shall be num-
bered in numerals and shall contain two numbers separated by a
full stop, the first number being the number of the item and the
second
being
that
of
the
clause
numbered
in
consecutive
order.
(iii) Sub-Clause: An aspect of the subject matter of a clause
requiring separate treatment Sub-clause shall be numbered in
numerals and shall contain three numbers separated by full stops,
the first two numbers being those of item and clause respectively,
and the last one being that ofthe sub-clause numbered in consecu-
tive order.
(iv) Sub"subclause: A subdivision under a sub-clause. Sub-
subclause shall be numbered in numerals and shall contain four
numbers separated by
full stops the
first three numbers being
those of the item, clause and sub-clause respectively and last one
being
that
of
the
sub-subclause
numbered
in
consecutive
order.

======================================================================
PAGE 11 of 16
======================================================================
In numbering items, clauses, sub-clauses and sub-subclauses,
care shall be taken that ideas having same status are numbered at
the same level and that a given idea is not split up into too many
unnecessary subdivisions.
10. APPENDICES
Any matter, such as description of a lengthy test method, dis-
cussion of any of the requirements of the Standard or its basis not
included in clauses and any other matter, which is not suitable for
the text of the Standard but is of general interest or assistance in
the use of the Standard shall be given as an Appendix.
Immediately under Xh^ Appendix designation, reference to the
relevant clause or clauses of the standard shall be given in brac-
kets, followed by the title of the Appendix.
11. TABLES
Tables
shall be used wherever tabular presentation would
eliminate repetition or show relationships clearly. Tables may be
of the formal or informal type. The formal type should be used
where large amount of data is presented and which is likely to be
examined as a separate unit or referred to elsewhere in the text
The informal type should be used where a small amount of
material is presented as an integral part of the text
Captions in capitals shall be placed at the top of all formal
Tables which shall be numbered in numerals in one consecutive
series
in
a
given
Standard,
including Tables
in Appendices.
Grouping of Tables as Table 1-A, Table 1-B should be avoided
unless they are very closely related and cannot conveniently be
consolidated in one Table or made two separate Tables.
All formal Tables should be separated from the rest of the text
with thick line across the page one at the top and the other similarly
at the bottom of the Table. It is desirable to give Clause numbers
below the heading of Tables and Figures in brackets.
As a general rule, the Table may be placed as near the first
reference to it as possible without breaking it into the middle of the
paragraph.
In general, footnote to the Tables should be avoided Where it
is necessary to use footnote to formal Tables they shall be in
5



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 16
======================================================================
smaller type placed immediately above the bottom thick line and
shall be intended To indicate reference to footnote
asterisks,
daggers, another small symbol should be used, but, where there is a
large number of footnotes to a Table, superscript numerals in one
consecutive series may be used
12. ILLUSTRATIONS
Diagrams,
maps,
graphs,
photographs
and
drawings
in
perspective in isometric or in third angle projection shall be used
wherever it is thus possible to illustrate an idea more clearly.
Illustrations fall into two classes,
viz.
(a)
Line drawing^,
(b)
Half-tones
Line drawings:
should
be made
in
black
Indian
ink on
superior white drawing paper or tracing cloth. Blue-prints are of
no use for reproduction and black line prints are also unsatis-
factory«
Line drawings are generally classified into two categories:
(a)
Diagrams which go into the body of the Standard; and
(b)
Plates which are generally on separate large size sheets.
Diagrams: The matter for the standard is printed in 10 pt size
type (nearly 1.5mm in height); therefore the written matter in
diagrams should be so made that the size of the
letter when
reduced for reproduction should be about 1.5mm. The printed
area
of a page measures
170 mm deep and
108 mm wide.
Therefore, the ultimate size of such drawings will not generally be
more than 127 mm x 100 mm. Thus, ifa diagram is to be reduced to
one quarter ofthe size submitted by the Committee the lettering on
it should not be less than 6 mm in height.
Plates: Plates should preferably be prepared in widths that are
multiples of 190 mm The size of letters used in the Plate should be
so chosen that after reduction no letter would be less than 1.5 mm
size. Thus if the width is 380 mm, the minimum size of the letter
should be 3 mm. The thickness of the letter should also stand cor-
responding reduction. The title should be in the right hand bottom
comer in letters of such size that when reduced, the size will be at
least 3 mm.
Scale should be drawn in the Plate below the title to admit of
reduction of drawings without altering the correct relation of the
6



======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 16
======================================================================
scale of the drawing. Mere mention of the scale thus *Scale of 1/100
(1 cm = Im)' should be avoided as this would be incorrect when
size of the plate
is reduced photographically.
Coloured inks should not be used When
it is desired to dis-
tinguish lines, dotted or chain dotted lines should be used instead
of colours.
From the standpoint of pleasing appearance, a rectangular
graph or drawing with proportions between 3 by 5 and 3 by 4 is to
be preferred to a square one.
The appearance and effectiveness of a graph depend in a large
measure on the relative thickness of lines used in its component
parts. The thickest line should be used for the principal curve. If
several curves are presented on the same graph, the line width
used for curves should be less than that used when a single curve is
presented. Co-ordinate rulings should be the narrowest in thick-
ness. Principal reference lines such as the axes should be wider
than other rulings but narrower than curves. For the size of reduc-
tion that is usually adopted for the Standard it is considered that
the thickest line when finally reduced should not be more than
IVi points,
i.e.
1 mm width.
"Half-tones" are ordinary photographs and it is necessary to
see that prints are
clear,
slightly over-printed and preferably
glazed Only black and white photos be submitted as coloured
photos
generally do
not
give good
results
in
printing. Also
photographs which are dim or out of focus do not come out dis-
tinctly in reproduction and make a bad "half-tone". Negatives
should accompany the photographs whenever possible. Captions
should be written on the back of prints in soft pencil.
All
illustration
in
a given Standard shall be designated as
figure
(figures) and consecutively numbered in numerals. Group-
ing of figures as 1-A B shall be avoided to extent where a figure
illustrates a number, of parts relating to the same object Captions
shall be placed at the bottom of figures. In the script, initial letter of
all the principal words shall be in capital.
In preparing the originals, captions shall be typed or neatly
printed in hand on the back of the figures in full or in part but the
full
text of
all
the captions
shall be included
in
the manu-
script.

======================================================================

======================================================================
Each figure shall be placed as near the reference to it in the text
as possible without needlessly breaking into the middle of a
paragraph. Necessity for turning over a page to refer to figure
shall be avoided
12. UNITS OF MEASURE
SI units shall be used in all the Standards.
