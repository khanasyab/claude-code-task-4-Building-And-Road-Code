Alternative Standards and Specifications
Where alternative standards and specifications are intended to be used
in accordance with
Para
1.9,
all such proposals shall be submitted by the Concessionaire to the Independent
Engineer
together
with
certification
and
details
mentioned
in
Para
1.9.
In
case,
the
Independent Engineer is of the opinion that the proposal submitted by the Concessionaire is
not in conformity with any of the International Standards or Codes or evidence by successful
performance, then he will record his reasons and convey the same to the Concessionaire
for compliance. A record
shall be kept by the Independent Engineer,
of non-compliance,
if any, by the Concessionaire. Adverse consequences,
if any arising from adoption of any
such alternative proposals shall be treated as "Concessionaire Default" and shall be dealt in
accordance with the provisions of the Concession Agreement.
1.12
Guidelines for Preparing Schedules of the Concession Agreement
Certain paras
(fully or part)
in Sections
1
to 14 of this Manual
refer to the Schedules of
the Concession Agreement. While
finalizing
the
feasibility/project
report
for the
Project
Highway, and the scope of the project, each of these paras should be carefully examined and
addressed by the Authority with a view to making appropriate provisions in the Schedules of
the Concession Agreement.
1.13
General considerations for Planning, Design and Construction
The
Project Highway shall be planned as a
"partially access controlled highway" where
access to the highway shall be provided only at pre-determined locations.
In doing so, the
Concessionaire shall take measures to overcome the physical and operational constraints
and plan, design and construct the Project Highway using appropriate methods, management
techniques and technologies. The objective therefore is to construct a 4-lane highway for all
road users as an active infrastructure facility for people for their safety and services and as a
catalyst in development of economy based on an inclusive approach.
General considerations shall, without being limited to, be as follows:-
a)
The constraints
The physical constraints in the existing highway are in the form of limitation of
right of way, un-regulated access, inadequate service roads and underpasses,
numerous at-grade junctions, lack of physical separation between local and
through
traffic etc. The operation constraints arise out of the necessity or
possibility of closing a portion of the road for construction and/or diverting
the traffic to temporary diversions, thereby reducing the capacity and safety
of the existing highway. The solutions evolved by the Concessionaire shall
be such that these operational constraints are overcome through appropriate
planning, design and construction method, techniques and technologies and
by adopting suitable traffic management measures.

b)
Safety of design
All designs shall be safe to ensure that the Project Highway or any part thereof
(for example embankment, pavement, retaining structures, bridges, culverts,
etc) does not collapse (global stability) nor its serviceability/performance (for
example settlement, roughness, undulations, deflections, etc) deteriorates
below acceptable
level as prescribed
in Schedule
'K' of the Concession
Agreement.
c)
Durability
The Project Highway shall not only be safe but also durable. This would mean
that the deteriorating effects of climate and environment (for example wetting
and
drying,
freezing and thawing,
if applicable, temperature
differences,
aggressive environment leading to corrosion, etc.)
in addition to the traffic
shall be duly considered
in design and construction
to make the Project
Highway durable.
d)
Mitigating disruptive effects of construction

INTERSECTIONS AND GRADE SEPARATORS
3.1
introduction
3.1.1
The intersections to be provided shall be one of the following types:
i)
At-grade Intersections
ii)
Grade separated Intersections without ramps
iii)
Interchanges
3.1.2
The
existing
intersections,
which
are
deficient
with
respect
to
the minimum
requirements, shall be improved to the prescribed standards. Additional land,
if any, required
for improving the existing intersections shall be provided by the Authority.
The types and locations of new Intersections, Interchanges and Grade-separated Intersections
without ramps
shall be based on requirements
stipulated
in
IRC:SP:41,
IRC:5,
IRC:92,
MORTH Specifications for Road and Bridge Works. These shall be specified in Schedule 'B'
of the Concession Agreement.
3.2
At-Grade Intersections
3.2.1
The type of intersections to be adopted shall be decided on the basis of parameters
like number of intersecting
legs,
traffic volume/speed, type of traffic control
etc. Properly
designed intersections shall be provided at all at-grade crossings. Rotary shall not be provided
on the Project highway.
3.2.2
i)
The intersections shall be designed having regard to flow, speed, composition,
distribution and future growth of traffic. Design shall be specific to each site
with due regard to physical conditions of the site available. The design of
different elements of intersection shall be done as per IRC:SP:41 "Guidelines
on Design
of At-grade
Intersections
in
Rural and Urban Areas" including
other criteria given
in this Manual. MORTH
- Type Designs for Intersection
on National Highways may also be referred to, wherever required to develop
suitable layout and design of At-grade Intersections.
.
ii)
At multi leg intersections, the points of conflict should be studied carefully and
possibilities of realigning one or more of the intersecting legs and combining
some movements to reduce the conflicting movements shall be examined.
The object shall be to simplify the design and appropriate control devices
added to ensure more efficient and safe operation.
iii)
The channelising islands shall start from the edge of the paved shoulder. This
principle shall also apply in case of MORTH
- Type Designs for Intersections
on National Highways.

Arrangement). The 5 m wide median
shall be continued
to cater
protected right turning. Moreover, wherever land permits, the median
width
shall be increased to 7 m to avoid narrow median width
at
storage lane location.

In the above layouts, the width of right turning storage lane may be 3.0-3.5 m.
3.3
Grade Separated Intersections and Interchanges
3.3.1
An interchange is justified at locations where traffic on cross roads is moderate to
heavy and for safe and efficient traffic flow, ramps are necessary for cross road traffic. The
type and location of interchanges to be provided shall be specified in Schedule 'B'.
Encompassing safety requirement and also to have better traffic control following layouts are
suggested for at-grade intersections below structures on the project highway.

6.8
Drainage for Structures
6.8.1
Culverts and bridges
6.8.1.1
For culverts and bridges provision of suitable cross slope/camber and down take
pipes/spouts near the kerb, covered with gratings at the
inlet points shall be provided at
regular interval to facilitate rapid draining of water from the deck without any ponding. The
length and location of these drainage spouts should be such that the water is not discharged
on any bridge element.
6.8.1.2
The bridges
particularly those
in
high
rainfall area
shall
preferably be
built
in
longitudinal gradient with suitably designed cross drains at abutment locations to facilitate
proper drainage.
6.8.2
Grade separators/flyovers/road over bridges
6. 8.2.1
Effective drainage
shall be provided
both
longitudinally and transversely. The
transverse drainage shall be secured by means of suitable camber in the roadway surface.
Longitudinal drainage shall be secured by means of scuppers, inlets, or other suitable means
of sufficient size and numbers to drain the run-off efficiently.
6.8.2.2
Efficient drainage of the deck structure shall be ensured by providing a suitably
designed drainage arrangement consisting of drainage spouts connected to horizontal and
vertical pipe system such that the water from the structure does not fall on the road, does
not stagnate over the road or at entry and exit points of grade separated structure and
is
discharged into the draining system of the area. Care must be taken that the pipes are taken
down in such a way that they are aesthetically pleasing.
6.8.2.3
Typically, water spouts are provided at the kerbs at the rate of
1 No. per 12 sqm
of the surface in level portions and
1 No. per 15 sqm of the surface area on gradients. Water
56



======================================================================
PAGE 67 of 180
======================================================================
IRC:SP:84-2014
spouts are connected to runner pipe of suitable diameter (minimum 100 mm) on either side
of roadway and taken down by downtake pipes at pier & abutment locations.
6.8.2A
Drainage fixtures and downspouts shall be of rigid, corrosion resistant material
not less than 100 mm as the least dimension and shall be provided with suitable cleanout
fixtures.
6.8.2.5
The arrangement of floor drains shall be such as to prevent the splashing discharge
of drainage water against any portion of the structure. Overhanging portions of concrete
floors shall be provided with drip moulds.
6. 8. 2. 6
Catch water drains are necessary at the ends of viaduct portion so that water coming
from grade separated structure does not over saturate and affect the earthen embankment.
Similar catch water drains should be provided at the end of gradient so that water coming
from the structure is properly let out to nearest drain.
6.8.2. 7
An integrated drainage plan for the water coming from the deck of structures, local
catchment area of the project and all other sources should be prepared so that no water falls
on any surface of the structures, or remain standing or flowing over the level roads. All the
water
is collected through sumps and finally discharged into the local drainage system
i.e.
storm water drain/pipes etc. either by gravity through connecting drains or by pumping into
the existing outgoing drains.
6.8.2.8
The rainwater from the deck of the structures usually does not flow transversely
but flows on the high gradient slopes of the road or approaches and
is collected in the valley
curve portion. As such attention
is to be paid to get this large quantity of water drained out
fast without accumulating there causing problems for traffic flow resulting in traffic jams. The
draining out systems should be designed with greater margins so as to avoid this problem, a
least for grade separators, inside the cities or inhabited areas.
6.8.3
Underpasses and subways
6.8.3.1
Where
rain water cannot flow
into the drainage system by gravity due to the
requirement of depressed road to get minimum head room, necessary provision for drainage
by vertical drains and/or pumping shall be made so that there is no disruption of traffic through
such location on account of water logging/flooding of underpass or subway.
6.9
Existing Drains, Canais and Minor Waterways
6.9.1
For the existing drains, canals and waterways, to be over passed by the highway,
draining provisions shall be maintained and the effects of prolonged heavy rainfall must be
catered for.
6.9.2
Special
attention
shall
be
paid
to
the
drainage channels
carrying
industrial
waste and effluent in particular to those draining chloride contaminated effluents which are
detrimental to the RCC structures.
6.9.3
Adequate
care
shall
be
taken
while
crossing
irrigation
canals
to
prevent
contamination of the flow in the canal by spillage from the highway.

IRC:SP:84-2014
6.9.4
When
highway
runs
parallel
to
existing
channels,
adequate measures
shall
be taken
in the form of bank protection and channel alignment to avoid water build up or
stagnation against the highway slope endangering the pavement drainage. The drainage
channels at the toe of the highway may have to be adequately protected or reshaped for
discharge
in to these channels. Where the discharge from road drainage
is not permitted,
separate cross drainage structures are to be provided on both sides of such channel.
6.10
Survey, Investigation and Design Report
The Concessionaire shall carry out proper surveys and investigations for detailed design of
the drainage system. The proposal for drainage system supported with survey investigation

SECTION - 9
TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES/ROAD SAFETY DEVICES/
ROAD SIDE FURNITURE
9.1
General
The
multi-lane highways
being
built under various
road development programmes
are
adopting the geometric standards specifications, signage, road markings
etc. as per the
provisions contained in the codes of practice and the standards of the Indian Roads Congress
supported
by
the
Ministry's
specifications.
However,
accident
data
demonstrates
that
motorists leave the roadway for numerous reasons including errors of judgment. To ensure
long term road safety on these highways, the following suitable engineering measure are
considered essential for adoption so as to help in improving road safety leading to reduction
of accidents.
Traffic Control Devices, Road Safety Devices and Road Side Furniture shall comprise of road
signs, road markings, object markers, hazard markers, studs, delineators, attenuators, safety
barriers, pedestrian guard rails, boundary stones, km stones, etc. Guidelines given in IRC:8,
IRC:25, !RC:26, IRC:35, IRC:67, !RC:79, IRC:103and Section 800 of MORTH Specifications
shall be used for providing these items unless otherwise specified in this Section.
9.2
Road Signs
The three types of road signs
viz., mandatory/regulatory signs, cautionary/warning signs
and informatory signs shall be provided as given
in iRC:67 and Section 800 of MORTH
Specifications. Proper signs shall be provided for main carriageways, service and slip roads,
toll plaza and other project highway facilities. Clustering and proliferation of road signs shall
be avoided for enhancing their effectiveness.
^
9.2.1
There
shall be corresponding road markings with stop
signs,
give way signs,
merging or diverging traffic signs, lane closed signs, road narrowing signs, slip roads/diversion
signs, compulsory keep left/right signs, or any other signs as per IRC:67.
9.2.2
The Specifications and Standards of road signs, which are not covered by IRC:67
would be as per International Standards.
9.2.3
All road signs shall be of Prismatic Grade Sheeting corresponding to Class C
Sheeting described
in IRC:67 and any of the sheeting types VIII, IX or XI as per ASTM D
4956-09 fixed over Aluminum or Aluminum Composite Material. The sheeting for different type
of signs can be chosen based on the selection guidance provided in IRC:67 depending upon
the situation encountered by road users
in viewing the signs. Sheeting with high coefficient
of retro reflection at small observation angle are for a road sign to be viewed by a driver from
a long distance, whereas the sheeting with wide observation angle for better performance
at short distance viewing. The Type XI sheeting will have better performance at short and
medium distances. Micro prismatic sheeting is preferred for gantry mounted overhead signs.
Type IV micro prismatic sheeting can be used for delineator posts.

Road side safety barriers
i) Warrants: The longitudinal roadside barriers are basically meant to shield two types of
roadside hazards
i.e. embankments and roadside obstacles and also for preventing the
vehicles veering off the sharp curves. Therefore,
all embankments with height 3 m or more
shall have safety barriers at the edge of formation, with delineating reflectors fitted on them.
W beam
barrier shall be provided along
all curves having
radii upto 450 m for complete
length of curves including transitions and 20 m further before and after the curve.
Normally on shoulder side the lateral distance of at least 0.75 to
1 .0 m width from edge of
paved portion (i.e. carriageway + paved shoulder) should be available without any obstacles.
Wherever a permanent object cannot be removed for some reasons, provision of tandems
viz. W-beam metal crash barriers and hazard markers with reflectors must be made. Further,
frangible lighting columns and sign posts need to be used for minimizing the severity in case
of collision.
Irrespective of type of barrier being used, the slope in front of W-beam or wire rope or rigid
barrier shall be near to flat gradient so that safety barrier perform best when impacted by a
vehicle and the slope of ground in front of barrier shall not be steeper than 10:1.
Some of the commonly encountered roadside obstacles are bridge
piers, abutments and
railing ends, roadside rock mass, culverts, pipes and headwalls, cut slopes, retaining walls,
lighting supports, traffic signs and signal supports, trees and utility poles.

9. 7.1.1
Types of roadside safety barriers
There are three types of longitudinal roadside safety barriers viz:
a)
Semi-rigid type like
•
W-beam type steel barrier
Thrie beam type steel barrier
b)
Rigid type (like concrete crash barriers)
c)
Flexible type (like wire rope fencing)
The steel barriers with strong post type usually remain functional after moderate collisions,
thereby eliminating the need for immediate repair.
If damaged by a vehicle collision, both posts
and
rails of W-beam are to be repaired. Lack
in maintenance can cause the W-beam
rails
to protrude into traffic way creating highly unsafe situation. The wire rope though technically
complicated, can be repaired with minimum costs. Though initial installation cost is relatively
high for concrete rigid barrier compared to W-beam and wire rope safety barriers, the repair
and maintenance issues can be minimized greatly in concrete rigid barrier. The psychological
shyness of drivers to keep away from the safety barrier will be the least
in
rigid concrete
barrier compared to other types. Since rigid barriers will not yield under any vehicle impact,
it shall be provided for bridges and ROBs and also to shield roadside objects/hazards where
the required set back distance cannot be retained with wire rope and W-Beam (due to any
site condition), as they are deflective in nature.
Invariably W-beam and wire rope barrier shall not be installed upon a structure. For a median
upon a structure,
it shall be concrete rigid barrier. Wire Rope Safety Barrier shall not be used
over major or minor bridges
9.7.2
Road side steel barriers
a)
Design aspects: The W-beam type safety barrier consists of steel posts and a
3 mm thick W-beam
rail. There shall be a steel spacer block between the
post and the beam to prevent the vehicle from snagging on the
post, as
the snagging can cause the vehicle to spin round. The steel posts and the
blocking out spacer shall both be channel section of 75 mm x 150 mm size
and 5 mm thick. The posts shall be spaced 2 m center to center. Fig. 9.7
gives the typical details of W-Beam
rail and splices and shall be procured
and installed from a reputed manufacturer.
The Thrie beam safety barrier shall have posts and spacers similar to the
ones mentioned above for W-beam type. The
rail and splices design details
for typical Thrie beam are shown
in Fig. 9.8 and shall be from a reputed
manufacturer.
This barrier has higher initial cost than the W-beam type but is less prone to
damages to vehicle collisions especially for shallow angle impacts.
The W-beam, the Thrie beam and the posts spacers and fasteners for steel
barriers shall be galvanized by hot dip process and design elements and

installations shall be as per the details shown for crash barrier in this manual
so as to achieve the performance characteristics intended for W-Beam. For
any structural elements and details missing
in this Manual for W-beam and
its various end treatments, the details from international guidelines/manuals
on W-beam which would conform to EN 1317 Part-2 can be adopted.
b)
End treatment for steel barrier:
If
hit, an untreated end of the roadside
barrier
can
be
hazardous,
because
the
barrier beam
can
penetrate
the
passenger
compartment
and
cause
the
impact
vehicle
to
stop
abruptly. End treatments should, therefore, form an integral part of safety
barriers and the end treatment should
not spear vault or
roll a
vehicle
for head on or angled impacts. The end treatment on approach
shall be
Modified
Eccentric
Loader
Terminal
(MELT)
arrangement
as shown
in
Fig. 9.9 and departure sides
it shall be Trailing Terminal (TT) arrangement as
shown in Fig. 9=10. Following the same end treatments, Fig. 9.11 presents the
typical layout of W beam whether on raised median sides or on depressed/
flushed median sides. The international practices shall be adopted for those
details which are not available in this Manual for MELT and TT arrangements
for the end treatment of W-Beam.
The W-Beam to concrete transition shall be carried out by decreasing the post
spacing, nesting one
rail behind another and using steel section behind the
W-Beam. The transition between W-beam and concrete barrier is detailed in
Fig. 9.12.
c)
Placement:
Placement recommendations determine the exact
layout
of
the barrier and shall be made by the design engineer keeping
in view the
lateral offset of the barrier and flare rate. The final layout shall be as site-
specific combination
of these factors. The
barriers
shall be as
far away
from the
traffic as possible and
shall
preferably have uniform clearance
between the
traffic and the hazard. As far as possible, the safety barrier
shall be placed beyond 2.5 m of the traveled way. For long and continuous
stretches,
this offset
is not
critical. The distance between the barrier and
the hazard shall not be less than the deflection of the barrier by an impact
of a
full sized
vehicle.
In case of embankments, a minimum distance of
600 mm shall be maintained between the barrier and the start of embankment
slope of a hazard to prevent the wheels from dropping over the edge.
The W-beam and Thrie beam perform well on the outside of curves and even
those of relatively small radius. When a kerb exists on the edge of road and
on to close proximity traffic way whether on shoulder or median edge lines,
a distance of 100 mm shall be maintained between vertical face of kerb and
W-beam or Thrie beam face to ensure that impacting vehicle do not vault
over safety barrier and at the same time reduces the nuisance
hit. The steel
barrier shall be placed in such a way so as to be collided by vehicle directly.
Fig. 9.13 gives the lateral clearance to be maintained in different situations.

Road side concrete barriers
a)
Design aspects: Roadside concrete safety barriers are rigid barriers having
a sloped front face and a vertical back face. For uniformity New Jersey type
concrete
barriers should be used where necessary.
Rigid crash
barriers
may however be required only in constrained urban location between main
carriageway and
service
road. The concrete
barrier may be
pre-cast
in
lengths of up to 6 m depending upon the feasibility of transport and
lifting
arrangements. Concrete grade
for the
barriers
shall
not be
leaner than
M30. The minimum thickness of foundations shall be 25 mm thick cement
concrete or hot mix asphalt placed at the base of barrier to provide lateral
restraint. Where more than 75 mm thick over lay on the road pavement
is
anticipated, the foundation step may be increased
to 125 mm. However,
longitudinal roadside concrete barrier should have elaborate footing design
which
is structurally safe unless sufficient earth support is available.
Suggested
flare
rates depending
upon
the
design
speed
are
given
in
Table 9.2.

End treatment: Safety barrier shall be provided with an end treatment, which
shall be obtained by tapering the height of terminating end of the median
barrier within a length of 8 m to 9 m.
c)
Placement:
Placement
recommendations
for
roadside

mentioned
in Para 9.7.2 (c) are applicable to roadside concrete barriers as
well.

Wire rope safety barrier
a)
Design aspects: The wire rope
barriers/systems are
suitable
for
either
shoulder
and/or
median
side
application,
provided
there
is
adequate
clearance to account for their deflection, as per manufactures system design
specification and standards. The slope of surface between traffic way and
'
wire rope safety
barrier shall always be
flatter than
10:1 and there shall
not any object or raised kerb
in between so to enable the cables to readily
dis-engage from posts during impact and thereby minimizing snagging and
ensuring that the vehicle is smoothly redirected.
Wire rope
barrier can be
repaired
quickly and
only damaged
posts are
to be replaced. High tension 3 rope or 4 rope wire system confirming the

======================================================================
PAGE 113 of 180
======================================================================
IRC:SP:84-2014
requirements of EN 1317 Part 2 for higher containment Level of H2 shall be
used. Typical details of wire rope barrier are given in Fig. 9.14 and wire rope
barrier with ropes interwoven are also presented
in Fig. 9.15. The wire rope
barrier shall be the proprietary product of an approved manufacture and test
result shall conform to EN 1317 Part 2.
End treatment: The end treatment shall be as per the manufactures details
conforming to EN 1317 Part 2. The Wire rope to W-beam transition
shall
be done Modified Eccentric Loader Terminal (MELT) arrangement as shown
in Fig. 9.1 6.The termination of Wire rope to a
rigid or concrete barrier or a
parapet shall be avoided and there shall be a transition from wire rope to
W-beam in-turn to concrete barrier as shown in Fig. 9.17.
Placement: The
placement
of
the
Wire Rope
Safety
Barrier
shall
be
determined
by
the
design
engineer and
shall
be
a
combination
of the
deflection
ratios of the barrier and the site-specific conditions. The barrier
shall be placed as far away from the traffic as possible and shall preferably
have uniform clearance. The
lateral slope of surface between
traffic way
and wire rope safety shall always be flatter than 10:1 so that vehicle bumper
trajectory will not change before an errant vehicle hit the wire rope.
When Wire Rope Safety Barrier
is provided
in front of a hazard,
it shall be
so located caters to the deflection specified by the manufacture. The barrier
shall be extended at full height not less than 30 m
in advance of the hazard
on the approach side, and shall continue at full height for 7.5 m beyond the
hazard on the departure side. The minimum length offence shall be no less
than 50 m.
If there
is a hazard present in the deflection area of the barrier,
then the distance between fence and the hazard shall not be less than that
deflection values described by the manufacture and
will depend upon the
post spacing.
There shall be at least
1 m setback distance between wire rope safety barrier
and the start of drop or embankment slope. While installing wire rope on a
highway carrying two/three-wheelers and other small vehicles, the deflection
as specified by the manufacturer shall be maintained as set back distance
from the start of drop or embankment. The deflection can be reduced by closer
post spacing, however the minimum setback distance shall be ensured. Wire
rope can be installed for curves radii more than 450 m only.
The Wire Rope Safety Barrier shall not be permitted in following situations:
Where a hazard
is present within the deflection area of the fence.
Where total fence length
is less than 50 m.
On a horizontal curves of radius 450 m or less.
On vertical sag curves of radius less than 3 km.
Where rate of change in setback is steeper than
1
in 10.

9.7.5
Median barriers
i)
General: Head-on-collisions, especially on highways with narrow medians,
caused by out-of-control vehicles jumping across the medians are a major
source of accidents. Fixed objects on medians also require shielding from
the traffic flow. Provision of median safety barrier
in such conditions
is an
important requirement.
ii)
Warrants: For
all multilane highways where adequate land
is available,
it
is preferable to provide wide depressed medians having width of 7 m or
more but with W-beam metal crash barrier or wire rope safety barrier at the
edges of the median. Considering the vehicle trajectory over kerbs, when
safety barrier are to be installed along an existing multilane highways with
raised medians,
it shall be placed
in such a way that vehicle bumper would
hit directly on the safety barrier than first with the raised median kerb. The
maximum lateral distance between vertical face of raised kerb and W-beam
shall not be more than
1 00 mm. Wire ropes are ideally suited in depressed or
flushed median situations in a mutii lane highway owing to their double side
nature and also not allowing crossover as wire rope never snaps. However,
while applying wire rope on a narrow flushed median,
it shall be placed at
the centre of flushed median, ensuring the sufficient deflection distance from
both
traffic way. The spacing of posts and the deflection stipulated by the
manufacture shall be strictly adhered. The placement of Beam and wire rope
barrier on median sides are pictorially presented in Fig. 9.13.
Median barriers shall also be provided to shield fixed objects
in a narrow
median.
If necessary, median barriers shall be flared to encompass a fixed
object, which may be a light post, foundation of overhead signs, bridge pier
etc.
iii)
Types of median barriers:
There are four types of median safely barrier viz., W-beam type steel barrier,
(Strong post type), Thrie beam type steel barrier, (Strong post type). Concrete
barriers, Wire Rope safety barrier with closer post spacing.
9.7.5.1
Steel median barriers
Design aspects: The W-beam barrier shall be similar to the roadside barrier described
in
Para 9.7.2 (a).
The Thrie beam barrier shall be similar to the roadside barrier described in Para 9.7.2 (a).
Placement: Steel beam crash barrier shall be placed at both the edges of median along the
carriageway. The lateral placement and end treatment of W-Beam at median location as given
in Fig. 9.11 shall be followed. The Modified Eccentric Loader Terminal (MELT) arrangement
on approach side and Trailing Terminal (TT) arrangement on departure side shall be adopted
for W Beam end treatment in median location also.
108



======================================================================
PAGE 119 of 180
======================================================================
IRC:SP:84-2014
9.7.5.2
Concrete median barriers
Design aspects: Concrete median barrier shall be New Jersey type. These should be used
in case of narrow medians of two meter or less along with an anti-glare screen for avoidance
of headlight glare. The concrete barrier cannot be altered easily, hence rigid barrier shall be
provided
in narrow median
in urban location to prevent pedestrian intrusion and other side
friction. The terminating end of the median barrier shall be tapered in a length of 8 to 9 m.
Placement: Concrete median barrier shall be placed at both the edges of median along the
carriageway.
9.7.5.3
Wire rope median barrier
Design aspects: The design apsects given in Para 9.7.4 (a) will be applicabale for wire rope
at median location.
Placement: The requirements covered
in Para 9.7.4 (c) for wire rope will be applicable for
median barrier also. Also, when Wire Rope Safety Barrier
is placed between two adjacent
carriageways which are at the same level,
it shall be placed at the center of the median with
deflection area not be less than that deflection values described by the manufacture from
either side of the fence.
In case of two carriageways which are at different levels,
it shall be
at both sides of the median edge.
In the case of a split median,
it shall be on the carriageway
of higher side. Wire rope barrier for median location can be adopted as long as the median
is not raised and allowable deflection can be kept from both
traffic way sides as given
in
Fig. 9.13. The end treatment presented
in Para 9.7.4 (b) will be applicable for wire rope at
median location also.
9.7.6
General
Raised kerbs or drains shall not be provided between the traveled way and the barriers.
These destabilize the vehicle balance and disturb
its equilibrium before
it strikes the barrier,
thus defeating the essential purpose of safety and redirection of the impacting vehicle. Steel
barriers shall be provided in non-built-up sections whereas concrete barriers shall be provided
in built-up sections. In addition to the warrants given in Paras 9.7.1
(i) and 9.7.5 (ii), the safety
barriers shall also be provided at the following locations:
a)
Where embankment is retained by a retaining structure (concrete).
b)
On valley side of highway in mountainous and steep terrain (concrete).
c)
Between main carriageway and footpath in bridges (concrete).
d)
At hazardous
locations
identified
in Schedule 'C or through safety audit
(concrete/steel as specified in Schedule 'B' or Safety Audit Report).
The requirements of Safety Barriers for structures are given in Para 7.17 of this Manual.
9.8
Road Boundary Stones (RBS)
Road boundary stones shall be provided at the boundary on both sides of the Right of Way.
These shall be spaced at 50 m. The boundary stones shall be of cement concrete as per

SECTION - 11
LANDSCAPING AND TREE PLANTATION
11.1
Genera!
The Concessionaire
shall
plant trees and
shrubs
of required number and
type
at the
appropriate locations within the Right of Way and
in the land earmarked by the Authority
for afforestation keeping
in view the IRC Guidelines on Landscaping and Tree Plantation.
The Authority shall specify the number of trees which are required
to be planted by the
Concessionaire as compensatory afforestation or otherwise
in Schedule 'C of Concession
Agreement. The Concessionaire shall also maintain the trees and shrubs in good condition
during the Concession Period as per the maintenance schedule. The guidelines given in this
Section shall be followed
in plantation of trees and shrubs.
11.2
Design Considerations in Various Locations
11.2.1
Set-back distance of trees and other plantation
Trees on the roadside shall be sufficiently away from the roadway so that they are not a
hazard to road
traffic or restrict the
visibility. Most vulnerable locations
in
this regard are
the inside of curves, medians, junction corners and cut slopes. Trees shall be placed at a
minimum distance of 14 m from the centre line of the extreme traffic lane to provide recovery
area for the vehicle that runs off the road. A second row of trees 6 m further away will also be
planted wherever possible. Preferably the first row of trees shall consist of species with thick
shade and other rows of vertical type providing thin shade. Expansion of the Project Highway
to 6-lanes shall be taken
into consideration while locating the trees so that land
is free of
trees when further widening takes place. The distances for alternative rows of trees shall
be reckoned from the nearest edge of the unidirectional carriageway. No plantation shall be
allowed on the embankment slopes.
11.2.2
Set-bacl< of trees on curves
Experience has been that growth of thick vegetation close to the formation on
inside of
horizontal curve leads to serious reduction of sight distance and causes avoidable accidents
with
cattle/children suddenly emerging from the
side.
Uncontrolled trees/vegetation, may
also affect
visibility of traffic control devices and road signs. Therefore,
in
plain terrain a
stopping sight distance of 180 m corresponding to the design speed of 100 km per hour may
be ensured on all curved sections of the Project Highway along the innermost lane. However,
where there are site restrictions their requirement may be reduced to 130 m corresponding to
the design speed of 80 km per hour as a special case. The existing trees and vegetation on
the sides have to be suitably thinned/trimmed, or even removed
if necessary and a regular
programme of pruning of the offending trees shall be undertaken as part of the maintenance
operations.
In
all cases, location of trees shall be checked to ensure that clear vision of all
highway signs/signals is available at all times to the motorists. Also, the foliage or trees shall
not come in the way of roadway lighting.

vertical clearance
available across the roadway
shall be
minimum 5 m. From this angle, the probable size of all plants shall be anticipated in advance,
at the time of initial planting. To allow for the effects of growth, wind and rain, trees shall be
trimmed to 6 m and 6.5 m above the pavement in rural and urban areas respectively.
11.2.4
Plantation in medians
In the sections of the Project Highway where median width
is more than 2.5 m, shrubs shall
be planted and maintained to cut-off headlight glare from traffic in the opposite direction.
Flowering plants and shrubs are eminently suited for the purpose. These shall be planted
either in continuous rows or in the form of baffles. The height of shrubs shall be maintained
at
1 .5 m to cut-off the effect of traffic lights coming from the opposite direction.
In the sections, where the width of median
is less than 2.5 m, shrubs or flowery plants may
be planted
in between crash barriers or other means like metal/plastic strips to cut off glare
shall be provided.
The shape of shrubs and plants shall be suitably regulated so that there
is no overgrowth
either vertically or horizontally beyond the edge of the median.
In the vicinity of road intersections and median openings, median plantation shall be avoided
or restricted to low-growing varieties to ensure adequate visibility.
11.2.5
Spacing of avenue trees
The spacing of avenue trees
will depend on the type and growth characteristics of trees,
requirement of maintenance, penetration of distant views,
etc. A range of 10-15 m would
meet the requirement for most varieties.
11.2.6
Choice of trees
The following guidelines shall be kept
in view while selecting the species of trees to be
planted:
i)
Trees shall be selected with due regard to
soil,
rainfall
, temperature and
water level
ii)
Trees which become very wide shall be avoided as their maintenance would
cause interference with traffic flow.
iii)
The species must be capable of developing a straight and clean bole up to a
height of 2.5 to 3.5 m from the ground level.
iv)
The selected trees shall, preferably, be fast growing and wind-firm. These
shall not be thorny or drop too many leaves.
v)
The trees shall be deep rooted, as shallow roots injure pavements.
vi)
In urban areas, the species selected shall be of less spreading type, so that
these do not interfere with overhead services, clear views of signs/signals,
and efficiency of roadway lighting.

section
is
economically
unviable or leads to adverse environmental consequences.
ii)
Narrow right-of-way where
all the surface area must be retained for road
purpose.
iii)
Railway yard, airport or similar facilities.
iv)
Parks or other land uses, existing or planned.
,
v)
Prohibitive costs of land acquisition exceeding the costs of tunnel construction
and operation.
14.1.2

3-lane tunnel shall be added for other side of traffic.
In case there are two existing tunnels of
2-lanes each another tunnel of 3-lane or two tunnels of 2-lanes each shall be added.
14.2.6
Carrigeway & paved shoulder
The carriageways of the tunnels
shall be of cement concrete. Tunnels shall have paved
shoulder of 2.0 m on
left side and edge strip of 0.60 m on the right side.
In case of tunnels
having more than 500 m length provision
shall be made for 100 m long and 3.0 m wide
emergency lay bye beyond the left most lane at 750 m intervals to facilitate refuge by break
down/damaged vehicles and also for maintenance vehicles. Proper transitions, line of sight

======================================================================
fRC:SP:84-2014
3.1
Tag commissioning
3.1.1
Each Tag
will be required to have a non-changeable and unique Tag
ID, which
must be read by the Transceiver at the point-of-sale.
3.1.2
At the time of commissioning, the point-of-sale module shall read the unique Tag
ID and allocate an EPC code & a randomly generated initiation code.
It shall then write the
EPC code. Vehicle
registration number, vehicle class code and the
initiation code
in the
EPC memory area using the software module provided. The Tag
ID, EPC code. Vehicle
registration number, the vehicle class code and
initiation code shall also be stored
in the
central database.
3.2
Tag initiation
•
3.2.1
Tag initiation will be a process carried out during Tag commissioning or when the
originalowner suspects a cloning of the Tag.
3.2.2
In the first case, the Tag initiation software shall generate a random initiation code,
write in the Tag and store in the central database as mentioned
in
Para 4.1.2. Each time a
Tag is read by the Transceiver for tag commissioning, a new initiation code will be generated,
written on the Tag and stored in the central database along with other information.
3.2.3
In the second case, the Tag initiation software shall generate a random initiation
code and read Tag ID, EPC code, vehicle registration number & vehicle class code from the
Tag mounted on the windshield. After due verification from the centra! database, the value of
initiation code shall be updated on the Tag as well as on the central database. Old initiation
code and EPC code shall be marked for special handling for 'catching' the clone as and when
the cloned Tag comes into contact with Transceivers at the toll gates.
4.
Automatic Vehicle Identification at Toll Point
4.1
The communication sequence between the Transceiver and Tag shall conform to
ISO 18000-6C.
4.2
The Transceiver shall retrieve the Tag and EPC memory contents for those Tags
whose EPC code satisfies the mask stored in the Transceiver for a matching entry. The EPC
code shall be used to index into the database from where the Tag 10, Vehicle registration
number, the Vehicle class code and the initiation code will be retrieved from the database and
verified against the corresponding values read from the Tag.
