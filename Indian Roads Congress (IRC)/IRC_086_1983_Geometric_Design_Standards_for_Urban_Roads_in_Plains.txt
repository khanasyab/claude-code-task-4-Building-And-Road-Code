GEOMETRIC DESIGN STANDARDS FOR
URBAN ROADS IN PLAINS
1.
INTRODUCTION
1. 1.
Geometric
design
deals
with the visible elements of a
highway.
Adoption of proper
geometric standards facilitates safe
and
economical
operation
of
vehicles.
Geometric
design
is
influenced by a number of factors among which nature of
terrain,
type, composition and volume of traffic, operating speed,
land-use
characteristics and aesthetics are important.
1.2.
A draft for this
document
was
initially
prepared
by
the IRC Secretariat.
This was considered by the
Traffic Engineer-
ing Committee (personnel
given
below)
in their meeting
held
on
the 4th and 5th
October,
1978 which approved the same subject to
certain modifications
to be carried
out by Dr. N.S. Srinivasan and
K. Arunachalam.
The
draft
so
modified
was
approved
by the
Specifications and
Standards
Committee
in their meeting held on
the
24th
May,
1983,
and
later by the Executive Committee and
Council in their
meetings
held on the
21st
July,
1983
and
21st
August, 1983 respectively.

SCOPE
2.1.
These standards are applicable to urban roads in plains.
These are
also
applicable
to
roads
in
suburban
areas.
These
however do not cover standards for urban expressways.
2.2.
All the main elements
of geometric
design
for
urban
roads are included in the text. Layout of junctions are not covered
as standards
for
the
same
are
proposed
to
be
brought
out
separately.
3.
CLASSIFICATION OF URBAN ROADS
3.1.
For the purpose of geometric
design, urban roads other
than expressways
are
classified
into four main categories.
These
are:
(i) Arterial
(ii) Sub-arterial
(iii) Collector Street
(iv) Local Street
This publication deals
with
standards
for
all
categories
of
roads except Expressways for which separate standard
is proposed
to be evolved.
3.2.
Definitions
(i)
Arterial
:
A general
term
denoting
a
street
primarily
for through traffic, usually on a continuous route.
(ii)
Sub-arterial
:
A general term denoting
a
street
prima-
rily for through traffic usually on a continuous
route but
offering somewhat lower level of traffic mobility than the
arterial.
(iii) Collector Street
:
A street for
collecting and distributing
traffic
from and
to local streets and also
for
providing
access to arterial streets.
(iv) Local Street
:
A street primarily for access to residence,
business or other abutting property.
3.3.
Functions
Functions of different categories
of urban
roads
are
give
below:
(i)
Arterials
:
This system of streets, alongwith expresswa
where
they
exist,
serves
as
the
principal network f
2



======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 46
======================================================================
IRC
: 86-1983
through traffic flows.
Significant intra-urban
travel such
as
between
central
business
district
and
outlying
residential
areas
or
between
major
suburban
centres
takes place
on
this
system.
Arterials
should
be
co-
ordinated with existing and proposed expressway systems
to
provide
for
distribution
and collection
of
through
traffic
to
and
from
sub-arterial
and
collector
street
systems.
Continuity
is essential
for arterials
to
ensure
efficient movement of through
traffic.
A properly
deve-
loped and designated
arterial
street system
would
help
to identify
residential
neighbourhoods,
industrial
sites
and
commercial
areas.
These streets may generally be
spaced
at
less
than
1.5 km in highly developed central
business
areas and
at
8 km or more in
sparsely
deve-
loped urban fringes.
The arterials are generally
divided
highways
with full
or partial access.
Parking,
loading
and
unloading
activities
are
usually
restricted
and
regulated.
Pedestrians
are
allowed
to
cross
only
at
intersections.
(ii)
Sub-arterials
:
These are functionally similar to arterials
but with somewhat lower level of travel mobility.
Their
spacing
may
vary
from
about
0.5 km
in
the
central
business district to 3— 5 km in the sub-urban fringes.
(iii) Collector Streets
:
The
function of collector streets
is to
collect traffic from local streets and feed
it to the arterial
and sub-arterial streets or vice-versa.
These
may be
located
in
residential
neighbourhoods,
business
areas and
industrial
areas.
Normally,
full
access
is allowed
on
these streets from abutting proper-
ties.
There
are
few
parking
restrictions except during
the peak hours.
(iv) Local Streets
:
These
are intended primarily to provide
access to abutting property and normally
do
not
carry
large volumes of traffic.
Majority of trips in urban areas
either originate from or terminate on these
streets.
Local
streets
may
be
residential,
commercial
or
industrial,
depending on the predominant
use of the adjoining land.
They
allow
unrestricted
parking
and pedestrain move-
ments.
3.4.
General Considerations
3.4.1.
The principal
factors to
be considered in designating
roads into appropriate system
are
the travel desire lines of people
3



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 46
======================================================================
IRC
: 86-1983
by various modes of
transportation,
the
access needs of
adjacent
land, network pattern, and existing and proposed land-use.
3.4.2.
In designing a road in urban areas, besides the
classi-
fication of the road,
other
factors
like
type
of
traffic,
effect on
environment, drainage and maintenance must also be
given
prime
consideration.
For
example,
mixed slow moving
traffic
requires
careful
consideration
of
grades,
climbing
lanes,
curvature etc.
Consideration should
also
be
given
to
see that the road
and
its
structures blend
with
the
environment
and
produce
a
pleasing
appearance.
Noise
and
fume
pollution
is
a
problem in
urban
areas and the cross-section
should
provide
for remedial measures
such as
noise
barriers,
and
adequate
distance
should
be
kept
between busy routes
and
populated areas.
Since
idling
engines
and slow motor vehicles have higher deleterious emissions, arterials
should be designed for
least
stoppages.
Design should also
take
care of drainage, erosion control, space for
services and for
erect-
ing signs, lighting posts,
etc.
4.
DESIGN SPEED
4.1.
Design
speed
is related to
the
function
of
a
road.
Keeping in view the type of functions expected of each
class of the
urban road
system,
the
design speeds given in Table
1 are recom-
mended for adoption.
Table
1.
Design Speeds
Classification
Design Speed (km/hr)
Arterial
80
Sub-arterial
60
Collector street
50
Local street
30
4.2.
A
lower
or
higher value compared to that designated
in Table
1 may be adopted
depending
on the presence of physical
controls, roadside development and other related factors.
4.3.
A lower design
speed may
be
adopted
in the central
business area or areas
with
extremely
heavy
roadside
develop-
ment.
On the other hand, in suburban areas, a higher
value
may
be more appropriate.
4



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 46
======================================================================
IRC
: 86-1983
4.4.
For divided
highways,
running speeds of
vehicles
are
in general higher and, therefore, in such cases a higher
value
may
be adopted.
4.5.
It should however be kept in view that
sudden
change
in design
speed
along
any
road
should
be
avoided.
Change,
where necessary, should
be
made in stages in steps of 10 km/h at
a time.
5.
SPACE STANDARDS
5.1.
The
space
standards
recommended
for
the
various
categories of urban roads are given in Table
2.
Table
2.
Recommended Land Widths for Roads in Uuban Areas
Classification
Recommended land width
in metres
Arterial
50-60
Sub-arterial
30—40
Collector street
20—30
Local street
10—20
Note
:
The term "space standard"
is often referred to as "right-of-way".
6.
CROSS-SECTIONAI ELEMENTS
6.1.
The
width
and
layout
of
urban
road
cross-sections
depend
on
many
factors,
the
chief amongst
them
being
the
classification
of
road,
design
speed,
and
the
volume
of
traffic
expected.
Other considerations are requirements of parking
lanes,
bus-bays,
loading-unloading
bays,
occurrence
of
access
points,
volume of pedestrians
and
cyclists,
width
of drains,
location
of
sewer
lines,
electricity
cables
and
other
public
utility
services.
Plate
1 shows some
typical
cross-sections.
Actual width of each
element should be
based
on
traffic volumes and other functional
requirements explained in paras 6.2.1 through 6.2.1 1.
6.2.
Road Width and Design Traffic Volumes
6.2.1.
The road width should be designed
to
accommodate
the design traffic volume.
Past traffic counts and consideration
of
future
development
of
urban
areas
mu>t
be
kept
in view while

or on the basis of results of trans-
portation study which allows for change
in land-use
and
accounts
for
socio-economic
factors.
The
road
should
be
designed
to
accommodate the
traffic volumes computed for the
end
of
design
life. A design period of 15-20 years should be adopted for arterials
and
sub-arterials
and
10-15
years
for local and collector streets.
A
higher
design
period
should
be
taken for small towns and a
lower design period for large
cities.
For high volume
streets
and
busy
intersections,
peak
hour
volumes should
be used to deter-
mine the widths.
For rough estimate, the peak hour flows may be
taken as 10-12 per cent of the daily flow.
6.2.2.
Traffic
in
urban
areas
in
the
country
is of mixed
nature.
The width requirement should be assessed on the basis
of
equivalent
passenger
car
units (PCU) using the tentative equiva-
lency factors shown in Table
3.

the

of
through
urban
roads
at
different
situations
such
as through
sections, roundabouts and intersections
is different, the equivalency
factors
for
different
situations
are
different.
The
equivalency
factors
given
above
are
applicable
only
to through sections of
urban roads between junctions.
6.2.3.
The
design
of
main
traffic
routes
in built-up areas
should be based on peak hour demands and not as
in
rural
areas
on
the
average
daily
traffic.
On two-way undivided carriageway,
the capacity
is relatively independent of distribution
by
direction,
and
design
is
based on two-way total flows.
On dual or divided

carriageway, capacity
is dependent on distribution by direction and
design should therefore be based on peak hour
flow
in
the
busier

travel.
Tentative

6.2.5.
Footpath (Sidewalk)
: The minimum width of footpath
should be
1.5 metres.
They should have well
maintained
surface
with crossfall neither so
flat as to be
difficult to drain nor
so
steep
as
to
be dangerous to walk upon.
The crossfall within the range
of 2.5 to
3 per cent should meet this requirement.
Those
parts
of
the
footpath
immediately
adjoining
buildings,
fences,
trees and
other obstructions, which will not be available for
free
movement
of
pedestrians
should
be
disregarded
while
calculating
widths
required.
Table 6 gives the capacity guidelines for design of
foot-
paths.

The width should be increased by
1
metre
in
business
and
shopping
areas to allow for dead width. Footpaths adjoining shop-
ping
frontages
should be atleast 3.5 m and a minimum of 4.5 m
is
desirable adjoining longer shopping frontages.
At points of possible
congestion such as bus stop or entrance of large
shops
and
public
buildings,
footpaths
may
be
wider.
Where
space
is available,
provision of verge between footpath and
carriageway
to
increase
safety
of
pedestrians
is
desirable.
When
deciding the width of
footpaths and verges, the width required
to accommodate
under-
ground
services
clear
of
carriageway
should
also
be taken into
account.
When on slopes or
in
the
case
of
ramps,
the
capacity
should be suitably reduced.
6.2.6.
Cycle Track
:
The
minimum
width
of
cycle
track
should
be 2 metres.
Each
additional
lane where required should
be
1 m.
Separate cycle tracks should be provided when
the
peak
hour cycle traffic
is 400 or more on
routes
with
a
motor
vehicle
traffic
of
100-200 vehicles
per hour.
When the number of motor

vehicle using the route
is more than
200 per
hour,
separate
cycle
tracks
are
justified even
if cycle traffic
is only 100 per hour.
As a
general rule, the capacity of cycle tracks may be taken as
given
in

6.2.7.
Medians
:
Urban
highways
of
six
lanes
or
more
should, -as a general
rule, be provided with median.
For four-lane
roads, however, the provision of median should be judicious taking
into
account
such considerations as safety, directional distribution
of traffic, the proportion of slow-moving traffic,
roadside
develop-
ment
and
quality
of
service,
etc.
As
far as possible, medians
should be avoided where there are significant tidal flows
of
traffic,
or where the individual carriageways are inadequate for catering
to
peak-hour
traffic
volumes,
or
where
there
is
intense
roadside
developments without frontage roads.
Width of median
is
dictated
by
a
variety
of
conditions.
Widths will depend on the available right-of-way, terrain, turn lanes,
drainage and
other
determinants.
Wide
medians
are
preferred
where space and cost considerations permit.
Minimum
widths
of
median
at
intersections
to accomplish various purposes should be
as follows
:
(i) Pedestrian refuge,
1.2 m; (ii) Median lane
for
pro-
tection of vehicle making right turn, 4.0 m but 7.5 m
is
recommen-
ded;
(iii)
9 to
12 metre
is required to protect
vehicles
crossing
at
grade.
Even
greater
widths
are
required for U-turns.
Absolute
minimum width
of median
in
urban
areas
is
1.2 m; a desirable
minimum
is 5 m.
As far as possible, the median should be of uniform
width
in
a
particular
section.
However, where changes are unavoidable, a
transition of
1 in 15 to
1 in 20 must be provided.
6.2.8.
Verge
: Verges are required between carriageway and
property
line
not
only
to
accommodate
lighting columns,
traffic
9



======================================================================

signs, underground services etc., but
also
to
provide
appropriate
clearance to ensure proper vehicle placement and
development
of
full
carriageway
capacity.
Where
road
width
is restricted,
full
width between carriageway and property line should be paved and
used for pedestrian sidewalk/cycle track.
Where possible, a
mini-
mum verge of
1 m width should be kept.
They should be
suitably
levelled,
trimmed
and
provided
with
a
crossfall of 5 per cent
if
turfed and
3
per cent
if cobbled
or surface
dressed.
This should
be increased
if poles, kerb-height, or excessive
crossfall
discourage
parking
close
to
the
kerb
and also where either parked vehicles
frequently overlap on to the" adjacent
traffic
lane
or
the
parking
lane
is likely to be used as a peak hour traffic lane.
6.2.9.
Parking lanes
: Parking lanes may be provided
on
all
sub-arterials
and
collector
streets in
business and shopping areas.
Parallel kerb parking should be preferred.
Parking lane width
for
parallel parking should be
3 m
which may
be
reduced
to
2.5 m
where available space
is limited.
Where additional
parking
capa-
city
is
desired
and
sufficient carriageway width
is available, angle
parking may be adopted.
6.2.10.
Busbays
:
Busbays should not be
located
too
close
to intersections.
It
is desirable that they are located 75 m from the
intersection on either side
preferably
on
the
farther
side
of
the
intersection.
Busbays should be provided preferably by recessing
the
kerb
to
avoid
conflict
with
moving
traffic.
The
length
of the recess
should be
15 m for single bus stop with increase of
15 m
for
each
extra
bus
for
multiple
bus stops.
The taper should be desirably
1
: 8 but not less than
1
: 6.
The
depth
of
the
recess
should
be
4.5 m
for
single bus stop and 7 m for multiple bus stop.
Suitable
arrangement should be made for
drainage
of
surface
water
from
busbays.
Sufficient
footpath
should
be
ensured
behind
the
busbays.
6.2.11.
Lay-byes:
To
enable
drivers
to
stop
clear
of
carriageway,
lay-byes
should
be
provided
at intervals along long
straight routes.
They should always be provided near
guide maps
and
other
public
conveniences
to
enable drivers to stop clear of
carriageway.
They
should
normally
be
3 m
wide
and
atleast
30 m
long
with 15 m end tapers on both sides.
Suitable arrange-
ments should be made for drainage of surface water from
lay-byes.

7.
KERB
7.1.
It
is desirable that roads
in
urban
areas
are
provided
with kerbs.
7.2.
Kerbs
may
be
barrier
type,
semi-barrier
type
or
mountable type.
Appropriate situations
for
use
of
each
type
is
indicated below
:
(a)
Barrier type
:
Built-up areas adjacent to footpaths with
consi-
[Fig. 1(a)]
derable pedestrain traffic.
(b)
Semi-barrier type
:
On
the
periphery of the roadway where pedes
[Fig. 1(b)]
train traffic is light and a barrier type could tend
to reduce traffic capacity.
(c)
Mountable type
:
Within the roadway at
channelization schemes,
[Fig*.
1(c)]
medians, outer separators and
raised medians
on bridges.
7.3.
Each
figure
shows
two
varieties
of each type of kerb
with gutter and without gutter.
Kerbs
with
gutter
should always
be used at drainage edges of pavements.
8.
CAMBER
8.1.
Camber or crossfall should be adopted
as
follows
for
straight sections
:
Surface type
Camber
(i) Gravelled or WBM surface
2.5 to 3 per cent
(1 in 40 to
1 in 33)
(ii) Thin bituminous surfacing
2 to 2.5 per cent
(1 in 50 to
1 in 40)
(iii) High type bituminous surfacing
1.7 to 2 per cent
or cement concrete surfacing.
(1 in 60 to
1 in 50)
8.2.
Higher values of camber
should
be
adopted
in
areas
with high intensity of rainfall and where water is expected
to pond
in
local
depressions
due
to unequal settlement.
Steeper camber
should also be
provided
on
kerbed
pavements
to
minimise
the
spread of surface water flows.
8 3.
For
shoulders
along unkerbed pavements, the crossfall
should be of least 0.5 per cent steeper than the slope
of pavement
subject to minimum given below
:
WBM surface
3 per cent
Gravel surface
4 per cent
Larth surface
5 |.er cent

8.4.
For paved footpaths, crossfall of 3-4 per cent should be
adopted.
8.5.
For verges and unpaved areas, the
crossfall
should
be
4-6 per cent.
8.6.
Undivided carriageways
should
have
a
crown
in
the
middle and slope towards the edges.
8.7.
Divided
roads may
have
a
single crowned section or
separate
crowned
sections
for
each
carriageway
depending
on
requirements of drainage and access to abutting property.
9.
SIGHT DISTANCE
9.1.
Stopping sight distance should be provided at all
points
on the
road.
Stopping sight distance
is the total distance travelled
by the driver from the time a danger
is comprehended
by
him
to
the actual stop,
i.e. the
distance
travelled
during
perception
and
brake
reaction
time
plus
the
braking distance.
For the purpose
of measuring the stopping sight distance, the height
of
eye
should
be assumed as
1.2 m and height of object as 015 m.
The design values of sight distance are shown in Table 8,
Table
8.

9.2.
On
undivided roads,
intermediate sight distance which
is equal to twice the
stopping
distance
should be provided where
vehicles are permitted to cross the centre line.
9.3.
Headlight Sight Distance
On valley curves,
the
design
must
ensure that the roadway
ahead
is illuminated during
night
travel by vehicle headlights
for
13



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 46
======================================================================
IRC
: 86-1W3
a sufficient length which
enables
the
vehicle to brake to a stop,
if
necessary.
This is known as
the
headlight sight
distance and
is
equal to the safe stopping distance.
From
safety
considerations,
valley curves should be designed to provide for this visibility.
F6r designing valley
curves, the following criteria
should
be
followed
to ensure the headlight sight distance:
(i) height of headlight above the road surface is 0.75 m;
(ii) the useful beam
of headlight
is one degree upwards from the grade
of the road; and
(iii) the height of object is nil.
10.
HORIZONTAL ALIGNMENT
10.1.
In
general,
horizontal
curves
should
consist
of
a
circular portion flanked by spiral transitions at both ends.
Design
speed,
superelevation
and
coefficient
of
side
friction affect
the
design of circular
curves.
Length
of
transition
curves is
deter-
mined on the basis of rate of change of centrifugal acceleration and
superelevation.
10.2.
Superelevation
10.2.1.
Design
values
:
Superelevation
required
on
hori-
zontal curves should be
calculated
from
the
following
formula.
This assumes the centrifugal
force
corresponding
to
three-fourth
the design speed
is balanced
by
superelevation
and rest
counter-
acted by side friction:
_
V%
e ~
225/?
where
e
«< superelevation in metre per metre
V =» speed in km/h, and
R = radius in metres
Superelevation obtained from the above expression should be
limited to 7 per cent.
However,
on
urban sections with frequent
intersections,
it will
be
desirable
to
limit
the
superelevation to
4 per cent for convenience in
construction and for facilitating easy
and safe turning movement of vehicles.
Fig. 2 indicates
the
superelevations for various design speeds
on this basis.

10.2.2.
Radii
beyond
which
no
superelevation
is
required
:
When the value of
the
superelevation obtained vide para
10.2.1
is
less than the road camber,
the
normal
cambered
section
should
be continued on the curved
portion without providing
any
super-
elevation.
Table

shows
the
radii
of
horizontal
curves
for

camber
rates

required.

Methods
of
attaining
superelevation
:
The
normal
cambered section of the road
is changed into superelevated
section
in two stages.
First
stage
is
the
removal
of
adverse camber in
outer half of the
pavement.
In
the
second stage, superelevation
is gradually built-up over
the full
width of the carriageway so that
required superelevation
is available
at the beginning of the circular
curve.
There are three different methods for attaining
the
super-
elevation:
(i) revolving pr.vement about the centre line;
(ii)
revolv-
ing pavement about
the
inner edge; and
(iii)
revolving pavement
about the outer edge.
Plate 2 illustrates these
methods
diagram-
matically.
The small cross-sections at the bottom of each diagram
indicate the pavement cross-slope condition at different points.
Each
of
the
above
methods
is
applicable
under
different
conditions.
Method
(i) which involves least distortion of the
pave-
ment will be found suitable in most of the
situations
where
there
are
no
physical
controls,
and may
be adopted
in th the normal
course.
Method
(ii)
is preferable where the lower
edge
profile
is
a
major
control,
e.g.
on
account
of
drainage.
Where overall
appearance
is the criterion, method
(iii)
is preferable since the outer
edge profile which
is most noticeable to drivers is not distorted.
The superelevation should be attained gradually over the
full
length of the transition curve so that the
design
superelevation
is

available at the starting point of the circular portion.
Sketches
in
Plate
2
have
been drawn on this basis.
In cases where transition
curve cannot for some reason
be
provided,
two-third
supereleva-
tion may be attained on the straight
section
before
start
of
the
circular curve and the balance one-third on the curve.
In
developing
the
required
superelevation,
it
should
be
ensured that the longitudinal slope of the pavement edge compared
to the centerline
(i.e. the
rate of change
of
superelevation)
is
not
steeper than
1
in
150.
When
cross-drainage
structures
fall
on
a
horizontal curve,
their deck should be superelevated in the same
manner
as
descri-
bed above.

Minium Curve Radius
Minimum radius of curve can be determined from the equation
:
V =
vehicle speed in km/h
e =
superelevation ration in metre per metre
f —
coefficient of side
friction between
vehicle tyres and pavement
(taken as 0.15)
R = radius in metres
Based
on
this
equation, minimum radii of horizontal curves
for
the
different
design
speeds
with maximum
superelevation
limited to 4 per cent and 7 per cent are given in Table

Set-back Distance at Horizontal Curves
Physical obstructions on the inside of horizontal
curves
often
restrict sight distance.
Sight areas on horizontal curves should
be
such
as
to
provide
driver
with sight distance equal to the design
stopping distance on curve.
Figure 3 indicates the minimum width
ot set back from obstructions to sight measured from centre line of
innermost lane.
These values are only applicable when
the
length
ot arc of the curve
is greater than the design stopping distance
For
shorter lengths of curves, width of sight area should be checked
bv
trial and error by assuming various positions of object
and
drivers
on straight portions adjoining the curve.
10.5.
Transition Curves
10.5.1.
Transition curves are necessary for a vehicle to have
smooth
entry
from
a
straight
section into a circular curve.
The
transition
curves
also
improve
aesthetic
appearance
of the road
besides permitting gradual application
of
the
superelevation
and
extra
widening
of
carriageway needed at the
horizontal
curves.
Spiral curve should be used
for this purpose.
10.5.2.
Minimum
length
of
the
transition curve should be
determined from-the following two considerations and the larger of
the two values adopted for design:
(i) The
rate
of change
of
centrifugal
acceleration
should not cause
discomfort to drivers.
From this consideration, the length of transi-
tion curve
is given by
:
.
0.0215 V*
Ls "
CR~
L$ = length of transition in metres
V = speed in km/h
R = radius of circular curve in metres
r
80
.
c = 75^Tp ( sut>Ject to a maximum of 0.8 and minimum of 0.5)
(ii) The
rate
of change
of superelevation
(i.e. the longitudinal grade
deveJopod at the pavement edge compared to
through
grade
along
the centre line) should be such as not to cause discomfort
to
travel-
lers
or to make
the
road
appear
unsightly.
This
rate of change
should not be steeper than
1
in
150.
The
formula
for
minimum
length of transition on this basis with superelevation limited to 7
per
cent works out to
:

2.7 V*

10.6.
Widening of Carriageway on Curves
10.6.1.
At sharp horizontal curves,
it is
necessary
to
widen
the carriageway to provide for safe passage of vehicles. The widen-
ing required has two components:
(i) mechanical widening to
com-
pensate
the
extra width occupied by a vehicle on the curve due to
tracking of the rear wheels, and (ii) psychological widening to permit

easy crossing of vehicles since vehicles
in
a
lane
tend
to
wander
more on a curve than on a straight reach.
10.6.2.
On two-lane or wider roads,
it
is necessary
that both
the
above
components
should
be
fully
catered
for
so
that the
lateral clearance between vehicles on curves
is maintained equal
to
the clearance available on straights.
Position of
single-lane
roads
however
is
somewhat
different,
since during crossing manoeuvres
outer wheels of vehicles have in
any
case
to
use
the
shoulders
whether on the straight or on the curve.
It
is,
therefore
sufficient
on single lane roads
if only the mechanical component
of
widening
is taken into account.
10.6.3.
Based on the above considerations,
the
extra
width
of carriageway
to
be
provided
at horizontal curves cn single and
two-lane roads
is given
in
Table
12.
For
multi-lane
roads,
the
pavement
widening may be calculated by adding half the widening
for two-lane roads to each lane.

The widening should be
effected
by
increasing
the
width
at
an approximately uniform rate along the transition curve.
The extra width should be continued over
the
full
length
of
the
circular curve.
On curves having no
transition,
widening
should
be
achieved
in
the
same
way as the superelevation i.e. two-third
being attained on the straight section before start of the
curve
and
one-third on the curve.
10.6.5.
The
widening
should
be
applied
equally
on
both
sides of the carriageway. However the widening should be provided
only on the inside when the
curve
is
plain
circular
and
has
no
transition.
10.6.6.
The extra widening may
be
attained
by
means
of
offsets
radial
to
the
centre
line.
It
should
be ensured that the
pavement edge lines are smooth and there
is no apparent kink.

VERTICAL ALIGNMENT

.
General
Vertical alignment
in urban
areas
is
governed
by
need
to
match building line and entrance
line
levels
and
levels
of
inter-
sections and median openings.
11.2.
Gradient
Most urban roads carry mixed
traffic
including
slow
moving
vehicles
like
bicycles and animal/hand carts.
Besides
this, urban
roads generally have intersections
at
frequent
intervals.
In
view
of
this,
as
a general rule, a gradient of 4 per cent should be consi-
dered the maximum for urban roads.
On roads carrying predomi-
nantly
slow
moving traffic, however, the gradient should desirably
not exceed
2 per
cent.
At
intersections,
the
road
should
be
as
near level as possible.
As the urban roads are generally kerbed,
it would be desirable
to ensure a minimum gradient as indicated in Table 13 for
facilitat-
ing longitudinal drainage.

Vertical Curves
Vertical
curves
should
be
provided
at
all

Summit Curves
Summit curves in urban areas
should
be
designed
for
safe
stopping sight distance and they should be coordinated
with
hori-
zontal
curvature.
Broken-back
profiles
should
be
avoided and
wherever possible, approaches
to
bridges
less
than
30 m
width
should be designed to
fit a single vertical curve.
Length of the summit curve should be calculated on the
basis
of the following formulae
:
(i) When the length of the
curve
exceeds
the
required
sight
distance
i,e. L
is greater than S
r _
NS*
L ~
"474
Where N = deviation angle, i.e.
the
algebraic
difference
between two
grades
L = length of vertical curve in metres
5 = sight distance in metres.
(ii) When the length of the curve is less than the required
sight
distance i.e. L is less than S
The minimum length of summit curves for
stopping
sight
distance
and
various
deviation
angles
have
been
calculated and given in
Fig.
5.
Summit curves shall be
square
parabolas
(y = ax2 )
and
minimum length should not be less than that given in Table 14.

Valley Curves
Valley curves on
unlighted urban roads should be
such
that
for
night
travel
the
headlight
beam
distance
is
the same as the
stopping
sight
distance.
In
accordrnce
with
this
criterion,
the
length of the curve may be calculated as under
:
(i) When the length of curve exceeds the sight distance
NS*
~
"1.50 + 0.0355
(ii) When the length of the curve
is less than the requiied
sight
distance
_ c
1.50 + 0.0355
The
length
of curves for various values of sight distance and
deviation angles have been calculated as
per
above
formulae
and
given in Fig. 6.
Valley curves on urban roads which are usually
lit during the
hours of darkness may be designed merely for vertical acceleration
of 0.5 g for riding comfort and in that case minimum lengths given
in Table 14 will suffice.
1 1.6.
Co-ordination of Horizontal and Vertical Alignments
Horizontal and vertical alignments
should
not
be
designed
independently.
They complement each other and poorly designed
combination can mar the good points and aggravate the deficiencies
of
each.
The
design
should
be
visualised in the
perspective
to
achieve a flowing and
pleasing
view
from
the
road.
Following
broad principles should be followed in alignment co-ordination:
(i) The degree of
curvature
should
be
in proper
balance
with
the
gradients.
Straight
alignment
or
flat
horizontal
curves
at
the
expense of steep or long grades,
or
excessive
curvature
in a
road
with flat grades, do not constitute balanced
designs
and should
be
avoided.
(ii) Vertical curve superimposed upon horizontal curve gives a
pleasing
effect.
As such the vertical and horizontal curves
should
coincide
as far as possible and their lengths should be more or less
equal.
If
this is difficult to achieve for any reason, the horizontal curve should
be somewhat longer than the vertical curve.
(iii) Sharp horizontal curves should be avoided at or
near
the
apex
of
pronounced summit/sag vertical curves from safety considerations.
