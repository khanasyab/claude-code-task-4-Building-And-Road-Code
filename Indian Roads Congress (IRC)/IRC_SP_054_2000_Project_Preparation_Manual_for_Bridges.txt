1. INTRODUCTION
1.1.
Bridge
structures
are
essential
component
of any
road
network. Preparation of bridge projects involves a chain of activities such
as
survey and
investigations,
selection
of
site,
fixing
of waterways,
selection of type of structure, design of structural elements, preparation of
drawings and cost estimates, economic evaluation, preparation of contract
documents, quality assurance scheme, maintenance manual and schedule.
Guidelines and codal requirements already exist on different aspects
of these activities. The preparation of a bridge project will not only be
guided by codal provisions but also by the need to optimise the investments.
The structure should have an assured safety and level of performance
over
its
expected
life. These
considerations demand
that
the
project
should be prepared after thorough investigations, collecting
all relevant
information, evaluating
all possible
alternatives for selecting the most
effective solution, both from the technical angle and the economic point
of view.
1.2.
The extent, nature and quality of investigations and analysis
of data help in ensuring safety and cost-effectiveness of the structure. The
best
design
and
technologically
superior
option
emerges
only
if
investigations
have
been
concluded
with
the
utmost
accuracy
and
completeness. Project preparation work can be carried out either by the
owner himself or with the help of consultants. In case consultants are
employed, their competence and capability to carry out the work should
be properly established.
2



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:54-2000
Adequate funds and time should be earmarked for
all
activities
needed for planning, investigation and design. Such investments in the
initial stages of a project shall prove worthwhile in the long run. The
techniques adopted and the equipment used should be such as to give the
desired level of accuracy.
1.3.
Presentation
of
project
details
in
a
comprehensive
and
systematic manner helps in many ways. Such a project report enables a
quick scrutiny by technical, financial and administrative authorities who
are required to judge the technical soundness and economic benefits and
financial viability as applicable, of a project before according investment
sanction. When external funding of a project is sought, a well prepared
and properly presented report becomes all the more necessary to improve
the chances of funding. If private financing is envisaged, the selection of
a project depends upon its competitive cost and its ability to recover the
investments within a reasonable time span.
The project document ultimately also forms the basis for bidding,
selection of the contractor and for its successful execution. The care that
should bfe taken in preparing such a document cannot be over-emphasised.
1.4.
This manual
lays down
guidelines
covering
the
various
aspects which are to be detailed in the report for a bridge project.
It is
hoped
that use of these guidelines, would result in a uniformly good
quality aQd comprehensive report which would help in speedy evaluation
and subsequent successful execution of the project.
2. SCOPE
The manual covers bridge structures for all classes of highways in
urban and non-urban areas. The word "bridge structures" used in this
Manual
covers
bridges
across
rivers,
canals,
viaducts,
structure
for
interchanges including under-passes and flyovers across the road, flyover
and under-passes across railways, acquaduct/syphon in combination with
highway structures and retaining walls which may be considered critical
for the design and safety of the main structure. The Manual is applicable
for
all bridge structures with bridge length more than 6 m. These are
general guidelines and specific requirements of the bridge project, shall
3



======================================================================
PAGE 20 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:54-2000
be prepared on the basis of these guidehnes as applicable keeping in view
the magnitude and complexity of the project.
3. STAGES IN PROJECT PREPARATION
Generally there are three stages in project preparation
:
(i)
pre-feasibility
report,
(ii)
feasibility report/preliminary project report, and
(iii)
detailed project report.
Project
preparation work
starts
with
the
identification
of
the
project. This phase is known as pre-feasibility phase. For this stage, the
broad features of the project are identified. The possible locations, nature
of crossing, traffic dispersal system for different alternatives are identified.
The effect of implementation on the traffic scenario in immediate vicinity
is also broadly considered. The reconnaissance
visit to the area of the
intended bridge site is sufficient at this stage.
In the feasibility stage, preliminary surveys, data collection and
investigations are carried out,
alternative
sites are investigated, outline
design
and
rough
cost
estimates
for
various
alternatives
are
made.
Sometimes pre-feasibility and feasibility stages
are combined into the
feasibility
stage. A feasibiUty report covering recortimended alignment
including alternatives considered, span arrangements, preliminary cost
estimate, economic and financial viability (as required) is prepared. This
should include recommendations regarding need for carrying out model
studies, where required. Special design requirements for the project,
if
any, and schedule for all pre-construction activities shall also be included
in the feasibility report.
The
third stage
is known as detailed engineering.
In
this stage
detailed
surveys and
investigations
are
carried
out on
approved
site
alignment. Detailed designs are worked out on the basis of results of
survey and investigation and detailed drawings are prepared. An accurate
cost estimate is made along with the Bill of Quantities and the specifications
are finalised. The detailed project report (DPR) incorporating
all these
aspects
is prepared. DPR should clearly
indicate the required budget
4



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:54-2000
provision
for
the
project and
also
include,
if required by
the
client,
documents for pre-qualification of contractors and the tender documents.
In addition, the detailed engineering stage should include preparation
of a work progranmie (CPM/PERT Chart), the quality assurance system
and maintenance manual.
4. ?RE-FEASIBILITY REPORT
In the pre-feasibility report a matrix
is evolved based on which
minium number of
sites
required
for conducting
feasibility
study
is
identified. A matrix covering land acquisition problem, nature of crossing,
likely foundation depth, length of approaches, length of bridge, firmness
of banks, suitability of alignment of approach road, etc., are required to
be examined and tabulated in the form of decision of matrix by giving
suitable weightage to each factor. From the decision matrix, 2 to 4 sites
are
identified
for
feasibility
study.
Pre-feasibility
study need
not be
carried out for widening and rehabilitation project. Pre-feasibility studyjs
specially required in the case of bridges on missing links.
5. PREPARATION OF TECHNO-ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY REPORT
5.1.
General
The techno-economic
feasibility study
report prepared with
the
data readily
available
as
well
as
that collected during
the
feasibility
studies should indicate
in
detail various
alternatives
in respect of the
technical, economic and social aspects. The quality of feasibility report
depends upon
the
accuracy and
extent of
data,
its
analysis and
the
investigation that goes into its preparation. The nature and extent of data
needed depends upon the type of crossing as well as on
its size.
5.2.
IdentificaUon of Data Needs
The data collection should be carefully planned. While the data
collected should be comprehensive enough to aid engineering judgement,
a disciplined effort
is required to identify specific data needs for any
given project. Data needs for long span bridges such as cable stayed and
5

======================================================================
IRC:SP:54-2000
suspension bridges, arch bridges or P.S.C. box construction of cantilever
method would be different from those for more conventional bridges. Site
data requirement, discussed hereunder, can be treated as a general guide.
Depending on the requirements of a particular
site,
activities in
respect of site data collection, evaluation of design data and structure
design may have to be repeated on demand. Hence, these activities should
be planned so as to afford the required site flexibility. Also the aspects
wherein repetition can be avoided should be identified at the earliest.
Data
collected
should
be
continuously
reviewed,
which may
sometimes lead to identification of supplementary data needs or revision
of data already collected.
The data colle^^tion team should have regular interaction with the
design department/highway administration.
Foi" selection of alternative bridge sites and approach alignments,
reference may be made
to
"Pocket Book
for Bridge Engineers" and
"Pocket Book for Highway Engineers" published by IRC.
Economic viability of the bridge project on alternative locations
play a vital part in selection of the site.
5.3.
Data Collection
5.3.1.
Maps, plans and topographical features
i) Index Map
An
index map
is needed
to
locate
the
project area with
reference
to
its
connection with the capital
city of the State and near by major towns.
It
should give a bird's eye view of the project area and the overall road and rail
network in the State. The alternate sites investigated/the general topography
of the country, the important towns, villages,
etc., in the vicinity are to be
shown
in
the index map. The
largest
scale topographical maps
available
(1:50,000) may be used for preparing the index map. Smaller scale (1:250,000)
may be used in addition for major projects for covering larger are^.

IRC:SP:54-2000
ii)
Site Plan
A
site
plan drawn
to
a
suitable
scale
should show
details
of
the
sites
considered
in
the
feasibility
study
and
extending
not
less
than
100 m
upstream and down-stream from
tlje centre
line of the crossing.
It should
cover the approaches
to a
sufficient distance, which
in
the case of major
bridge shall not be less than 500 m on either side of the channel. In case the
river is meandering in the vicinity of the proposed bridge
site, the course of
the river extending a suitable distance not less than 2 loops on either side of
the proposed crossing
shall te plotted on
the
site plan. The name of the
channel or the bridge and of the road and identification number allotted to
the crossing are to be indicated, the direction of flow of water, the alignment
of existing approach, angle of skew, location and value of permanent bench
mark, the location of cross sections and longitudinal sections taken, location
of
trial
pits
or
boring,
other
details
such
as
building
or any
permanent
structure, places of worships, well, nallah, burial ground, out crop area, etc.,
are also to be indicated.
lii) Contour Survey Plans
The contour* plan of the stream should show
all topographical features and
extending upstream and downstream of any of the proposed
sites,
to
the
distance indicated below
(or such other greater distances as
the Engineer
responsible for the design maydirect) and to
sufficient distance on
either
side
to give a clean
indication of the topographical or other features
that
night influence the location and design of the bridge and its approaches. All
alemative sites considered shall be shown on the plan.
(a)
100 m for catchment area less than 3
sq. km
^scale not less than
1 cm = 10 m)
(b)
3tO m for catchment area of 3
to 15
sq. km
(scde not less than
1 cm = 10 m)
(c)
1.5 km or the width, between
the banks, which ever
is
greater,
for
catchnent areas more than
15
sq. km
(scale rot less than
1 cm = 50 m)
In case of meandering river, the above provision has to be suitably reviewed.
!v) Topographical Map
The topographical imp
is essential for finalising the site alignment. Such a
map could be prepared from topographical maps published by the Survey of
India.
If deemed
necessary,
due
to
the
scope
and
size
of
the
project,
combined with scarcity of data, etc., aerial survey may be made to provide
7



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:54-2000
sufficient updated
data.
For very
large bridge
projects
or
for bridges
in
difficult terrain, satellite imagery may also be obtained to fix alternative sites.
For major
bridges, ground survey of
site may be needed
to
include
the
relevant portion of approaches and the river reach relevant to the protection
work.
v) Catchment Area Map
In
order
to determine
the
basic
parameters
of discharge,
etc.,
it
will
necessary
to
prepare
the catchment
area map from
available topographc
maps. In restricted areas where topographic maps are restricted, the concered
departments should make efforts to procure the same for the project. A(£ual
parameters of scale and size to be used in the catchment area map d^nd
to
great
extent on
the
needs
of each
individual
project
and
a
sudied
judgement
is required on the part of the engineer responsible,
vi)
Geological Map
Geological maps, when required for reference in route alignment ^-nd bridge
site selection for assessing geological stability, should be procure! from the
Survey of India, State Geological Departments, etc.
5.3.2. Traffic data
: Basic design parameters such as the number
of traffic lanes required, the approach gradients, need for a tentral verge
etc. are determined by the type, intensity and volume of tnffic to which
the bridge has to cater.
In case of bridges forming part of road projects, tie traffic figures
collected for the design of road could be directly
utilised.
In case of
independent bridge projects, traffic survey should be coiducted if adequate
data is not readily available.
Depending upon the importance, relevance ind complexity of the
project and the traffic scenario, the type of data wMch will be needed are:
a)
Classified Traffic Volume Count
b)
O-D Survey
c)
Speed and Delay Survey
d)
PedesU^in Volume Survey
e>
Socio-economic profile of the project icfluencc area for the last 5 years
5.3.3. River cross-section for a bridge project
: The river cross-
sections yield information on channel profile, bank characteristics, depths
8



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:54-2000
of water, etc. However, these data are usually collected during lean flow
periods, their direct application in estimation of the design discharge may
not be feasible or reliable.
The number of river cross-sections should be such
as
to
yield
sufficient data for design of waterway, proposed structure and the approach
\ embankment.
At
least one
cross-section
should
be
taken
along
the
proposed alignment of the bridge for each alternative
site. The location
if cross-sections shall be indicated on the site map. The number of cross-
stctions studied should conform to the provision of relevant clauses of
IFC:5.
5.3.4. Hydrologic data and
river characteristics
: The
basic
purpose of collecting hydrological data
is to study the rain fall pattern
(like iuensity, duration, frequency) and run off characteristics of the basin
under consideration, and thereby determine the likely discharge through
the chamel and thus decide upon the optimum water^vay for the bridge.
The extent of hydrological data collection and subsequent analysis
should be commensurate with the type and size of crossing under study.
5.3.5. Catchment area chs^racteristics
: The catchment area of a
bridge site should be identified and marked cle'arly on the topographical
map. The
idertified catchment
should
also
include
the
contour and
existing land use pattern like forests* cultivated land, barren land, desert,
etc., to the extent possible.
"

"
The run-off cf a stream at a given site is determined by two factors:
(i) precipitation and (ii) physical characteristics of the. catchment area. In
general,
the
size of \he catchment area plays a dominant
role
in
the
determination
of
run-off.
However,
it
is
possible
that some
other
characteristics such as 4ope, soil characteristics,
etc., becomes equally
important
at
specific
sites.
This
. possibility
should
be
thoroughly
investigated during the data collection stage and appropriate measures
taken
to
obtain
a
full
set of
data.
Likely changes
in
the catchment
environment and land use should also be kept in view. Future development
in the vicinity of the alignment specially for urban-areas which might

======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:54.2000
influence the run-off characteristics, (if indicated in any perspective plan
already developed) should also be looked into.
5.3.6. River/Channel characteristics
: All details of configuration
of the river/channel as may be relevant to hydrological analysis may be
obtained from ground/aerial survey. All controls, natural (drops, rapids,
bends,
debris)
and
artificial
(dams,
barrages,
weirs,
spurs,
road and
railway
bridges,
etc.)
should
be
identified
and
relevant
informatior
obtained.
Details,
if any,
of future work
that may
affect
the
strean
hydraulics should be collected. Degradation of a river channel may invte
higher flood discharge whereas aggradation may result in higher
fliKxi
levels and bank spills. These factors have a direct bearing on the de»ign
of waterway clearances and approaches as well as the bridge struuHure
itself All information which may help evaluate present or possible iiiture
aggradation/degradation
of channel
should
also be
collected.
£ifforts
should also be made to collect data regarding the quantity, size mi nature
of debris and floating materials and the period of occurrence ofdebris in
relation to flood peaks.
5.3.7. Flood
flow
data
: A
reliable
assessment
o'
the
flood
discharge and of the corresponding water levels are basic for a proper
design of the bridge and
its approaches.
a)
Historical Data
Major floods that arc known to have occurred at the
.«te before the start of
maintaining records may be called historical floods. Al data relating to these
events including the years in which they have occuml, the magnitude, the
area floodfid, flood water levels, flood marics or oUie' positive evidence of the
height of historical flood etc. should be collected fom all available sources.
Local
enquiry
can
also
provide
useful
data.
A
critical
analysis
of
the
reliability of such data
is of paramount importance.
Personnel with necessary experience in flood low determination can detect
flood marks or other positive evidence of tte height of historical
floods,
which may prove invaluable as additional
oata.
b) Flood Data Records
Flood discharge data at the nearest gauging station and other flood related
data thit may be available from records of irrigation or other authorities/



======================================================================
PAGE 27 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:54-2000
agencies shall be collected.
It
is readily recognised that gathering such data
depends on the co-operation extended by the concerned authorities/agencies.
The hydraulic performance of existing bridges or other structures under flood
situations in the vicinity of the proposed facility should be used to augment
the available hydrologic data. The effect of flood control
structures
in the
upstream
stretch needs
to be
investigated and appropriately
assessed and
accounted
for.
The discharge and linear waterway should be calculated as per IRC:5 General
Features of Design (Section-I)
5.3.8. Sub-soil data
: Information on the soil in bed and bank^ is
necessary for evaluation of sediment, movement, and the stability of bed
and banks
in
general. The
size and
particle .distribution of
soil,
soil
classification and other relevant information shall be obtained. IRC: 78
and relevant IS Codes may be referred.
Borings for foundation-soil exploration will yield data regarding
scour, sound founding strata, S.B.C., settlement characteristics etc.
5.3.9. Meteorological data
: All relevant meteorological records
of temperature, wind, cyclones, etc. that may determine the loading and
other design specifications of structure or affect construction operations
shall be collected. This would be required in the case of major bridge
structures only.
Information on wind speeds, temperature variations in summer and
winter, rainfall, humidity likely to prevail and their expected duration
is
also required for planning of construction operations.
5.3.10. Construction materials
: Information on
availability of
construction materials with special reference to their quality, quantity and
proximity of their source should be carefully collected.
Majority of the road bridges are built in reinforced or prestressed
concrete. The prime object of material-surveys, is to identify good quality
aggregate (conforming to specifications) sources at site or in its vicinity.
It is important to appreciate that concrete of adequate quality can be made
economically with aggregates of widely
divergent
characteristics and
11



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 64
======================================================================
lRC:SP:54-2000
hence the number of sources to be investigated with respect to economic
and technical viability will necessarily be large.
5.3.11. Environmental data
: All data relevant to 'environmental
examination' have to be collected for projects for which such study
is
demanded. A description of the environmental aspects of the site supported
by sketches and photographs may be furnished where necessary.
In general, care should be taken to minimise the degradation of the
existing environment of the proposed
site.
5.3.12. Special design requirements
: Special design requirements
may be required or asked for some specific projects. These may relate to
special road traffic requirements. Water-transport requirements, hydraulic-
model study, wind-tunnel
testing, dynamic analysis and seismic design
controls etc.
For major bridge projects the span arrangement is, to some extent,
dictated
by
the
river
regime.
Establishing
flow
patterns,
discharge
distribution etc. become difficult for many reasons (such as soil conditions,
presence of obstruction in the form of other structures, meandering course
of the river). Model studies can help in finding an optimum solution.
In general, model studies are expensive and hence should be taken
recourse
to
only where
essentially
required. Model
studies
are more
justifiable for major bridges and/or bridges located in strategic areas etc.
Model studies give more definitive ideas about preferred alignment,
flow patterns, discharge distribution, form, type and extent of guide bund
etc., than analysis of data and studying of maps.
It will also help to find
out the effect of siltation particularly for bridges near ports, jetties, etc.
to
assess
the
appropriate
length.
However,
results
of model
studies
require careful scrutiny and an intelligent interpretation. Situations leading
to inaccurate results from model studies should be identified and corrective
measures taken.
5.3.13. Existing services
: A strip plan showing existing service
facilities such
as telephone
lines,
electric
lines (high tension and low
12



======================================================================
PAGE 29 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:54-2000
tension), underground cables, underground water lines, sewer lines, etc. is
required to be prepared. The strip plan should also show the position of
relocation of such service facilities.
5.3.14. Labour accommodation
: Information regarding the supply
and demand aspects of skilled and unskilled labour have to be collected,
especially for major bridge projects.
Availability of such labour locally
has
to
be
investigated.
Land
requirement
for
storage,
labour
accommodation, offices, etc. may be quite considerable in major projects
and demand close scrutiny.
In addition, requirements for labour camps such as drinking water,
sanitation
at
site, housing,
electricity and other
facilities may
also be
investigated and reported to the extent necessary.
5.3.15. Other authorities
:
Information about other
authorities
whose clearance is required for the project should be collected. Interaction
with these authorities to ascertain their specific requirements would help
in collection of any additional data and preparation of the project in a
well planned manner.
5.3.16. Data regarding existing bridges
: Functioning of existing
bridges on the stream in the vicinity of proposed bridge location (Road'
bridge, Railway bridge etc.) should be studied and data collected. Data
collected should include hydraulic
data, geometric data and
structural
data to the extent possible.
5.4.
Organisation of Activities
Major activities required for preparing the feasibility report have
to be identified and placed in proper sequence so as to provide a smooth
flow of operation.
Activities leading to preparation of a well documented feasibility
report may be classified as given below
:
a)
Collection of data
13

Identification of alternative bridge sites/alignments
e)
Development of design philosophy
f)
Preliminary
design,
general
arrangement
drawings
and
preliminary
cost
estimates
g)
Environmental impact examination and economic evaluation
h)
Model study where required through appropriate agency and taken up as a
parallel activity to items (e) to (g).
It
is quite obvious
that many of the
activities
stated above are
interlinked.
5.5.
Source of Data
The sources of site data may include
:
i) Maps
ii)
Records
iii)
Govt. Deptts. such as Industries, Agriculture, Planning Board etc.
iv)
Field inspection
v)
Information obtained from local enquiry
vi)
Geological details
At least one site inspection should be conducted. The purpose of
site inspection varies with the level of the team involved. It ranges from
identification of data needs and collection of raw data at the elemental
level
to
a global
appraisal of the project
to
aid
in
analysis, decision
making and financing. Careful planning of field inspection activities
is
necessary for a successful site/field inspection visit.
The need for conducting data collection in stages, review of the
collected data and the decisions based on the same, lead to multiple site
inspections throughout the project preparation exercise. The initial field
inspection should also identify the number and type of field inspection
which may be needed in later stages. A reconnaissance survey may be
carried out to examine the general character of the area. Data collected
would be useful in deciding alternative sites to be examined.

5.6.
Preliminary Investigation
5.6.1. General
: After collecting the data, preliminary investigation
is to be undertaken keeping in view the data collected. As the preliminary
investigation results are analysed, there might be need for more details in
particular areas. The extent of gaps in investigation could be reduced by
careful planning prior to taking up preliminary investigation.
5.6.2. Topographic survey
: A review of the available topographic
data should reveal the additional details required. Efforts should be made
to collect these through an accurate instrument survey. The data collected
should be accurate, detailed and exhaustive enough for use in the detailed
design stage.
Ground surveys conducted at site help in preparation of site map
and river cross sections. Keeping in mind that these maps are to be used
in the identification of alternative locations and alignments, the surveys
should be planned to be sufficiently exhaustive.
Establisnment of permanent bench marks
at
site linked
to GIS
levels which
are
to be used during
detailed survey
construction and
maintenance must precede such survey.
5.6.3. Hydrological survey
: For bridge projects across any stream/
river, a hydrological survey should be carried out.
5.6.4. Traffic survey
:
Traffic survey should be carried out
in
accordance with relevant IRC Code.
5.6.5. Sub-soil investigation
: In the feasibiUty stage, the sub-soil
investigation should be carried out in a representative manner.
The
investigation
carried
out should give
sufficient
details
for
various alternatives under consideration. Extent of subsoil investigations
including number of bore holes should be predetermined.

5.7.
Preliminary Engineering
5.7.1. Design philosophy
: Design philosophy of criterion
is a
clear, comprehensive and precise elucidation of the general principles to
be adopted and the significant parameters to be used in the actual design
of a highway bridge
structure. Design philosophy forms
the basis of
design and also serves as a reference for the design procedure.
Design philosophy flows from design requirements as per codes;
nature of data base; the extent of available data;
special requirements
specified
for the
particular bridge
structure by
the
client
viz.
special
loads,
increased
clearances and
current
practice. As
far
as
possible
minimum number of expansion joints should be kept in the structure for
better serviceability by adopting larger span or continuity in structure.
5.7.2. Analysis of data
: The
data collected and investigation
results should be analysed to determine the following
:
i) UFL
ii) LWL
iii) LBL
iv)
Erodibility of bed/scour level
v)
Design discharge
vi)
Likely foundation depth
vii)
Safe bearing capacity
viii)
Engineering properties of sub-soil
ix)
Artisian conditions
x)
Settlement
characteristics
xi)
Vertical clearances
xii)
Horizontal clearance
xiii)
Free board for approach road
xiv)
Severity of environment with reference to corrosion (severe/moderate)
xv)
Data pertaining to seismic and wind load
xvi)
Availability of suitable construction material
xvii) Requirement of model study
Data for various types of a bridge structure, such as a river-bridge,
a flyover, an underpass etc., need to be analysed within the framework of
function of the structure.
16



======================================================================
PAGE 33 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:54-2000
The analysis of data should be relevant and exhaustive enough to
be of adequate use in the development of design philosophy.
5.7.3. Finalisation of design philosophy
: A design philosophy is
arrived
at based on the codal requirements for design,
results of data
analysis, special requirements specified by the client and current practices.
The design philosophy should include following general principles to be
followed in the design, such as, relevant methods of analysis and design,
parameters of design, like design loads, flood levels, etc., special design
requirements, namely traffic dispersal system, construction methodology
etc., codes to be followed in the order of precedence, special literature.
While finalizing the design philosophy, aesthetic form and function
of the bridge structure should be given due consideration. Appropriate
durability criteria should be adopted for bridge structures. For bridges in
marine environment, requirement for protection of reinforcement against
corrosion should be considered.
(a) Additional consideration for aqueduct
It
is possible that a site chosen for an aqueduct is also an ideal location for
a highway bridge
to cross
the
river.
It
is
also
possible
that considerable
savings in costs may be achieved where an aqueduct and a highway bridge
are combined. In this case,
it
is quite likely that the approach roads of the
highway may not follow the most preferred alignment.
Design philosophy for a combined structure should reflect the concerns and
the needs for both the elements. Comprehensive design philosophy should
detail out factors
that are relevant to each element,
viz.
the aqueduct and
bridge, and also those which are common to both. This entails concurrence
of ideas of the various concerned departments such as the irrigation, bridges,
highways, etc. The design philosophy should take cognizance of the relevant
Codal provisions for aqueduct design and the IRC specifications, codes and
special publications for highway bridges.
The factors which have to be worked during discussions among the concerned
authorities, inter-alia, are
: the alignment, the formation level, slopes, if any,
of the structure, relative positions of the two elements, the structural system,
loads, construction methodology and sequences.
17



======================================================================
PAGE 34 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:54-2000
(b) Additional considerations for subways and underpasses
Major
factors
to be given consideration
in subway/underpass designs and
construction are
:
(i) stability of the structure against uplift due to buoyancy
as a whole and also during construction;
(ii) water tightness of the structure
to prevent seepage;
(iii) drainage of the subway;
(iv) construction aspects
such as excavation,
traffic diversion scheme
etc.;
(v) existing services and
future provision, if required; (vi) ventilation consideration; (vii) lighting and
other
utilities.
The structure should be checked for overall stability against uplift,
the calculations for such a determination depend upon the level of the
water table assumed. The highest water table level
is arrived from the
study of data collected over a reasonably long period in the past at the
proposed site. In the absence of such data, the maximum water table level
may be
set
at a depth of 0,5
metre from
the
existing ground
level.
However, decision regarding the water table level shall be made on the
basis of discussion among all concerned parties.
The methods
to be adopted
to overcome any
uplift have
to be
indicated in the design philosophy. These methods generally fall into two
major categories
viz. those which increase the weight of the structure
such as
iron ore
filling and those which anchor the structure such as
providing
ground
anchors. When
ground
anchors
are
proposed,
the
suitability of the soil conditions have to be ascertained by additional tests,
if necessary. When the weight of the structure
is to be increased,
the
availability and economy of the heavier fill materials should be investigated.
Artesian
condition,
if
any,
should be
studied
for
finalisation
of
the
foundation location and type of foundation.
Underground
structures,
e.g., subways are highly susceptible
to
water
leakage
and
subsequent
structural
damage
which
reduces
serviceability and durability of the structure. To ensure water tightness,
the
structure may be designed
as uncracked, or more prudently, with
limited crack widths. Crack widths may be limited to values acceptable
to all the concerned parties, say 0.1 mm and the same may be achieved
by limiting the strain in steel and by providing smaller diameter reinforcing
bars at closer spacings etc. These details need to be agreed upon by all
concerned parties. Additional water proofing may be needed and details

of the procedures
for
the same need
to be mentioned
in
the
design
philosophy. Alternatively use of water pressure release system may be
resorted to where feasible and after discussions with owner.
Drainage
of subways
is
an
important
consideration. Wherever
possible,
gravity
led
drainage
should be
given
preference.
However,
gravity assisted drainage should be augmented where required by providing
a sump-pump facility. This will entail the incorporation of facilities such
as pumphouse etc. in the overall plan of the structure.
The design philosophy for subways and underpasses should include
details
of the
excavation
procedure
to be
arrived
at
after a
detailed
analysis of nature of the soil, economy, suitability of the scheme envisaged
in
construction,
traffic
diversion
programmes,
location
of
existing
underground services
etc.
Special precautions which need
to be taken
during excavation, such' as safety of neighbouring structures, movement
of pedestrain and vehicular traffic
etc. have to be mentioned in
detail.
Proposed methods of dewatering during
construction
is
also
a major
aspect which should be dealt with-in the design philosophy.
Provision for ventilation in case of subways should be based on
acceptable
levels
of
pollution
and
should be
detailed
in
the
design
philosophy, keeping in view comfort of the public.
Lighting of subways should also be detailed in the design philosophy.
Glare-free
lighting luminaire
to achieve
a lux
level of 100 lux or as
decided in consultation with concerned authorities, should preferably be
adopted.
Ligfiting
levels
in
subways/underpasses
should be
critically
examined
under day
light
conditions
to
achieve
acceptable
gradient
between
the bright outside and
the
relatively dark
inside. The design
philosophy for electrical system should also indicate the type of wiring,
provision of standby supply, etc.
The design philosophy,
insofar
it
is developed
at the
feasibility
report
stage,
should be
agreed upon by
all concerned
parties
before
proceeding to the next phase.

5.7.4. Approach alignment and siting of bridges
: Selection of
various alternative alignments involve only preliminary engineering. These
alternatives are usually based on subjective judgement. Care should be
taken to see that alternatives are not sought for the sake of alternatives,
i.e., the alternatives should be meaningful and sufficiently distinct from
one another.
Preliminary investigation of siting and alignment alternatives are
usually required for major bridges where different approach alignment,
and economy of construction are influencing factors.
Alternatives may be grouped into two categories
:
(i) siting and
approach-alignment alternatives, (ii) alternatives in the structural systems.
Identification of feasible alternative sites and approach alignments
may be made with the aid of topographical maps, road project maps, field
survey maps etc. as available. Factors affecting the choice of structural
forms are enumerated in clause 5.7.7. herein
5.7.5. Identification
of
feasible
alternative
alignment
:
Preliminary bridge-site location and, along with
it, alignrpent alternatives
need to be decided upon at the start of feasibility study to enable planning
relevant data collection efforts. At least some basic data in the form of
broad topographic survey maps are needed at this stage. At various stages
of project development,
alternatives could be progressively
shortlisted
based on more data and
its analysis keeping
in view the influence of
geometric requirements of road alignment. Guidelines for bridge alignment
given
in
Pocket Book
for
Bridge
Engineers
published by IRC
for
Ministry of Shipping & Transport may be referred.
Review of alternatives may include
field inspection
as well
as
scrutiny of data.
For selection of alternatives, a decision matrix could be made as
in the case of pre-feasibility study stage.
20

======================================================================
IRC:SP:54-2000
For minor bridges
(upto a
total
length of 60 m), alignment of
approaches takes precedence over the bridge
site, whereas for a major
bridge
(with
total
length of over 300 m)
the requirement of a good
bridge
site
is given
priority. For bridges, within these two extremes a
choice
shall
be made
on
the
relative
merits
between
the two
viz.
bridge
site and
alignment
of approaches.
Final
choice
shall
require
discussions with the concerned authorities such as PWD, MOST, City
Corporation
and/or any
other
client before
preparation of
feasibility
Report.
5.7.6. Geometric design
: For every feasible site and alignment,
a geometric design which includes
vertical curves,
horizontal curves,
superelevation etc. need to be carried out.
5.7.7. Span
configuration
:
Each
site
has
its own
unique
conditions
affecting
the choice
for the type of a bridge
structure
for
optimum
performance,
economy
and
maintenance
free
design
life
service.
Choice
of
a
particular
span
arrangement
and
the
type
of
structure depends upon several factors such as site characteristics, type
of
sub-soil
strata,
height
and
length
of
the
bridge,
design
and
construction aspects, availability of construction materials, construction
technology and time-frame of construction etc.. In case of urban flyovers,
the practical and economic viability of viaduct span vis-a-vis retaining
walls for approaches may be examined without affecting the aesthetics
and other requirements.
Design
effort
is an
important parameter
in
selecting
the
span
arrangement and so also
is the availability of specialised centering and
shuttering,
launching
equipment
etc.
These
factors
often
dictate
an
alternative
span
arrangement
to
be
adopted.
Successful
tenderer's
suggestions regarding an alternative span arrangement are governed by
the design and construction resources under his
control. Such
tender
data from previous
projects
should be made use of
in
updating
the
feasibility analysis for the project
at hand. This would greatly help in
limiting the number of economically feasible alternatives.
21



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:54.2000
The
ranges
of span
length
within which
a
particular
type of
superstructure can be economical alongwith other considerations like type
of foundation etc. are given below
:
Type of superstructure
Span length
(i)
R.C.C. single or multiple boxes
1.5
to 15 m
(ii)
Simply supportwJ RCC slabs
3
to 10 m
(iii) Simply supported RCC T-Beam
10 to 25 m
(iv) Simply supported PSC girder bridges
25
to 45 m
(v) Simply supported RCC voided slabs
10 to
15 m
(vi)
Continuous RCC voided slabs
10 to 20 m
(vii) Continuous PSC voided slabs
15
to 30 m
(viii) RCC box sections; simply supported/
balanced cantilever continuous
25
to 50 m
(ix) PSC Box sections, simply supported
balanced cantilever
35
to 75 m
(X) PSC
cantilever construction/continuous
75 to 150 m
(xi)
Cable stayed bridges
200 to 500 m
(xii) Suspension bridges
500 m
onwards
However, whenever an economical span arrangement and type of
structure is decided,
it has to be ensured that the required infrastructural
facilities, design and construction capabilities, specialised materials etc.
are available.
5.7.8. Aesthetic consideration^
: For aesthetics, attention should
be focussed on producing a clean, simple, well proportioned structural
form. In most cases, achieving the desired visual quality may add little to
the overall cost of the structure. Aesthetic considerations should play an
important part in minor bridges also. Bridge parapets, are the most visible
parts and should harmonise with the surroundings.
Landscaping
the
site
to
achieve
visual agreement between
the
structure and the environment should be considered especially in case of
urban locations and grade separation structures.
22



======================================================================
PAGE 39 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:54-2000
5.7.9. Preliminary design
: Preliminary designs should be carried
out for all alternatives.
The
design
should
provide
the
following:
the
approach
road
alignment, siting, geometric design: type, depth and preliminary design of
foundations
and
substructures,
type
and
preliminary
design
of
the
superstructure including bearings,
5.7.10. General arrangement drawings
: Based on the preliminary
design,
General
Arrangement Drawings
should
be
produced
for
all
alternatives. These drawings should be detailed enough in all respects so
that a considered judgement of the relative merits of the various alternatives
can be made.
5.7.11. Preliminary cost estimates
: Preliminary cost estimates
are prepared after the preliminary design for various alternatives has been
completed. Such cost estimates are necessary for feasibility studies and
project evaluation. Rates adopted for the cost estimates should be those
as per schedule of rates based on MOST Data Book. For items
not
covered by Data Book, proper analysis of rates may be prepared.
5.7.12. Initial environmental examination
: Initial environmental
examination should be carried out for all alternatives. Construction of a
large bridge may have an adverse impact on the environment. The most
likely impacts are as under.
a)
Increase in floodability
b) Likelihood of river bank erosion
c)
Possibility of siltation
d)
Relocation and rehabilitation of people/communities
e)
Traffic and transportation effects on the surrounding areas
f)
Effects on historic site/monuments
g)
Likelihood of the bridge structure not harmonising with the surroundings.
Floodability can increase
if the waterway
is inadequate and the
afflux is large. This may raise the level of water upstream in the nearby
settlements.
The siting of the bridge and the waterway prisivided may change the
course of the
river and erode the river banks,
affecting
the, land and
settlements.
23



======================================================================
PAGE 40 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:54-2000
The level of the river bed may rise due to siltation that may be
caused due to interference with the natural regime of the flow. Inadequate
waterway too causes flooding and consequent deposition of silt on the
agricultural land.
For major bridges, there
is a distinct possibility of relocation of
people communities. Efforts should be made to keep the impact of the
bridge
in
this regard
to a minimum. The proposed bridge might also
attract or generate additional
traffic affecting adversely the capacity of
roads in the vicinity. The proposed bridge may also adversely affect the
quality
and
nature
of
historic
sites/rrionuments.
Aspects
of
such
environmental impacts of the proposed bridge need
to be
studied
in
detail.
In addition, approaches to a major bridge may traverse through
forest
land,
unstable
hill
faces,
natural
lakes,
historical landmarks
or
architectural/archaeological
relics. The Archaeological Survey of India
and
the
State
Archaeological Departments
should be
consulted. The
department
of
culture
will
be
able
to
throw
light on
the
historical
resources.
When bridges and their approaches are to be constructed adjacent
to inhabited areas, the vibration, noise and dust caused by construction
activity
will
adversely
affect
the
environment.
Necessary
mitigatory
measures
will need
to be undertaken
to safeguard the
interests of the
surrounding environment.
5.8.
Economic Evaluation
5.8.1. General principles
: Though the construction of a bridge
brings about a variety of benefits enjoyed by practically all sectors of the
economy, the prevailing conditions of resource scarcity necessitates an
economic evaluation of projects
so
that only worthwhile
projects
are
taken
up
for
implementation.
The
Indian
Roads
Congress
Special
Publication No. 30 (Manual pn Economic Evaluation of Highway Projects)
contains detailed procedure for economic evaluation and may be referred
io for guidance.
24



======================================================================
PAGE 41 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:54-2000
While for very large bridge project a separate economic evaluation
is necessary, smaller projects are usually included as part of the overall
highway projects for economic analysis.
Economic
evaluation
exercise
for
large
bridge
projects
should
include approaches as a part of the project. The cost and benefits of both
bridge and
its approaches are to be considered together.
5.8.2. Period of analysis
: A bridge has a long design life of many
years (say in the range of 50-100 years). But
it is not necessary to carry
out economic evaluation for such a long period because of difficulties of
forecasting and because of the insignificant contribution of discounted
future benefits.
It
is customary
to cover a period of 15-30 years
after
throwing open the facility to traffic.
5.8.3. Traffic
projection
:
Three
types
of
traffic
are
to
be
considered
:
1. Normal traffic, which includes the present traffic growing at a projected rate.
2.
Diverted
traffic,
i.e. the traffic which would get diverted to the new
facility
after
its construction.
3.
Generated
traffic, the
traffic
that gets generated Or induced because of the
new improved
facility.
The rate of growth of traffic is estimated on the basis of (i) past
trends with
suitable
modifications
to account
for
the
future, and
(ii)
economic models which establish the elasticity of traffic with respect to
economic indicators such as GNP, growth in population, agricultural and
industrial outputs.
5.8.4. Troject cost and scheduling
: Cost of the project
is
split
into yearly cost inputs over the expected period of completion. The cost
of maintaining the structure over the period of analysis is also considered.
Since economic costs, exclusive of taxes and subsidies are to be considered,
they should be worked out after studying the tax element in the various
items of work. As an approximation, the economic cost can be taken to
be 80-85 per cent of the financial cost.
25



======================================================================
PAGE 42 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:54-2000
5.8.5. Project benefits
: The benefits from the construction of a
bridge
fall under the following heads
:
a)
Savings
in
vehicle
operating
costs due
to reduced
travel
distance
and/or
superior road conditions;
b)
Savings
due
to
value
of
reduction
in
time
of
travel
of passengers
and
commodities
in
transit;
c)
Savings due
to reduction
in accident costs;
d)
Expected
increase
in
agricultural,
industrial or mining output.
Travel time savings of passengers are not generally considered in
highway project evaluation
in India. However,
if the project results
in
very substantial travel time savings, the EIRR may be presented with and
without travel time savings, e.g. in the case of an urban route.
The VOC elements may be taken from the IRC Special Publication
No.
30.
5.8.6.
Sensitivity analysis
: The estimation of project costs and
benefits
is
dependent
on
various
factors
which may
vary
from
the
assumptions made at the time of project formulation. In order to asses§^
how sensitive the economic evaluation
is
to uncertainties, a sensitivity
analysis
is carried out. Normally, three cas'es are considered
:
i) Base benefits reduced by
15 per cent
ii)
Base cost increased by
15 per cent
iii)
Base
(i)
and.
(ii) above together.
5.8.7. Economically/Financially low return projects
:
In some
projects,
particularly
for subways,
underpasses,
flyover
etc. .adequate
economic/financial return may not be associated. These are needed from
the considerations of special benefits under compelling circumstances.
5.9.
Feasibility Study Report
Feasibility Study of a projeict should be carried out and a report
prepared to cover the following aspects wherever relevant and applicable.
These are for general guidance only and any other relevant subject shall
be studied and suitably incorporated in the report.

Acceptance of Feasibility Study Report
The feasibility study report is generally required to be presented in
draft form called draft Feasibility Study Report to the employer for their
comments. After receipt of comments of the employer,
the
feasibility
study report is finalised duly incorporating the comments of the employer.
After submission of final feasibility study report, the employer is required
to
take
decision
about
final
bridge
site,
approach
alignment,
design
parameters including type of bridge and span arrangement.
6. PREPARATION OF DETAILED PROJECT REPORT
6.1.
Detailed Investigation
Upon
finalisation
of
alignment
and
bridge
site,
detailed
investigations are carried out with respect to topographic survey, subsoil
investigations and environmental impact assessment. Model
study
(if
required) has to be carried out immediately after acceptance of approach
alignment and bridge
site.
6.1.1. Final
location
survey
:
The
purpose
of
final
location
survey
is to lay out final centre line of the road in field based on the
alignment selected in the design office and to collect necessary data for
preparation of working drawings. The completeness and accuracy of the
project drawings and estimate of quantities depends a great deal on the
precision with which
this survey
is carried out. As far as possible, for
28



======================================================================
PAGE 45 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:54-2000
survey of major bridges, modem survey equipment such as total station
should be used.
On fmalisation of bridge alignment, the same
is to be set-out on
site on the basis of actual geometry. The initial topographical survey
is
required to be updated on the basis of actual setting out at
site. Such a
detailed survey
is more important where there
is a substantial time gap
between execution of topographical survey
at preliminary investigation
stage and settlement of the alignment.
6.1.2. Sub-soil
investigation
: On
fmalisation
of
layout,
it
is
necessary to carry out a detailed sub-soil investigation based on the actual
layout.
It
is
at
this
stage
that
the requirement of various
tests
to be
conducted as well as their location at site becomes evident. At least one
bore hole on each foundation location should be made in case of major
bridges. When founding strata is rock, the number of bore holes may be
suitably increased depending upon the dip of rocky strata. The number of
bore holes in case of minor bridges may be decided in consultation with
the employer. The tests should provide adequate information required to
carry out engineering design. Sub-soil investigation should be carried out
as per IRC:78 and relevant IS Codes or as decided by the concerned
departments. Before the fmal investigation
is taken up,
it is necessary to
review the extent of usefulness and reliability of the data obtained from
preli'minary investigations. No further investigations are required in case
preliminary investigations provide adequate information/data to carry out
detailed engineering design.
6.1.3. Environmental impact assessment
: Environmental Impact
Assessment on the selected alignment should be carried out as per the
guidelines of Ministry of Environment & Forests. The mitigation measures
of adverse impact should be outlined by an Environmental Management
Plan.
6.2.
Detailed Design
After detailed investigations have been completed, detailed design
is taken up and has
to be carried out for various components of the
29-



======================================================================
PAGE 46 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:54-2000
crossing as per the design philosophy developed and finalised at feasibility
stage. Based on detailed design, working drawings
are required to be
prepared. Constructability of structure has to be considered in the design
stage. Special care may be taken to examine easy concreting of structure
by avoiding congestion of reinforcement and proper dimensioning.
6.2.1. Superstructure
: The detailed design of superstructure is to
be
carried
out
using
the most
appropriate
methods. Computer aided
methods
of
analysis may
be
used
but
care
should be
taken
in
the
modelling of the structure and interpretation of the results. Results so
obtained should preferably be checked by other simpler methods wherever
relevant.
For
specialised
structures
such
as
cable-stayed
or
suspension
bridges, dynamic analysis
is required. Wind tunnel testing may also be
required in certain cases.
6.2.2. Bearings, expansion joints,
railing, wearing coat and
appurtenances
: The type of bearings
is dependent on the
structural
system for the superstructure and the support conditions. The detailed
design of bearing is carried out depending upon the type of superstructure,
support condition and bearing type. Details of expansion joints, railing,
wearing coat and other appurtenances should also be given.
6.2.3. Substructure
: The detailed design of substructure will be
carried out in accordance with the hydraulic and structural requirement.
In addition, as the substructure
is one of the two
visible parts of the
crossing.
Its aesthetics require special consideration.
6.2.4. Foundations
: The type and size of foundations depends on
the
soil
conditions
and
river
flow
pattern
as
determined
from
the
investigations. The detailed design should be carried out following the
guidelines given in the design philosophy.
6.2.5. Approaches, river protection, river training works, etc.:
Detailed drawings of approaches,
river protection and
training works
(where provided) should also be given.

6.2.6. Software application
: For speedy and accurate analysis/
design, 'computer aided design' methods
are
often resorted
to. Where
standard proven
softwares
are
used,
with
approval
of the
client,
the
design may be carried out straight away giving a brief of the software
adopted, alongwith input data and output. If designers' own programmes
are used, their validity should be proved to the satisfaction of the client
giving the logic adopted and comparing the results obtained with long
hand method for few typical cases.
6.3.
Detailed Cost Estimates
6.3.1. Cost estimates and its content
: The detailed cost estimate
of the project should give a clear picture of the financial commitments
involved and should be complete in all respects.
It should give a realistic
idea of the cost involved. This
is possible only
if all the items of work
are carefully listed, the quantities are determined to a reasonable degree
of accuracy and the rates are provided on a realistic basis.
The estimate should have the following components presented in a
logical sequence
:
1.
General Abstract of Cost under Major Heads
2.
Details of Cost for Each Major Head
3.
Details of Quantities
4.
Justification
for Rates
5.
Quarry/Material Source Charts
6.
Foreign Exchange Component
7.
Tools and Plants
6.3.2. General abstract of cost
: The General Abstract of cost
should be one-page summary of estimated cost under each major head.
Considering that a bridge project invariably involves its approaches, the
following major heads are suggested:
1.
Site clearance
2.
Earthwork
3.
Shoulder, sub-base and base course
4.
Bituminous/cenicnt concrete courses'

Provision
should
be
made
for
contingencies,
work-charged
establishment costs, quality control and supervision charges.
Contingencies are intended to cover minor variations in quantities
and rates. The normal practice is to provide 3-5 per cent contingencies.
Work-charged establishment costs are intended to cover the wages
of casual staff employed in connection with execution of the work. The
normal practice
is to provide 1.5-2 per cent.
Quantity
of following
items should be given
in
the
report
for
working out factors for escalation formula
:
i) Cement
ii)
Reinforced
steel
iii)
Prestressing
steel (high tensile
steel)
iv)

Provision
for quality
control
is made
separately. The provision
should cover
the
cost of field and
central
laboratory and
the
testing
charges. In modem contracts,
it is usual to specify that all quality control
tests are made by the contractor at his cost, and the rates are expected to
reflect this. In that case,
it may be more appropriate to include this item
in the Analysis of Rate of individual item of work-
Project Management charges
are intended
to cover the cost of
office
establishment and
that of the
supervisory
staff
For National
Highway works which are executed by the State Public Works Department,

IRC:SP:54-2000
Agency Charges at 9 per cent are currently paid by the Central Government
to cover the supervision charges incurred by the States. If the supervision
is
to be done by
the
Indian
Consultants,
Foreign
Consultants
or
a
combination of these and the Public Works Department, the supervision
charges should be estimated accordingly.
The addition" of centage charges should follow a logical pattern.
The format given in clause 6.3.3
is recommended.
6.3.3. Details
of
cost
of each major head
:
Items
that
are
involved under each of the major heads of work are
to be
listed,
the
quantities and rates entered against each and the cost derived and entered.
In order to ensure that no items are missed,
it is desirable that each
department prepares its own standard list of items based on M.O.S.T. data
book and specifications. This standard list can be used 'for all estimates,
marking
'nil'
entries against those
that are not needed for a particular
project.

6.3.4. Details of quantities
: The quantities entered in the cost
estimate are to be well supported by detailed calculations.
It should be
possible for anybody to check the calculations independently.
6.3.5. Justification of rates
: The rates adopted must be realistic
and should reflect truly the cost likely to be incurred in carrying out the
work as per the specifications stipulated.
Most of the State Public Works Departments have Basic Schedule
of Rates for different Districts/Zones in the state and they are regularly
updated. If the Basic Schedule of Rates is valid for the year in which the
estimate is prepared, and it reflects the Specifications truly, the rates can
be adopted. Otherwise, the rates have to be analysed. The Report should
contain the analysis which should account for all items of cost, over heads
and profit on realistic basis.
The
quarry
and
material
source
charts
should accompany
the
analysis of rates.
6.3.6. Foreign exchange component
: Where a work involves the
use
of
foreign
exchange,
the
estimates
should
give
details
of
this
component. It should comprise material and equipment costs and personnel
costs.
6.4.
Specifications
The Detailed Project Report should clearly make a reference to the
Specifications which is intended to govern the work. These could be the
State Public Works Department Specifications or the Ministry of Surface
Transport Specifications.
6.5.
Special Specifications
If the Standard Specifications does not fully cover the scope of
certain items of work in the project, it is necessary to mention broadly the
additions and alterations that would be made to the Specifications. Any
special item not covered by the clauses in the Specifications may have to
be governed by special clauses issued by the Ministry of Surface Transport
34



======================================================================
PAGE 51 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:54-2000
or the State Public Works Departments.

borrowed from A.S.T.M. or other foreign bodies or Bureau of Indian
Standards
or
the
Indian
Roads
Congress,
mention
should
be made
accordingly.
6.6.
