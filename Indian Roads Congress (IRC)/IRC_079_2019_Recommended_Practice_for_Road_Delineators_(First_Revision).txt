RECOMMENDED PRACTICE FOR ROAD DELINEATORS
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1	
The role of delineators is to provide visual assistance to drivers about alignment of 
the road ahead, especially at night. Delineators are particularly effective in the case of complex 
locations involving changes in horizontal/vertical geometry, and during severe weather conditions 
such as heavy rain, fog or snow. Normally, reflectors are used on the delineators for better night 
time visibility.
1.2	
In a broad sense, “delineation” stands for any device or treatment whose aim is to 
outline the roadway or a portion thereof. This could include painted lines, raised pavement 
markers, posts, post-mounted reflectors or contrast treatments of the pavement. Delineation by 
pavement markings is covered by IRC:35, “Code of Practice for Road Markings”. This code deals 
only with post type retro reflective delineators or embedded on any concrete structures/trees.
1.3	
The code was first published by IRC in 1981. A need was felt to update the document 
keeping in view of the new and improved materials which are now available. A Sub-group consisting 
of Shri Pawan Kumar Singh (as Convener of the Sub-group) along with Dr. S. Velmurugan, Shri 
S.K. Popli, Dr. P.K. Agarwal and Shri Parampreet Singh as members was constituted to prepare 
the draft revision document. The draft prepared by the Sub-group was considered by the H-7 
committee (personnel given below) at its meeting held on 10th October 2018. The Convener was 
authorized to forward the same to IRC after modifying further in the light of the deliberations for 
placing before the Highways Specifications and Standards (HSS) Committee. Subsequently, 
HSS Committee considered and approved the draft in its meeting held on 23rd October, 2018. 
The revised draft incorporating the comments of HSS was approved by the 216th Council in its 
meeting held on 22nd November, 2018 at Nagpur (Maharashtra) for printing.

2. SCOPE
2.1	
Delineators are classified under three types:
	
(i)	
Roadway Indicators
	
(ii)	
Median Markers
	
(iii)	 Hazard Markers, and
	
(iv)	 Object Markers
2.2	
Each of these serves a somewhat different purpose. “Roadway indicators” are intended 
to delineate the edges of the roadway to guide drivers about the alignment ahead, particularly 
where it might be confusing for some reason. The objective of “hazard markers” is to define 
obstructions like guard-rails and abutments adjacent to the carriageway, for instance at culverts 
and bridges which are narrower than the roadway width at approaches. “Object markers” are 
used to indicate hazards and obstructions within the vehicle flow path, for example channelizing 
islands close to the intersections, roundabouts at the intersections or electric poles or trees 
located within the Right of Way (RoW).
2.3	
At the same time, it is to be borne in mind that the delineators are basically driving 
aids and should not be regarded as a substitute for warning signs, road markings, or barriers for 
out-of-control vehicles.
3. ROADWAY INDICATORS
Design
3.1	
Roadway indicators are popularly called as Delineators or Guide Poles. It is basically 
a form of guide posts made of Mild steel with pure polyester powder coating with the minimum 
thickness of powder coating of not less than 40 micron for protection against corrosion. The 
surface should be concealed so that there should not be any exposed surface without powder 
coating. Alternatively, these metal guide poles can be concealed with thermoplastic body which 
is of course somewhat cost prohibitive. The posts shall have an ellipsoidal or circular design 
with the height of the pole shall be 800 to 900 mm above the ground with about 200 to 300 
mm base which can be anchored onto the ground. Mild steel Guide Poles shall conform to 
Type XI sheeting specifications as per IRC:67 and ASTM D 4956 which would ensure to obtain 
clear visibility of the road alignment during night time (refer Fig. 1). In this context, to achieve 
enhanced visibility of the curved portion of the road, guide poles shall have substantial area

allocated to exhibit alternate band of black paint and white retro reflective sheeting which can 
provide added aesthetics as well. The above arrangement shall be in place on both sides of 
poles in the case of undivided carriageways having sharp curves.
To prevent complete vandalism of the above, it is recommended to house the sheeting coupled 
with concealed edges as shown in Fig. 1. The normal spacing between two successive guide 
poles shall be about 50 to 70 m center to center in case of high speed interurban roads catering 
to high volume traffic. However, in the case of low volume roads as well as rural roads located 
on rolling and hilly terrain, concrete delineators (shown in Fig. 2) can be used as these would 
be less costly.

3.2	
As an alternative to guide poles in work zones, plastic drums with alternative red 
and white retro-reflective stripes of 100 to 150 mm wide conforming to Type IV Standards 
(Reboundable work zone sheeting as per ASTM D 4956 Clause S2) shall be used for roadway 
delineation as shown in Fig. 3, especially when it is for temporary purpose in the event of 
diversions, road works etc.
Fig. 3 Temporary Delineator Posts for Work Zones
3.3	
These temporary guide posts shall possess a height of about 800 to 900 mm above the 
ground with about 200 to 300 mm base anchored onto the ground. Such temporary delineators 
shall have three stripes of retro reflective sheeting (each stripe with 150 sq cm or above) of 
Type XI conforming to IRC:67 and ASTM D-4956 which would ensure clear visibility during night 
time as shown in Fig. 3.
3.4	
These guide poles shall be always retro reflective in nature as it helps to improve 
visibility at night and at locations where visibility is poor due to fog etc. As mentioned earlier, 
the posts should have alternate band of black colour paint and white retro reflective sheeting of 
Type XI as per IRC:67 and ASTM D-4956. White colored retro reflective sheeting should be fixed 
on reverse side of posts in the case of undivided carriageways having sharp curves. 
Application
3.5	
The decision to use roadway indicators, whether continuously or in short sections 
selectively, will be guided by factors such as importance of the road, quantum of fast traffic, speed 
of travel, road crash records, danger posed by any specific deficiency in the road alignment, 
etc. The primary use of roadway indicators in non-urban sections of main roads is especially 
in curved reaches. However, in the urban stretches, the use of delineators could be decided 
based on warrants of the road and traffic conditions including the road stretches which are not 
adequately lighted. Application photographs are given in Fig. 4.
3.6	
In situations where a guard-rail or parapet wall is provided for safety, roadway indicators 
shall be mounted above or immediately behind the guard-rail. In addition, the guard-rail shall be 
treated with Retro-reflective sheeting of Type VI black and yellow stripes with Aluminum backed 
flexible prismatic sheeting conforming to ASTM D4956-09 which is applicable for reboundable 
devices.

Criteria for Use
3.7	
Normally, use of roadway indicators should be considered under the following situations:
	
(i)	
Curved Sections
	
(a)	 Horizontal curves of radius 300 m or less.
	
(b)	 Vertical curves with inadequate visibility.
	
(ii)	
Straight Sections
	
a.	
Road sections where visibility is often poor due to mist, fog or snowy 
conditions
	
b.	
Reaches where the alignment appears uncertain to the driver, e.g. pavement 
width transitions, temporary road diversions, etc. 
	
c.	
Road sections subject to frequent submergence and ponding due to storm 
water
	
d.	
Approaches to narrow bridges and culverts 
	
e.	
Valley side of hill roads
	
f.	
Road embankment exceeding 3 m in height
	
g.	
Approaches to important intersections
	
h.	
Special problem points such as causeways and tunnels.



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 24
======================================================================
IRC:79-2019

Placement and Spacing
3.8	
As a general rule, roadway indictors should be erected at the edge of the usable 
shoulder and in the case of kerbed sections at a distance of 0.6 m from the kerb face. On 
hilly terrains, they may be placed either on the parapet or at the edge of the earthen shoulder 
depending on the available roadway width and Right of Way (RoW).
3.9	
The overall line of posts should be parallel to centre line of the road ordinarily, except 
that at guard-rails or other obstructions, it may be so adjusted that the delineators are in line with 
or inside the innermost edge of the obstruction (see Fig. 5). As far as practicable, the top of the 
posts should be in uniform grade, taking into account the effects of shoulder cross fall and super 
elevation.
3.10	
On straight sections, roadway indicators should be spaced uniformly 50-70 m from 
each other, according to local conditions, the posts being in pairs, one on each side of the 
roadway. On divided roads, these should also be provided on medians to meet the condition of 
providing them on inside of the horizontal curves. Where the normal uniform spacing is affected 
by cross-roads, driveways etc. and a delineator would fall in that area; the same may be moved 
in either direction a distance not exceeding one quarter of the usual spacing. If it still falls in such 
a zone, it should be omitted.
Delineators mounted above or immediately behind Guard Rail. The placement of delineators are not at constant 
distance from roadway edge because of the Bridge Rail
Note:-
	
Delineators should be placed at a constant distance from the carriageway edge expect that when an 
obstruction exists near the pavement edge, the line of delineators should make a smooth transition so as 
to be in line with the obstruction.

3.11	
On horizontal curves, the spacing should be fixed in relation to the curve radius as 
given in Table 1. In addition, some delineators should be continued beyond the curve on either 
side. The spacing of first, second and third roadway indicators on the approaches, in advance 
and beyond the curve, should be 1.8 S, 3 S and 6 S respectively (where S is the normal spacing 
on the curve) but not exceeding 50 m. The method of placement is explained in Fig. 6.

Notes:
1.	
Adjust Distance ‘x’ suitably so that the last roadway delineator 
is at the end of the curve.
2.	
Install all delineators at edge of the roadway perpendicular to 
the oncoming traffic.
3.	
See table for value of ‘S’ i.e. Spacing of delineators on the 
curve.

3.12	
On vertical curves where visibility is not adequate, roadway indicators should be 
provided at a spacing of 30 to 50 m depending on the sharpness of the curve.
3.13	
At problematic locations like causeways, road delineators may be installed at a much 
smaller spacing, say 5 or 10 m, according to local conditions.
4. MEDIAN MARKER
Flexible Median Marker (FMM) should be used for improving median visibility during dark hours. 
Use of Median Marker provides safety against collision happening with medians during night time 
or severe weather. Flexible Median Markers shall be provided with fluorescent yellow colour retro 
reflective sheeting Type XI as per IRC:67. Flexible Median Marker shall be of tough, high impact 
resistant, injection-molded, thermoplastic body with property of flexibility to provide high durability 
and U shape structure having rebound/bounce back property (refer Fig. 7 for typical illustration). 
As mentioned earlier, the sheeting shall be of Type XI conforming to IRC:67 and it should be 
on both the faces whereby providing maximum reflectivity at longer distances with adequate 
durability. The logo of the manufacturer shall be embossed on either side of the body during the 
injection molding process. FMM shall be fixed by a combination of epoxy adhesive and grouting/
drilling on concrete medians or properly constructed solid medians.
A.	
Colour
The marker body shall be produced in neutral Black colour. The colour of the retro reflective 
element shall be Florescent Yellow.
B.	
Material
The plastic body of the FMM shall be moulded from Flexible Thermoplastic Body.
C.	
Dimensions
Height: The marker height shall be a minimum of 180 mm.
Width: The marker width shall be a minimum 120 mm.
Body Thickness: Minimum of 6.5 mm.
Shank Length: Each of the shanks shall not be less than 20 mm and depth shall not be less than 
30 mm.
Reflective Area: Shall not be less than 90 cm square. 
D.	
Performance
Reboundability
The body of FMM shall bounce back to its original position after 750 numbers of hits using 
pendulum of 1.8 kg conforming to ASTM D 256. 
Tensile Test
Adhesion between the body and outer casing body of FMM shall withstand 50 Kgf tensile loads 
conforming to ASTM D 638 method.

Design
5.1	
The following designs shall be adopted for hazard markers:
The striped markers consisting of alternating black and yellow stripes sloping downward at an 
angle of 45° towards the side of the obstruction on which the traffic is to pass (see Fig. 9).

Application and Placement
Object Hazard Markers (OHM) should be put up wherever there are objects on the edge of the 
travelled way which can lead to road crashes. For e.g. bridge abutments, guard rails, etc.
5.2	
These OHM should be erected immediately ahead of the line of obstruction, for 
instance on a narrow bridge just where the bridge rail starts. When placed in conjunction with the 
guard-rail on a bridge approach, the OHM should be located immediately behind the guard-rail 
and at sufficient height to ensure that these will be properly visible to the oncoming traffic. The 
inside edge of the OHM should be in line with the inner edge of the obstruction as far as possible.

Typical application of these markers on a narrow bridge in continuation of a curve is 
shown in Fig. 10.
Fig. 10 Typical Illustration of Object Hazard Markers on Narrow Bridge
6. OBJECT MARKERS
Several designs of object markers are possible including circular shape. For example, such 
Aluminum-backed flexible prismatic reflective sheeting shall be used for application on the beam 
and post of the Metal crash barrier or porous concrete structures like roundabout, at bull noses, 
Traffic Police/Toll Booth Structures, as well as at entry/exit points of the Tunnel structures aimed 
at enhancing nighttime visibility (refer Fig. 11).
6.1	
This Aluminum-backed flexible prismatic sheeting shall be made of yellow colored 
flexible prismatic sheeting with non-metallic prismatic lens formed in a transparent, synthetic 
resin as retro reflective elements. This flexible prismatic sheeting shall have black and yellow 
stripes with aluminum backed flexible prismatic Type VI sheeting conforming to ASTM: D4956 
specifications and standards of coefficient of retro reflectivity, flexibility and impact resistance 
applicable for reboundable devices. This flexible prismatic sheeting shall have screen printed 
arrow/slant line pattern in black colour in a continuous roll format. These object markers may be 
bigger if the conditions so warrant on the ground.

minimal investment. Width of object marker shall be 300 mm and length of object markers might 
vary depending upon the situation but shall be generally minimum around 400 to 500 mm so that 
reflectors are fully visible to the approaching traffic as shown in Fig. 11.
7. INSTALLATION 
7.1	
Techniques of installation can vary according to nature and stiffness of the ground, and 
local custom. A proper foundation with M-25 grade of concrete shall be used for the installation of 
all types of delineators. Installation should ensure that the post does not change its orientation, 
particularly when it is of a circular shape.
7.2	
The delineators should be so positioned that the retro reflectorised face is perpendicular 
to the direction of travel.
8. MAINTENANCE
To remove dirt, the delineator should be periodically scrubbed clean, especially after rains. 
Warranty of reflective sheeting should be in accordance with IRC:67. The ground around the 
delineators should be kept clean by cutting grass and bushes periodically so that visibility of the 
above delineators suggested for installation at any specific location is not affected.
