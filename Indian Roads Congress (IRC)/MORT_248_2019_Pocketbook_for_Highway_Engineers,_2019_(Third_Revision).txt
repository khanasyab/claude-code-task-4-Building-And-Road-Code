FOREWORD
I am happy to present this revised edition of Pocket Book for Highway 
Engineers to the highway profession.  It was initially published in 
December, 1982 and subsequent revisions were made in May, 1985 
and February, 2002.  Since the year 2002, there have been phenomenal 
changes in the standards, materials used, specifications of works, 
technology of construction and maintenance and evaluation of 
performance in highway engineering.   It was, therefore, a long felt 
need for revision of this Pocket Book to capture the latest methodology.
In this edition of Pocket Book a separate and new chapter on Road 
Drainage has been included.  A chapter on pre-construction activity 
which includes methods of land acquisition, shifting of utilities and 
procedure for environmental clearances has also been incorporated. 
Separate chapters of Pavement Design and Maintenance of Pavement 
now include Rigid Pavement also. To make aware of the policies of 
Government of India in highway related matters a new chapter on 
Central Sector Acts/Policies has also been introduced.  The chapter 
on Road Safety now lay emphasis on various traffic control devices 
which can reduce the number of accidents on roads.  
This Pocket Book has been updated with the latest editions of the 
Specifications for Road and Bridge Works of Ministry of Road 
Transport and highways, various related IRC publications and circulars 
of Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.  The Pocket Book 
contains fourteen chapters and gives information and guidelines on all 
aspects of highway engineering.  This Pocket Book is mainly intended 
for National Highway works.  Major aspects of State Highways have 
also been covered.  I hope it will be useful to all the engineers of the 
country dealing with highway works. 
It is quite natural, this publication cannot be expected to cover all the 
subjects and details of highway engineering and as such should not 
be considered as a substitute for the Standards and Specifications as 
well as Codes of Practice.  For guidance relevant IRC Codes and other 



======================================================================
PAGE 5 of 310
======================================================================
publications have been added to the text. The Pocket Book should 
not to be made part of any types of contract document /RFP/tender 
document.  
This Pocket Book was helpful and warmly accepted by the highway 
profession and I hope this edition will also be equally popular and 
helpful to the practicing highway engineers as in the past.
Pocket Book has been published by the Indian Roads Congress, as 
sanctioned under a financial assistance by Ministry of Road Transport 
& Highways.  
Due to rapid changes which are taking place in Highway Engineering, 
the Pocket Book will need to be updated from time-to-time.  To 
achieve this objective, the regular feedback and suggestion from the 
profession for further improvement and to bring in latest technology, 
methodology of construction, materials, etc may be brought to the 
notice of this Ministry.

PREFACE TO THIRD REVISION
The roads, particularly, the highways, are considered to be the lifeline 
of a country.  Efficient road connectivity is an essential component not 
only for socio-economic growth of the region (s)/country but also helps 
in achieving balanced growth & inclusive growth.  The construction of 
quality roads requires concerted actions on many fronts. The Pocket Book 
should be based on the latest codes, guidelines, practices, specifications 
and policies. This document will facilitate highway professionals as ready 
reckoner.
On the request of Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, the Indian 
Roads Congress under took the task of revision of Pocket Book for 
Highway Engineers. For this purpose, IRC constituted a Working Group 
comprising of Shri S.B. Basu, Chief Engineer (Retd.), MoRTH and 
Shri S.K. Nirmal, Secretary General, IRC.
The Working Group prepared the draft revision of Pocket Book, taking 
due guidance from the latest version of IRC Codes/ Manuals/Guidelines/
Specifications, MoRTH Policy Circulars and relevant BIS Standards.
Valuable suggestions  received from Shri B.N. Singh, DG (RD) & 
SS, MoRTH; Shri I.K. Pandey, Addl. Director General, MoRTH; 
Shri Sanjeev Kumar, Chief Engineer [S&R(P&B) & Road Safety], 
MoRTH; Shri Varun Aggarwal, Superintending Engineer [S&R (P&B) 
& Road Safety], MoRTH; Shri Santosh Arya, Executive Engineer [S&R 
(P&B) & Road Safety], MoRTH were duly considered by the working 
group while revising the Pocket Book.
Shri Rahul Patil, Deputy Director (Tech.), IRC and Shri Sandeep Negi 
provided the necessary Technical /Secretarial support.
For revision of the Pocket Book, every effort has been made to bring out 
the best current practice (s). I am sure this Pocket Book in its present form 
would prove to be very useful to all practicing highway engineers. The 
Pocket Book, however, needs to be updated periodically with changes in 
technology and environment. The MoRTH/IRC would therefore welcome 
the feedback/suggestions from users for further updation.

CHAPTER 1
GENERAL INFORMATION
1.1 
Land, Terrain and Classification
India lies entirely in the northern hemisphere. The main land extends 
between latitudes of 804’N and 3706’N, longitudes 6807’East and 
97025’ East and measures about 3,214 km from north to south between 
extreme latitudes and 2,933 km from east to west between the extreme 
longitudes. It has a land frontier of 15,200 km. The total length of 
coast line of the mainland, Lakshadweep Island is 7,516.6 km. The 
country has total land area of 3.3 million sq.km. India’s population as 
on March, 2011 stood at 1.21 billion. India has 29 States and 7 Union 
territories. Indian Standard Time is GMT + 5.30 hrs. The mainland 
comprises of four regions namely, the great mountain zone, plains of 
the Ganga and the Indus, the desert region and the southern peninsula. 
The climate of the country can broadly be classified as a tropical 
monsoon one. But inspite of much of the northern part of India lying 
beyond the tropical zone, the entire country has a tropical climate 
marked by relatively high temperatures and dry winters. There are 
four seasons, namely winter, summer, south west monsoons and post 
monsoon seasons.
1.2 
Road Classification
As per constitution of India, Union Government through the Ministry of 
Road Transport & Highways (MORTH) is responsible for development 
and maintenance of National Highways. State governments and Union 
Territories are responsible for the same, for roads other than National 
Highways in their respective jurisdiction. 
1.2.1 Non-urban Roads: 
Non-urban roads in the country are classified into following five 
categories:



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
2
	
1)	
National Highways: These are main highways running 
through the length and breadth of the country connecting 
major ports, highways of neighbouring countries, State 
capitals, large industrial and tourist centres, etc The 
total length of National Highways is 1,32,500 km. 
	
2)	
State Highways: These are arterial routes of a state 
linking district headquarters and important cities within 
the state and connecting them with National Highways 
of the neighbouring States. The total length of State 
Highways is 1,56,694 km.
	
3)	
Major District Roads: These are important roads 
within a district serving areas of production and markets, 
and connecting these with each other or with the main 
highways.
	
4)	
Other District Roads: These are roads serving rural 
areas of production and providing them with outlet 
to market centres, taluka/tehsil headquarters, block 
development headquarters or other main roads.
	
5)	
Village Roads: These are roads connecting villages or 
group of villages with each other and to the nearest road 
of a higher category.
	
	
Other District Roads and Village Roads have been 
combined and known as Rural Roads.
	
	
The total length of Major District Roads and Rural 
Roads is 53,12,117 km. 
1.2.2. Urban Roads: 
	
Urban roads are classified into the following four categories:
	
1) 	
Arterial Streets: This system of streets, along with 
expressways where they exist, serves as the principal 
network for through traffic flows. Significant intra-
urban travel, such as, between central business district 



======================================================================
PAGE 18 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
3
and outlying residential areas or between major 
suburban centers take place on this system. These 
streets may generally be spaced at less than 1.5 km in 
highly developed central business areas and at 8 km or 
more in sparsely developed urban fringes. The arterial 
streets are generally divided highways with full or 
partial access. Parking, loading and unloading activities 
are usually restricted and regulated. Pedestrians are 
allowed to cross only at intersections. 
	
2)	
Sub-arterial Streets: These are functionally similar to 
arterial streets but with somewhat lower level of travel 
mobility. Their spacing may vary from about 0.5 km in 
the central business district to 3-5 km in the sub-urban 
fringes. 
	
3)	
Collector Streets: The function of collector streets is 
to collect traffic from local streets and feed it to the 
arterial and sub-arterial streets or vice versa. These may 
be located in residential neighborhoods, business areas 
and industrial areas. Normally, full access is allowed 
on these streets from abutting properties. There are few 
parking restrictions except during the peak hours.
	
4)	
Local Streets: These are intended primarily to provide 
access to abutting property and normally do not carry 
large volumes of traffic. Majority of trips in urban areas 
originate from or terminate on these streets. Local streets 
may be residential, commercial or industrial, depending 
on the predominant use of the adjoining land. They 
allow unrestricted parking and pedestrian movements. 
	
5)	
Non-Motorized Transport (NMT) Streets and 
Greenways: All motorized traffic will be prohibited, 
using barrier and enforcement of regulations to prevent 
their entry and encroachment of NMT space. Such 
streets will be designed in compliance with universal 
accessibility guidelines with bicycle parking and access 
for emergency response vehicles.

1.3 
There are following types of roads according to the cross-
section of the roads.
	
1)	
Expressways – These are arterial highways for 
motorized traffic, with divided carriageways for high 
speed travel, with full control of access and provided 
with grade separators at locations of intersection and for 
high mobility. Generally, only fast moving vehicles are 
allowed access on expressways. 
	
2)	
4 Lane/6 Lane/8 Lane roads – These roads have 
divided carriageway and also partially controlled for 
access. Each carriageway are of either two lane or three 
or more lane standard.
	
3)	
Two lane roads with or without shoulders - These road 
have 7 m wide carriageway and the shoulders on both 
sides. Part of the shoulders may be paved or unpaved. 
MORTH has taken a policy decision that all National 
Highways, except on hill roads will be improved to 
a minimum standards of two lane carriageway with 
paved shoulders on both sides irrespective of the traffic 
intensity on the road.
	
4)	
Intermediate lane roads: The intermediate carriageway 
width of 5.5 m is adopted in exceptional circumstances 
particularly in hill sections. It has been decided to 
adopt 5.5 m carriageway in hilly stretches of National 
Highways carrying traffic less then 8000 pcu. 
	
5)	
Single lane road – These are roads with single lane 
carriageway of 3.75 m width. These are provided for 
roads having low density of traffic.
1.4	
MORTH implements National Highway Projects through 
the agencies of State Governments, National Highways Authority 
of India (NHAI), National Highways Infrastructure Development

Corporation Ltd. and Border Roads Organization (BRO). MORTH 
has also established Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in some states 
for execution of such project. The National Highways are entrusted to 
NHAI, BRO, State Government and NHIDCL for their development 
and maintenance. 
NHAI	executes high valued projects. NHIDCL has been entrusted 
with development of National Highways in hilly states and North 
Eastern Region of the Country. BRO is developing and maintaining 
National Highways in border area of the country. National Highways 
within the State except those entrusted to NHAI, NHIDCL and BRO 
are entrusted to the State Government concerned.
1.5 
Modes of Implementation of Highway Projects
Based on the availability of funds, the projects are implemented either 
from the funds of the Project Authority (Public funded projects) or 
through the participation of private sectors (Public Private Partnership). 
For public funded projects, projects may be executed either by 
conventional “Item Rate Contract” or through the Engineering, 
Procurement and Construction (EPC) contracts. In item rate contracts, 
the responsibilities for design lie with the project authority whereas in 
the EPC contracts the design and development are the responsibilities 
of the contractors. There are three variants of PPP Projects namely 
BOT (Toll), BOT (Annuity) and Hybrid Annuity depending on the 
mode of financing. Present policy of Ministry is that procurement of 
item rate contracts is to be done only for works upto Rs. 5.00 crore.
1.6 
Toll Plaza
As per amendments of the National Highways Act, 1956 the Central 
Government is empowered to levy fees for service benefits rendered 
in relation to use of ferry, bridges, tunnels and sections of National 
Highways. The fees when levied shall be collected in accordance 
with the rules made under this Act. The rules made are to be notified 
in official Gazette. The MORTH has also prescribed fees for such 



======================================================================

======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
6
services by notifying the fee Rules in official gazette from time to 
time. As per notifications of September, 2018 MORTH is empowered 
to collect additional fees for overloaded vehicle. 
As per present policy, two lanes in each direction of travel shall 
be provided with the system of payment through Electronic Toll 
Collection (ETC) out of which one lane shall be dedicated for ETC 
exclusively and the second lane shall be stand by ETC lane, stand by 
ETC lane may be converted to dedicated ETC lane in case of failure / 
maintenance of first ETC lane.
Legally, there are provisions which enable to collect user’s fee (toll) 
in perpetuity from the vehicles plying on National Highways. Tolls 
are also source of financing for the projects implemented through PPP 
mode. Many State governments are also collecting tolls on the roads 
under the jurisdiction of the State Government. Tolls are collected at 
Toll Plaza which are constructed at convenient locations outside the 
influence of local traffic.

CHAPTER 2
Project Preparation 
2.1	
Preparation of highway projects involves a chain of activities, 
such as, field surveys and investigations, selection of alignment, 
carrying out various designs, preparation of drawings and estimates, 
etc. To be compatible with technical requirement, consistent with 
economy, it is essential that every project should be prepared after 
thorough investigations and collecting all relevant information and 
evaluating all possible alternatives. Detailed procedures of preparation 
of road projects including survey and investigation are detailed in 
IRC:SP:19 “Manual for Survey, Investigation and Preparation of Road 
Projects”. The fundamental principle of route selection and alignment 
improvement is to achieve the least cost on transportation covering 
initial cost of construction, its maintenance and road user cost. 
2.1.1	 Broadly following stages are involved in preparation and 
sanction of project
	
1.	
Pre-feasibility study
	
2.	
Feasibility study/preliminary project report preparation 
including cost estimation

The details of various surveys, proforma for presenting the result and 
typical drawings are given in IRC:SP:19.
2.2 
Traffic surveys and analysis
2.2.1	 Information about traffic would form basis for fixing the 
number of traffic lanes, design of pavement, design of intersections 
and interchanges and economic appraisal of the project.
2.2.2	 Following traffic surveys are required to be conducted in 
connection with the preparation of highway project:
	
(a)	
Classified traffic volume counts
	
(b)	
Origin – Destination Surveys
	
(c)	
Speed and Delay Studies
	
(d)	
Traffic Surveys for the design of Intersections and 
Interchanges
	
(e)	
Traffic Surveys for replacing railway level crossings 
with grade separators
	
(f)	
Axle Load Surveys
	
(g)	
Accident Records
	
(h)	
Pedestrian/animal cross traffic surveys
2.2.3 Classified Traffic Volume Count Surveys
The classified traffic volume count surveys shall be carried out for 
continuous 7 days (24 x 7) for both the directions. The count stations 
should be selected such that the result represents the traffic flow in 
homogeneous section of the highway. Guidance may be taken from 
IRC:9 “Traffic Census on Non-Urban Roads.” Traffic survey done 
by Indian Highway Management Company Limited (IHMCL) on 
National Highways using ATCC (Automatic Traffic Counter and 
Classifier) may be used. This survey is to be carried out using ATCC

system or equivalent technologies for major project on important 
highways. A seven day count will give Average Daily Traffic (ADT)
which can be converted to Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) 
applying seasonal correction and using conversion factors from any 
traffic count in the region.
2.2.4 Origin – Destination Surveys
When a new road is being planned or extensive improvements are to be 
carried out to an existing road or a bypass is under consideration, origin-
destination survey is to be conducted. The points at which the data is to 
be collected should be carefully chosen on the road network such that 
it should be possible to derive the volume of traffic likely to use the 
facility under consideration. The survey should normally be conducted 
for three consecutive days on sample basis. For exceptional cases, in 
heavy density corridors and where the daily variation of traffic is not 
much, at least one day’s survey may be conducted on a normal working 
day. IRC:102 “Traffic Studies for Planning Bypasses Around Towns” 
gives guidance in this regard. The commodity movement data should 
also be collected during the survey.
2.2.5 Speed and Delay Studies
Speed and delay studies on the existing facility provide the basis for 
estimating causative problems and benefits of the improved facility. 
The study is conveniently conducted by the ‘Moving Observer 
Method’. By this method a task vehicle is run along with a traffic 
stream, at approximately the perceptible average speed of the traffic 
stream. A separate run is needed for each direction.  The average of 
around six runs ensures accuracy of results. By noting down the travel 
time, including actual running time and stopped delays, the vehicles 
counted in the opposite direction and those overtaken/overtaking, 
it is possible to calculate the volume, speed and delay. For further 
information IRC:102 may be consulted.

2.2.6 Traffic Survey for Design of Intersections and Interchanges
For design of Intersection and Interchanges, turning movement 
surveys are to be carried out. For this purpose, it would be sufficient to 
have counts for 2 hours each in the morning and evening peak periods 
unless there exist extended peak hours. The methodology used in 
IRC:SP:41 “Guidelines on Design of At-grade Intersection in Rural 
and Urban Area” needs to be used.
2.2.7 Traffic Surveys for replacing Railway Level Crossing with 
Grade Separated Structures
It has been decided that all the railway level crossing on National 
Highways will be replaced by grade separated structures. For many 
projects particularly on State Highway, the decision regarding 
replacement of railway level crossings with grade separators is taken 
on the basis of product of gate closure and fast traffic per day. For this 
purpose, traffic counts should be taken in a week spread over three 
consecutive days and 24 hours each day if such information is not 
already available. The number and duration of gate closures should 
be ascertained from Railway authorities and also counted at site while 
conducting 24 hours survey. Information should also be obtained on 
the angle of crossings of the road way and the railway. If there is a 
requirement of improvement of geometrics of the approach roads, an 
index plan including the existing alignment is to be obtained.
2.2.8 Axle Load Survey
Axle load survey is needed to generate data for pavement design. This 
survey shall be carried out along with the classified volume count 
survey. Number of days of survey may vary between 24 hours and 3 
days. For important NH projects the survey may be carried out for 2 
normal days (24 hours). Axle load surveys in both direction shall be 
carried out on a random sample basis normally for truck only both 
empty and loaded trucks. However, a few buses may be weighed. 
Axle load survey shall normally be done using axle load pads or

other sophisticated instruments. IRC:SP:19 contains the proforma for 
collecting data.
2.2.9 Pedestrian/Animal Cross Traffic Survey
For heavily trafficked section, this survey is required to determine the 
necessity of viaduct for safe pedestrian/animal crossings.
2.2.10 Accident Records
Accident records data base to be obtained for improvement of black 
spot on the road.
2.2.11 Traffic Projection
Traffic growth should be assessed in the first instance on the basis 
of observed traffic and other economic indicators.  The technique 
has also been given in IRC:SP:19. IRC:108 “Guidelines for Traffic 
Prediction on Rural Highways” may also be referred. In addition, 
diverted traffic and generated traffic are also to be considered. The 
period of projection depends on the type of the project, importance of 
the road, availability of finances and other relied factors. For major 
trunk routes, the desirable and minimum forecast periods are15/20/30 
years and 10 years in case of stage construction respectively. 
2.3	
RECONNAISSANCE SURVEY  
2.3.1	 The main objective of reconnaissance survey is to examine 
general character of the area for the purpose of determining the most 
feasible routes or route for further detailed investigations. This can be 
accomplished by:
	
a)	
Study of digital maps, topographical survey sheets, 
agricultural, soil, geological and meteorological maps 
and aerial photographs.
	
b)	
Where necessary and feasible, aerial reconnaissance 
	
c)	
Ground reconnaissance



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
13
2.3.2	 Study of Survey of India (SOI) maps is useful. The topo sheets 
are available in the scale of 1:25,000, 1:50,000 and 1:250,000.
2.3.3	 In addition to these, special purpose maps like Forest Survey 
of India maps, vegetation maps, National Bureau of Soil Survey and 
Land Use Planning (NBSS & LuP) maps, Geological Survey of India 
maps, wherever available may also be consulted for other details 
which will be helpful in selection of alignment.
2.3.4	 Satellite remote sensing, small format aerial photography, 
photogrammetry, aerial photography are also useful in difficult 
terrain. Aerial reconnaissance will help to take final decision about the 
alignment to be studied in detail. 
2.3.5	 Based on the information collected during the reconnaissance 
survey, a report should be prepared. The report should include all 
relevant information collected during the survey, a plan to the scale 
of 1:50,000 or larger as available showing the alternative alignments 
studied alongwith their general profile and rough cost estimates. It 
should discuss the merits and demerits of the different alternatives to 
help the selection of one or more alignments for detailed survey and 
investigation. 
2.4	
PRELIMINARY SURVEY
2.4.1	 The preliminary survey is a large scale instrument survey 
conducted for the purpose of collecting all the physical information 
which affects the proposed location of a new highway or improvements 
to an existing highway. During this phase of the survey, topographic 
features and other features, which affect highway locations like 
house, kiosk, monuments and place of worships, cremation or burial 
grounds, utility and railway lines, stream, river, canal, cross drainage 
structures are collected. In addition general information like traffic, 
soil, construction materials, drainages etc. are also collected. All these 
details are collected for preparation of an accurate base plan showing 
all these features.  Plans and longitudinal section drawing are referred 
to for detailed study to determine the centre line of the road. 



======================================================================
PAGE 29 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
14
2.4.2	 For land based survey, Mobile LiDAR (Light Detection and 
Ranging) or equivalent technology are to be used for important 
projects. Aerial mobile LiDAR or equivalent technology are to be 
used for such projects. This is for meeting the requirement of high 
accuracy in surveys. In areas, where LiDAR or equivalent technology 
cannot survey accurately, traditional methods of Total Station/Auto 
level shall be used to complete the study. 
2.4.3	 Scales for drawings of Plans and Longitudinal sections are 
adopted as per follows:
Table 2.1  Scales for Drawings
Horizontal Scale
Vertical Scale
Built up areas and hilly terrain
1:1,000
1:100
Plain and rolling terrain
1:2,500
1:250
The plan should also show contours at 1-3 m interval particularly for 
roads.
2.5 
Environmental Impact Study and Resettlement and 
Rehabilitation Action Plan 
2.5.1 The Environmental Impact Assessment (Eia)
2.5.1.1	The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has become an 
integral part of highway project preparation work. EIA study is taken 
up concurrently with the project of feasibility report or the detailed 
project report. The main purpose of EIA is to identify the environmental 
impact of the project proposal and its different alternatives, weigh their 
significance and severance, propose possible mitigating measures 
and provide necessary information for taking decision regarding the 
overall acceptability of the project from environmental angle.
2.5.1.2	Environmental impact assessment for the projects funded 
by Government of India or the state government concerned is to be 
carried out as per latest guidelines of the Ministry of Environment and 



======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
15
Forest and Climatic Change (MoEFCC). In this regard, IRC:SP:93 
“Guidelines on Requirements for Environmental Clearances for Road 
Projects” may be referred. In respect of highway project, environment 
clearances are required for green field projects of both National 
Highways and State Highways, expansion of National Highway 
greater than 100 km length involving additional right of way or land 
acquisition greater than 40 m on existing alignment and 60 m on 
realignments or by passes, State Highway expansion projects in hilly 
terrain (above 1000 m AMSL) and/or ecologically sensitive areas. 
Environmental clearances for other projects are not required. It is 
desirable to consult the website of MOEFCC for their latest guidelines 
on this subject. For projects funded by external agencies like ADB, 
World Bank, etc., the environmental impact assessment is to be 
carried out as per the guidelines of the funding agencies concerned as 
amended from time to time. 
2.5.2 Environment Management Plan (EMP)
2.5.2.1	An Environment Management Plan (EMP) is required to 
be prepared and implemented in compliance with the statutory 
environment clearance of a highway project. The clearances are 
accorded on the basis of submission of EIA by the Project Authority. 
Promises made by the project authorities while submitting the EIA and 
the conditions attached by the MOEFCC while according the clearance 
form the basis for preparation of an EMP, which is implemented 
during the project execution or operation by the contracting agencies 
and monitored by the project authorities. 
2.5.2.2	The EMP is an extremely important document containing 
specific measures and proposals aimed at prevailing or mitigating 
the adverse impact on the environment to ensure its implementation. 
EMP has to be a part of contract document. The detailed method of 
preparation of EMP and its implementation are given in IRC:SP:108 
“Guidelines on Preparation and Implementation of Environment 
Management Plan”.

2.5.3 Resettlement and Rehabilitation Action Plan (RAP)
2.5.3.1	Whenever project will entail acquisition of land, structures 
and other assets and cause displacement or loss of assets within 
the right of way, a socio-economic base line study and preparation 
of a Resettlement and Rehabilitation Action Plan (RAP) should be 
undertaken as a part of the project. Since acquisition of land and other 
assets may be unavoidable and an integral part of the project design 
and implementation, undertaking a social impact assessment and 
preparing RAP is also to be included as a part of project design from the 
start and undertaken in close coordination with environment analysis 
and environmental action plan. The Right to Fair Compensation and 
Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement 
Act, 2013 are to be followed for rehabilitation measures. For projects 
funded by external agencies like ADB, World Bank guidelines of the 
agencies concerned in this regard are to be followed.
2.6 
Feasibility Report 
2.6.1	 A feasibility report is prepared after the preliminary survey is 
completed. This report is intended to serve as the basis for according 
Administrative Approval (AA) for the project by the Project Authority 
concerned. The Feasibility Report must establish the economic 
viability and technical soundness of the alternative selected. Thus it 
must be preceded by engineering surveys and investigation of sufficient 
accuracy and details as to results in a fairly firm estimation of the cost 
of the project. It must be based on accurate traffic projections and must 
contain an economic analysis. 
Feasibility Report also includes the economic analysis based on 
current costs. This may be carried out as per IRC:SP:30 “Manual on 
Economic Analysis of Highway Projects in India” or using HDM IV 
after suitable calibration for Indian condition. A sensitive analysis is 
also to be carried out for different scenarios of benefits and costs. 
In case of project being implemented through Public Private 
Partnership, the financial analysis with different scenario must be 
presented. 



======================================================================
PAGE 32 of 310
======================================================================

17
2.6.2	 The feasibility report must be accompanied by the drawings 
like locality map, plan, typical cross section showing pavement details, 
cross drainage and other structures, intersection drawings, strip plan, 
preliminary LA plans. A check list for a highway Project Feasibility 
Report is given at Appendix 2.2.	
2.7 
Selection of optimum alignment in the design office 
2.7.1	 Making use of the maps from preliminary survey showing the 
longitudinal profile, cross sections and contours, a few alternative 
alignments for the final centre line of the road are drawn and studied 
and the best one satisfying the engineering, aesthetic and economic 
requirements is selected. The alignment determined in the design 
office shall be checked in the field, especially when data base is not 
adequately updated. 
2.8 
Final Location Survey
2.8.1	 The purpose of the final location survey is to lay out the centerline 
of the road in the field based on the alignment selected in the design office 
and to collect necessary data for preparation of the working drawings. 
Taking of longitudinal section along the selected centre line and cross 
sections are also part of the final location survey. The accuracy of the 
survey should be first checked by senior professionals. This will also 
generate precise land acquisition requirements. The two main operations 
involved in the survey are the staking out of the final centre line of the 
road by means of a continuous survey and detailed leveling. The centre 
line of the road as determined in the design office is translated on the 
ground by means of continuous transit survey and staking out of the 
centre line as proceeds. All the Horizontal Intersection Point (HIP) and 
intermediate Points of Transit (POT) on long tangents should be fixed on 
hubs on new roads and by means of spikes or nails into the pavement of 
existing roads. Bench marks are also to be established at 2 km interval 
for vertical control for location, design and construction, Temporary 
bench marks at an interval of 250 meters are also to be established



======================================================================

50 – 75	
-	
For rolling terrain
	
50	
-	
For built up areas
	
20	
-	
For hilly terrain
2.8.3	 All the points  referencing the centre line and bench marks 
should be protected and preserved and are to be so fixed at site that 
there is little possibility of their being disturbed or removed till the 
construction is completed.  The final location survey is considered 
complete when all the necessary information is available and ready 
for the designer to be able to plot the final road profile and prepare the 
project drawings. 
2.9 
Soil and Material Survey
2.9.1	 Soil and other material survey are required to determine the 
nature and physical characteristics of soil and soil profile for design of 
embankment and pavement, classification of earth work, subsoil water 
level and flooding service, sources and suiatibility of aggregates and 
lead of aggregates and manufactured items.

To design pavement both flexible and rigid pavement. 
2.9.2	 Investigations for soil and other materials required for 
construction are carried out in respect of the likely sources and the 
availability and suitability of materials. Some other investigations, for 
instance in respect of landslide prone locations may also be conducted 
at this stage.
2.9.3	 The soil and materials location surveys should include study 
of all available information such as geological maps, data published 
by the various authorities regarding location of construction materials 
and the information available with ground water authorities regarding 
depth of water table. This information should be perused in conjunction 
with general information gathered during the preliminary survey. 
2.9.4	 The guidelines and directions contained in various codes and 
guidelines relevant to the subject of study are to be followed for 
collection of samples, testings to be done and reporting test results. All 
the required tests as prescribed in the relevant guidelines and codes 
are to be conducted as per IS codes as applicable to the tests to be 
conducted. The test methods as prescribed in the relevant IRC codes

ROAD INVENTORY AND CONDITION SURVEY
2.10.1	 For highway projects involving improvement to an existing 
road it is necessary to prepare a road inventory and carry out condition 
survey to assess the existing condition of the road and structures. 
The details to be collected and the format for presentation of data are 
available in IRC:SP:19. Details available with the project authorities 
in this regard are to be made use of. The inventory data should be 
stored in computer files using simple utility packages, such as Excel.
2.11 
DRAINAGE STUDIES
2.11.1	 Adequate information about drainage pattern is necessary 
to devise an effective drainage system. Drainage studies have the 
following principal objectives:
	
(i)	
Fixing the grade line of the road
	
(ii)	
Design of pavement, and
	
(iii)	
Design of the surface/sub-surface drainage system
2.11.2	 Main components of the drainage investigations are 
determination of HFL and ponded water level, depth of water table, 
range of tidal levels and amount of surface runoff. Besides this, for cut 
sections in rolling and hilly areas, it would be necessary to carry out 
special investigations for sub-terrane flows and seepage of irrigation 
water from fields situated above the road.
2.12 
STUDY OF CROSS DRAINAGE STRUCTURES 
2.12.1	 For cross drainage structure i.e. culverts, surveys and

CHAPTER 3
PRECONSTRUCTON ACTIVITIES
3.1 
Land Acquisition
3.1.1 National Highways 
Land required for development, maintenance and operation of 
National Highways are acquired as per the National Highways Act, 
1956 (NH Act),
3.1.2	 Section 3 of NH Act pertains to the acquisition of land. This Act 
provides for a “competent authority’ who is authorized by the Central 
Government by notification in the official gazette to perform the 
functions of the competent authority for such area as may be specified 
in the notification. Steps as described below are to be followed for 
acquisition of land for works on National Highways.
	
a)	
Section 3A – The intention of acquisition of land 
for National Highway works are to be declared by 
a notification in the official gazette. The competent 
authority shall cause the substance of the notification to 
be published in two local newspapers one of which will 
be in vernacular language.
	
b)	
Section 3B – Any person authorized by the Central 
Government, after the issue of the notification as per 
Section 3A, can make any inspection, survey including 
taking levels, dig or bore into subsoil, set out boundaries 
and intended lines of works etc.
	
c)	
Section 3C – This section empowers any person 
interested in the land may within twenty one days from 
the date of publication of the notification as per Section 
3A may object for the use of land. This objection has to 
be in writing with the grounds thereof and to be made to 
the competent authority. The competent authority gives 



======================================================================
PAGE 48 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
33
an opportunity to the objector of being heard either in 
person or by a legal practitioner and either allows or 
disallows the objections after hearing all such objections 
and after making such enquiry as may be necessary.
	
d)	
Section 3D- If there is no objection to the land notified 
under section 3A or where objections have been 
disallowed, the competent authority shall submit a report 
to the Central Government and Central Government 
shall as soon as may declare by notification in the 
official gazette that the land should be acquired for 
the purpose of National Highways. On publication of 
this notification, the land vest absolutely in the Central 
Government free from all encumbrances. In respect to 
any land if no declaration under Section 3D is made 
with a period of one year from the date of publication 
of notification issued under Section 3A, then this 
notification shall cease to have any effect. 
	
e)	
Section 3E – After issue of notification as per Section 
3D and depositing the amount for compensation with 
the competent authority, the competent authority 
may direct the owner or any other person who may 
be possession of such land to surrender or deliver the 
land to the competent authority or any other person as 
authorized by him within sixty days of the service of 
notice. The Competent authority shall apply either to 
the Commissioner of Police or the District Collector as 
the case may be if any one fails to comply to surrender 
the land and the Commissioner of Police or District 
Collector shall enforce such order.
	
f)	
Section 3F – Under this section, any person authorized 
by the Central Government can legally enter and carry 
out for any work pertaining to National Highway when 
the land is vested under Section 3D.



======================================================================
PAGE 49 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
34
	
g)	
Section 3G – This section is for determination of the 
amount payable as compensation for acquisition of 
any land under this Act. As per policy it has now been 
decided that the determination of compensation amount 
and rehabilitation and resettlement of project affected 
people shall be as per “The Right to Fair Compensation 
and Transparency in Land Acquisition Rehabilitation 
and Resettlement Act, 2013”. (RFCTLARR Act, 2013)
	
h)	
Section 3H – The amount determined under Section 
3G shall be deposited by the Central Government with 
the competent authority before taking possession of the 
land. 
3.1.2.1	MORTH has brought out “A Manual of Guidelines on Land 
Acquisition for National Highways under the NH Act, 1956” in 
December, 2018. This Manual is compilation of Ministry’s circulars 
on this subject, guidelines on the process of acquisition of land and 
other relevant details.
3.1.2.2		 MORTH has also taken e-initiative to track land acquisition 
process. This is a web based portal named as ‘BhoomiRashi’. The 
objective of the portal is to develop a Land Acquisition (LA) system 
which would provide linkage across authorities, eliminate the need 
of physical copy, reduce formatting errors/clerical mistakes and easy 
tracking of the draft notification. The ‘BhoomiRashi’ portal comprises 
details of 724 districts, 6494 sub districts (tahsil/taluka) and 6,57,424 
villages of the country.
3.1.2.3	MORTH as issued a circular No. NH-15017/21/2018-P&M 
dated 10th May, 2018 brining out the policy guidelines for land 
acquisition, tree felling and utility shifting across the alignment. It has 
been decided that the project implementation agencies shall undertake 
additional land acquisition on one side of an existing road to the extent 
feasible for expansion of existing roads to next  level of configurations. 
The acquisition side shall be decided based on the intensity of the 



======================================================================
PAGE 50 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
35
existing utilities and trees (following overall cost savings principle) 
and such side may change form on stretch to another stretch depending 
upon the most optimal alignment. In addition, other guidelines have 
also been given to minimize the requirement of additional land 
acquisition, optimization of utility shifting and felling of trees.
3.1.3. State Highways
The land required for development, maintenance and operation of 
State Highways are to be acquired following the procedure as per “The 
Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition 
and Resettlement Act, 2013”. The compensation for acquisition of 
land and rehabilitation, resettlement of the affected persons are also 
to be done as per this Act, The details of this Act, are available at the 
website of www.legislative.gov.in
3.2 
Environmental Clearances
3.2.1.	 Environmental and social legal framework	
The Constitution of India directs the State to endeavor to protect and 
improve the national environment and to safeguard the forests and 
wildlife of the country. Article 51 (g) of the Constitution states that it 
shall be the duty of every citizen of India to protect and improve the 
national environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife and 
to have compassion for living creatures. In order to achieve above 
objectives the Government of India has created a legal framework 
for highway projects and are to be followed strictly. The details are 
available IRC:SP:-93 “Guidelines on Requirements for Environmental 
Clearances for Road Projects”.
3.2.2 Clearance Requirements for Road Projects
3.2.2.1 Clearance Requirements of Project Authorities
 
	
Environmental Clearance (EC) is required for only certain 
categories of National Highway and State Highway 
projects, as explained in the subsequent section, under 
EIA notification, 2006.



======================================================================
PAGE 51 of 310

“Consent to Establish” a project is required under the 
Air Act and Water Act.
 
 
“Consent to Operate” a Plant or Machinery is required 
under the Air Act and Water Act.
 
 
Clearance from the Coastal Zone Management 
Authorities (CZMA) of the concerned State is required 
for projects located in earmarked coastal areas, under 
the CRZ notification.
 
 
Forest clearance is required for all such projects where 
a forest area is to be diverted for the project, under the 
Forest Conservation Act, irrespective of the type of 
forest or area of forest under diversion. 
	
	
If a roadside plantation on the Right of Way (ROW) of 
the road is notified as a Protected Forest, use of any area 
under such plantation for road widening is construed as 
Diversion of Forest Land, and Forest Clearance (FC) is 
required for the project.
 
 
Wildlife clearance is required for all such projects 
where the project is located in a Protected Area (PA), 
which is a collective term for National Parks, Wildlife 
Sanctuaries, etc.
 
 
Clearance from the Inland Waterways Authority 
is required in case the project alignment crosses a 
navigational channel.
 
 
NOC from Central Ground Water Board is required for 
drawing ground water in notified blocks.
 


and extraction of minor minerals.
3.2.2.3 Procedure for obtaining Environmental Clearance
	
a)	
The process of obtaining environmental clearance for 
road projects has been described in EIA notification 
2006, as amended from time to time. As per the 
present policy, environmental clearance is required 
for all green field projects i.e. expressways and new 
alignments, widening of national highway more than 
100 Km length involving additional land acquisition 
greater than 40 m on existing alignment and 60 m on 
realignment or by passes and State Highway widening 
projects in hilly terrain (Above 1000 m AMSL) and/or 
ecologically sensitive areas. Environmental clearance is 
not required in the following cases of existing highways 
and expressways.
	
	
1.	
Road development projects other than State 
Highways and National Highways.
	
	
2.	
State Highway widening project located below an 
altitude of 1000 m AMSL



======================================================================
PAGE 53 of 310
======================================================================

38
	
	
3.	
State Highway widening projects not located in an 
ecologically sensitive area
	
	
4.	
National Highway widening upto 100 km length
	
	
5.	
National Highway widening project of more than 
100 km length involving land acquisition upto 40 
m (at any place) on existing alignment and 60 m 
(at any place) on re-alignment or bypasses.
	
b)	
The Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate 
changes (MOEFCC) has developed a single web portal 
for submission of proposals for Environment Forest and 
Wild Life Clearances. The portal is known as “Online 
Submission & Monitoring of Environment Forest and 
Wild Life Clearances (OSMEFWC). The portal is 
accessible at URL- http://efclearance.nic.in.
	
	
The project authorities need to register on the portal. 
After successful registration, the application for 
seeking Terms of Reference (TOR) for conducting the 
Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) for the project 
for seeking Environment Clearance (EC) may be 
uploaded on line. The stepwise process for uploading 
the applications is provided on the portal. Alongwith 
the online submissions, the project authorities are also 
required to submit hard copies of the application and 
other documents. 
	
c)	
The environment clearance procedure can be divided 
into four stages
	
	
	
Screening (only for State Highway Projects)
	
	
	
Scoping – Scoping refers to the process of 
finalization of the Term of Reference (TOR) for 



======================================================================
PAGE 54 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
39
the EIA study, so that the outcome of EIA and 
resultant Environment Management Plan (EMP) is 
precise and relevant to the environmental settings 
of a particular project.
	
	
	
Public Consultation – Public consultation refers to 
the process by which the concerns of local affected 
persons and others who have plausible stakes in the 
environment impacts of the project or activity are 
ascertained with a view taking into account all the 
material concerns in the project or activity design 
as appropriate public consultation is not required 
for widening projects not involving acquisition of 
land and projects in border states. 
	
	
	
Appraisal – Appraisal refers to the detailed scrutiny 
by the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) of the 
application, final EIA report and public hearing 
proceeding for grant of environmental clearance. 
On conclusion of the proceedings, the EAC makes 
categorical recommendation to the regulatory 
authority concerned either for grant of prior 
environmental clearance on stipulated terms and 
conditions, or rejection of the application together 
with reasons for the same. The appraisal by EAC 
is completed within six days of the receipt of 
the final EIA and other documents. The EAC’s 
recommendations are placed within next fifteen 
days before the competent authority for a final 
decision.
	
	
	
The regulatory authority conveys its decision 
to the applicant within forty five days of the 
receipt of the recommendation of EAC. The 
disagreement, if any, alongwith the reasons with 



======================================================================
PAGE 55 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
40
the recommendation of EAC is also to be sent to 
the EAC for reconsideration. The EAC’s response 
on this issues is made within next sixty days. 
Within next thirty days the views of the authority 
which is final is conveyed to the applicant.
	
	
	
Validity of Environment Clearance is for five 
years for highway projects. It can be extended 
to maximum period of seven years provided an 
application is made to the regulatory authority by 
the applicant. 
	
	
	
It is mandatory for the project management to 
submit half yearly compliance report in respect 
of the stipulated prior environmental clearance 
terms and conditions in hard and soft copies to the 
regulatory authority concerned, on 1st June and 
1st December of each calendar year. 
3.3 
Coastal Regulation Zone Clearance
	
a)	
As per notification dated 06.01.2011 under Section 
3 (1), Section 3 (2) (v) and Section 5 (3) (d) of the 
Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 certain coastal 
stretches have been declared as Coastal Regulation Zone 
(CRZ) and activities in the CRZ are thereby regulated. 
	
	
In general, if a highway project passes within 500 m 
from the high tide line or crosses back water/creak 
etc., a prior CRZ clearance is required from Coastal 
Regulation Zone Management Authorities (CZMA) 
and MOEFCC. The boundary of 500 m is, however, 
of sacrosant and the only way to ascertain the limits of 
CRZ is to refer to the CRZ map of the State. 
	
	
For regulating development activities, the coastal 



======================================================================
PAGE 56 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
41
stretches within 500 m of high tide line on the landward 
side have been classified into four categories of 
Category I (CRZ-I), Category II (CRZ-II), Category III 
(CRZ-III) and Category IV (CRZ-IV). In CRZ-III, with 
a population density of 2161 per square kilometer as per 
2011 census shall have a no development zone (NDZ) 
of 50 m from the High Tide Line (HTL) and in areas 
having population density of below 2161 pe square km 
as per 2011 census NDZ of 200 m is to be maintained. 
 
b) 
Clearance Procedure
	
	
The CRZ notification provides elaborate regulatory 
requirements for different types of CRZ area. Generally, 
development activities are not allowed in sensitive CRZ 
zone. The project authorities are required to consult 
CZMA of the state for submitting the prescribed 
application. The alignment map of the highway project 
is superimposed on the CRZ map of the State to ascertain 
the location of the project in the CRZ.
	
	
If a road project does not otherwise require 
Environmental Clearance (EC) as per the provisions of 
EIA notification, 2006, EC is still required in case the 
project alignment falls in the CRZ area. 
3.4 
Forest Clearance
 
a)	
For any road project where a forest area is required to be 
taken under road construction, clearance for diversion 
of forest land for non-forestry purpose is necessary 
from MOEFCC as per statutory provisions. MOEFCC 
has ten Regional Offices (ROs). The ROs are authorized 
to clear linear projects, irrespective of the area or type 
of forest involved.

b) 
Procedure for diversion of forest land
	
	
The application is submitted online using the web portal 
of MOEFCC. The stepwise procedure for uploading the 
application form and other documents is given on the 
web portal. Hard copies, in prescribed format along with 
prescribed documents are also required to be submitted 
by the project proponent, after registration with the 
office of the Forest Circle concerned to the designated 
Nodal officer of the State and to the DFO (s) concerned 
under whose jurisdiction the forest area proposed to be 
diverted falls. 
	
	
Forest clearances proposals are procured in two stages. 
In the first stage, in principle approval is granted (or 
rejected) for diversion of forest-areas, alongwith certain 
conditions.
	
	
The final (second stage) clearance is issued by MOEFCC 
after fulfillment of the conditions stipulated in the 
first stage and receiving any undertaking regarding 
compliance of the conditions which are due to be 
fulfilled in due course.
	
	
After the receipt of Compliance Report, fulfilling the 
conditions stipulated in Stage-I (in-principle approval) 
from the user agencies through the respective State/
UT Governments, Stage-II clearance is accorded by 
concerned RO of MOEFCC. Following this, the project 
authorities are handed over the forest land for non-
forestry use, by the State Government, provided they 
have other requisite clearances also. However, for 
linear projects, tree cutting permission and working 
permission is granted by the concerned DFO after the 
Stage-I clearance, after confirmation from the Central 



======================================================================

======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
43
Government that the user agency has deposited the 
requisite amount for Compensatory Afforestation, NPV, 
etc.
3.5 
Procedure for obtaining Wild Life Clearance
When a road through a protected Area (PA) viz. a National Park, Wild 
Life, Sanctuary or biosphere reserve etc., prior wild life clearance is 
necessary from National Board of Wild Life even if the project does 
not involve diversion of forest land from the PA. In case of forest 
land diversion is also involved, the proposal of forest clearance for 
such areas is also processed simultaneously both online and in hard 
copies. However, forest clearance in such cases is received only after 
securing wildlife clearance. Even surveys and geotechnical studies in 
PA require prior clearance from the National Board of Wild Life.
In case of PA the online proposal of forest clearance is submitted 
first. The proposal for wild life clearance then can be submitted. The 
stepwise procedure for uploading of web portal is given on the web 
portal. 
The detailed procedure and format of application for all the clearances 
as mentioned above are described in IRC:SP:93.
3.6 
Other Relevant Clearances
3.6.1 Clearance for Eco-Sensitive Zones
 
a)	
All the PAs have Eco-Sensitive Zones (ESZ) earmarked 
all along the periphery of a particular PA. The limits 
of an ESZ are notified, and vary across the PAs, and 
along different directions outside a PA. However, unless 
such boundaries are notified, a 10 km radius from the 
boundary of a PA is taken as the ESZ. Clearance for 
such areas is required, only in case the project requires 
Environment Clearance. In such an eventuality, 



======================================================================
PAGE 59 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
44
clearance for the ESZ of a PA is granted by the Standing 
Committee of the National Board of Wildlife, as per the 
procedures for Wildlife Clearance. 
	
b)	
For the areas covered under the Project Tiger, even 
outside the core area of a PA, and the migratory corridors 
of Tigers contagious to such areas, clearance is required 
from the Standing Committee of the National Board 
of Wildlife on recommendation of the National Tiger 
Conservation Authority (NTCA) as per the procedure 
for Wildlife Clearance, under Section 38 (O) (G) of 
Wildlife Protection Act.
 
c)	
For all other ESZs, notified under the Environment 
Protection Act, clearance is considered as a part of 
Environment Clearance, only if the requirement of EC 
is triggered.
3.6.2 Permission from State/Central Ground Water Authority
For the construction of highway, if water requirements are met through 
ground water, prior permission is required from State/Central Ground 
Water Board.
3.6.3 Permission of Irrigation Department/Water Resource 
Department
For the construction of highway, if water requirements are met 
through River/Canal, etc., prior permission is required from Irrigation 
Department/Water Resource Department.
3.6.4 NOC from Archaeological Department
As per the provisions of the Ancient Monuments and Archacological 
Sites and  Remains Act, it has been notified that every area, beginning 
at the limit of the protected area or the protected monument, as the 
case may be, and extending to a distance of one hundred metres in 



======================================================================
PAGE 60 of 310

45
all directions shall be prohibited area in respect of such protected 
area.  or protected monument. Having regard to the classification of 
any protected monument or protected areas Central Government may 
specify an area more than 100 metres to be the prohibited area. No 
permission for carrying out any public work or project essential to the 
public or other construction, shall be granted in any prohibited area. 
Every area begin in at the limit of prohibited area in respect of 
every ancient monument or archaeological site and remains of 
national importance and exending to a distance of 200 metres in all 
directions shall be regulated area in respect of such monuments and 
archaeological site and remains. For carrying out any construction or 
reconstruction or repair or renovation necessary permission is to be 
obtained from archeological department. 
3.6.5 Permission for Quarrying and Borrowing Operations
At the time of construction of highway, permission of Department 
of Geology and Mines, State Government is required for new quarry 
and borrowing operations. Environmental Clearance is required for 
extraction of minor minerals as follows:
	
a)	
For mining area upto 5 ha- From District Level 
Environmental Impact Assessment Authority (DEIAA)
	
b)	
For mining area of more than 5 ha and less than 50 
ha –From State Environmental Impact Assessment 
Authority (SEIAA)
	
c)	
For mining area of 50 ha or more – From MoEFCC
3.7 
Shifting of Public and Industrial utility lines/services along 
and across National Highways
There may be public and industrial utility lines/services along or 
across the project highway which interfere with the construction and 
operation of the project highways. These are to be shifted to new 



======================================================================
PAGE 61 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
46
locations. These are also to be shifted if they are hazardous from 
the safety consideration. The department or organization concern(s) 
are to be approached for taking necessary action in this regard. If 
the payments are to be made by the project authority, in cases the 
highways are declared/constructed later than the laying of the services, 
the cost estimate for such shifting works are to be obtained from the 
department or organization concerned. The payments are to be made 
after obtaining necessary sanctions of the cost estimates from the 
competent authority.

CHAPTER 4
Geometric Design Standards
4.1	
Geometric design deals with the visible elements of a highway. 
Sound geometric design results in safety and economic operation of 
vehicles. 
The 
standards 
as 
detailed 
below 
are 
generally 
as 
per 
IRC:73 “Geometric Design Standards for Rural (Non-Urban) 
Highways”. If specified in the contract/concession agreement, 
IRC:SP:73 “Manual of Specifications and Standards for Two Laning 
of Highways with Paved Shoulders”, IRC:SP:84 “Manual for 
Specifications and Standards for Four Laning of Highways through 
Public Private Partnership” and IRC:SP:87 “Manual of Specifications 
and Standards for Six Laning of Highways through Public Private 
Partnership” are to be followed for geometric design standards. 
4.1.1. Terrain Classification
The geometric design of a highway is influenced significantly by 
terrain condition. Terrain is classified by the general slope across the 
alignment. The criteria given in Table 4.1 should be followed.

Notes
1.	
Generally, use ruling gradient for design. In special situations, 
such as, isolated over bridges in plain terrain or roads carrying 
substantial slow traffic, use a flatter gradient of 2 per cent.
2.	
Exceptional gradient should not exceed 100 m at a stretch. 
Successive stretches of exceptional gradient must be separated 
by a minimum length of 100 m having gentle gradient.
3.	
The rise in elevation over a length of 2 km should not exceed 
100 m in mountainous terrain and 120 m in steep terrain.
4.	
For kerbed sections, minimum gradient for a drainage should 
be 0.5 per cent when drain is lined and 1 per cent if unlined
5.	
Maximum gradient at hair-pin bend is 2.5 per cent.

4.1.18 Notes on alignment coordination
1.	
Vertical and horizontal curves should coincide. If not possible, 
the horizontal curve should be somewhat longer than vertical 
curve.
2.	
Sharp horizontal curves should be avoided at or near apex of 
pronounced summit/valley curves.
3.	
Grade and curvature should be in proper balance. Flat 
horizontal curves at the expense of steep or long grades, or 
sharp curvature with flat grades should be avoided.
4.	
Broken-back curves (two curves in the same direction with 
short tangent in-between) both in alignment and profile should 
be replaced by a single curve.
4.1.19 Roadway Width at Cross Drainage Structure and Bridges
4..1.19.1 At Culverts
Overall width of culverts (measured from outside to outside of the 
parapert walls) should be equal to the normal roadway width of 
approaches on both sides.

4.1.20 Lateral & Vertical Clearance at Underpasses
Wherever the Project Highway is proposed to be taken above/over 
a cross road, minimum clearances at underpass shall be as follows: 
These are for general information. The exact width and the spans will 
depend upon the requirement of Project Authority and Circulars issued 
by MORTH/State PWDs from time to time. 
Lateral Clearance
i)	
Full roadway width of the cross road shall be carried through 
the Vehicular Underpass. The lateral clearance shall not be less 
than 12 m (7 m carriageway + 2 x 2.5 m shoulder width on 
either side).
ii)	
For Light Vehicular Underpass the lateral clearance shall not 
be less than 10.5 m including 1.5 m wide raised footpath on 
either side.
iii)	
Guard rail/crash barriers shall be provided for protection of 
vehicles from colliding with the abutments and piers and the 
deck of the structures.
Vertical Clearance 
Vertical clearance at underpasses shall not be less than the values 
given below. These are as per IRC:73.
Table 4.17  Vertical Clearance at Underpass 
i) Vehicular Underpass
5.0 m (Non urban areas)
ii) Light Vehicular Underpass

CHAPTER 5
Design of Pavements
5.1 
Flexible Pavement
The new pavements sections should be designed in accordance with 
IRC:37 “Guidelines for the Design of Flexible Pavement”. IRC:37 is 
based on a Mechanistic- Empirical approach.  The flexible pavement 
has been modelled as a layered structure and stress and strain are 
computed using linear elastic model IITPAVE, an updated version of 
FPAVE developed under MORTH Research Scheme R-56 “Analytical 
Design of Flexible Pavement”. The guidelines also cover the design 
of pavement by including material like (i) different combination of 
cementitious bases and subbases, (ii) reclaimed asphalt pavement 
(RAP) base treated with foamed bitumen/bitumen emulsion & (iii) 
high modulus bituminous mixes with stiffer binders. This code also 
covers the design of long life pavement. 
5.1.1 Design Traffic
The design traffic is estimated  in terms of equivalent number of 
cumulative standard axles of 80 kN to be carried during the design 
period. Axle load spectrum data are required where cementitious bases 
are used for evaluating the fatigue damage for heavy traffic.
5.1.2 Initial Traffic
Assessment of the present day average traffic should be based on seven 
day-24 hour count made in accordance with IRC:9 “Traffic Census on 
Non-Urban Roads”. Only the number of commercial vehicles having 
gross weight of 30 KN or more and their axle loading is considered for 
the purpose of design of pavement. 
5.1.3 Traffic Growth Rate
The present day traffic has to be projected for the end of design period 
at growth rate by studying and analysis the data of past trends of traffic 



======================================================================
PAGE 80 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
65
growth and also macro-economic parameters and expected demand due 
to specific developments and land use changes likely to take place during 
design life. The procedure outlined in IRC:108 “Guidelines for Traffic 
Forecast on Highways” may be adopted for traffic projection. If the data 
for the annual growth rate of commercial vehicle is not available or it is 
less than 5% growth, rate of growth of 5% should be used.  
5.1.4 Design Period
It is recommended that design period of 20 years may be adopted for 
National Highways, State Highways and urban roads. Pavements for 
very high density corridors (more than 300 msa) and expressways 
shall preferably be designed as long-life pavements. Otherwise, 
for such corridors, the pavement shall be designed for a minimum 
period of 30 years. If Stage construction is adopted for uncertainty 
of future traffic or possibility of substantial increase of future traffic 
due to future development, the stage-1 pavement will have at least 
40% remaining after Stage-1 period (traffic). Assuming that the life 
consumed varies linearly with traffic, the design traffic for Stage-1 
shall be taken 1.67 times of the Stage-1 period. Stage construction is 
not allowed for cement treated bases and sub-bases. The thickness of 
the pavement for the next stage shall be determined after evaluation of 
the structural condition of pavement by FWD. 
5.1.5 Computation of Design Traffic
5.1.5.1	The design traffic in terms of the cumulative number of 
standard axles to be carried during the design life of the road should 
be computed using the following equation:
Ndes = 365 x [(1 + r)n – 1]   x A x D x F
                           r
Where,
Ndes = 	Cumulative number of standard axles to be catered for in the 
design in terms of msa.

A =

D = 	 Lane distribution factor 
F =	
Vehicle Damage Factor (VDF)
n =	
Design period in years
r = 	
Annual growth rate of commercial vehicles (expressed in

The traffic in the year of completion is estimated using the following 
formula
	
	  A = P (1 +R)x
Where P = Number of commercial vehicles as per last count
Where x = Number of years between the last count and the year of 
completion of construction.
5.1.5.2 Lane Distribution Factor (Distribution of commercial and 
traffic over the carriageway)
Distribution of commercial traffic in each direction and in each lane 
is required for determining the total equivalent standard axle load 
applications to be considered in the design.
 
i) 
Single-lane roads
	
	
Traffic tends to be more channelized on single-lane roads 
than two-lane roads and to allow for this concentration 
of wheel load repetitions, the design should be based on 
total number of commercial vehicles in both directions.
 
ii) 
Intermediate Lane Road of Width 5.5 m
	
	
Design traffic should be based on 75% of the two way 
commercial traffic



======================================================================
PAGE 82 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
67
 
iii) 
Two-lane two way roads
	
	
The design should be based on 50 per cent of the total 
number of commercial vehicles in both directions. If 
vehicle damage factor in one direction is higher, the traffic 
in the direction of higher VDF is recommended for design.
 
iv) 
Four-lane single carriageway roads
	
	
The design should be based on 40 per cent of the total 
number of commercial vehicles in both directions.
 
v) 
Dual carriageway roads
	
	
The design of dual two-lane carriageway roads 
should be based on 75 per cent of the number of 
commercial vehicles in each direction. For dual three-
lane carriageway and dual four lane carriageway, the 
distribution factor will be 60 per cent and 45 per cent 
respectively. 
5.1.5.3	 Vehicle Damage Factor (VDF)
	
a)	
The VDF is a multiplier to convert the number of 
commercial vehicle of different axle loads and axle 
configuration into the number of repetitions of standard 
axle load of magnitude of 80 kN. It is defined as equivalent 
number of Standard axles per commercial vehicle
	
b)	
In case of cemented bases, cumulative fatigue damage 
principle, applicable to rigid pavement and other 
structures, is used for determining fatigue life of cement 
bases for due to axle load repetitions using the data for 
the spectrum of axle loads.
	
c)	
VDF should be arrived at carefully by carrying out 
specific axle loads surveys for a minimum period of 24 
hours on the existing roads in each direction.

For small projects, in the absence of weigh pad, axle 
loads of typical commercial vehicles plying on the 
road may be estimated approximately from the type of 
goods carried. Where information on axle loads is not 
available and the proportion of heavy vehicles using the 
road is not large following indicative values of VDF in 
Table 5.2 can be used.

5.1.6 Requirement of CBR of subgrade
5.1.6.1	 The subgrade is the top 500 mm of the embankment immediately 
below the bottom of pavement, and is made up of insitu material, 
select soil or stabilized soil that forms the foundation of the pavement. 
It should be well compacted to have a minimum 97 per cent or higher 
of laboratory dry density or higher achieved with heavy compaction 



======================================================================
PAGE 84 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
69
as per IS:2720 (Part 8) for expressways, National Highways, State 
Highways and other heavily trafficked roads. When the subgrade is 
formed using a material which is stronger than 500 mm embankment 
soil or when the subgrade itself is prepared in two separate layers 
with significantly different strengths the effective contribution of the 
subgrade and embankment layers has to be considered in design. The 
determination of effective CBR as well as the detailed guidelines for 
preparation of samples, testing and acceptance criteria are given in 
IRC:37 “Guidelines for the Design of Flexible Pavements”.
5.1.7 Pavement thickness and composition
5.1.7.1	 Once the design traffic and the subgrade CBR are known 
the pavement composition and the thickness can be decided as per 
the procedure detailed in IRC:37. The detailed pavement design 
procedure including  principles of pavement design, determination 
of properties of different layers of pavement and subgrade have been 
described in the above mentioned guidelines. The cementitious bases 
have also been described Pavement design catalogues have also been 
presented in these guidelines for different traffic ranges (upto 50 msa 
design traffic) , different CBRs and different combination of material 
composition.
5.1.7.2	 IRC:37 also includes a CD, which contains the design software, 
can be used for design of flexible pavements.
5.2 
Design of Rigid Pavement
5.2.1	 Rigid pavement for new roads should be designed in accordance 
with IRC:58 “Guidelines for the Design of Plain Jointed Rigid 
Pavements for Highways”. The design as per IRC:58 is based on the 
considerations of the flexural stress under the simultaneous action of 
load and temperature gradient for different categories of axles and also 
considering sum of cumulative damages caused by axle loads. This 
guideline also include procedure for design of pavement with widened 
outer lane, tied concrete shoulders, pavements bonded to stabilized sub-
base as well as design of longitudinal, expansion and contraction joints. 



======================================================================
PAGE 85 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
70
These guidelines are applicable to roads having an average number of 
daily commercial vehicles more than 450 numbers with laden weight 
exceeding 30 kN. Cement concrete pavement may be designed to have a 
life span of 30 years or more. 
5.2.2 Traffic:
5.2.2.1	 Axle load survey is to be conducted for a continuous period of 48 
hours. The vehicles to be surveyed may be selected randomly to avoid 
bias. If the spacing of consecutive axles (wheel base) is more than  2.4 
m, each axle shall be considered as single axle. The intervals at which 
axle groups should be classified for fatigue damage analysis are. 
Data on the spacing of axles is also to be collected during traffic survey.
	
Single Axle 	
	
10 KN
	
Tandem Axle	
	
20 KN
	
Tridem Axle	
	
30 KN
5.2.2.2	 Wheel Base Characteristics
Information on wheel base of commercial vehicles is necessary to 
identify proportion of axles that should be considered for estimating top 
down fatigue caused by axle loads during night period. The commonly 
used spacing of transverse joint is 4.5 m. Thus axles with spacing 
more than 4.5 m will not contribute to top down fatigue cracking. The 
percentage of commercial vehicles with spacing between the front and 
the first rear axle less than the proposed spacing of the transverse joint 
in concrete slabs should be established from the axle load survey 
5.2.2.3	 The traffic counts and the corresponding traffic estimates 
should indicate the day and night traffic trends as the traffic during the 
day hours is generally responsible for bottom-up cracking whereas the 
night time traffic may lead to top-down cracking.
5.2.2.4	 Assessment of average daily traffic should normally be based 
on seven day 24 hours count made in accordance with IRC:9. The 



======================================================================
PAGE 86 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
71
determination of actual value of annual rate of growth shall be as per 
methods as prescribed for the design of flexible pavement. The annual 
growth rate of commercial vehicles shall be taken as a minimum of 
5%. 
5.2.2.5	 The edge flexural stress caused by axle loads for Bottom 
Up Cracking (Day Time) is maximum when the tyre imprint of the 
outer wheel touches the longitudinal edge. Typical lateral distribution 
characteristics of wheel paths of commercial vehicles observed 
on Indian highways indicate that very few wheels of vehicles are 
tangential to the longitudinal edge or longitudinal joint on two-
lane two-way roads and divided multi-lane highways. Taking into 
consideration these issues, it is recommended that 25 percent of the 
total two-way commercial traffic may be considered as design for two 
lane two way roads for analysis of fatigue damage. In case of four 
lane    and other multilane divided highway, 25% of total traffic in the 
direction of traffic is to be considered for design.
5.2.2.6	 The design traffic for Top-Down Cracking (Night Time) 
analysis will usually be a fraction of the design traffic considered for 
bottom-up cracking analysis. Only those commercial vehicles with 
the spacing between the front axle and the first rear axle less than 
the spacing of transverse joints is considered for the analysis of top-
down cracking. This percentage should be established from axle load 
/ traffic survey. A default value of fifty percent of the design traffic for 
the bottom-up cracking analysis may be considered for the analysis of 
top down cracking. 
5.2.2.7	 The cumulative number of commercial vehicles during the 
design period may be estimated from the following expression. 
C =  365xA( (1+ r)n  -  1) -
r
Where, C = Cumulative number of commercial vehicles during the 
design period,

A = Initial number of commercial vehicles per day in the year 
when the road is opened to traffic
	
r = Annual rate of growth of commercial traffic volume 
(expressed as decimal) and
	
n = Design period in years 
The design cumulative number of axle load repetitions for fatigue 
damage can be obtained from the cumulative number of commercial 
vehicles as per IRC: 58.  Equivalency factor like VDF in rigid 
pavement is assumed as 2.35 in accordance with IRC:58.
5.2.3 Temperature Consideration
Temperature differential between the top and bottom fibers of concrete 
pavements causes the concrete slab to curl giving rise to stresses. As 
far as possible temperature differential values estimated realistically, 
for the given site using geographical parameters and material 
characteristic should be used for analysis. In the absence of any local 
data, the maximum temperature differential values given in IRC:58 
may be adopted for the pavement design. The maximum temperature 
differential during the night is nearly half of the day temperature. 
5.2.4 Embankment soil and characteristics of subgrade and 
subbase
5.2.4.1	 CBR of embankment soil placed below the 500 mm select 
subgrade should be determined for estimating the effective CBR of 
subgrade and its modulus of subgrade reaction k value for design.
5.2.4.2	 The modulus of subgrade reaction ‘k’ which is defined as the 
pressure per unit deflection of the foundation as determined plate 
load tests. The k value is determined from the pressure sustained at 
a deflection of 1.25 mm. As the plate load test is time-consuming 
and expensive and therefore the design of k value is often estimated 
from soaked CBR value. The relationship between the CBR value 
at different soaked CBR and k value has been given in IRC:58. A 



======================================================================
PAGE 88 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
73
minimum CBR of 8% has been recommended for the 500 mm select 
soil subgrade.
5.2.4.3	 If the CBR of the 500 mm thick compacted subgrade is 
significantly larger than that of embankment below it, the effective 
CBR is to be determined as per method described in IRC:58.  
5.2.4.4	 The subgrade needs to be protected by providing separation and 
drainage layers of Granular Sub Base (GSB). The details of separation 
and drainage layers have been given in IRC:58.
5.2.4.5	 To provide a uniform, stable and permanent support to the 
concrete slab it is laid over a subbase layer of Dry Lean Concrete 
(DLC) with minimum thickness of 150 mm having 7 day average 
compressive strength of 7 Mpa. Cement treated subbase with recycled 
or marginal aggregated have also been recommended in IRC:58. The 
interface layer can be made smooth to reduce the interlayer friction 
by providing a de-bonding interlayer of polythene sheet white or 
transparent having a minimum thickness of 125 micron.
5.2.4.6	 The k values of different types of subbase have also been given 
in IRC:58
5.2.5 Recommended Design Procedure: 
5.2.5.1	 As per IRC: 58, steps as given below may be followed for 
design. 
Step 1 :	Stipulate design values for the various parameters. 
Step 2 :	Select a trial design thickness of pavement slab.
Step 3 :	Compute the repetitions of axle loads of different magnitudes 
and different categories during the design life.
Step 4 :	Find the proportions of axle load repetitions operating during 
the day and night periods. 
Step 5 :	Estimate the axle load repetitions in the six-hour-period during 
the day time. The maximum temperature differential is assumed to 



======================================================================
PAGE 89 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
74
remain constant during    the 6 hours for analysis of bottom-up cracking 
Step 6 :	Estimate the axle load repetitions in the six-hour period during 
the night time. The maximum negative temperature differential during 
night is taken as half of day-time maximum temperature differential. 
Built in negative temperature differential of 5ºC developed during the 
setting of the concrete is to be added to the temperature differential for 
the analysis of top-down cracking. Only those vehicles with spacing 
between the front (steering) axle and the first rear axle less than the 
transverse joint spacing need to be considered for top-down cracking 
analysis. 
Step 7 :	Compute the flexural stresses at the edge due to the single and 
tandem axle loads for the combined effect of axle loads and positive 
temperature differential during the day time. Determine the stress ratio 
(Flexural stress/Modulus of Rupture) and evaluate the Cumulative 
Fatigue Damage (CFD) for single and tandem axle loads. 
Step 8 :	Compute the maximum flexural stress in the top surface of 
the pavement slab with the front axle near the approaching transverse 
joint and the rear axle close to the following joint in the same panel 
under negative temperature differential. Determine the stress ratio and 
evaluate the CFD for different axle loads for the analysis of top-down 
cracking. 
Step 9 :	Sum of CFD for the BUC and TDC. If the sum is less than 1.0, 
the pavement slab is safe against fatigue cracking. 
5.2.5.2	 The entire design process is programmed on an excel sheet 
and it is included in a CD enclosed with these guidelines IRC: 58. 
This will enable the designer to make several trials conveniently. 
The designer has to provide modulus of the subgrade reaction of the 
foundation supporting the pavement slab, 28-day strength of concrete, 
temperature differential; traffic data such as rate of traffic growth, 
axle load spectrum, proportion of single, tandem and tridem axles, 
proportion of trucks with wheel base less than transverse joint spacing 
(say 4.5 m). All relevant traffic and material data are inputs to the

75
excel sheet. It is worth noting that concrete strength increases with 
age. The excel sheets provide designs by considering 90-day strength 
of paving concrete (The minimum 28 day flexural strength is taken 
as 4.5 MPa). Any other strength including that of high performance 
concrete can be the input. 90 day strength can safely be used because 
of numbers of conservative assumption in the design. 
5.2.6 Design of Joints
5.2.6.1	 Cement Concrete Pavements have different types of  joints 
given as:
	
i)	
Contraction joints 
	
ii)	
Construction joints 
	
iii)	
Expansion joint
	
iv)	
Longitudinal joint 
5.2.6.2	 Contraction joints are transverse joints which relieve the 
tensile stresses in concrete pavements. The joint spacing of a concrete 
pavement depends upon the type of coarse aggregates and the average 
temperature fluctuation in different seasons. The spacing of contraction 
joints should be limited to 4.5 m to prevent top-down cracking during 
the night hours. Expansion joints are no longer in use. Construction 
joints are as far as possible, be placed at contraction joints except in 
case of emergency. 
5.2.6.3	 Dowel bars are provided for load transfer of transverse 
joints. The design of dowel bars recommended as per IRC:58 for the 
dimension and lengths of dowel bars are given below:
5.2.6.3.1	Recommended dimensions of Dowel Bars for transverse joints 
of Rigid Pavements are given in Table 5.3

5.3 
Design of Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavement 
(CRCP)
5.3.1	 Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavement (CRCP) is 
intended for roads carrying high volume of commercial traffic and 
where closing road often for maintenance is difficult.
5.3.2	 The CRCP may be with elastic joints or without joints. 
The CRCP with joints are similar to jointed reinforced concrete 
pavement except that steel reinforcements run through the pavement 
continuously. Transverse joints are formed in concrete slab by saw cut 
at 4.5 m spacing for full width and sealed but without discontinuing 
the steel. The CRCP without joints is a joint less rigid pavement with 
continuous reinforcement. 
5.3.3	 The main advantages of CRCP are
	
	
These pavements are rugged and durable for heavy 
truck corridors or expressways.
	
 
The riding quality remains smoothen as there are no 
transverse joints but noise problem persists.
	
 
The cost of maintenance is minimal.
5.3.4	 CRCP roads are to avoided in the following situations
	
 
In marine climate near sea coast where the reinforcing 
bars are vulnerable for corrosion.
	
 
In a road having large number of utility lines, it is not 
desirable to construct CRCP as repair of these utility 
lines is a difficult task.
	
 
Due to high initial cost, CRCP should be avoided in 
road catering to light traffic like village road, urban 
streets and of short length.
	
 
Construction of CRCP using manual method should be 
avoided. This manual method will be slow and would 
result in construction of large number of transverse 
construction joints.

joints there of and their detailing are available in IRC:118 “Guidelines 
for Design and Construction of Continuously Reinforced Concrete 
Pavement”. 
5.4 
Strengthening of Flexible Road Pavements Using Falling 
Weight Deflectometer (Fwd)
5.4.1	 Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) is an impulse-loading 
device in which a transient load is applied to the pavement and the 
deflected shape of the pavement surface is measured. The working 
principle of a typical FWD is illustrated in Fig. 5.1. D0, D1 etc. shown 
in Fig 5.1 are surface deflections measured at different radial distances. 
Impulse load is applied by means of a falling mass, which is allowed 
to drop vertically on a system of springs placed over a circular loading 
plate. The deflected shape of the pavement surface is measured using 
displacement sensors which are placed at different radial distances 
starting with the center of the load plate. Trailer mounted as well 
as vehicle mounted FWD models are available commercially. The 
working principle of all these FWD models is essentially the same. A 
mass of weights is dropped from a pre-determined height onto a series 
of springs/buffers placed on top of a loading plate. The corresponding 
peak load and peak vertical surface deflections at different radial 
locations are measured and recorded.

5.4.2	 The details of FWD calibrations, method of measurement, 
analysis of data, design of overlay and calculation of the remaining 
period of service etc. are given in IRC:115 “Guidelines for Structural 
Evaluation and Strengthening of Flexible Road Pavements using 
Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) Technique”. Following steps are 
to be taken before deflection measurement. 
5.4.2.1	 Calibration of the FWD
It is essential that FWD’s are calibrated for the following for getting 
accurate and reproducible results. 
	
 
Static calibration of the load cells
	
 
Load repeatability of the FWD
	
 
Absolute calibration of deflection transducers
5.4.2.2	 Pavement evaluation survey and data collection. The 
following are the broad categories of survey investigation and data 
collection exercise; (i) Historical data about the pavement, (ii) 
condition survey of the pavement for identification of uniform sections 
having similar conditions; (iii) deflection measurements using FWD 
and (iv) pavement layer thickness and composition and the subgrade 
characteristics. 
5.4.3 Analysis of Data
Following are the steps for analysis of data obtained from the field 
observations:-
	
i)	
Processing of Load & Deflection Data
	
ii)	
Identification of Homogeneous sub sections. 
	
iii)	
Back calculation of layer moduli
	
iv)	
Correction for Temperature 
	
v)	
Correction for seasonal variation

5.4.4 Estimation of Design Traffic
This traffic in terms of standard axle load of 80 kN repetitions shall be 
considered for design of overlay. These are to be calculated as per details 
given in para 5.1 for design of flexible pavement as mentioned above.
5.4.5	 The following are the steps to be followed for design of 
overlays for flexible pavement for Indian Highways by using FWD.
	
i)	
Measurement of surface deflections of homogeneous 
section of the in-service pavement using FWD.
	
ii)	
Normalization of the deflections to correspond to a 
standard target load of 40 kN.
	
iii)	
Collection of information about layer type and layer 
thickness.
	
iv)	
Back calculation of pavement layer moduli from 
the normalized deflections using appropriate back 
calculation software. Back calculation will be done by 
considering the pavement to be a three layer system. All 
bituminous layers will be combined together. Similarly 
granular base and subbase layers may be combined. For 
pavements with modified subgrades, the modified layer 
may be treated as part of subgrade. Cemented subbases 
may be treated to be part of granular layer.
	
	
For pavements with cemented base, unless the pavement 
is being evaluated for its remaining life within a short 
period after construction, the cemented layer may be 
treated as part of granular layer.
	
v)	
Adjustment of the bituminous layer modulus (back 
calculated) to a standard temperature of 350C.  
	
vi)	
Adjustment of the subgrade and granular layer moduli 
to correspond to post monsoon condition. 



======================================================================

81
	
vii)	
Selection of 15th percentile modulus (15% of the values 
will be less than this value) of each of the three layers 
considered for analysis. 
	
viii)	
Analysis of the in-service pavement using liner elastic 
layer theory with the back calculated (corrected) moduli 
and layer thickness collected from field as inputs. This 
includes computation of critical Strains (a) Horizontal 
Tensile Strain at the bottom fiber of bituminous layer and 
(b) Vertical Compressive Strain on top of subgrade. The 
loading configuration and the locations of critical strains 
for analysis will be similar to those adopted in IRC:37. 
	
ix)	
Estimation of the remaining life of the pavement using 
the fatigue in bituminous layer and subgrade rutting 
performance criteria adopted in IRC:37. The strain 
values obtained in step viii will be used to estimate the 
remaining lives from fatigue and rutting consideration. 
Remaining life of the pavement will be the shortest 
of the lives obtained from bituminous layer fatigue, 
subgrade rutting and cemented base fatigue (in case of 
pavements with cemented base) criteria.
	
x)	
For design of bituminous overlay, a trial thickness of 
overlay of an appropriate material has to be selected and 
the critical strains have to be evaluated. The modulus 
value of the bituminous overlay material may be selected 
as per the guidelines given in IRC:37. Design overlay 
thickness can be selected by trial in such a way that the 
computed critical strains are less than the permissible 
limits given by the performance criteria for the design 
traffic level considered.

Benkelman Beam Deflection

requirements of flexible pavements are given in IRC:81 “Guidelines 
for Strengthening of Flexible Road Pavements using Benkelman Beam 
Deflection Technique.” The procedure involves the following main 
operations. This method may be used for strengthening of pavement 
for State Highways. This method is not reccomended for NH Projects. 
	
i)	
It will be preferable if the length of each section of 
uniform performance is kept at a minimum of 1 km 
except in the case of localized failure or other situations 
requiring closure examinations where minimum length 
of section may be suitably fixed. This is done by visual 
observations supplemented by rut depth measurments 
using a 3 m straight edge. 
	
ii)	
Making 10 equidistant points in each traffic lane of 
uniform section along the outer wheel path (i.e. 60 cms 
from the pavement edge) for single-lane road, 90 cms 
for two-lane road and 1.5 metre for four-lane divided 
carriageway. 
	
iii)	
Conducting deflection measurements at the marked 
points as per CGRA procedure by placing probe of the 
Benkelman Beam between dual wheels of a loaded 
truck with rear axle weighing 8170 kg and load equally 
distributed over two wheels each provided with dual 
tyres inflated to a pressure of 5.60 kg/cm2.
	
iv)	
Ascertain annual rainfall in the area. Also, pavement 
temperature, moisture content of the subgrade, 
classification of the subgrade soil at the time of taking 
deflection measurements may be determined.
	
v)	
Correct the deflection values to standard temperature 
of 350C and account for seasonal variation which is 
dependent on annual rainfall in the area, classification 
of subgrade soil and its moisture content at the time 
of testing. Correction for temperature variation is 



======================================================================
PAGE 98 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
83
not applicable in case of roads with thin bituminous 
surfacings or where the road is subjected to severe 
cracking or the bituminous layer is substantially 
stripped. Correction for seasonal variation is to be done 
as per the procedure given in IRC:81.
	
vi)	
For the set of 10 corrected, values of deflections, find 
out the mean deflection (x), standard deviation (σ) and 
then the characteristic deflection (D.C.) by the following 
formulae. 
	
	
Mean deflection (x) = ∑x
                                                           n
	
	
Standard deviation (σ) = √(x – x)2
                                                                    n -1
	
	
Characteristics deflection 
	
	
a) Dc = x + 2 σ  (for major arterial roads, like NH & SH)
	
	
b) Dc = x +  σ  (for all other roads)
	
	
Where x = Individual deflection, mm
	
	
x  = Mean deflection, mm
	
	
Dc = Characteristic deflection
	
	
σ = Standard deviation
	
	
n = Number of deflection measurements
	
vii)	
Design traffic may be calculated as given in the design 
of flexible pavement as mentioned above. The design 
period may be considered as 10 years.
	
viii)	
From the graph in IRC:81 find out the overlay in terms 
of bituminious macadam construction required for 
the characteristic deflection and cumulative standard

axles as worked out as per above paras (vi) and (vii) 
respectively. 
5.6 
Structural Evaluation of Rigid Pavement
5.6.1	 Evaluation of structural condition of in-service rigid pavements 
can be done using Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD).  The strength 
of the pavement concrete as well as the modulus of subgrade reaction 
can be estimated so that the capacity of the pavement to withstand 
future traffic loading i.e. balance life can be determined using 
cumulative fatigue damage principle as laid down in IRC:58.
5.6.2	 Structural evaluation exercise should include load transfer at 
the transverse and longitudinal joints so that the necessary measures 
may be taken to retrofit dowel and tie bars before extensive damage 
occurs. The deflection data can be used to detect voids at transverse 
joints, longitudinal joints, interiors as well as at the corners so that 
actions can be taken to fill up the voids by grouting to prevent large 
scale damage to pavements.
5.6.3	 IRC:117 “Guidelines for the Structural Evaluation of Rigid 
Pavements by Falling Weight Deflectometer” gives the details of 
pavement evaluation process, evaluation of subgrade modulus, elastic 
modulus of concrete and strength of pavement concrete. Method for 
filling of voids detected by FWD testing or by any other like GPR etc. 
by cement grouting and for retrofitting of dowel bars have also been 
prescribed in these guidelines IRC:117. 	
5.7 
Design of stabilize pavement using Commercial Chemical 
Stabilizers (CCS)
5.7.1	 In recent past different types of CCS have come into market. 
The companies which are promoting these indicate that there are 
special chemical compound which have been evolved after long 
research and should be mixed with cement to enhance the strength 
and durability characteristics of soil cement mix. These are available 
in powder form or liquid form. However, since long term performance 



======================================================================

85
of roads constructed with such special products is not available, it 
becomes difficult to accept such products for large scale application.
5.7.2.	 The details mechanism of acceptance for CCS, material 
characterization have been given in IRC:SP:89 (Part II) “Guidelines 
for the Design of Stabilized Pavement”. This document may be 
referred for further details.
5.7.3	 The design methodology for CCS Conventional stabilizer like 
cement, lime & fly ash shall remain the same as provided in IRC:37
5.8 
Internal Drainage in Pavement
5.8.1	
The performance of a pavement can be seriously affected if 
adequate drainage measures to prevent accumulation of moisture in 
the pavement structure are not taken. Drainage measure are especially 
important when the road is in cutting or built on low permeability 
soil or situated in heavy rainfall/snowfall area. On new roads, the aim 
should be to construct the pavement as far above the water table as 
economically practicable. The difference between the subgrade level 
and the level of water table/high flood level should generally, not be 
less than 1.0 m or 0.6 m in case of existing roads which have no history 
of being overtopped. In waterlogged areas, where the subgrade is 
within the zone of capillary saturation, consideration should be given 
to the installation of suitable capillary cut off as per IRC:34-2011 
“Recommendations For Road Construction In Areas Affected By Water 
Logging, Flooding  and/Or Salts Infestation” at an appropriate level 
underneath the pavement. Nevertheless, maintenance of transverse 
section of the road way in good shape to reasonable crossfall as to 
facilitate quick run off surface water and provision of appropriate 
surface and sub surface drains are primary measures to guard against 
poor drainage conditions. The details regarding drainage provisions 
are given in IRC:SP:42 “Guidelines for Road Drainage”.

CHAPTER 7
ROAD SAFETY INCLUDING TRAFFIC 
ENGINEERING, MARKINGS, SIGNAGE ETC.
7.1	
Road accidents is a negative externality associates with 
expansion in road network, motorization and urbanization in the 
country. Road traffic injuries are recognized globally as a major 
public health problem, for being one of the leading causes of deaths, 
disabilities and hospitalization, imposing huge socio-economic costs. 
During the calendar year 2016, the total number of road accidents is 
reported at 4,80,652 claiming 1,50,785 lives in the country meaning 55 
accidents and 17 death every hour. Various measures which promote 
road safety are presented below:-
7.2 
Road Intersection
Road Intersections are points of conflict and hence are prone to 
accidents. About 37% of total accidents took place on junctions 
during the calendar year 2016. Therefore, it does not need any further 
emphasis on the importance of the road intersection. The intersections 
need proper design and are to be notified through appropriate signs 
and markings as the driver will have to carry out different manoeuvers, 
like diverging, merging, weaving, crossing, etc. 
7.2.1 Intersection Types and Choice
a)	
Generally intersections can be classified into following 
categories depending on the traffic conditions. These are:
	
1.	
Uncontrolled Intersections at-grade: These are the 
intersections between any two roads with relatively 
lower volume of traffic and traffic of neither road has 
precedence over the other.
	
2.	
Intersection with Priority Control: There is theoretically 
no delay occurring on the major road and vehicles on the 



======================================================================
PAGE 108 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
93
minor road are controlled by “Give WAY” or “STOP” 
sign.
	
3.	
Time separated intersection/Signalized Intersection at – 
Grade: The detailed warrants for signalized intersection 
are laid down in IRC:93 “Guidelines on Design and 
Installation of Road Traffic Signals”. A signalized 
intersection besides other warrants, is justified if the 
major street has a traffic volume of 650 to 800 vehicles 
per hour (both direction) and minor street has 200 to 
250 vehicles per hour in one direction only.
	
4.	
Space 
Separated 
Intersection/Grade 
Separated 
Intersections: The detailed warrants for interchange 
or grade separated Intersections are given in IRC:92 
“Guidelines for the Design of Interchanges in Urban 
Areas”. According to these, a grade-separated 
intersections, besides other warrants, is justified when 
the total traffic of all the arms of the intersection is in 
excess of 10,000 PCU’s per hour. 
b)	
Road Intersections occur in multiplicity of shapes. They can, 
however, be divided into seven basis forms – T, Y, Scissor, 
Cross, Staggered, Staggered and skewed, and Multiway. The 
various shapes of at-grade intersections are shown in Fig. 
7.1. The relation of a particular shape is governed by the 
configurations and geometrics of the intersecting arms.
c)	
Rotary is suitable for urban/sub-urban areas where right 
turning traffic is substantial, and shall not be adopted on high 
speed rural sections. Lighting is essential. For design of rotary, 
reference may be made to IRC:65 “Guidelines for Planning 
and Design of Roundabouts” for broad design features.



======================================================================

======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
94
d)	
Channelised intersections with mountable kerbs for the traffic 
islands are suitable for rural highways. The islands shall be 
of sufficient size (min. 6m2  ) to attract attention, and shall be 
painted in alternate black and white stripes. 
e)	
Grade-separation may be warranted where the peak-hour traffic 
is in excess of 10,000 PCUs. Even at locations with lesser traffic, 
the natural difference in levels between the intersecting roads, 
if existing, could be made use of in separating the crossing 
streams. Grade separation will be necessary at all crossings of 
a highway which is to be developed to a completely access 
controlled standard. Similarly, interchanges will be required at 
all major crossings on highways developed to access controlled 
standard.
f)	
Signal control are essentially for roads in urban/sub-urban 
areas. A signalized intersection besides other warrants given in 
IRC:93, is justified if the major street has a traffic volume of 
650 to 800 vehicles per hour (both direction) and minor street

has 200 to 250 vehicles per hour in one direction only. 
	
For design of at-grade intersections, except for traffic rotaries 
and signalized intersection, IRC:SP:41 “Guidelines for the 
Design of At-Grade Intersections in Rural and Urban Areas” 
may be referred.
7.2.2 Essential data required for design of road intersections.
	
i)	
An index/location plan in the scale of about 1:10,000 to 
1:20,000 showing the intersection under consideration 
and the road/rail/river network. 
	
ii) 	
A base plan of the intersection in the scale of 1:500 where 
two or three intersections are located close together. 
Additional base plan to a scale of 1:1000 should be 
prepared showing all the intersection affected. 
	
iii)	
The peak hour design traffic data. The peak hour design 
traffic data should give its compositional and the 
directional break up.
	
iv)	
In the urban/sub-urban areas and intersection with 
villages with substantial pedestrian movements, the 
peak hour data on persons crossing the intersection 
should be collected for the design of well planned and 
pedestrian crossing for set movements. 
	
v)	
Other relevant details such as the flexibility of providing 
proper drainage and the lighting system and also the 
present and future land use in the vicinity of intersection 
shall be given.
	
vi)	
Accident data at intersections should be collected as per 
MORTH forms as detailed in para 7.11
7.2.2.1	 A comprehensive investigation of traffic conditions and 
physical characteristics of the location is required to determine the 
need for signal installation. The following data is required to be 
collected for proper design and operation of a signal. 



======================================================================
PAGE 111 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
96
	
i)	
Number of motorized vehicles entering the intersection 
in each hour from each approach during 10 consecutive 
hours of a representative day;
	
ii)	
Vehicular volumes of heavy vehicles (e.g. trucks, buses) 
light vehicles (e.g. passenger cars, taxis, jeeps, tempos), 
motor cycles, scooters and non-motorised vehicles (e.g. 
hand carts, bullock carts, rickshaws, cycles, etc.), from 
each approach for atleast two hours in the morning and 
two hours in the evening during peak periods;
	
iii)	
Pedestrian volume counts on each cross walk during the 
same periods as vehicular counts in para (ii) above and 
also during hours of highest pedestrian volumes.
	
iv)	
85th percentile speed of all vehicles on the uncontrolled 
approaches to the location, if not at least an average 
speed of approach must be recorded.
	
v)	
A condition diagram showing details of the physical 
layout including such features as intersectional 
geometrics, channelization, grades, sight distance 
restriction, bus stops and routings, parking conditions, 
pavement markings, street lighting, drive ways, location 
of nearby rail-road crossings distance to nearest signals, 
utility poles and fixtures, and adjacent landuse, etc.
	
vi)	
A collision diagram showing accident experienced by 
type, location direction of movement, severity, time of 
day, date and day of week for at least one year. 
7.2.2.2	The following data are also desirable for a more precise 
understanding of the operation of the intersection and may be obtained 
during periods specified in para 7.2.2.1 (ii) above:
	
i)	
Delay in seconds per vehicle determined separately for 
each approach.
	
ii)	
The 85th percentile speed of vehicles on the controlled 
approaches at a point near to the intersection but 
unaffected by the control.



======================================================================

iii)	
Pedestrian delay time for at least two 30 minute peak 
pedestrian delay periods of an average week-day or like 
periods of a Sunday or Saturday.
7.2.2.3	Traffic control signals on an intersection should not be installed 
unless one or more of the following signal warrants are met:
	
Warrant 1	
-	
Minimum vehicular volume
	
Warrant 2	
-	
Interruption of continuous traffic
	
Warrant 3	
-	
Minimum pedestrian volume
	
Warrant 4 	
-	
Accident experience
	
Warrant 5	
-	
Combination of warrants
7.2.2.4 Visibility at Intersections
a)	
To avoid collisions, sufficient sight distance should be available 
along the intersecting arms and their included corners. The minimum 
visibility triangles should be clear of any obstructions upto a height of 
1.5 metre above the road way. Minimum eligibility distance along major 
roads at priority intersections on rural roads is given in Table 7.1

b) At an intersection where the intersecting roads are more or less of equal 
importance and there is no established priority (known as uncontrolled 
intersections), visibility should be provided on the principle that drivers 
approaching the intersection on from either highway must be able to

perceive a hazard and halt the vehicle if required before reaching the 
intersection. Fig. 7.1 (a) explainsthe requirement of a visibility triangle.
c) On intersection, involving a major road and a minor road, traffic 
on minor road is controlled by ‘STOP’ or ‘GIVE WAY’ signs/road 
markings. Such sections are known as priority intersections. Fig. 7.1 (b) 
explains the visbilty triangle at priority intersections.

7.2.3 Interchange
7.2.3.1 Warrants
The decision to provide interchanges are based on careful consideration 
of following factors
	
1.	
Design consideration – For expressways to ensure 
continuous flow of traffic on the expressway interchanges 
are to be provided to avoid at grade intersection with 
the intersecting roads. However it should be determined 
based on the priority of the intersecting roads whether 
to terminate, re-routed or grouped with to provide the 
interchange.
	
2.	
Safety – At grade intersection may require up-gradation 
based on the number of accidents at the intersection. 
	
3.	
Congestion – An interchange may be warranted where 
the Level of Service (LOS) of an at grade intersection is 
unacceptable and the intersection cannot be modified to 
provide an acceptable LOS.
	
4	
Site topography – At certain sites, a grade separated 
intersection may be more feasible than an at grade 
intersection due to local topography.
	
5.	
Traffic Volume – Interchanges are desirable at cross roads 
with heavy traffic volume. Generally the interchange is 
considered necessary when the total traffic of all the arms 
of the intersection is in excess of 10,000 PCU per hour. 
	
6.	
Road user Benefits – An interchange is warranted if an 
analysis reveals that road user benefits due to reduction 
in travel time will exceed the costs over the service life 
of the interchange. 
7.2.3.2	Types of Interchanges
Interchanges can be broadly classified as:



======================================================================
PAGE 115 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
100
System Interchange : An interchange that maintains free-flow through 
its elements for all major movements.  System interchanges mainly 
connects from major road to major road.  A major road typically refers 
to an expressway, major highway or major arterial road that does not 
contain at-grade intersections.
Service Interchange :An interchange that does not maintain free-flow 
through its elements for all major movements.  Service interchanges 
mainly connects from major road to minor road.  A minor road 
typically refers to a highway, arterial or sub-arterial road that contains 
at-grade intersection.
7.2.3.3	 The common geometric configurations of interchanges are 
trumpet, diamond, clover leaf, rotary and directional interchanges. Within 
each type of interchange, there can be several variations such as split 
diamond, partial clover leafs etc. depending on the ramp arrangements. 
7.2.3.4	Typical layouts of all these types are at Fig. 7.2
Fig.7.2a.  Typecal 3-leg Interchange
Fig.7.2b.  Diamond Interchange

7.2.3.5	 Details of interchanges, design considerations selection of 
interchanges, safety considerations etc. are given in IRC:92-2017 
“Guidelines for Design of Interchanges in Urban Areas” The present 
guidelines are applicable mainly for urban roads. But in some cases 
non-urban roads also have been included and guidelines may be 
followed.
7.3 
Road –Rail level crossing
7.3.1	 When railway line and road cross at same level, railway level 
crossing is provided across the road carriageway as a measure of safety. 
Road-rail level crossings are classified into five types (Special, A, B, 
C &D Classes) depending upon the importance of the road, volume 
of road traffic and number of trains passing per day, etc. Of these, 
first four types of Railway Level Crossings are for controlling road 
Fig. 7.2.f.  Types of Interchanges



======================================================================
PAGE 118 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
103
vehicular traffic, whereas, fifth classification is for control of cattle 
movement and pedestrian traffic. In actual practice, the classification 
is decided mutually by the Railway and Road Authorities. The angle 
of crossing between centre line of the road and that of rails should not 
ordinarily be sharper than 45 degree for vehicular traffic, whereas, for 
the cattle crossing and footpaths, the angle of crossing should be 90 
degrees.
7.3.2 Safety measures
Some safety measure on the approaches to Railway Level Crossing 
necessary for control of accidents are as given below:
	
i)	
Speed limit signs and other signs as per IRC:67 “Code 
of Practice for Road Signs” shall be installed at suitable 
locations on either approach;
	
ii)	
Rumble strips on both sides of Railway crossing should 
be provided.
	
iii)	
Flashing signals should be provided on both sides of the 
crossing, if required as per site considerations.
	
iv)	
Approaches to Railway Level crossing should be made 
“No Overtaking Zones” and necessary signs installed 
accordingly on either approach, and
	
v)	
Grade separations should be provided to replace the 
existing level crossings if the Train Vehicle Unit (TVU) 
i.e. the product of Average Daily Traffic (fast vehicles 
only) and the number of gate closures per day exceeds 
50,000 in the design year. However, for the new 
constructions, such as, realignments and bypasses grade 
separations should be provided if this figure exceeds 
25,000 in the design year.
For more details, IRC:39 “Standards for Road-Rail Level Crossings” 
is to be referred.



======================================================================
PAGE 119 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
104
However, as per policy decision of MORTH all at grade crossing on 
National Highways with Railways will be replaced by grade separated 
structures. 
7.4 
Road Signs
To promote road safety and efficiency by providing for the orderly 
movement of all road users on all types of roads, road signs are 
provided. Road signs notify road users of regulations and provide 
warning and guidance needed for safe, uniform and efficient operation. 
IRC:67 “Code of Practice for Road Signs” may be referred for details 
of different road signs, materials to be used etc. 
7.4.1 Classification of road signs
 
a) 
Mandatory/Regulatory
	
	
These inform the road users of law and regulations as 
per laws. Violation is a legal offence. These are circular 
in shape except STOP sign which is octagonal and 
triangular GIVEWAY or YIELD sign. They are with 
red circular ring which indicates prohibitory regulation 
and diagonal red bar prohibits the action or movement 
indicated by the black symbol.
 
b) 
Cautionary/Warning
	
	
Warn road users of the existence of certain hazardous 
conditions. These are triangular in shape with red border 
and black symbol in white background.
 
c) 
Informatory/Guide signs
	
	
As a general rule, there shall be four sizes of signs 
namely small, medium, normal and large. Sizes of signs 
also depend on type of sign. For expressways different 
bigger size of signs are to be used as the design speed is 
greater than other types of roads. The size of signs to be 
used depend on the category of signs and design speed 
of the road. These signs are rectangular in shape

7.4.3 Orientation of Signs
The signs shall normally be placed at right angles to the line of travel 
of approaching traffic except for signs related to parking which should 
be fixed at an angle 150 to the carriageway. 
7.4.4 Size and Colour
The Size of the sign are given in Table 7.2 and 7.3 below 
The scheme of colouring of signs shall be as per IRC:67. Signs shall 
be provided with retro-reflective sheeting and/or overlay film. The 
reverse side of the sign shall be painted grey.
Except in case of railway level crossing signs, the sign posts shall be 
painted in 250 m wide bands alternatively black and white. The lowest 
band next to the ground shall be in black.

Road Markings
7.5.1	 Road markings perform an important function of guiding and 
controlling traffic on a highway. The markings serve as a psychological 
barrier and thus helps to signify delineation of traffic path and its lateral 
clearance from traffic facilitating movement into safe location and in 
effect provide for an extension  of side walk/cycle track across the 
road way. Road marking, therefore, indispensable to ensure smooth 
and orderly flow of traffic and promoting road safety.
7.5.2 Road markings materials
The commonly used materials for road markings are



======================================================================
PAGE 128 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
113
	
a)	
Hot applied thermoplastic compound and
	
b)	
Solvent borne and water borne road marking paints 
Other specific material for rod making includes cold applied plastic 
and performed adhesive colour pattern for markings.
The specification of road marking material shall be as per Clause 803 
of MORTH Specifications of Road and Bridge Works. Retro reflection 
is accomplished in pavement marking through the use of glass beads, 
partially embedded on the surface of the marking as binder material 
and also spread externally during application time. The quality of 
glass beads plays in important role in retro reflectivity of pavement 
marking. The specification of glass beads shall be as per Clause 803 
of MORTH Specifications of Road and Bridge Works. 
7.5.3	 The general colour pattern followed for road markings are 
given below:-
 
1. 
White -	 The colour should be widely used for road 
markings because of the visibility and good contact. As 
per MORTH circular no. RW/NH-33044/105/2018-S&R 
(P&B) dated 07-01-2019 the colour of pavement marking 
on concrete roads shall also be white instead of yellow.
 
2. 
Yellow – To convey message in the form of longitudinal 
marking where it is not permitted to cross the markings. 
Also used for parking restrictions and to improve other 
traffic control.  
 
3. 
Blue – Blue colour should be used to indicate new and 
special markings which are not conventional and also 
public transportation including three wheelers, scooters, 
rickshaw and Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) corridor on 
urban street.
	
4.	
Green – The green colour should be deployed to 
distinguish the bicycle and non-motorized transport 
facilities provided on the road.

5. 
Red/Purple – Where multiple road users are sharing the 
road space on hazardous location,  the red colour marking 
is primarily used to help people to understand the danger.
7.5.4 Classification of Pavement Markings
Pavement markings are broadly classified into following seven 
categories based on the placement of markings with regard to vehicular 
movement and also based on the function of the markings.
	
i)	
Longitudinal Marking (LM)
	
ii)	
Transverse  Marking  (TM)
	
iii)	
Hazard Marking (HM)
	
iv)	
Block Marking (BM)
	
v)	
Arrow Marking (AM)
	
vi)	
Directional Marking (DM)
	
vii)	
Facility Marking (FM)
7.5.5	 These marking are used in combination for various cases of 
markings on the road for safe and orderly guidance of traffic. The 
details of marking in for different applications, road markings materials 
and general features etc. are given in IRC:35 “Code of Practice for 
Road Markings”
7.5.6	 Few typical cases of markings are given in Fig. 7.6 to 7.9

7.5.7 Road Studs
Retro-reflective studs are used to supplement longitudinal/transverse 
reflectorized markings which would improve visibility in night time 
in adverse weather conditions. Road studs are also used across the 



======================================================================
PAGE 131 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
116
carriageway to serve as speed arrestor coupled with eschewing warnings 
through creation of rumbling sensation to the user. Road studs shall be 
made of plastic material with reflectors for all type of roads.
7.5.7.1	 The studs with different colour of reflector such as white, red, 
yellow and green are used for highways.
	
a)	
White Colour – To indicate traffic lane line and centre 
of the carriageway
	
b)	
Red Colour – To indicate a line which should not be 
crossed and mainly to delineate the left hand edge of the 
carriageway.
	
c)	
Yellow Colour – To delineate the right hand edge of the 
carriageway (median side edge) in case of the multilane 
divided carriageway to indicate a line which should not 
be crossed. 
	
d)	
Green Colour – To indicate cross edge lines like lay-
byes and to show the boundary of acceleration or 
deceleration line on the left hand side of the carriageway 
in case of multi lane divided carriageways. 
Typical road marking are shown in Fig. 7.10 
7.5.7.2	 The details of road studs are given in IRC:35. The clause 804 
of Specifications of Road and Bridge Works of MORTH and ASTM D 
4280-04 shall be referred for technical specification of road studs. 
7.5.7.3 Solar powered road makers are to be used at locations like 
approach to road crash prone locations and highly hazardous locations 
like bridge, toll plaza, sharp curves, pedestrian crossings, lane transitions, 
speed humps, junctions, channelization, construction sites, rail road 
crossings, median opening, lane changing, accident prone locations.
7.5.7.4	The road markings provided in existing roads should be 
subjected to safety audit to ensure their uniformity.

7.6 
Traffic Safety Barriers.
7.6.1	 Traffic safety barriers also known as crash barriers are 
provided on high speed highways to prevent accidents when vehicles 
lose control and run off the road. Especially dangerous road sections 
with sharp curves, approaches to bridges with restricted roadway, 
high embankment, hazardous obstacles such as poles, trees and bridge 
structural elements. Experience has shown that if suitably designed 
and properly located, it is possible to redirect the vehicle nearly 
parallel to the direction of the barrier and can minimize the severity of 
the accident and reduce the damage of property.
7.6.2 Types of Traffic Safety Barriers.
	
a)	
There are two general types of traffic safety barriers 
namely Road Edge Barrier (also known as road side 
barriers) and Median barriers.
	
b)	
Depending upon their mode of performance traffic 
safety barriers can be classified generally as 
	
	
i)	
Flexible (e.g. Cable wire type barrier)
	
	
ii)	
Semi-rigid (e.g. Steel beam type barrier)
	
	
iii)	 Rigid (e.g. Concrete barrier)
7.6.3 Road Side Barrier
A road edge barrier also known as road side barrier, is a longitudinal 
system used to shield vehicles from hazards on the edge of the road 
and are generally provided at the following locations.
	
i)	
High Embankment with steep slopes
	
ii)	
Near road side obstacles
	
iii)	
Bridge rail ends
	
iv)	
At specific locations for ensuring safety of by standers, 
pedestrians and cyclists.
	
v)	
Dangerous ditches
	
vi)	
Steep grades
	
vii)	
Accident black spots

7.6.4	 Median Barriers
Median barriers are those that are provided in the medians of highways 
for protecting the traffic on both the carriageways. They are intended 
to prevent head on collision, especially on highways with narrow 
medians, caused by out of control vehicles jumping across the median. 
They also shield fixed objects on the median from traffic flow.
7.6.5	 The warrants for requirement of traffic safety barriers, details of 
different types of barriers, specification and maintenance for barriers 
are given in IRC:119 “Guidelines for Traffic Safety Barriers”.
7.6.6	 Figures relating to different types of barriers is given in Fig. 7.11

======================================================================
PAGE 135 of 310
======================================================================

7.6.7	 Raised kerbs or drains should not be provided between the 
carriageway and the barriers. These destabilize the vehicle balance 
and disturb its equilibrium before it strikes the barriers, thus defeating 
the essential purpose of safety and redirection of the impacting 
vehicles. It is a good practice to avoid kerbed and raised median in 
dual carriageway of highways.
7.6.8	 The metal safety barriers shall be compliant with test 
acceptance criteria of European EN13170-2 Standard or NCHRP 
350 for containment levels of N2, H1 and H2 or NCHRP 350 for 
containment levsl TL 3 and TL 4. The wire rope (cable) barriers shall 
be compliant with test acceptance criteria of European EN 1317-2 
Standard for Containment levels N2, H4 and H2. The concrete, metal 
and the wire rope (cable) used for the safety barriers shall comply 
with the requirements given in IRC:119. The manufacturers of the 
metal safety barriers and wire slope (cable) barriers shall provide 
all applicable crash test reports that confirm the barriers have passed 
the crash test conducted by an international accredited crash testing 
laboratory having all needed all the testing facilities. 
7.7 
Road Delineators
7.7.1	 The role of delineators is to provide visual assistance to drivers 
about alignment of the road ahead, especially at night. Delineators are 
particularly effective in case of complex locations involving changes in 
horizontal/vertical geometry and during severe weather conditions such 
as heavy rain, fog or snow. Reflectors are used on the delineators for better 
night visibility. Delineators are basically driving aids and should not be 
regarded as a substitute for warning signs, road markings or barriers for 
out of control vehicle. Delineators are classified under three types:
	
i)	
Roadway Indicators: These are intended to delineate the 
edges of the roadway so as to guide drivers about the 
alignment ahead, particularly where it might be confusing 
for some reason. As a general rule, delineators posts 
should be erected at the edge of usable shoulder, and in 
the case of kerbed sections at a distance of 0.6 m from 
the kerb face. On hill roads, these may be placed either 



======================================================================
PAGE 136 of 310
======================================================================

121
on the parapet or at the edge of the shoulder. The normal 
spacing between two successive indicators in a straight 
section shall be about 50-70 m. Roadway indicators 
have been shown in Fig.7.12.   Flexible Median Marker 
(FMM) should be used for improving median visibility 
during dark hour. Use of Median Marker provides safety 
against collision happening with medians during night 
time or severe weather. Typical application of FMM are 
shown in Fig. 7.13.

of FMM
	
ii)	
Hazard Markers: These are to define obstruction, like, 
guard-rails and abutments adjacent to the carriageway, 
for instance at culverts and bridges which are narrow 
than the roadway sideat approaches. Hazard markers 
are shown in Fig. 7.14.

7.7.2	 Details of material of delineators, spacing in different situations, 
installation and maintenance are given in IRC:79 “Recommended 
Practice for Road Delineators”. 
7.8 
Variable Message Signs
Variable Message Signs (VMS) messages are used to inform and direct 
motorists of variable situations in a consistent and orderly manner. The 
messages are for the purpose of traffic control management and timely 
traveler information. The information is most often displayed in real 
time and can be controlled either from a remote centralized location or 
locally at the site. They are commonly installed on full span overhead 
sign bridges, post mounted on roadway shoulders, overhead cantilever 
structures and portable types mounted on trailers/prime movers. 
Examples of traveler information provided through VMS include:
	
i)	
Travel time between known destinations
	
ii)	
Congestion conditions along a high speed corridors
	
iii)	
Construction site warning/information notices
	
iv)	
Special events notice and motorists instructions
	
v)	
Maintenance operations schedule
	
vi)	
Severe weather announcement
	
vii)	
Incident or accident notification
Generally, VMS system forms part of the Advanced Traffic Management 
System (ATMS), one of the major components of Intelligent Transport 
System (ITS).The integrated ATMS Software receives online data 
from Automatic Traffic Counter & Classifier (ATCC) metrological 
sensors, traffic control system,  CCTV, Video Incident Detection 
System (VIDS), Emergency Call Boxes (ECB), etc. After processing 
and analyzing the data information can be automatically shared with 



======================================================================
PAGE 139 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
124
road users through VMS, Internet, SMS, FM, radio etc. However, 
VMS can also be used independently for providing information to the 
road users effectively. In this case, the inputs to the VMS systems are 
using manual entry or pre-programmed messages through computers. 
IRC:SP:85 “Guidelines for Variable Message Signs” covers purpose 
of using VMS, warrants for VMS, message content of VMS, VMS 
for urban areas, portable VMS and design of VMS. The specifications 
for VMS are at clause 816.11 of MORTH Specifications for Road and 
Bridge Works.
7.9 
Traffic Management in Work Zones
7.9.1	 The road construction and maintenance activities are the 
integral part of road network development. The road works zones are 
areas of conflict between normal operating traffic, construction works, 
road building machineries and construction traffic. For construction 
of new road or new bypass the problem is not that acute except that 
care has to be taken to avoid and remove conflicts between workers 
and construction machineries and construction traffic. To ensure 
safety of all, there is a need to adopt an efficient and effective plan 
for management of traffic zones. Work Zone Traffic Management 
Plan (WTMPs) are required to meet the safety needs of regular traffic 
as well as works traffic, ensuring minimum disruption in access to 
properties and movement of pedestrians.
7.9.2	 The details of WTMPs are available in IRC:SP:55 “Guidelines 
on Traffic Management in Work Zones”. Some illustrations on traffic 
management practices are attached in Fig. 7.16,  Fig. 7.17, Fig. 7.18 
and Fig. 7.19.

Traffic Calming Measures
7.10.1	Vehicle speed is one of the critical factors associated with road 
accidents because higher speeds reduce the time available to avoid 
collisions and make impacts in collisions more severe. Research 
studies from around the world demonstrate conclusively that the 
frequency and severity of accidents usually reduce with reduction 
in average speed. The traffic claiming techniques have played an 
important role in enhancing better safety by ensuring lower driving 
speeds and smaller speed differences between different road users. 
Studies have shown that traffic calming can reduce accident level by 
up to 40 per cent.
7.10.2	The central theme of traffic calming is to reduce the adverse 
impact of motor vehicles on built-up areas both in urban roads and rural 
highways. The techniques usually involve reducing vehicle speeds, 
providing more space for pedestrians and cyclists and improving the 
local environment.
The classification of traffic calming techniques are as given in Fig 
7.20 below.

Traffic Calming Measures in Urban and Rural Areas”. 
7.10.3.4	Typical examples of traffic calming in different locations are 
illustrated in Fig. 7.21, , Fig. 7.22 & Fig. 7.23.
7.11 
Road Accident Recording 
7.11.1	Road accident data is the base measure of safety and without 
it, the scale and nature of road safety problems cannot be established 
with certainty. The existence of a reliable accident database is thus 
a crucial element in the management of road safety. The purpose of 
acquisition of accident data should be to acquire as much relevant 
knowledge as possible from the data to help to prevent accidents of 
similar nature from occurring in the future.
7.11.2	The best source of validated accident data will be the police 
force; either the police man attending the scene of an accident or 
the office at a police station who receives the report by the involved 
parties/witness.
7.11.3	The MORTH has prepared a new uniform accident recording 
format to be adopted by the police in all the State/UTs The copies of the 
Road Accident Recording Form is attached at Annex 7.1. In addition, 
there are 17 forms known as Reporting Format to be prepared by the 
State/UT Departments for reporting to MORTH. The copies of these 
forms may be downloaded from the site http://pib.nic.in/newsite.

Road Safety Audit
7.12.1	 Road Safety Audit is a formal systematic and detailed examination 
of a road project by an independent and qualified team of auditors that leads 
to a report of the potential safety concerns in the project. The outcome of 
road safety audit is a audit safety report that identifies road safety issues 
and makes recommendations to remove or reduce the impacts.
7.12.2	There are five stages of a road project at which road safety 
audit can be conducted namely stage 1: Planning/feasibility stage, 
stage 2: Detailed design stage, stage 3: Construction stage, stage 4: 
Pre opening stage, stage 5: Safety audit of existing roads.
7.12.3	Road safety audits may be commissioned only at selected 
stages according to the cost of the road project or the classification of 
the road. As a general rule audit (i) any road project on a high speed 
road and (ii) any road project experiencing high volume of traffic and 
vulnerable road users.
7.12.4	As a general rule, audit is to be done for any road project on a 
high speed road an any road project experiencing high volume of traffic 
and vulnerable road users. For any new project, audit is to be undertaken 
for all four stages i.e. stage 1 to stage 4. For National Highway and State 
Highways audit for stage 1 is optional and audit is to be undertaken 
for stage-2, stage-3 and stage 4. Audit at stage 5 is to be undertaken 
according to local policy and resources. As per MORTH Circular 
letter No.RW/NH-29011/11/2015-P&M (SCE) dated 04.07.2018, the 
Project Implementation Agencies concerned that DPR consultant gives 
a certificate in the DPR that they have addressed the safety related 
concerns with inputs from the Road Safety Expert and the IE/AE/SC 
issues and identical certificate for having taken care of the safety aspects 
while approving engineering designs. These road safety measures have 
to be carriedout for all new road projects of National Highways having 
length of 5 km or more at the stage of Detailed Project Report (DPR)/
Engineering Design. . 
7.12.5	The audit team of two persons shall conduct the safety 
audit. They should have qualification and experience in road 
safety engineering and have completed and approved road safety

audit training programme of at least two week duration and have 
demonstrated experience with the type of road project and the stage of 
audit and clearly have no previous involvement in planning or design 
of the road project. 	
7.12.6	The IRC:SP:88 “Manual on Road Safety Audit” is a 
comprehensive guidelines for conducting the Road Safety Audit. This 
manual contains an overview of road safety audit, the key steps for 
conducting a road safety audit, managing road safety audit practices 
for safer roads, safety audit case studies, reporting and road safety 
audit checklists. 
7.13. Equivalency Factors for Vehicle
7.13.1	The traffic on the road is composed of different types of vehicle, 
it is normal practice to convert the volume into equivalent Passenger 
Car Unit (PCU) by using equivalency factors given in Table 7.4

7.13.2 Capacity and Design Service Volume of Different Categories 
of Roads
Capacity of Road: The maximum hourly Volume (Vehicles per hour)  at 
which vehicle can reasonably by expected traverse a point or uniform 
section of a lane on road way during a given time period under the 
prevailing roadway, traffic and control conditions.
Design Service Volume: Maximum hourly volume at which vehicles can 
reasonably be expected to traverse a point or uniform section of a lane or 
road during a given time period under the prevailing roadway, traffic and 
control conditions while maintaining a designated Level of Service.
Level of Service (LOS): A qualitative measure describing operational 
conditions within a traffic stream and their perception by drivers/
passengers. There are six LOS recognized commonly designated from 
‘A’ to ‘F’ with LOS ‘A’ representing the best operating conditions i.e. 
free flow and LOS ‘F’ the worst i.e. forced on break down flow.

CHAPTER 8
STRUCTURES
8.1 
Culverts
Culvert is a cross drainage structures having a total length of 6 m 
or less between the inner face of the dirt walls or extreme vent way 
boundaries measured at right angles thereto. 
8.1.1	 The culverts can be of following types:
	
a)	
RCC hume pipes
	
b)	
RCC Slab on masonary/concrete abutment and piers
	
c)	
Stone slab on masonary/concrete abutment and piers
	
d)	
RCC box cell structures
	
e)	
RCC/masonary arches on masonary/concrete abutment 
and piers
Frequency of culverts varies depending on the region and terrain. The 
location, size and other details of such structure should be decided 
judiciously to cater for discharge and balancing requirements. 
Normally selection of site for culverts is guided by road alignment
General Arrangement Drawing (GAD) showing a typical box culvert 
is given in plate 8.1.

======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
140
8.1.2	 For design of culverts, following design data are to be collected
 
a)	
Catchment Area
	
	
A traverse should be made along the water shed when 
the catchment, as seen from the topo (G.T) sheet is 
less than 1.25 Sq.km. Larger catchments can be read 
from the 1 cm = 500 m topo maps of survey of India 
by marking the watershed in pencil and reading the 
included area by placing a piece of transparent square 
paper over it. 
 
b)	
Cross Sections
	
	
For a sizeable stream, at least three cross sections should 
be taken, namely one at selected site, one upstream 
and another downstream of the site. Approximate 
distances, upstream and downstream of the selected 
site of crossings at which cross sections should be 
taken will depend on catchment areas and are given in 
IRC:SP:13 “Guidelines for the Design of Small Bridges 
and Culverts” The scales of cross section for horizontal 
and vertical scale 1:1/1000 and 1:1/100 respectively.
 
c)	
Highest Flood Level 
	
	
The highest flood level should be ascertained by 
intelligent local observations, supplemented by local 
enquiry and marked on the cross sections. 	
 
d)	
Longitudinal Section
	
	
The longitudinal section should extend upstream and 
downstream of the proposed site for the distances upto 
the location of taking cross sections as mentioned 
above.



======================================================================
PAGE 156 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
141
 
e)	
Velocity Observation
	
	
Attempts should be made to observe the velocity 
during an actual flood. If that flood is smaller than 
the maximum flood, the observed velocity should be 
suitably increased.
	
f)	
Trial Pit Sections
	
	
The trial pit may be taken down roughly 2 to 3 m below 
the lowest bed level. Where the rock or some firm 
undisturbed soil stratum is not likely to be far below the 
alluvial stream, a trial pit should be dug down to such 
rock or firm soil. The trial pit sections should be plotted 
to show the kind of soil passed through it. 
In addition, site inspection of an existing road or railway culverts not 
very far away from the selected site, if any, will be provide useful 
information like marks indicating maximum flood level, the afflux, 
the tendency to scour, the probable maximum discharge, likelihood of 
collection of brush wood during flood and many other particulars. All 
these should be carefully recorded.
The details regarding collection of design data have been described in 
IRC:SP:13.
8.1.3	 Following are also to be considered while deciding on the size 
of the culverts
	
a)	
Peak flow and hydraulic requirements 
	
b)	
Ease of maintenance and desilting operation
	
c)	
permissible velocity for fish movement where the 
channel carries fish
	
d)	
movement of debris, gravels and boulders
8.1.3.1	The required size of the culvert is decided on the basis of 
hydrologic, hydraulic and structural analysis. The details regarding 
these are available in IRC:SP:13. However, the minimum size of the 
culvert is fixed on the basis of ease in maintenance.



======================================================================
PAGE 157 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
142
8.1.3.2	Generally, the alignment of road sections should govern the 
location, alignment and profile of culverts. Existing culverts deviating 
from general road profile should be provided with shock free curves. 
Some cases where the profile could be improved are illustrated in Fig. 
8.1.
8.1.4 Design
	
1.	
Culverts should be constructed simultaneously with 
earthwork to have smooth profile on the road and to 
avoid duplication of compaction of approaches
Fig 8.1 Some examples of satisfactory and unsatisfactory 
location, alignment and profile for culverts



======================================================================
PAGE 158 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
143
	
2.	
From the consideration of maintenance of culverts, it is 
desirable that span of culvert is kept minimum 2 m and 
height 1.5 m and diameter of pipe 1.2 m.
	
3.	
The cushion between the top of the pipe and road level 
shall not be less than 600 mm. Pipe culverts shall be 
of NP 4 type conforming to the requirement of IS:458. 
First class bedding consisting of compacted granular 
material can be used for height of fill upto 4 m. The 
bedding material shall be well graded sand or another 
granular material passing 5.6 mm sieve. The compacted 
thickness of granular material shall be a shown in the 
drawing and in no case it shall be less than 75 mm. For 
fill height of maximum 8 m concrete cradle bedding 
having  mix not leaner than M 15 shall be used. RCC 
pipe culverts with single row or upto six rows can 
be used as they are comparatively cheaper than slab 
culverts. However, due to short length of pipes as 
available, culverts for roads having more than 2 lane, 
box culverts are being used.
	
4.	
RCC slab culvert are to be adopted where the founding 
starta is rocky or of better bearing capacity. In case 
where adequate cushion is not available for location 
pipe culvert, RCC slab culvert is to be adopted. RCC 
slab culverts are also used for cattle crossing.
	
5.	
RCC box cell structure is preferred where bearing 
capacity of soil is low.
	
6.	
Balancing culverts are to be located at points on L 
section of the road where down gradient meet. There 
balancing culverts balance the discharge from both 
sides of road.
8.1.5	 C.D works in black cotton (BC) soils:  To safeguard the 
structure from the ill effects of the damaging nature of the soil, a sandy

media all around the foundation is to be provided. To improve the 
bearing capacity of BC soils a layer of stone metal/boulder with sand 
having thickness of about 450 mm to 600 mm can be provided.
8.1.6	 The structural details of different types of culvers are given in 
IRC:SP:13.
8.1.7	 The works of culverts are to be carried as per MORTH 
Specifications for Road and Bridge Works.
8.2	
Road Over Bridges (ROB)/ Road Under Bridges (RUB)/
Vehicular Under Pass (VUP)/Passenger Under Passes (PUP).
The location, size etc. have been discussed in previous Chapter 2.  The 
structural design of the major structures like ROB and RUB has been 
detailed in Pocket Book of Bridge Engineers. The small structures like 
VUP and PUP are to be designed as culverts and given in this chapter.

before hand in the event of occurrence of emergencies 
such as spillage of oil or bitumen or chemicals, fire.
9.3.  
Setting Out 
All construction should be with reference to the final centre line of the 
main location survey.
The centre line should be accurately referenced, every 50m interval 
in plain and rolling terrains, 20 m intervals in hilly terrains and at all 
curve points, by marker pegs and chainage boards set in or near the 
fence line. The schedule of reference dimensions should be prepared 
and marker pegs shall be maintained till the end of the work. 
Working bench marks tied with the reference bench mark, should be 
established at the rate of four numbers per km and also at or near 
all drainage structures, other bridge and underpasses. An up- to-date 
record of all bench marks should be maintained and the working bench 
marks should be checked frequently. 
On construction reaching the formation level stage, the centre line 
should again be set out and accurately referenced by marker pegs at 
the outer limits of the formation. Posts of timber or steel should be kept 
one metre from the formation edges showing the finished formation/
finished base course/finished road levels. It should be possible to 
stretch a thread across to verify the finished levels of various courses. 
All survey monuments, bench marks, beacons, etc. should be 
maintained accurately during the construction process. A survey file 
containing the setting out data for traverse points and levels shall be 
prepared and maintained during the construction process. 
Precision automatic levels, having a standard deviation of ± 2 mm per 
km and fitted with micrometer attachment shall be used for all double 
run leveling work. Setting out of the road alignment and measurement 
of angles shall be done by using Total Station with traversing target, 
having a accuracy of one second. Measurement of distances shall be 
done preferably using precision instruments, like, Distomat. 



======================================================================
PAGE 165 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
150
The work should conform to the clause 109 of MORTH Specifications 
for Road and Bridge Works. 
9.4. 
Clearing and Grubbing 
Demarcate the limits of clearing and grubbing as shown on the 
drawings. 
Mark the roadside trees, shrubs, buildings, utility lines, etc. which are 
not to be disturbed and ensure that the contractor provides suitable 
safeguards to protect these from injury or damage. 
Before start of work, examine the contractor’s work plan including 
the procedures to be followed for disposal of waste materials and the 
precautions proposed against soil erosion, air pollution and water 
pollution. 
All trees, stumps, etc. falling within excavation and fill lines should be 
cut to such depth below ground level that in no case these fall within 
500 mm of the subgrade. Also, all vegetation (roots, undergrowth grass, 
etc.) and other deleterious matters should be removed between fill lines. 
From embankment/cut areas, remove and store top soil for reapplication 
later.
Have the removed materials of value, suitably stacked for reuse or 
auctioning. 
In wooden areas, burning should not be permitted. 
Ensure that no hazard to the public is created by the contractor’s 
operations. 
Periodically observe the operations to ensure that damage to adjacent 
property is being prevented and that trees, utilities and structures 
which are to remain are being preserved. 
The work shall be carried out as per Clause 201 of MORTH 
Specifications for Road and Bridge Works.

9.5. 
Earthwork
9.5.1 Preliminaries: Review the project drawings, special provisions 
and specifications relating to earthwork prior to the commencement of 
work. 
Review soil survey report and borrow area charts. Where soil has to be 
borrowed from outside the road land boundaries, take action to obtain 
the necessary permits or for temporary acquisition of land.
Obtain detailed plans showing the design of shoring, bracing, sloping 
or other provisions made for safety of workers. Ensure that these 
satisfy the safety requirements. 
Discuss with the contractor his schedule of earthwork operations, 
sources of materials, the equipment he proposes to use, etc. Ensure 
that the plan of operations is in accordance with the requirement of 
the contract. 
9.5.2      Excavation for Roadway and Drainage
All materials in excavation are to be classified as one of following: soil, 
ordinary rock (not requiring blasting), hard rock (requiring blasting), 
hard rock (blasting prohibited) and marshy soil. This classification is 
based on the methods, tools and equipment required for excavation.
The area for the roadway and drainage excavation should be cleared 
and grabbed.
Set out the limits of excavation true to lines, curve, slopes and grades 
and sections as shown on the drawings. Periodicals checks are to be 
done on the bench marks and on the construction lines for accuracy.
The work shall be so done that the suitable materials available from 
excavation are satisfactorily utilized as deemed fit. All reasonable 
precautions are to be taken for protection and preservation of any or all 
existing trees, drains, sewers, sub-surface drains, pipes, conduits or any 
other structures which may be affected by construction operations. All 



======================================================================
PAGE 167 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
152
adequate precautions are to be taken to guard against soil erosion, water 
pollution etc. and appropriate drainage measures are also to be taken. 
If water is met with in the excavation, it shall be removed by suitable 
diversions, pumping or bailing out and the excavation is to be kept dry.
9.5.3 Preparation of cut formation
Cut formation requires very close inspection for the reason that it is 
for the first time that the material gets exposed.
Check for suitability of the natural material. Some shales may look 
hard when dry but get slushy in presence of water. If such unsuitable 
materials are met with, have these removed to a depth of at least 0.5 m 
or as otherwise specified and replaced with suitable material. 
If density of sub-grade is lower than specified density, it shall be 
loosened to a depth of 500 mm, recompacted in layers not less than 97 
per cent of the maximum laboratory dry desnity as per clause 9.5.6.
In rock formation all dish shaped cavities left out by blasting should 
be cut out at edges to facilitate drainage. Low areas should be filled up 
with sub-base material and properly compacted. 
Any seepage should be intercepted and properly drained.
Earth work for excavation shall be carried out as per clause 301 of 
MORTH Specifications for Road and Bridge works.
9.5.4 Blasting Operations
Followings are to be observed:
	
i)	
All the statutory laws, regulations, rules, etc. pertaining 
to the acquisition, transportation, storage, handling and 
use of explosives shall be strictly followed.

iii)	
Normally, open foundations shall be laid dry. Dewatering 
by bailing, pumping, diversion channels and other 
necessary works should be carried out when seepage 
flow is met with. Where cofferdams are required, these 
are to be safely designed and made watertight and 
should be carried to adequate depth and heights.
	
iv)	
The discharged water should not cause damage to the 
works, crops or any other property.
	
v)	
Backfilling shall be done with approved material after

mechanical tamper, rammer plate vibrator etc. 
	
vi)	
The work shall be carried out as per Clause 304 of 
MORTH Specifications for Road and Bridge Works.
9.5.6 Embankment Construction 
This work also involves construction of subgrades, earthen shoulders 
and miscellaneous backfills in addition to the construction of 
embankment for accommodating the roadway.
The materials used for this work shall be soil, moorum, gravel, 
reclaimed material for pavement, fly ash, pond ash, a mixture of these. 
Materials from swamps, marshes and bogs, peat, logs stump, perishable 
material, any soil classified as OL, OI, OH or Pt, material susceptible 
to spontaneous combustion, materials in frozen condition, clay with 
liquid limit exceeding 50 and plasticity index exceeding 25 and materials 
with salts resulting in leaching in the embankment should be considered 
unsuitable material for embankment. Ordinarily, only the materials 
satisfying the density requirements as given in the Table 9.1 below shall 
be used for embankment. This table will not be applicable for light weight 
fill material e.g cinder, fly ash etc.  The material to be used in the subgrade

trees leaning downhill indicating of seepage, the surface soil; twisted trees 
or bared surface in otherwise timbered area indicating landslide. If such 
features are observed, consult the designer if the design had taken these 
into account. If not, seek specific instructions for remedial measures.
Where necessary, the original ground level shall be levelled to facilitate 
placement of first layer of embankment, scarified, mixed with water 
and then compacted by rolling. Ensure that any portion of the original 
ground falling within 0.5 m from subgrade level is compacted at least 
to 97 per cent or Proctor density determined as per IS:2720 (Part 8).
Plan for proper sequence of delivering materials to embankment site 
so that double handling is avoided.
Permit delivery of embankment material to site only if the necessary 
rollers in working condition are present at site.
Have a special check on the following points during the construction 
operations :

than 1 m, allow the existing road surface to stay and 
shall be roughned. In all cases, it is to be ensured that 
500 mm portion below the new subgrade is compacted 
to the desired density.
 
c) 
Embankment around structures:
	
	
i)	
Suspend filling around structures upto a distance of 
twice the height of the embankment. Permit filling 
only after the concrete/masonry has been in position 
for at least 14 days. Bring up the embankment in 
equal horizontal layers simultaneously on each 
side to avoid undue thrust and unequal pressure.

Where the WBM is to be laid directly over the subgrade, a 25 mm 
course of screenings (Grading B) or coarse sand - "inverted choke" - 
should be spread on the prepared subgrade before the application of 
aggregate is taken up. In case of fine sand or silty or clayey subgrade 
it is advisable to lay 100 mm thick insulating layer of screening or 
coarse sand on the top of fine grained soil. A preferred alternative to 
inverted choke is the use of appropriate geosynthetics mesh.
Arrangements for lateral confinement of aggregates must be provided. 
This can conveniently be done by raising the shoulders in stages equal 
in thickness to each layer of WBM.
The construction operation of WBM shall be carried as per clause 404 
of MORTH Specifications for Road and Bridge Works.
No traffic should be allowed on the road until the macadam has set. 
The compacted WBM course should be allowed to completely dry and 
set before the next pavment course is laid over it. WBM works should 
not be  carried out when atmospheric temperature is less then 10οC in 
shade.
9.6.5. Crushed cement concrete sub-base: This work consists 
of breaking and crushing the damaged cement concrete slabs and 
recompacting the same as sub-base in one or more layers. The 
thickness of each layer shall not exceed 75 mm compacted thickness. 
It shall confirm to one of the grading’s given inTable 9.6
Coarse aggregate shall be broken cement concrete slabs crushed to a 
size not exceeding 75 mm and conforming in the specified grading.
The crushed material shall be spread on the prepared subgrade with the 
help of a motor grader with three wheeled power rollers of 80 to 100 
kN capacity or tandem or vibrating rollers of 80 – 100 kN static weight.
The work shall be carried out as per clause 405 of MORTH Specifications 
for Road and Bridge Works.
9.6.6. Wet mix macadam (WMM): The work shall consist of 
laying and compacting clean, crushed, graded aggregate and granular 
material premixed with water, to a dense mass on a prepared subgrade/
sub base/base or existing pavement.

should be permitted.
The mix should be spread uniformly and evenly in required quantities 
on the prepared subgrade/sub-base/base by a self-propelled paver 
finisher. In no case should the mix be dumped in heaps on the area. In 
exceptional cases, if permitted, motor grader may be used.
After the mix has been laid to the required thickness, the rolling shall be 
uniformly compacted by a suitable roller. 80-100 kN smooth wheeled 
roller may be used for a compacted thickness of not exceeding 100 
mm. For a compacted single layer upto 200 mm the compaction shall 
be done with a vibratory roller of minimum static weight of 80-100 
kN.
The roller speed should not exceed 5 km/hour.
Rolling should continue till density achieved is at least 98 per cent 
maximum dry density for the material as per IS:2720 (Part 8).
When irregularity develop during rolling which exceeds 12 mm with 
a 3 m straight edge, the surface should be loosened and premixed 
material added or removed as required before rolling again so as to 
achieve uniform surface.
It is not advisable to lay the wet mix macadam during rains and the 
tempo of work suffers during rains.
After final compaction of WMM course, the road shall be allowed to 
dry for 24 hours.

9.7.13.	Recycling of bituminous pavement
1. 
Scope: This work covers the recycling of existing bituminous 
pavement materials to upgrade an existing bituminous pavement 
which has served its initially intended purpose. Recycling process 
can be categorized into in-situ recycling (where processing takes 
place on site), and central plant recycling (where reclaimed material 
is processed off site). The process can be further sub-divided into hot 
and cold process. The details as below are for hot process.
2.	
Reclaimed bituminous material may be used in the production 
of dense graded bituminous base and binder course material, subject 
to the requirements of paras 3 to 9 below and subject to the satisfactory 
completion of full trial investigations in respect of all related materials.



======================================================================
PAGE 210 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
195
For estimating purpose, a maximum not greater than 60 per cent  of 
reclaimed bituminous material shall be assumed.
3. 
Materials for recycled pavement: The recycled materials shall 
be a blend of reclaimed and new materials proportioned to achieve 
a paving mixture with the specified engineering properties. The 
reclaimed materials shall be tested and evaluated to find the optimum 
blend meeting the mixture requirements. Such testing and evaluation 
shall be carried out on representative samples, either cores sampled 
from the carriageway or samples taken from stockpiles in accordance 
with current practice. The sampling frequency should be sufficient 
to determine how consistent the reclaimed material is and to provide 
representative samples for composition analysis and measurement of 
properties of recovered binder. As an absolute minimum, one sample 
to represent 500 m of two lane carriageway shall be taken.
4. 
Bitumen extraction: The procedure described in ASTM 
D-2172 shall be used to quantitatively separate aggregates and bitumen 
from any representative sample of reclaimed bituminous pavement.
5. 
 Aggregate evaluation: Mechanical sieve analysis (IS:2386, 
Part 1, wet sieving method) shall be performed on the aggregate 
portion of the reclaimed bituminous pavement sample to determine 
the grading. It is essential that the reclaimed materials to be recycled 
are consistent, as variable materials will cause problems with the 
control of quality and impede the efficiency of the recycling operation. 
Suitable sources of consistent material of sufficient quantity, either in 
existing pavements, from stockpiled of known origin or from another 
suitable source shall be identified, before a decision can be made on 
the optimum percentage of reclaimed material.
After selecting the proportion of reclaimed material to be recycled, 
the grading of the mixture may need adjustment, to meet specification 
requirements, by the addition of selected aggregate sizes.
6. 
Evaluation of bitumen: When the amount of reclaimed 
bituminous materials to be used in the mixture exceeds 10 per cent, 



======================================================================
PAGE 211 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
196
the penetration value of the recovered binder from the reclaimed 
bituminous material, before mixing, shall exceed 15 pen, after 
recovery of binder in accordance with requirements of BS 2000 : (Part 
397), when tested in accordance with IS:1203. Provided the above 
requirement is met, hardening of the old binder, during the original 
mixing process or through ageing, can be compensated for by adding 
a softer bitumen, to obtain the appropriate final grade of binder.
The determination of the type and amount of binder required to be 
added in the final mix is essentially a trial and error procedure.
After mixing with recycled materials, the binder recovered from the 
mixture shall have a recovered penetration value not less than the 
value specified in Table 9.37.

Rejuvenators: The use of rejuvenators, and a test to 
measure their effectiveness, shall be as per para 519.6.3 of MORTH 
Specifications for Road and Bridge Works. 
8. 
Untreated aggregate: If necessary, fresh untreated aggregate 
shall be added to the reclaimed bituminous pavement to produce a 
mix with the desired grading. The aggregate shall be checked for 
quality requirements in accordance with specified grading of Dense 
Bituminous Macadam. Reclaimed aggregate, if any, or any aggregate 
normally used for the desired bituminous mixture, or both, may be 
used for this purpose.
9. 
Combined aggregate grading: The blend of reclaimed and 
new aggregate shall meet the grading criteria specified in the relevant 



======================================================================
PAGE 212 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
197
parts of Clause 505 of  MORTH Specifications for Road and Bridge 
Works as appropriate. The blend of aggregates shall be checked for 
resistance to stripping as specified in for the specification of DBM. 
10. 
Mixture design: The combine aggregate grading and binder 
content shall comply with the relevant tables in Clauses 505 of 
MORTH Specifications for Road and Bridge Works. For dense 
bituminous macadam the mixture design shall also comply with the 
requirements for the DBM.
11. 
Reclaiming old pavement materials: The removal of 
pavement materials to the required depth shall be accomplished either 
at ambient temperature (cold process) or at an elevated temperature 
(hot process), as approved by the Engineer. For details, Clause 519 
of the MORTH Specifications for Road and Bridge Works may be 
referred.
12. 
Mixture design and construction operations should conform 
to Clause 519 of the MORTH Specifications for Road and Bridge 
Works.
9.7.14. Fog spray: Fog Spray is a very light application of low

9.7.21 Warm Mix Asphalt
The basic principle of this technology is that by adding certain 
additives at the final stages of the mix production, the coating of the 
aggregates by the binder is greatly enhanced and can be achieved at 
a considerable less temperature (typically 300C less) compared to a 
sufficiently high temperature to make it fluid enough to surround the 
aggregates and coat their surfaces. In hot mix processes, it is viscosity 
of bitumen alone, which is less at higher temperature that plays the 
main role in coating of aggregates. In warm  mix technology this 
can be achieved in three different ways by increasing the volume of 
bitumen, by making the bitumen less viscous,  by reducing the surface 
tension at aggregate bitumen interface etc.
A range of warm mix technologies have potential for use in bituminous 
construction like Dense Bituminous Macadam (DBM), Bituminous 
Concrete (BC) and Recycled Asphalt Pavement. 
The Warm-Mix Technology uses a variety of patented products, as 
additives, which come in different forms such as solid, liquid and 
powder and use different processes for administering the additives 
and mixing. 
Further details are available in IRC:SP:101 “Interim Guidelines for 
Warm Mix Asphalt”

Fibre may be used subject to the provision in the design to reduce 
shrinkage cracking and improve post-cracking residual strength. The 
fibres may be steel fibre as per IRC:SP46 or polymeric synthetic fiber. 
Types of Joints
There are four types of joints These are
	
i)	
Expansion Joint: Expansion joint provides the space into 
which pavement can expand thus relieving compressive 
stresses due to expansion and inhibiting any tendency 
towards buckling of concrete slabs.
	
ii)	
Contraction Joint: Contraction joint relieves tensile stresses 
in the concrete and prevents formation of irregular cracks 
due to restraint in free contraction of concrete. Contraction 
joints also relieve stresses due to warping.
	
iii)	
Longitudinal joint: Longitudinal joint relieves stresses 
due to warping. These are commonly used for dividing 
the pavement into lanes when width of the slab becomes 
more than 4.5 m.
	
iv)	
Construction joint: Construction joints are provided 
whenever day’s construction operations starts and stops/
ends. These are full depth joints construction should be 
so planned that day’s construction activity may end at 
the location of regular contraction joint. It may also be 
provided where paving stops for more than half an hour 
due to stoppage of work.
Depending on the locations, the joints can also be classified as 
Transverse joints and Longitudinal joints. Transverse joints can be 
expansion, contraction or construction joints and shall be placed across 
the direction of traffic direction. These shall make a right angle with 
the centre line of the pavement. This joint shall be continuous from 
edge to edge of the pavement through all lanes constructed at the same

212
time or different times. The maximum spacing of transverse joint shall 
be 4.5 m. Dowel bars as per dimensions, locations and spacing are 
required at expansion joints to transfer wheel loads to the adjacent 
slab. For slabs of thickness less than 200 mm dowel bars need not be 
provided.
The details of different types of joints and their constructions have 
been given in IRC:15 “Code of Practice for Construction of Jointed 
Plain Concrete Pavements”.
The proportioning of concrete and mix design shall be done as per 
IRC:44 “Guidelines for Cement Concrete Mix Design for Pavements”.
The batching and mixing plant should include minimum four bins, 
weighing hoppers with automatic weighing devices using load cells 
and scales for the fine aggregate and for each size of coarse aggregate. 
More bins amy be required to handle mineral admixtures like fly ash, 
GBFS and also different types of sands like fine, coarse and crushed 
etc. If cement is used in bulk, a separate scale for cement should be 
included.
The weighing hopper should be properly sealed and vented to preclude 
dust during operation. Approved safety devices shall be provided 
and maintained for the protection of all personnel engaged in plant 
operation, inspection and testing.
Each stationary mixer should be equipped with an approved timing 
device, capable of making audible warning signal, which will 
automatically lock the discharge lever when the drum has been 
charged and release it at the end of the mixing period
The mixer should be cleaned at suitable intervals. The pickup and 
throw-over blades in the drums should be repaired or replaced when 
they are worn down 20 mm or more.
Batching plant should be calibrated in the beginning and thereafter at 
suitable intervals not exceeding one month.

Mixers should be of pan type, reversible type with single or twin shaft 
or any other mixer capable of combining the aggregates, cement and 
water into a thoroughly mixed and uniform mass within specific mixing 
period and discharging the mixture without segregation. The mixing 
of each batch will continue for 60 seconds after all the materials are 
discharged into the mixer or as recommended by the manufacturers of 
the plant.
The design features of batching plant should be such that shifting 
operations should not take very long time.
The concrete should be placed with an approved fixed form or slip form 
paver with independent units designed to (i) spread (ii) consolidate 
from the mould, screed and float-finsih, and (iii) texture and cure the 
freshly placed concrete in one complete pass of the machine in such 
a manner that a minimum of hand finishing will be necessary and so 
as to provide a dense and homogeneous pavement in conformity with 
the design and specifications. The paver should be equipped with 
electronic sensors to pave the slab to the required thickness, camber, 
grade and alignment in the case of slip form pavers. Vibrators should 
operate at a frequency of 8000 to 10000 HZ at a paving speed of 0.8 
to 1.0 m/minutes. No concreting should be done when the concrete 
temperature is above 300c.
Freshly mixed concrete from the central batching and mixing plant 
shall be transported to the paver site by means of truck/tippers  of 
sufficient capacity in adequate numbers. Tarapauline covers shall be 
used for protection of concrete against the weather. The trucks/tippers 
should be capable of maintaining the mixed concrete in a homogeneous 
state and discharging the same without segregation and loss of cement 
slurry. The feeding to the paver is to be regulated in such a way that 
the paving is done in an uninterrupted manner with a uniform speed 
throughout the day’s work.  The trial length of the concrete pavement 
shall be constructed at least one month in advance of the proposed 
start of concrete paving work. The trial length shall be constructed 
away from the carriageway but with at least a sub-base layer stipulated

below it. Prior to the construction of the trial length, a detailed method 
statement shall be submitted giving description of proposed materials, 
plants and equipments to be used in the constructions. The trial length 
of slab shall be at least 60 m for mechanized construction and 30 m for 
semi-mechanized construction. Trial lengths shall be constructed in 
two equal parts over a period comprising at least part of two separate 
working days. Transverse joints and longitudinal joints with the 
required dowel bars and tie bars shall be constructed and assessed in 
the trial length. 
The details of materials, tools, plants and equipment, construction 
methodology and quality control are given in IRC:15.
9.10 
Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavement (CRCP)
Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavement (CRCP) is intended 
for roads carrying very high volume of commercial traffic and where 
closing road often for maintenance is difficult.  Unlike the jointed plain 
cement concrete pavement  no transverse joints are provided in CRCP 
but longitudinal joints are necessary if the carriageway width is more 
than a lane width. Longitudinal steel is provided in CRCP primarily to 
control transverse cracks which appear due to shrinkage taking place 
in fresh concrete and also hold them together. This pavement is similar 
to jointed reinforced concrete pavement except that steel runs through 
the pavement continuously. 
For design of pavement thickness, IRC:58 can be adopted. An extra 
thickness of 10-15 mm may be provided to for compensating the wear 
and tear and also depth of texture. Thickness in the range of 250 mm to 
300 mm is generally found to be satisfactory depending upon present 
traffic volume. Longitudinal steel percentage of 0.65 to 0.8 percent of 
pavement cross section is found to result in acceptable crack spacing 
and width as per CRSI FHWA, USA. The steel bars used are normally 
of 16 mm to 20 mm diameter and are grade Fe 415. In India TMT bars 
of Fe-500 conforming to IS:1786 can readily be used.

The construction of CRCP can be done as detailed out in IRC:15. The 
paving can be done using either slip form of fixed form paver. For 
further details IRC:118 “Guidelines for Design and Construction of 
Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavement (CRCP)” may be referred.
9.11 
Fibre Reinforced Concrete Pavement (FRCP)
Initially fibres were used in concrete as secondary reinforcement 
or for crack control in less critical elements. Now Fibre Reinforced 
Concrete as the main (structural) reinforcement in slab on grade, 
industrial floors, pavements and as the structural base. These can also 
be used in sub bases for pavements or cement treated sub bases which 
are susceptible to shrinkage cracking. In general fibre concrete can be 
used in all applications where plain concrete can be used. FRC gives 
improved impact resistance and flexural fatigue endurance. Structural 
FRC can be usefully deployed in the following areas
	
i)	
Concrete Pavements (PQC/Overlays, thin and Ultra-
thin whitetopping) for roads, runways, bridge.
	
ii)	
Overlays for rehabilitation or strengthening of roads, 
runway, bridge decks.
	
iii)	
Thin or ultrathin overlays where overhead clearance is 
critical.
	
iv)	
Rotaries, intersections and locations where odd shapes 
of pavements are required.
	
v)	
Toll Plaza with only polymeric fibres or in combination 
with steel fibres.
FRC pavement can be opened to traffic earlier if the flexural strength of 
concrete of about half the specified value can be achieved at an age of 1 to 
3 days only, by choosing an appropriate mix proportion and fibre content.
Fibres may be of steel fibres or polymeric fibres. Steel fibres should 
have an ultimate strength of at least 800 MPa. Steel Fibres can be

straight or deformed. Polymeric fibres with low elastic modulus which 
are monofilament or fibrillated form varying in length from about 
12 mm to 40 mm. These fibers are normally used to control plastic 
shrinkage cracking. Macro polymeric fibers in 30 to 60 mm length 
of higher elastic modulus can increase the toughness and strength 
capacity of the FRC pavement. Micro fibres are in 12 mm to 40 mm 
length and  have diameter less than 0.2 mm.
Maximum size of aggregate shall depend upon the thickness of 
pavement and the average spacing of well dispersed fibres in concrete. 
For most application maximum size of aggregates could be 20 mm.
Table 9.45 shows range of proportions for FRC for pavement 
application. This table is guidance for initial trial mix. The final mix 
proportion after successful trials may differ from the guidance in the

White topping
White topping is defined as a Portland Cement Conrete (PCC) 
overlay constructed on the top of an existing bituminous pavement. 
White topping is thus PCC resurfacing (Overlay) as rehabilitation or 
structural strengthening on bituminous pavement. The PCC overlay 
may or may not be bonded to the layer below. A PCC overlay is 
commonly applied where rutting of bituminous pavements is a 
recurring problem. Concrete overlays offer the potential for extended 
service life, increased structural and functional capacity, reduced 
maintenance requirements and lower life-cycle costs when compared 
with bituminous overlay alternative.
White topping is classified into three types. These are i) Conventional 
White Topping, ii) Thin White topping and iii) Ultra-thin White 
Topping.
This is based on the degree of bonding between the under laying 
bituminous layer with PCC overlay and the thickness of the overlay.
Conventional White topping – It consists of a PCC overlay of 
thickness 200 mm or more which is designed and constructed without 
consideration of any bond between the concrete overlay and underlying 
bituminous layer. Conventional white topping is designed and 
constructed like new rigid pavement without assuring any composite 
action. The existing bituminous surface is treated as sub base like Dry 
Lean Concrete (DLC). 
Thin White Topping (TWT) – PCC overlay of thickness greater 
than 100 mm and less than 200 mm is classified as TWT. The bond 
between the overlaid PCC and underlying bituminous layer is often a 
consideration but it is not mandatory and maybe ignored in the design. 
High strength concrete with fibres is commonly used. Joints are at 
shorter spacing of 0.6 m to 1.25 m.
Ultra-Thin White Topping (UTWT) – PCC overlay of thickness 
equal to or less than 100 mm is classified as UTWT. In this case bonding 



======================================================================

218
between underlying bituminous layer and PCC layer is mandatory. 
Milling the existing bituminous surface to an average depth of 25 mm 
is normally used to provide the bonding at the interface of the existing 
bituminous surface and PCC overlay. High strength concrete with fires 
is normally provided with closely spaced joints at an interval of 0.6 
to 1.25 m. 
The details of materials to be used, mix proportioning and strength of 
concrete and construction methodology for different types of white 
topping are given in IRC:SP:76 “Guidelines for Conventional and 
Thin White Topping”
9.13 
Geo-synthetics
Geosynthetic is a general classification for all synthetic materials 
used in geotechnical engineering application. It includes geotextiles, 
geogrids, geostrips, geomembranes, geonets, geocomposites, geocells, 
geosynthetic mats, paving fabric and glass grid etc. Geofabrics made 
from natural fibres such as jute and coir are classified as natural 
geotextiles and may also be used in different geotechnical engineering 
applications.
Geotextile – Geotextile fabric shall be a woven, non-woven or knitted 
fabric consisting of long chain polymetric filaments or yarns such as 
polypropylene, polyethylene or polyester or any combination thereof. 
There are several application areas for geotextiles requiring specific 
functions namely separation, filtration, drainage, reinforcement or a 
combination thereof.
Geogrids – A deformed or non-deformed net like polymeric material 
used with foundation, soil, rock, earth or any other geotechnical 
engineering related material. Geogrids have relatively high strength, 
high modulus and low creep sensitive polymers with appertures 
varying from 10 to100 mm in size or more. Geogrids can be of uniaxial 
grid, biaxial grid or three dimensional grids and the openings holes 
in geogrids are either elongated ellipse, near squares with rounded 
corners, squares or rectangles. Geogrids are used as reinforcement

in pavements and reinforced soil slope. Geostrip is another form of 
geogrid which is used in reinforced soil structure. 
Geomembranes – An essentially impermeable membrane (linear 
or barrier) used with foundation, soil, rock, earth or in any other 
geotechnical application used to control fluid migration. 
Geomembranes are made from PVC or polyethylene sheets which 
are duly protected from ultraviolet exposure by carbon black or any 
antioxidant and thermal stabilizers. These are used as capillary cut off 
in roads in water logged areas. 
Geonets – Geonets are used in combination with other types of 
geosynthetics. These are usually formed by continuous polymeric ribs 
at acute angle to one another.
Geocomposite – A manufactured material, which could be a 
combination of any two or more synthetic materials, like geotextile, 
geogrids, geo-nets and geomembrane etc. Prefabricate Vertical 
Drains (PVD)/Band Drains and Fin Drains come under category of 
geocomposites. 
Geocells– It is a three dimensional structure with inter-connected 
cells. The geocells are made of polyester/polypropylene/high density 
polyethylene stabilized with carbon black and may be used in erosion 
control of slopes.
Geosynthetic mats: These are two dimensional or three dimensional 
mats with specified thickness, made of multi-filaments with apertures 
to allow vegetation growth for erosion control application. These are 
used for erosion protection of slopes.
Geospacer: Geospacer is a three dimensional synthetic extruded 
from polymeric material such as HDPE. It provides separation and 
a void between layers to provide in plane drainage. The material is 
UV Stabilized with carbon black. Geonets are often laminated with 
geotextiles on one or both sides and are referred as drainage material 
and increasingly used to replace traditional gravel drainage layers.

Paving Grid/Glass-Fibre Grid/Asphalt-Interlayer Composites 
(AIC)/Composite Paving Grid : 
Asphalt Reinforement : These are products for strengthening of 
asphaltic layer for pavement. Paving fabric is made from the fibres with 
non-weaving process (needle punch and heat bonded) and applied by 
providing tack coat with asphaltic layer. The Paving Grid/Glass Fibre 
grid shall be manufactured from a glass fibre roving or polymeric grid 
pattern, resistant to chemical attack, mildew and rot. A grid combined 
with a paving fabric called a composite. AIC is made from non-woven 
geotextile with fibre glass rovings, will provide dual functions.  
Use of Geosynthetics: 
In a given application, a geosynthetic can perform one or several 
functions to improve the mechanical and/or hydraulic behavior of the 
structure in which it is incorporated. The basic functions performed by 
a geosynthetic are as follows:
1.	
Separtion/Filtration
2.	
Reinforcement
3.	
Drainage
4.	
Moisture Barrier
5.

agencies and State government have to use geosynthetics in a 
bigger way as per the existing IRC Codes/Guidelines and MORTH 
Specifications and Guidelines. 
Natural Geotextiles
These geotextiles are made of natural fibres like jute or coir. The 
blankets/mats/mesh made of these fibres are sometimes further 
reinforced with polymeric nettings to enhance its tensile strength and 
for holding the fibres intact. These fabrics have excellent drapability 
and aid in quick growth of vegetation and are used for erosion control. 
Use of Natural Geotextiles – Natural geotextile which is made of 
natural fibres like jute or coir may be used for control of erosion. 
Natural geotextile shall be used to control surface erosion of top cover 
soil on cut or fill slopes to facilitate vegetation to grow. The natural

Step 1:	 Excavation of initial cut of 1.0 m to 2.0 m depending upon the 
capacity of in-situ soil to stand unsupported for about 12-24 
hrs;
Step 2:	 Drilling hole for nail;
Step 3:		 Installation of nails followed by grouting and placing of 
drainage strip;
Step 4:	 Placing of construction facing and installation of bearing 
plates;
Step 5:	 Repetition of process till final level is reached, and
Step 6:	Placing of final facing
9.15.7	Other geotechnical aspects, design considerations, drainage 
measures, corrosion protection, different tests are detailed in Clause 
3200 of MORTH Specifications for Road and Bridge Works.
9.16. Special Measures to Hilly Areas
9.16.1. The problem: Some of the important special problems arising 
in the construction of roads in hilly areas are:
	
i)	
Road construction will invariably involve cutting which 
will disturb the natural inclination of the soil to create 
conditions for triggering landslides.



======================================================================
PAGE 243 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
228
	
ii)	
Bared and steep cut slopes are conducive to serious 
erosion.
	
iii)	
Surface run-off earlier draining along the natural hill 
slopes will be directly discharging into the roadway 
unless intercepted. Another problem is safe disposal of 
concentrated flows from cross drainage structures on 
the valley side. 
	
iv)	
The cut formation will be exposed for the first time, and 
may bringforth several features, 	 such 
as, 
seepage 
flow, presence of poor unsuitable soils and shales, etc. 
	
v)	
The cut portions will be in the heaving cycle while the 
adjoining fillings will be in the consolidation cycle. 
Unless special care is taken, this can cause serious 
unequal settlements. 
9.16.2.	Remedial measures : For combating these problems squarely, 
several measures are warranted right from the stage of planning. Some 
of the important measures in this regard are :
	
i)	
Roads should be located through geologically stable 
strata. 
	
ii)	
Avoid large-scale cutting and filling, and follow the 
level of the land as far as possible. When in cutting, 
adopt half-cut and half-fill type of cross-section which 
involves least disturbance to the natural ground. 
	
iii)	
Align the roads away from streams and torrents and 
potential landslide/erosion prone areas. 
	
iv)	
Provide catchwater and interceptor drains. After 
cutting has been made, look for seepage flows and take 
measures to intercept these. 
	
v)	
Locate and align culverts in such a way that severe 
erosion at outlets and siltation at inlets are avoided. 
Take necessary precautions/safeguards to ensure safe 
disposal of water discharged into the valley side. 



======================================================================
PAGE 244 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
229
	
vi)	
Do not push surplus excavated materials down the 
valley, but have these dumped in low areas where these 
cannot get easily washed away. Cut slopes should be 
stable for the strata cut, and where necessary, provide 
suitable breast walls, pitching, etc.
	
vii)	
Where erosion is likely to be a problem, clearing 
and grubbing operations should be so scheduled and 
performed that grading operations and permanent 
erosion control features can follow immediately 
thereafter. Otherwise, provide temporary erosion control 
measures between successive construction stages - see 
Clause 306.3 of MORTH Specifications for Road and 
Bridge Works.
	
viii)	
Provide all bared surfaces with vegetative cover. Also, 
provide for strip forests for a minimum distance of 30 m 
on either -side of the road.
	
ix)	
Consult officers of Forest/Geological Deptts., right from 
the stages of survey and investigations. For any seriously 
problematic areas, consult specialist organisations for 
appropriate solutions.
	
x)	
Clause 306 of MORTH Specifications for Road and 
Bridge works may be referred for further details.
9.17. Quality Control for Road Works
It is the prime responsibility of the Engineer-in-charge to ensure that the 
work performed and all the materials incorporated in the work conform 
to the specification requirements. Objective tests for checking the 
quality of materials are available, but he should not wait till materials 
are delivered at site. Some of the actions he could take are :
	
i)	
Obtain the test certificates of manufactured materials 
from the sources from where these are to be procured.
	
ii)	
For manufactured items for which I.S.I. marking 
facilities are not available, he should inspect the place 



======================================================================
PAGE 245 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
230
of manufacture to ensure that the materials used and the 
processes adopted can turn out products satisfying the 
specification requirements.
	
iii)	
In the case of mineral aggregate, he should inspect the 
quarry, or even station his representative there to ensure 
that only approved rock is crushed to the required sizes.
	
iv)	
For works involving processing (e.g., stabilisation) or 
compaction involving equipment, he may, if so provided 
for in the contract, ask the contractor to do the work on a 
trial stretch to ensure that the equipment and procedures 
used can turn out quality work.
Constructions organisations should preferably have quality control 
units independent of the construction staff. These units are intended 
to bring out any deficiency in the material or work to the notice 
of the Engineer-in-charge, as a second check. Presence of these 
units will not, however, absolve the Engineer-in-charge of his prime 
responsibility.
The different quality control tests and their minimum frequency on 
different layers of subbase, bases (non bituminous) and bituminous 
layers are given in Clause 903 of MORTH Specifications for Road 
and Bridge Works.
IRC:SP:112 Manual for Quality Control in Road and Bridge Works 
gives further details on quality control of road works
It is essential that the results of all quality control tests and observations 
should be systematically recorded and carefully preserved, preferebly 
in digital format, for quick and convenient retreival.

CHAPTER 10
ROAD DRAINAGE 
10.1.	 Adequate drainge is a primary requirement for maintaining 
the structural soundness and functional efficiency of a road. Rapid 
dispersal of water from pavement and subgrade is a basic consideration 
in the road design. Roads are constructed with two types of drainage 
system: surface drainage and subsurface drainage.
10.2	
Surface Drainage: Two types of surface drainages are provided 
a) Transverse Drainage and b) Longitudinal Drainage
10.2.1	Transverse Drainage: It is used to provide the continuity of 
natural water lines intercepted by the road. It is designed to avoid the 
flooding of the platform and surrounding areas e.g. aqueducts, culverts 
and cross drainage structures. 
10.2.2	Longitudinal Drainage: It is used to gather and channelize the 
precipitated water on the road surface and from the side slopes and 
nearby land thus avoiding its access to the road surface e.g. unlined 
and lined longitudinal drains and kerb channel drains. 
10.3	
Sub-surface Drainage: Two types of subsurface drains are 
constructed to dispense trapped water inside the subgrade and 
pavement layers. These are longitudinal interception drains and 
longitudinal water table lowering drains. 
10.4	
Following survey, investigations and designs are required for 
designing a drainage system.
	
a)	
Preparation of alignment plan, longitudinal and cross 
sections and contour map.
	
b)	
Hydrological survey such as rainfall analysis and runoff 
estimation
	
c)	
High flood stastical information for the region.
	
d)	
Hydraulic design
	
e)	
Geotechnical Investigation

Recourse to remote sensing methods such as aerial photography and 
satellite remote sensing  may have to be made wherever  required.
10.5 
Surface Drainage of Pavement
10.5.1	When a road is constructed on a natural terrain, the waterways 
are intercepted and necessary measures have to be taken to divert such 
water from the road. Besides, water received on road surface from 
rainfall and snowfall has to be disposed of as quickly as possible from 
safety considerations. Side ditches, lined drains, catch-drains and 
cross drainage structures are provided as part of the overall surface 
drainage system. 
10.5.2	With a view to facilitate quick removal of rain water, longitudinal 
profile of the road normally is not designed flat. When the road is 
provided with kerbs, a minimum longitudinal gradient of 0.3 percent 
is considered essential. To get clear the runoff water rapidly from the 
pavement surface, cross fall or camber to the pavement is provided. 
Diagrams showing cross fall in different pavement configuration are 
shown in Fig. 10.1, 10.2 & 10.3.

10.5.3 Drainage of shoulders
Black topped shoulders are durable and help in quick disposal of 
surface water. In case of earthen  shoulders camber/cross fall provided 
is more than by 0.5 percent of the pavement surface. Silt and clayey 
soil is more suceptable to erosion whereas good moorum/gravely soil 
is relatively less prone to erosion. Earthen and granular shoulders 
have to be periodically maintained by levelling and compacting. This 
operation involves adding of fresh material to compensate for loss of 
soil due to erosion, vehicle movement etc. and compacting the same 
after adding required water to achieve MDD. To reduce the erosion at 
the longitudinal edge where shoulder joins side slopes, rounding the 
sharp corner and compacting by a hand held plate compactor is helpful.
10.5.4 Drainage of side slopes
Side slopes can be protected by providing turfing with sods/seedings 
and mulching/jute netting/coir netting etc. The details can be seen in 
Clause 307/308 of MORTH Specifications for Road and Bridge Works, 
IRC:56 “Recommended Practice for Treatement of Embankment and 
Road Slide Slopes for Erosion Control and IRC:SP:42 “Guidelines on 
Road Drainage”.
10.5.5 Drainage of high embankments
In high embankments special arrangements like flumes/chutes are 
provided at regular interval so the water collected from the shoulder 
is channelized to these flumes/chutes. An energy dissipater would be 
required at the toe to control the high velocity with plain chutes. But 
stepped chutes is preferable as it is a self-energy dissipating structure. 
The spacing of chutes depends on the intensity of precipitation, 
gradient and type of side slope surfacing etc. Generally a 20 m C/C 
spacing can be considered as reasonable.

The plain chutes are either semi circular RCC pipes or insitu/precast 
RCC sections. A concrete bed anchored intermittently is provided 
under the chutes. Stone pitching of 1.0 m width (normally) with a 
filter bed is provided on both sides of the chutes. The rest of the slope 
is normally covered with grass turfing or stone pitching as per site 
conditions. A schematic view of slope protection arangement with 
plain chutes/flume is shown in Fig. 10.4. Details have been described 
in IRC:SP:42. 
Fig. 10.4.  A Schematic View of Slope Protection Arrangement 
with Plain Chute/Flume
10.5.6 Drainage of Medians
Medians may be raised or depressed. Earth filling must be flush with 
kerb and with two sided camber. If turf is provided on the top there 
is not much chance of too much water infiltrating to lower layers. In 
raised median sections with one sided cross fall, water can be diverted 
from one carriageway to  other by having an opening/channel in the 
median. These are provided at 10 m to 20 m intervals depending upon 
the intensity of rainfall, road width etc. An open drain or a buried pipe 
provided for collecting surface water which can be disposed of at a 
nearby cross drainage structures. In case of depressed median, central 
drain is to be lined effecting to prevent seepage of water to lower 
pavement layers. Photographs 10.1, 10.2 & 10.3 are given as few of 
the examples of drainage of medians.

10.6 
Subsurface Drainage
10.6.1	The moisture which reached lower layer of pavement form 
different sources is termed as subsurface moisture.  Disposal of this 
moisture away from the pavement body is termed as subsurface 
drainage. Consequences of lack of effective subsurface drainage 
system results in premature failure of pavement with formation of 
cracks, settlement, rutting in case of bituminous pavement whereas 
formation of crack, fragmentation and settlement of slab in case of 
cement concrete slabs.
10.6.2	Sources from which water/moisture reaches lower layers of 
pavement
i)	
from poor quality of bituminous mixes which are permeable,
ii)	
from the cracks, potholes and joints,
iii)	
from the failed joint seals of cement concrete pavement,
iv)	
through the longitudinal joint between pavement and shoulders,
v)	
from earth filled medians and shoulders, 
vi)	
seepage of water from the adjoining high ground in the cut 
section of hilly  terrain or form impounded water level higher 
than the road level in the abutting  agricultural fields,
vii) 	
from capillary rise of moisture when water table is high
10.6.3	Drainage of infiltrated moisture form pavement and shoulder 
surface can be done by providing suitable sub-base layer. Sub base 
shall have two sub layers namely drainage layer and filter layer. 
The upper layer of sub base functions as a drainage layer to drain 
away the water that may enter though surface cracks. The lower 
layer of sub base should function as the filter/separation layer to 
prevent intrusion of sub grade soil into the pavement. The aggregate 
gradation recommended for drainage are layer III & IV of MORTH 
Specifications for Roads and Bridge Works (Section 401).  Gradations 



======================================================================
PAGE 252 of 310
======================================================================

237
I, II, V, and VI specified in the same specification are recommended for 
filter/separation layer. Filter and drainage layers should be designed as 
per IRC:SP:42 and IRC:SP:50 “Guidelines on Urban Drainage”. It is 
necessary to extend both drainage and filter layers up to the slope of 
embankment (day lighted) to have efficient drainage. Commercially 
available geo-synthetic drainage composite can also be provided in 
lieu of aggregate layer meeting the requirement which will function as 
both filter and drainage layers whereever it proves to be cost effective 
and technically meeting the requirements. A diagram showing the 
proposal for disposal of sub surface moisture with a lined drain is 
shown in Fig. 10.5
French drains can be provided where sub surface drain is terminated 
under the shoulder. Durable crushed aggregates are used as backfill 
material around partially perforated  PVC or HDPE pipe. One of the 
filter material suggested in Table 309.3 of MORTH Specifications 
for Road and  Bridge works can be adopted to be used as backfill 
material. Normally a partially perforated PVC or HDPE pipe is buried 
near the bottom to collect and dispose of the moisture collected. 
The geosynthetic filer fabric shall satisfy filter criteria taking into 
consideration the properties of soil around it. Clause 702 of MoRTH 
Specifications for Roads and Bridge Works on geosynthetic filter gives 
the details. The details of these drains are shown in Fig. 10.6

10.6.4	Management of Seepage moisture from hills is the seepage 
form the adjoining hill and problem of surface water can be managed 
by providing drains for both surface and subsurface draines. Diagrams 
at Fig. 10.8 and Fig 10.9 show the drainage arrangement in hill 
sections.
Where there is a steep longitudinal gradient in cut sections, there is 
a chance of water seeping from higher ground along the middle of 
carriage way. Transverse and diagonal subsurface drains are provided 
to intercept this seeping water. Typical layouts of these types of 
drainage arrangements are shown in Fig.10.10 and Fig.10.11.

RCC box drains as shown in Fig. 10.12 can be provided to act as 
both surface drains and subsurface drains. The drain will have grated 
opening for collecting surface run off from the pavement and at the 
same time it can intercept seepage water from cut section in hilly 
terrain though well designed weep holes.

10.6.5 Treatment of capillary rise of water
Locations where water table or high flood level is too high: it is likely 
to affect subgrade and embankment and weaken them. It is, therefore, 
recommended that the bottom of subgrade should have a free board of 
not less than 0.6.-1.0  m above design HFL. If increasing of road level 
is difficult or due to financial implications, a capillary cut off should 
be provided. Capillary cutoff consists of sand blanket, HDPE sheet, 
drainage composite etc. A cushion of 10-15 cm thick layer of sand on 
granular material is required to be provided over the capillary cut off 
layer. The details of capillary cutoff and a blanket of granular material 
of sand are systematically shown in Fig. 10.13.

CHAPTER 11
PROJECT FACILITIES 
11.1.	 Access Permission to Fuel Stations, Private Properties and 
Rest Area Complexes
a) 
Fuel Stations
The petrol/diesel retail outlets shall generally be a part of the rest area 
complex along the highways. Rest areas should have various amenities 
for users e.g. places for parking, toilets, restaurants, rest room, kiosks 
for selling sundry items, bathing facilities, crèche etc. Petrol/diesel 
retail outlets and service stations with or without rest area amenities 
have, hereinafter referred to as fuel stations. These aspects should 
be incorporated while planning for improvement and upgradation of 
highways and/or planning of new fuel stations along the highways. 
The rest area complex can be planned subject to their commercial 
viability. It shall be ensured that the location of the proposed fuel 
station does not interfere with future improvements of the highways 
and nearby intersection/junction.
The fuel stations are to be located where the grounds are practically 
level, there are no sharp curves not less than those specified for 
minimum design speed or steep grades (more than 5%) and where 
sight distances would be adequate for safe traffic operations. The 
proposed locations should not interfere with the placement and proper 
functioning of highway signs, signals, lighting or other devices that 
affect traffic operation. It is also to be ensured, while considering a 
proposal for new fuel stations that the fuel stations on the corridor 
are well distributed on both sides of the highways so that vehicles do 
not have to cut across the traffic to reach them. Separate fuel stations 
need to be planned for the vehicles travelling in the lanes in opposite 
direction. 
If two or more fuel stations are to be sited in close proximity for some 
reasons, these would be grouped together to have a common access 
through a service road of 7.0 m width and connected to the highway 
through acceleration, deceleration lanes.



======================================================================
PAGE 259 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
244
The fuel stations are also not to be located within the distance 1000 m 
from any barrier including that of toll plaza and railway level crossing. 
Fuel stations should be located at a minimum distance of 200 m and 
500 m from the start of an approach road of a Road Over Bridge (ROB) 
and the start of a grade separator or a ramp respectively.
The access to the fuel stations along the National Highways shall be 
through deceleration and acceleration lanes.  The deceleration lane 
and acceleration lane may be dispensed with for fuel stations along 
urban roads and roads in hilly terrain.
For the safety and convinience of traffic, the minimum distance of 
the proposed fuel station from an intersection, the minimum distance 
between to adjacent fuel stations, the minimum sizes of the plots 
access layout, drainage arrangement, enforcement of right of way, 
biilding line and signage system for fuel stations located on National 
Highways shall be as specified by MORTH
b) 
Access to Private Properties
The private properties may be residential properties and other 
properties. The Residential Properties (RPs) shall mean individual 
plots with not more than four dwelling units.
The other properties (OPs) whether private or government shall include 
(excluding Fuel Retail Outlets for which separate guidelines exist) all 
other properties such as Industrial units, Hotels, Motels, Hospitals, 
School, Educational/Research Institutes, Housing Complexes, 
Recreational Clubs, Religious Structures, etc.  
There shall be no direct access to the National Highway from OPs. The 
access shall be through service road including required declaration 
and acceleration lane in case of both urban and rural reaches. The 
service road shall be constructed and maintained by the organization/
owners of OPs concerned. The land required is also to be provided 
by them at their own cost. The owner of OPs has also to pay the fees 
specified by the Government. For RPs, as far as possible there shall 



======================================================================
PAGE 260 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
245
be no direct access to the National Highway in urban/built up reaches. 
The access shall be through service road only. The Highway Authority 
may construct such service roads, subject to availability of funds. The 
direct access to RPs in rural areas can be granted. 
The above mentioned details and further details on the locations, layout 
and access to fuel stations access permission to private properties, Rest 
Area Complex etc. on National Highways are given in the Ministry’s 
circular letter No.RW/NH-33023/19/99- DO III dated 24.7.2013 and 
25.08.2014 and IRC:12 Unified Guidelines for Access Permission to 
Fuel Stations, Private Properties, Rest area Complexes and such other 
facilities along National Highways”.
The procedures for obtaining permission from the Highway Authorities 
are also available in these documents. 
11.2 
Pedestrian Facilities
Every traveller is a pedestrian at some stage of his or her travel and 
hence pedestrian facilities are very significant in urban transportation. 
In view of the paradigm shift from ‘moving the vehicles’ to ‘moving 
the persons while planning for transportation facilities for highways 
passing through the cities, provision of integrated and barrier free 
pedestrian facilities is essential to ensure inclusive mobility. IRC:103 
“Guideline for Pedestrian Facilitis” provides the details of such 
facilities.
In this regard, MORTH has issued guidelines for pedestrian facilities 
on National Highways for persons with disabilities or using mobility 
aids vide circular letter no. RW/NH-33044/28/2015/S&R (R) dated 
17.6.2015. This circular highlights the provisions to be made for 
person with disabilities or using mobility aids.
Pedestrian Crossings
Pedestrian Crossing can be broadly classified as i) At grade Pedestrain 
Crossing and ii) Grade Seperated Crossing. 



======================================================================
PAGE 261 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
246
At grade pedestrian crossing: At grade pedestrian crossing where 
the pedestrian cross the carriageway at the same level as that of 
vehicular movement. At grade crossing can be classified with respect 
to locational aspects as per below.
	
i)	
Pedestrians crossing at intersections
	
ii)	
Pedestrian crossing away from intersection (e.g. mid-
block crossings) 
At grade pedestrian crossing at intersection could be controlled or 
uncontrolled
Controlled crossings are achieved normally through provision of 
zebra crossings whether at an un-signalized or signalized intersection. 
Pedestrian crossings must inevitably integrated with the overall design 
of the intersection.
Uncontrolled crossing are those where the pedestrian cross walk is 
marked by studs or paint line but not controlled by any system of 
signals. Provision of uncontrolled pedestrian crossing must, as far as 
possible, be avoided.
Provision of a grade separated pedestrian facility may be warranted at 
locations where one or more of the following conditions exist:
Warrants
	
1)	
Volumes of pedestrian and vehicular traffic are so large 
that insertion of an exclusive pedestrian phase will 
increase the cycle time for traffic signals beyond 120

facility must be checked against delay costs for both 
pedestrian and vehicle drivers/users including increase 
in vehicle operating cost inflicted by increased delays. 
Effective law enforcement is necessary to control 
incidental crossing of Stop Line by vehicles.
Requirement of Pedestrian Subway  
 The pedestrian subway shall have a width and vertical clearance of 4.8 
m and 2.75 m respectively. There should be a good level of lighting, at 
least 50 lux  to have a clear view from one end to the other end. CCTV 
cameras along with notices are to be placed to enhance security and 
should have coverage for the entire length. Stalls shall be encouraged 
and set up as it gives sense of safety to pedestrian. Subways may be 
hump subways or full subways. In hump subways both the car lane users 
and pedestrians need to have a change in level. In case of full subways 
the pedestrian paths are lowered to a depth where a clear height of 2.75 
mm minimum can be achieved using 1:20 slope ranks with appropriate 
landing. The car users need not to change the level.
The details of different types of subways are given in IRC:103
Foot Over Bridge (FOB). This is of least priority since the walking 
length increase considerably.
Pedestrian guard rails
Pedestrian guard-rails are an important design element to prevent 
indiscriminate crossing and spilling over of pedestrian on to the 
carriageway. Their judicious use can help to ensure that pedestrian 
cross the streets at predetermined and safe location. It is also obligatory 
that sufficient width of footpath is made available where guard rails 
are provided. The design of guard rails should be neat, simple in 
appearance, as far as possible, vandal proof  The details of design, 
applications and installation guidelines are given in IRC:103

Although ITS may refer to all modes of transport, European Union 
defined ITS as systems in which information and communication 
technologies are applied in the field of road transport, including 
infrastructure, vehicles and users and in traffic management and 
mobility management with other modes of transport. ITS may 
improve the efficiency in a number of situations i.e. road transport, 
traffic management, mobility, etc. The purpose of ITS is to improve 
transportation safety and efficiency and also advance capability of road 
system. IRC:SP:110 “Application of Intelligent Transport System for 
Urban Roads” provides details of ITS. 
It is extremely important to manage and regulate traffic safely and 
efficiently. Therefore, the most important part is to collect all kinds 
of traffic data from all sources including primary and for using a real 
time data in order to work out an optimal solution for traffic problems.

CHAPTER 12
MAINTENANCE OF PAVEMENT  
(FLEXIBLE AND RIGID)
12.1. Flexible Pavement (Bituminous Pavement)
Timely and regular maintenance of roads have been known to provide 
economic rate of return of as high as 15 to 20% depending upon the 
category of road and traffic volume. It also helps in deferring the 
demand for rehabilitation which is costlier investment than preventive 
maintenance. Therefore, timely and appropriate maintenance of 
bituminous surface using sustainable/suitable materials and methods 
is significant for preservation of road asset and to serve the intended 
purpose.
12.1.1.	The maintenance operations are classified into following three 
categories.
	
a)	
Routine Maintenance – This is done by filling of 
potholes, repairing of cracks at a regular interval round 
the year.
	
b)	
Preventive Maintenance – It is performed to improve or 
extend the functional life of pavement surface while in 
good condition. 
	
c)	
Periodic Maintenance – This is done by applying a 
renewal coat with appropriate specification and is required 
to be carried out periodically at the specified frequency 
or based upon condition and performance of road surface 
depending upon category of traffic and climatic conditions. 
Maintenance is also required for pavement markings on 
the bituminous surfaces, as and when required, to guide 
the road users and to improve safety. 
12.1.2 System Approach
12.1.2.1	Pavement Management System (PMS) consists of a 
comprehensive coordinated set of activities with the planning, design, 



======================================================================
PAGE 271 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
256
construction, maintenance, evaluation and research of pavement. A 
major objective of PMS is to assist the highway engineer in making 
consistent and cost effective decision related to the construction, 
maintenance and rehabilitation of pavements.
12.1.2.2	Pavement Maintenance Management System (PMMS) is a 
technical or operational methodology for managing or directing and 
controlling maintenance, in a scientific manner, for optimum benefits.
12.1.3	The first step towards planning maintenance operations is 
the evaluation of the existing pavement surface in terms of physical 
condition. For this purpose pavement condition surveys may be 
undertaken by the visual assessment of the pavement surface and 
recorded in standard format. In case, more precise condition data is 
required, the surface distress is recorded by actual measurements. The 
details of standard formats are given in IRC:82- “Code of Practice for 
Maintenance of Bituminous Road Surfaces”. The rating of pavement 
may be assigned as per criteria given in the Table 12.1 below.

12.1.3.1	Apart from visual surveys, functional and structural 
evaluation of pavement based on riding quality (i.e. road roughness), 
skid resistance and deflection should also form the basis for taking 
maintenance decision in case of highways.
12.1.3.2	For preventive and periodic renewal requirement or short

term/long term maintenance strategies, it is desirable that at least two 
condition surveys are conducted every year on each stretch first before 
and the second after monsoon. On National Highway Network survey 
vehicles for capturing the inventory data and road condition are to be 
used for facilitating collection of data storage and easy reterival. On 
other roads, the condition surveys are to be carried out from a vehicle 
travelling at a speed of 5 km/hr supplemented by inspection of the 
critical locations by walking by a team or by an automated survey 
vehicle with experienced highway engineer at a responsible level.
12.1.4	The type of defects in bituminous surfacing are grouped under 
four categories
	
i)	
Surface Defects: These include fatty surface, smooth 
surface, streaking, and hungry surface.
	
ii)	
Cracks: These include all types of cracks, viz, hair-
line cracks, alligator cracks, longitudinal cracks, edge 
cracks, shrinkage cracks, and reflection cracks.
	
iii)	
Deformation: These include rutting, corrugations, 
shoving including those caused by layer slippage, 
shallow depressions, settlements and upheavals etc.
	
iv)	
Disintegration: These include stripping, loss of 
aggregates, raveling, potholes, and edge breaking.
12.1.4.1	The location and severity of distress are important to select 
appropriate maintenance treatments, materials and technique.
12.1.4.2	Further, details on each of these distress types, their symptoms, 
location, causes, severity levels and treatment are given in IRC:82. 
Photographs of distresses of few types are attached at Annex 12.1 
12.1.4.3 Preventive maintenance is a planned maintenance activity, 
which decreases rate of surface deterioration and extend life of 
bituminous pavement. All types of preventive maintenance have 
limitations for pavements with the structural failure. 
12.1.4.4	The typical preventive maintenance treatments are given below:-

Ultrathin Friction courses
Materials and methods for rectification of distress on bituminous 
surface are given in IRC:82.
12.1.5	 Periodic Renewal (PR)
12.1.5.1	The objective of PR is to preserve the required serviceability 
level of pavement surface and offset the wear and tear caused by traffic 
and weathering. The PR is needed to prevent further deterioration of 
the pavement and to ensure that qualities are kept up for the future 
requirement of traffic during to design life of the pavement. 
12.1.5.2	The renewal programme for each section of a road should be 
decided well in advance. The plan for a renewal programme should 
be prepared on the basis of periodic inspection of the road surface 
for assessing its condition and needs for providing renewal treatment. 
Inspection should be carried out manually or through automated 
machine. In addition, special inspections are necessary before and 
after the rains. It is not practicable or desirable to follow implicitly 
of any specified frequency irrespective of the condition of the road 
surface proposed to be renewed.
12.1.5.3	The stretches of the road showing signs of distress such as 
hungry surface/hairline cracking, raveling etc. should be invariably 
included in the programme. The stretches of the road which would be 
due for periodic renewal should be closely inspected for its inclusion 
or not in the programme. The specification of PR work will depend on 
the type of existing bituminous surface and its condition at the time 



======================================================================
PAGE 274 of 310
======================================================================

259
of renewal. Bituminous concrete has been recommended for National 
Highways
12.1.5.4	MORTH has now emphasized for use of recycling technology 
for PR works for reducing the dependence on limited natural 
resources i.e. crude oil and aggregate and also for addressing the 
environmental issues to lower demand of fuel, bitumen and aggregate. 
It has been decided that hot in place recycling is to be preferred over 
conventional surface renewal (laying new bituminous concrete) on 
National Highways works. MORTH with the circular dated 11.1.2018 
has intimated to all concerned to begin with and to equip more and 
more contractors capable of taking recycling work, at least 25% of the 
stretches of National Highways to be sanctioned for PR works with 
hot in place recycling technology. However, the stretches falling in 
hilly terrain, in North East areas or in other difficult terrain may be 
excluded for taking up hot inplace recycling. Efforts should be made 
to select continuous long stretches for hot in place recycling with a 
minimum length of 10 km continuous stretch. The works should be 
carried out as per MORTH Specifications for Road and Bridge Works 
and IRC:120 “Recommended Practice for Recycling of Bituminous 
Pavements”.
12.2 
Rigid Pavement (Cement Concrete Pavement)
12.2.1	All pavements deteriorate with time. The rate of deterioration 
of cement concrete pavement is comparatively much slower than the 
flexible pavement. The concrete pavements are therefore expected to 
have a larger service life. In case of concrete pavements, some distress 
at a few isolated locations, however, do take place immediately after or 
during an early stage after completion. If these isolated distresses are 
rectified well in time, then longer life of concrete pavement is assured 
without much need of detailed periodic maintenance rehabilitation. 
The main types of maintenance required in respect of cement concrete 
pavements are as follows:
a)	
Routine Maintenance: Routine maintenance may be defined as 
those treatment that are applied to a pavement in order to keep 
the pavement functioning properly.



======================================================================
PAGE 275 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
260
b)	
Programmed Maintenance: It covers works undertaken to arrest 
deterioration and restore the asset to its original condition.
c)	
Rehabilitation and Strengthening: It refers to programmed 
works that are undertaken to structurally restore the condition 
of a road sections to impart further design life to carry expected 
traffic loads.
d)	
Emergency Repair: It covers responding to complaints or 
emergencies.
12.2.2.1		 A site condition survey once a year, preferably in the 
beginning of monsoon season should be undertaken to assess the 
existing pavement condition and to identify pavement distress.
12.2.2.2	Distresses in concrete pavement are either structural or 
functional. Structural distresses primarily affect the pavement’s ability 
to carry traffic load. Functional distresses mainly affect the riding 
quality and safety of traffic. 
12.2.2.3	Structural distresses are manifested by cracks in the pavement. 
Any uncontrolled/random crack like longitudinal, transverse, diagonal, 
intersecting cracks that extended through the depth of the slab for more 
than the half of the depth of the PQC slab is considered as a structural 
crack. Structural cracks unless repaired effectively reduce the load 
carrying capacity of the pavement and adversely impact the designed 
service life of the pavement. Use of proper construction techniques 
and traffic load controls can reduce/avoid structural cracks. 
12.2.2.4	Functional distress do not necessarily reduce the load carrying 
capacity of pavements but affect the riding quality and safety. Roughness, 
loss of surface texture or any other surface related defects, problems like 
faulting, scaling, raveling and pop-outs etc. fall under this category.

12.2.3	Assessing Maintenance Needs
12.2.3.1	 The maintenance needs should be assessed every year as part of 
the planning of road maintenance programme. The overall assessment 
of the maintenance needs be done on the basis of condition surveys 
which can take various forms such as:
Visual condition surveys by manual method or by automated survey 
equipment.
Roughness survey by profillograph and bump integrator 
Deflection tests by Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD)
Friction/Skid resistance by sand patch, British pendulum and Mu-
metre
Drainage Condition Survey
Non Destructive Testing (NDT) techniques like ultrasonic pulse 
velocity, Impact 
12.2.3.2	The details of conducting these surveys and proformas for 
collection of data for all these assessment are given in IRC:SP:83.
12.2.3.3	The degree of severity of distresses as assessed for the surface 
condition recorded from the visual survey can be defined by rating of 
distress. A 5-level distress rating system has been recommended. This 
is given in Table 12.2 below

12.3 
Inspection of In-Service Roads
Periodical inspections of the roads by qualified engineers are warranted. 
The minimum frequency of inspection for condition by different level 
of engineers from Section Engineer to Executive Engineer concerned 
shall be as per details given in the Manual for Maintenance of Roads 
of MORTH published by IRC.
A pre-requisite to meaningful inspection is the up-to-date inventory 
of all related features of the road and continuous record of all the 
original and maintenance works as executed in that road. This can be 
conveniently complied for each section of the road usually 5-10 Km 
long in the form of Road Register. The Road Register should contain 
at least three basic details. The first giving statistical details like 
location, date of construction of the road, rainfall details, year-wise 
traffic census data base, vehicles by type on 7-day count basis and 
financial statement showing year-wise expenditure on capital works 
and maintenance works on different items of works. 
The second data is upto date latest basic inventory of the road like 
details of features in the plan and L-section of the road in numerical 
figures, symbols or signs. 
These details shall include the i) width of ROW, roadway and 
carriageway, ii) horizontal curves with their radii, iii) railway/road 
crossing, iv) cross drainage structures, v) floodable reaches, HFL, 
vi) average height fill, cut vii) soil type, design CBR, pavement 
composition, viii) gradients, sight distances, ix) location of road side 
furnitures, inspection bungalows, rest areas, fuel stations etc.
The third details shall be year wise and kilometer wise information of 
the works done for both original and maintenance works. The details 
of Road Register are to be updated on regular basis and are to be

maintained in digital format for easy storage and quick retrieval at any 
time. Back up hard copy of all data are also be maintained. 
The road should be inspected frequently and  twice a year once before 
the start of the rainy season and also soon after the rains by responsible 
engineers. Prior to the rain all the measures to drain the storm water, 
carrying out repair works on damages to all protective works, abutment 
and pier of CD Works, repair of pavement surface and storing and 
protecting road construction materials are to be done based on the 
inspection. During the rains, arrangements should be made to have a 
close watch on flood levels, possibility of overtopping of road sections, 
general flow of pattern of run-off water, proper functioning of drains 
and culverts so that prompt measures could be taken for regulating 
traffic flow and also forwarding off major damages.
After the rains, inspections are to be carried out to assess the damages 
caused by rain/flood and to give top priority for repairing breaches 
and removing blockages. Oozing out of water from shoulders/slopes, 
if any, are also to be observed. If so necessary measures to cut out to 
release and remove the locked up water are to be taken up. Repair 
of potholes/cracks are to be taken up to make the road trafficable. 
Stretches showing recurring damages are to be studied to ascertain 
causes of such damages and taking up remedial measures. 
12.4 
Road Maintenance Standards
The Contractor, engaged for maintenance, shall maintain the road assets 
in proper condition that comply with the Road Maintenance Standards 
and ensure road user safety and comfort. The maintenance activities 
shall be so planned that the defects are repaired well before they reach 
maximum defective condition as per the permissible tolerances. The 
Road Maintenance Standards for different components shall be as per 
IRC:SP:95 “Model Contract Document for Maintenance of Highways”.

CHAPTER 13
QUALITY ASSURANCE SYSTEM
13.1 
Definitions
Quality: The totality of features and characteristics of a product or 
service that bear upon its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs. 
Quality Policy: The overall quality intentions and direction of 
an organization as regards quality as formally expressed by top 
management. 
Quality Management: The aspect of the overall management function 
that determines and implements the quality policy. 
Quality Systems: The Organization structure, responsibilities, 
procedures, processes and resources for quality management. 
Total Quality Management: A management approach of an organization 
centred on quality, based on the participation of all its members and 
aiming at long term success through customer satisfaction and benefits 
to all members of the organization and society. 
Quality Assurance: All the planned and systematic activities 
implemented within the quality system and demonstrated as needed 
to provide adequate confidence that an entity will fulfill requirements 
for quality.
Quality Control: The operational techniques and activities that are 
used to fulfil the requirements for quality
13.2 
Class of Quality Assurance
Depending upon the rigors of control and cross verification, four 
classes of Quality Assurance (QA) are prescribed below:



======================================================================
PAGE 283 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
268
Table 13.1 Class of Quality Assurance
Class of Quality Assurance
Class Nomenclature 
Nominal QA
Q-1
Normal QA
Q-2
High QA
Q-3
Extra High QA
Q-4
Quality Assurance (QA) class needs to be decided prior to start of 
the project preparation. However, during the course of project 
implementation, QA class of some of the items/attributes may be 
upgraded to next class based on specific requirements. Provision 
for such upgradation needs to built into the contract. For National 
Highways & State Highways, Coastal roads, roads in high altitude 
and high rainfall (average over 2000 m) areas Q-3 class of QA is 
applicable. For Expressways, tunnels and elevated highways Q-4 class 
is applicable. IRC Manual IRC:SP:112 “Manual for Quality Control 
in Road and Bridge Works” has been developed for Q-3 class QA.
13.3 
Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) 
13.3.1	A document chronicling the actions to be taken and steps to be 
followed by each party to the project for successful implementation of 
the project duly fulfilling the quality requirements. 
13.3.2   The road project cycle involves three broad stages i.e. Project 
preparation, Project Development and Construction. Therefore, for a 
single project different quality assurance plan needs to be prepared 
by different parties in different stages. These are summarized below:-
Table 13.2  Requirements of QAP by Different Parties

Quality Control
13.3.3.	Model structures of QAPs for Consultants, Contractors, 
Supervision Consultants as mentioned above and protocol for 
Employer/Authority are given in IRC:SP:112. The process to ensure 
quality requirements for factory manufactured materials, products and 
specialized items have been given in IRC:SP-112.
13.4	
Many materials used in road construction are factory 
manufactured materials such as steel, cement, bitumen etc. and also 
finished items and products such as bridge bearings, expansion joints, 
crash barriers etc. Only some of the required tests to be equipped for 
carrying out the factory manufactured materials along with natural 
materials like soil, sand stone etc. The finished items are usually 
tested in manufacturer’s own laboratory or in a specialized third party 
laboratory.
IRC:SP:112 provides tentative lists and testing requirements of most 
of the factory manufactured materials, products and specialized items 
along with availability of site testing facility for them. 
13.5 
Personnel
Both the Contractor/Concessionaire and Engineer/Consultant are 
required to engage adequate number of personnel with required 
knowledge, experience and expertise to control quality. The knowledge 
and experience of lab technician who actually carry out the tests is 
also critical. The size and complexity of a project determines the range 
of personnel, their knowledge, experience and expertise. IRC:SP:112 
suggests the tests of quality personnel required with contractor/
concessionaire and Engineer/Consultant for projects of different sizes 



======================================================================
PAGE 285 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
270
and complexities. The organizational structure of the quality control 
personnel along with qualification and experience requirements are 
also specified.  
13.6 
Field Laboratory set up
13.6.1	The number and location of the field laboratories are to be 
decided on the basis of size, packaging, field organization structure 
and the project site. There can be a central/main laboratory for each 
package. Further plant laboratories can be established if they are 
located in different locations than the main camp site. Test equipments 
at each plant laboratory will be specific to the plant established at 
that location. General infrastructure requirements of the laboratory, 
layout and suggestive list of equipment and consumable for main/
plant laboratory, routine and special upkeep of equipment have also 
been given in IRC:SP:112. A typical layout plan of the central/main 
laboratory along with the list of equipment for central/main laboratory 
are attached at Annexure 13.1 & 13.2 respectively.
13.6.2  All the tests shall be conducted as per relevant Indian Standard 
Codes of Practice as mentioned in Section 900, other sections of 
MORTH Specifications for Road and Bridge Works and the relevent 
IRC Codes. In the absence of Indian Standards for any test,  reference 
may be made for any other appropriate international code of practice 
such as ASTM, BS, etc. Suggested codes of practice for various tests 
to be conducted on naturally occurring materials in original/crushed 
forms and various types of mixes are also given in IRC:SP:112. 
13.6.3  All the formats to be used for recording the results of various 
tests shall be included in the QAP. A copy of  each such test format 
shall be made available in the field laboratories. Test results shall be 
promptly entered in suitable registers and/or forms (paper/electronic) 
soon after conducting the tests. Electronic copies of the records shall 
be maintained in a way which facilitates quick and easy retrieval. 
The proformas for recording and reporting the tests and results are 
available in IRC:SP:112. 



======================================================================
PAGE 286 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
271
13.7.1  Reliability of factory manufactured materials and finished items 
for which specified test cannot be conducted in site laboratory has a lot 
of concern which needs to be duly addressed through a combination of 
testing in manufacturers/third party laboratories and rigorous protocol 
to ensure adoption of correct practices by the manufacturers. 
13.7.2	Only some of the tests of few factory manufactured material 
and factory manufactured finished items can be got tested at the field 
laboratory . The quality policy of the supplier shall be furnished by 
the Contractor/Concessionaire to the Engineer/consultant who will 
ascertain that the quality policy of such supplier shall commensurate 
with the specified details as per IRC:SP:112. In large/complex 
projects, the Engineer/Consultant may further exercise independent 
check about the adherence of quality policy of the supplier. For all 
such material and products the supplier/manufacture is required to 
submit detailed document describing the “Quality Management Plan 
(QMP) as detailed in IRC:SP:112. The quality of such material is also 
be confirmed either by witnessing tests in manufacturer’s laboratory 
or conducting third party testing.
13.8 
Calibration
Calibration is a comparison between a known measurement (the 
standard) and the measurement using the instrument to be calibrated.
Primary objective of calibration is to check and ensure that the 
measurements made by Inspection, Measuring and Testing (IMT) 
equipment has the same accuracy as specified by the equipment 
manufacturers. In practice, calibration also includes repair of device. 
Calibration of equipment is a must for certainty/reliability of the 
test results. Calibration of plant and equipment such as Hot Mix 
Plants, Concrete Batching Plants are also very important. Calibration 
requirement ranges from sieves to nuclear density metre. As a general 
rule, the IMT equipment measuring devices shall be calibrated at the 
frequency specified by the manufacturers of the specific equipment. 
Details of calibration requirement and material have also been given in 



======================================================================
PAGE 287 of 310
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Highway Engineers
272
IRC:SP:112. The requirement for equipment calibration, measurement 
and traceability are given in ISO/IEC 17025.
13.9 
Statistical Analysis – Variability of materials, workmanship 
and construction process is a reality in road construction. Adding to 
the variability of materials and processes there is also considerable 
variation in testing process resulting in measurement errors. Acceptance 
procedure requires statistical analysis of test results. These have been 
detailed in IRC:SP:112. Acceptance criteria for different materials/
finished products/items of work are given in relevant sections of 
MORTH Specifications for Road and Bridge Works.
13.10 New Material
13.10.1	 Several new materials are being developed from time to time 
which are not incorporated in MORTH Specifications for Road and Bridge 
Works. The new materials which are accredited by Indian Roads Congress 
(IRC) are only to be used. Following guidelines shall be followed when 
decisions have been taken to use these materials in the works.
	
a)	
All new materials proposed to be used in the work 
should be fit for the intended purpose and to be tested in 
the reputed laboratory as per direction of the Authority.
	
b)	
The material should have a technology and production 
base that is capable of producing the required quantity 
with consistent and reproducible quality.
	
c)	
Full responsibility of the manufacturer shall be 
guaranteed toward performance of the material.
	
d)	
The manufacturer’s quality policy shall be submitted.
	
e)	
The specification limits of the material shall be informed 
for different quality characteristics.
