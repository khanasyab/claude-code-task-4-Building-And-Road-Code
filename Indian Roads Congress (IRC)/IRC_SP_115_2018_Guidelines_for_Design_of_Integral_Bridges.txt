After due deliberations the B-9 Committee has taken a considered view that as there 
are no standards for Integral Bridges, there is a need to bring out these guidelines titled 
‘Guidelines for Design of Integral Bridges’, for the design, detailing and construction 
of Integral Bridges in India. Considering the fact that Integral Bridges worldwide have 
shown saving in initial cost  and life cycle cost through reduced maintenance. As Integral 
Bridges have demonstrated better performance under earthquake loads, their use needs 
to be encouraged. In addition, Integral Bridges eliminate expansion joints and provide 
better riding quality thereby adding comfort to the road users. Because of  advantage 
of reduced initial cost and maintenance cost and better service performance/riding 
quality, the engineer’s worldwide in countries like USA, UK, New Zealand, Australia, 
Japan etc. are preferring to use Integral Bridges. In UK, bridges up to a length of 60 
m are mandatory to be of integral type1. However, because of complexity in design of 
long Integral Bridges, their use is generally limited in length to about 100 m, though 
there are examples of Integral Bridges with length more than 300 m in some of the 
countries.
Keeping this objective in mind, a sub-committee consisting of following members was 
formed to prepare the initial draft of the guidelines.

e)	
Dr. Krishna Sandepudi
	
f)	
Dr. Harshavardhan Subbarao
	
g)

The initial draft prepared by the sub-committee was discussed by the B-9 committee at 
several meetings and finalized in its meeting held on 26th May 2017. The draft document 
was approved by Bridges Specifications and Standards Committee in its meeting 
held on 23.10.2017. The document was considered by IRC Council in its 213th meeting 
held on 03.11.2017 at IRC Session held at Bengaluru and approved the document for 
publication.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1	
General
An Integral Bridge (IB) is a structure where there are no bearings over the abutments and 
no expansion joints in the superstructure. IB’s are characterized by monolithic connection 
between the superstructure and the substructure (piers and abutments), unlike the traditional 
bridge construction, where the superstructure is supported on bearings and transfers all the 
forces to substructure and foundation through bearings. Provision of expansion joints and 
bearings in traditional bridges allows movement and rotation of the bridge deck, without 
transferring any force to abutment / pier and foundation due to thermal / creep / shrinkage 
induced movements. In case of IB’s, the deck carries the movement of deck to the abutment 
as well as to the backfill soil behind the abutment. The approach slab between the bridge 
end and the pavements accommodate the necessary movements, which leads to a strong 
soil-structure interaction.
Apart from the fully integral solutions without expansion joints or bearings, it is also possible 
to have structural solution, where only the expansion joints at Abutments are omitted, but the 
bearings are provided. The back-wall portion of the substructure is directly connected with 
the superstructure in such case and the superstructure, back-wall and approach slab moves 
together ‘towards’ and ‘away’ from the backfill during the thermal expansion and contraction. 
Such solutions, known as ‘Semi-Integral Bridges’ (SIB’s), are often appropriate particularly 
for the rehabilitation of bridges.
Another structural form, which is commonly used is ‘Framed-Type Bridges’ (FTB’s), where 
the bridge deck is monolithic at intermediate pier locations but have bearings as well as 
expansion joints at the abutment locations. In this case there is no interaction of the structure 
with the backfill soil. Design of FTB’s are well covered in existing IRC codes and therefore 
not covered in this guideline.
Fig.1.1 shows the different type of bridges, classified based on the connection of deck at the 
ends. This guideline covers design of fully Integral Bridges (IB’s) only as shown in Fig. 1.1(b) 
and (c).
There are four basic ways that a bridge can be made integral, depending on the abutment 
detail. These four forms can be referred to as: Bank seat abutments, Framed abutments 
(fully integral bridges); Embedded wall abutments and Flexible support abutments. Fig.1.2 
shows typical details of these different type of IB’s possible.

Advantages and Disadvantages of using Integral Bridges
Some of the advantages of adopting integral bridge concept as against the conventional 
bridge concept are summarized below:
	
•	
Added redundancy with improved seismic performance
	
•	
Improved structural reliability and redundancy

•	
Improved ride-quality and noise reduction
	
•	
Improved durability due to absence of expansion joints, which is the source 
of moisture ingress
	
•	
Potential for reduced initial cost
	
•	
Reduced maintenance requirement
	
•	
Reduced traffic disruption
	
•	
Lower whole-of-life cost and
	
•	
Improvement of bridge appearance
	
•	
Simplified Widening & Replacement detail
	
•	
Useful concept for strengthening of existing bridges
Some of the disadvantages of adopting integral bridge concept are summarized below:
	
•	
Limited span range due to restraints to movements caused by thermal, creep 
and shrinkage.
	
•	
Differential settlement between foundations resting on varying strata or 
varying scour conditions in case of river bridges.
	
•	
Climatic conditions with large variation in maximum and minimum ambient 
temperatures.
	
•	
Need for complex structural analysis involving soil-structure interaction.
1.3	
Integral Bridge Practices in various parts of the World
Experience on construction of Integral Bridges in the United States of America dates back 
to late 1930’s and early 1940’s. Ohio, South Dakota, and Oregon were the first states to 
routinely use continuous construction with integral abutments. California followed suit in 
1950’s. Tennessee and other states in USA began moving toward integral bridges from 
1960’s.
New Zealand’s experience with joint-less bridges began in 1930’s. Standardized design 
drawings for concrete bridges of this type have been developed by the New Zealand Ministry 
of Works and Development (NZMWD) as far back as 1950’s. 
In the 1970’s, Britain started to research on IB’s. Currently in UK, the bridges with span 
length less than 60 m and skew not exceeding 30º are generally required to be continuous 
over intermediate piers and integral at abutments2. The thermally induced cyclic movement 
at each abutment is restricted to ± 20 mm in case of IB’s as per the British Advisory Note.
In Japan, the first integral bridge was built in 1996. Generally the integral bridge length 
in Japan is restricted to 30 m. In Australia, the integral bridge construction is practiced by 
Queensland Main Roads Department (QMRD) since 1975. China began to build Integral 
bridges since 1990’s.

European experience of integral bridge is significantly less and dates back to 1960 onwards. 
However the experience gained by Europe has been positive and as a result, the trend 
is towards making integral bridges a larger percentage of all newly constructed bridges in 
Europe. In Switzerland, many integral bridges were constructed on the national motorway 
network during the period 1960-85. The long term experiences of these structures have 
been overwhelmingly positive, both in terms of construction and maintenance. More than 
40% of the existing bridges on FEDRO (Federal Roads Office of Switzerland) network are 
integral or semi integral structures2. The scientists at EPFL (Ecole Polytechnique Federale 
de Lausanne) are currently conducting research program on abutment and approach slab 
construction techniques, with the challenge to build long span bridges with integral concepts 
(i,e. bridges of length > 200m).

4 PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS
It is important to ensure that the feasibility of the IB concept for any project is established 
in the early planning stage. Every site is not necessarily suitable for this type of structure 
and hence indiscriminate use of this concept in situations where it is not suitable, should be 
avoided. Factors that influence the feasibility of adopting integral type of structure include:
	
a)	
Length of Structure
	
b)	
Climatic condition
	
c)	
Seismic zone
	
d)	
Type of superstructure
	
e)	
Type of abutments
	
f)	
Type of foundations and sub-soil conditions
	
g)	
Geometry of the structure
	
h)	
Complexity in analysis and design
4.1	
Length of Structure
The limitation in the length of the bridge, upto which an integral bridge can be built, depends 
upon:
	
a)	
The climatic conditions
	
b)	
Range of temperature variation (‘daily’ as well as ‘seasonal’)
	
c)	
Material of the structure, geometry of the structure
	
d)	
Abutment and pier heights and the sub-soil conditions
	
e)	
Differential settlements and scour conditions in river bridges
4.2	
Climatic Condition
IBs are sensitive to daily and seasonal changes in temperature and humidity. Lesser the 
variation in temperature, lesser will be the force induced in the structure. In the long term, 
creep in the deck, abutment and approaches will reduce the forces induced in the deck. For 
daily variation, the beneficial effect of creep should not be considered. Integral bridge with 
longer length is possible in regions where the difference between maximum and minimum 
shade air temperature is minimal.

PAGE 20 of 40
======================================================================

IRC:SP:115-2018
4.3	
Seismic Zone
Integral bridges perform better under seismic induced forces due to the fixity and restraints 
at the abutments. The multiple degree of redundancy in the structure helps to minimize the 
risk of failure of the structure. Therefore in high seismic zone, integral bridges are preferred.
4.4	
Type of Superstructure
The type of superstructure has a significant influence on the design of integral bridges. The 
following types of superstructure are usually adopted :
	
•	
Cast in-situ RC solid slab/voided slab deck
	
•	
Precast Prestressed/RCC girder with in-situ composite deck.
	
•	
Steel girder with in-situ concrete composite deck
IB’s with steel decking are more responsive to temperature than with concrete deck. IB’s with 
cast-in-situ post tensioned bridge decks suffer large movements resulting from shrinkage 
and creep, which needs to be absorbed by the structure.
4.5	
Type of Abutments
Various types of integral abutment types are possible, as given below7:
	
a)	
Bank Seat Abutments
	
b)	
Framed Abutments with fixed base (i,e. With open foundation or foundation 
with multi-row piles)
	
c)	
Framed Abutments with hinged base (i,e. foundation with single row piles)
	
d)	
Embedded Wall Abutments
	
e)	
Flexible support abutments
Fig.1.2 shows the various types of Abutments generally adopted for IBs.
Bank seat abutments: These are effectively extensions to the deck that are seated on the 
backfill and act as end supports for the bridge as shown in Fig. 1.2(a)(i) and Fig. 1.2(a) (ii). 
These bank pads slide on top of the foundation soil in response to thermal expansion and 
contraction of the deck and can rotate under live loading. The bank pad should have adequate 
weight to provide stability to the structure, and in multi-span structures, the end span should 
have adequate flexibility to accommodate differential settlement and to avoid uplift when 
remote spans are subject to traffic loading.
Bank pad abutments on piles: These are bank pad abutments founded on a single row 
of discrete vertical piles, as shown in Fig. 1.2(a)(iii), which are driven or bored through 
an embankment or cutting slope. The top of the piles are integral with the deck. When the 
deck expands, the pile cap and the end of the deck move into the backfill without significant 
rotation, whereas the piles flex backward into the fill.
Framed abutments: These abutments support the bridge deck and act as retaining walls 
for the backfill. They are connected structurally to the deck and are supported on spread 
footings or piled foundations as shown in Fig. 1.2 (c).



======================================================================

======================================================================


IRC:SP:115-2018
Embedded wall abutments: These include contiguous or secant pile, sheet pile or diaphragm 
wall abutments, which extend to a depth below the retained fill as shown in Fig. 1.2(d). The 
walls are integral with the bridge deck. These type of abutments are popular for short span 
underpasses in congested urban areas where top-down construction is envisaged.
Flexible support abutments: These are abutments in which the deck is supported on 
flexible piles or columns. The piles or columns are either enclosed in sleeves to allow them 
to flex without displacing the surrounding soil as shown in Fig. 1.2 (e)(i) and Fig. 1.2(e)(ii), or 
they are located in front of a reinforced soil or similar abutment as shown in Fig. 1.2(e)(iii). 
In these types of abutments, only the end screen, which is attached to the end of the deck, 
moves into the fill.
4.6	
Type of Foundations and Sub-Soil Conditions
Sub-soil condition is an important consideration while choosing the type of foundation and for 
ascertaining the feasibility of integral structures. The primary criterion is the need to support 
the piers and abutments on relatively flexible foundation. It is desirable to have ‘flexible’ 
abutment and foundations, which allow movement of the structure under thermal loadings 
without much restraint. For footings founded on soft or compressible soil, mechanical 
stabilization of the soil may be required to avoid large total and differential settlements.
Single row of Steel ‘H’ piles are commonly considered as the best foundation practice in 
integral bridges, in many countries, including USA, UK, Ireland. Single row of pile allows 
the abutment stem to translate into and out of the soil as it provides maximum ductility and 
flexibility in cyclic bending. Piles may be oriented with bending to occur about the strong or 
weak axis (relative stiffness between abutment and piles is so large that piles attract little 
moment regardless of orientation. For large movements, pile can be installed in permanent 
steel casings. The steel casing in such cases shall be designed to have the same design life 
as that of the bridge and an appropriate sacrificial corrosion thickness should be allowed for 
in the pile section.
Alternative to steel H-piles, single row of reinforced concrete piles / pre-stressed spun piles 
or steel pipe piles filled with concrete are also used for integral bridges in Europe. The use 
of Reinforced Concrete (RC) piles in IBs has not been widespread due to concerns over pile 
flexibility and the potential for concrete cracking. More than one row of piles in foundation can 
be used in IBs provided the piles can absorb the thermally induced high bending stresses, 
which may be caused due to increased stiffness of the foundation system in such cases.
Some of the countries (e,g. UK, Sweden)2 use sleeves around the piles to prevent soil from 
restraining the free bending of the piles during superstructure translation. The pile theoretically 
distributes any longitudinal translation along a greater length of freestanding pile, thereby 
reducing the moment induced in the pile.
Spread footing, by their very nature, restrain the rotation of the abutment stem and therefore 
attracts larger forces in the base, in case of IBs. However depending upon the length and 
geometry of the IB, spread footings can also be used.

4.7	
Geometry of the Structure
A complex geometry creates problems in the design of integral bridges. Irregular structures, 
sharply skewed structures and structures with sharp curvatures (that is, where there are 
abrupt or unusual changes in the mass, stiffness or geometry along the span) should be 
avoided.
For an integral structure, it is preferable that the spans are symmetrically placed and the 
adjacent pier stiffness does not differ substantially (say by more than 25 percent). Though 
curvature and skew can be accommodated, it would be desirable to avoid large skew (say, 
more than 30º) and high degree of curvature (Say R<100 m).
Bridges with tall piers are ideally suitable for integral bridges. The frame action greatly helps 
to reduce the lateral loads being transferred to the foundation. Preferably abutment heights 
on either side shall be the same. A difference in abutment height will cause unbalanced lateral 
loads resulting in side sway, which should be considered in the design by balancing the earth 
pressure which is consistent with the direction of sway, at the abutments. This procedure is 
a complex, iterative process and should be avoided.
4.8	
Complexity in Analysis and Design
Integral Bridges, for all their simplicity of construction, are complicated structural systems. 
To thoroughly analyze a given structure, the designer must not only design for primary 
loads (dead, live, wind, etc.) but must also accurately account for secondary loads (creep, 
shrinkage, settlement, temperature effects, etc.). To additionally complicate the analysis, the 
response of a structure to a given set of external forces is very dependent on the geometry, 
materials, configuration, soil-structure interaction, and construction details of the individual 
system.
5 CONSTRUCTION CONSIDERATIONS
The sequence of construction for integral bridges should be specified in the Good for 
Construction (GFC) drawings. Following requirements should be adhered to :
5.1	
Durability, Workmanship & Specific Requirements
5.1.1	
Concrete Quality
Minimum grades of concrete, minimum cement content, maximum water cement ratio, cover 
to reinforcement and other durability and workmanship requirement shall be same as given 
in IRC:112.
5.1.2	
Backfill
The densely compacted coarse gravel should be used as backfill material when this type 
of material is available. The material should be free draining and granular. Backfill material 
shall be compacted to the order of 95% modified Proctor density or 75% relative density. 



======================================================================
PAGE 23 of 40
======================================================================


IRC:SP:115-2018
The log-spiral approach with curved failure surface can be used when the soil friction angle 
is 40º or above and wall friction /soil friction ratio 0.60 to 0.75, to determine the passive 
resistance. These parameters should give a lower bound solution of the passive response 
of backfill, when subjected to static, cyclic and dynamic loadings. The designer who has 
performed field shear strength testing and is confident in the resulting parameters can use 
them in determining a larger earth resistance noting that calculated passive earth pressure 
coefficients increase by 10% to 15% for each one degree increase in the soil friction angle 
beyond 40º.The length of the compacted zone of backfill should extend for at least the height 
of the wall beyond the back face of the abutment and vertically below the bottom of the wall 
by about 25% of the height of the wall.
5.1.3	
Road Pavements
Road Pavements should be constructed in accordance with the specifications for Highway 
works and IRC codes right up to the back faces of integral abutment. The surfacing can be 
laid as continuous layer over the approach roads and over the deck water proofing.
5.2	
Sequence of Construction and its Influence in Design.
5.2.1	
The abutments and the wing walls shall be constructed first to seating level 
elevation.
5.2.2	
In case precast / prefabricated girders are used, they shall be placed on a support 
that allows rotation and deflection of girders due to self-weight of the deck. A 20 mm thick 
natural rubber sheet is generally provided to accommodate rotation of girders.
5.2.3	
The deck and the portion of the abutment above bearing seat elevation shall be 
cast integrally with the girders.
5.2.4	
There is a possibility that during construction, the superstructure will be subject 
to thermal movements when the freshly placed concrete of the abutment diaphragm is not 
fully set. This can be a serious concern with steel beam bridges that are more responsive to 
rapid changes in ambient temperatures. As such, casting of the closing pour of the abutment 
should be timed such that the initial set of the abutment diaphragm concrete occurs when the 
superstructure is at a relatively constant temperature. As bridge temperatures are dissimilar 
to ambient air temperatures, casting after midnight or in the very early hours of the morning 
is preferred.
5.2.5	
In the case of steel girder bridges, their thermal movements are modified after 
casting the concrete deck slab. Therefore the best results can be achieved by casting the 
closing abutment joint after the deck slab has been cast, and preferably whilst the deck slab 
is cooled with water spraying or flooding, which is also beneficial for curing.
5.2.6	
The construction of deck and abutment to the seating level shall be in sequence 
so that the structure becomes integral, with no residual stress. This may require careful 
consideration of concrete-pouring sequence and sometimes even the use of a retarder. The 
ends of the deck and the abutments shall be placed last unless setting of concrete can be 
retarded sufficiently to allow the placement from one end to the other in a single pour.

======================================================================

IRC:SP:115-2018
5.2.7	
The stability and the integrity of the structure shall be maintained at all stages of 
construction.
5.2.8	
Backfill shall not be placed behind the abutment until the concrete deck has 
attained 75% of its specified strength. Backfill shall be placed simultaneously behind both 
abutments, keeping the height of backfill appropriately same. At no time the difference in 
height of backfill shall be greater than 500 mm. The sequence of placement of backfill shall 
be taken into account in design.
6 LOADS and LOAD COMBINATIONS
6.1	
Introduction:
6.1.1	
Bridge structures and abutments in particular of integral Bridges must be designed 
for the movements due to thermal strains, both increasing and decreasing, and the decreasing 
strains due to shrinkage of the superstructure if it is concrete, and in addition the decreasing 
strains due to creep in case of pre-stressed concrete decks. The forces developed in the 
structural system are a function of the relative stiffness of the elements, their foundations, 
their interaction with the surrounding soils and sequence of construction.
6.1.2	
The forces due to applied loads must also be accommodated, and these are the 
dead loads, the vehicular live loads plus impact, the horizontal force due to wind, vehicle 
braking and centrifugal force and seismic force as applicable.
6.1.3	
The connection between the superstructure and the substructure must also be 
designed for a Minimum Lateral Restraint Capacity to ensure that the superstructure has 
sufficient lateral restraint to resist unaccounted lateral forces notwithstanding that has been 
catered for in the design. Integral Bridges therefore should also be designed for a force of 
500kN or 5% of the superstructure dead load, whichever is the greater acting at the junction of 
superstructure and substructure in addition to the actual forces. This force is to be considered 
at Ultimate Limit State.
6.2	
Longitudinal Movement:
6.2.1	
Integral Bridges should be designed to accommodate the effects of thermal 
expansion and other longitudinal forces, with thrusts from structural restraints, earth pressures 
and friction. They should also be designed for the effects of thermal contraction, with axial 
tension from structural constraint and sliding.
6.2.2	
The effects of temperature difference, shrinkage, and creep should also be 
considered in accordance with relevant clauses of IRC:6 and IRC:112.
6.2.3	
The temperature variation for Integral Bridges is to be taken assuming that 
during construction the bridge is made monolithic at following temperature ranges as given 
in IRC:6.

6.2.4	
The longitudinal movements calculated above as per IRC:6 and IRC:112 are 
serviceability Limit State values and should be multiplied by a factor of 1.25 to convert them 
to Ultimate Limit State Values.
6.3	
Thermal Effects:
6.3.1	
The Integral Bridges shall be designed for seasonal variation of temperature and 
shrinkage strains duly taking into account the sympathetic effects due to creep of concrete. 
In case of concrete structures when long term temperature movement is considered due to 
seasonal variation of temperature, the thermal modulus of elasticity may be taken as one-half 
that used for dynamic loads. Such benefits however shall not be considered for short-term 
movements caused due to daily variation in temperature (gradient effect).
6.3.2	
The temperature gradient loading shall be considered in line with provisions of 
IRC:6. The effect of sympathetic creep shall not be considered for temperature gradient effects.
6.3.3	
Special attention should be given to prevent early thermal and shrinkage cracking 
resulting from restraint to the longitudinal movement of deck slabs, by integral abutments.
6.3.4	
Bridges which are curved, or not symmetric, experience thermal movements 
relative to a zero movement point. The position of the zero movement point can be determined 
from a stiffness analysis employing horizontal stiffness at supports and abutments.
6.4	
Earth Pressure
6.4.1	
The earth pressure coefficient is a function of the displacement or rotation of 
the earth retaining structure. An integral abutment bridge will experience elongation and 
contraction of superstructure due to temperature variations during its service life. Thus 
the earth pressure at the abutments should be considered in correlation with temperature 
variations.
6.4.2	
A small displacement of the bridge away from the backfill soil can cause 
development of active earth pressure conditions. Therefore when the bridge contracts, due 
to fall in temperature, shrinkage, creep etc., active earth pressure will be developed behind 
the abutment.
Active earth pressure on abutments due to thermal contraction of decks are usually very 
small as compared to passive pressure and may be ignored.
6.4.3	
At rest earth pressure condition behind the abutment may be assumed when there 
is no thermal movement.



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 40
======================================================================
18
IRC:SP:115-2018
6.4.4	
When the bridge expands due to rise in temperature, the intensity of the earth 
pressure behind the abutment depends on the magnitude of the bridge displacement towards 
the backfill soil. The actual earth pressure coefficient may change between at rest ‘Ko’ and 
passive ‘Kp’ depending upon the amount of displacement of the abutment.
6.4.5	
Live load surcharge on backfill shall be ignored while calculating the passive earth 
pressure mobilised by thermal expansion of the deck.
6.4.6	
A summary of the proposed design earth pressure distributions with depth for the 
different structural form is as follows:
i)	
Shallow height bank seat abutments
	
The typical height of a bank seat abutment is up to 3.0 metres, and therefore 
the total force generated by passive excitation is usually readily accommodated 
within the design. The following equation to calculate the relationship between K*, 
the retained height (H) and thermal displacement of the top of the abutment (d), 
should be used.
	
K*=Ko+ (d/0.025H)0.4 x Kp
	
Where :
	
K*= Design earth pressure coefficient
	
Ko= At rest earth pressure coefficient
	
Kp= Passive earth pressure coefficient
	
The passive earth pressure coefficient shall be taken based on wall friction. δ=φ/2.
ii)	
Full height frame abutments with fixity at base
	
With the increase in the height of abutment, the magnitude of passive pressure 
acting on the back of the wall is likely to be significant. Careful design of the 
abutment is therefore important to ensure that the structure is strong enough to 
resist lateral pressures that could build up behind the wall, and yet flexible enough 
to accommodate movement. The earth pressure coefficient, being a function of 
abutment displacement, the following distribution of earth pressure coefficient is 
assumed:
	
•	
Earth Pressure with uniform value of K* over the top half of the retained 
height of the wall.
	
•	
Earth pressure then remaining constant with depth as K* drops towards Ko.
	
•	
Below this depth, pressures are according to the in-situ value Ko.
	
For framed abutments with fixity at base, the following equation which is based 
on wall friction, δ=φ/2 has been used to calculate the relationship between K*, the 
retained height (H) and thermal displacement of the top of abutment, (d):
	
K* = (d/0.05H)0.4x Kp
	
K* shall however not be taken less than the ‘at-rest’ earth pressure ‘Ko’.
iii)	
Full height frame abutments with hinge at the base
	
For framed abutments with hinge at base, the earth pressure distribution as given 
in 6.3.5 (ii) above shall be applicable except that the relationship between K*, the 



======================================================================

19

IRC:SP:115-2018
retained height (H) and thermal displacement of the top of abutment, (d) will be 
given by :
	
K*=Ko+ (d/0.03H)0.6 x Kp
iv)	
Full height embedded wall type abutment
	
Embedded wall type abutments are installed in undisturbed ground. For embedded 
walls, the earth pressure distribution may be represented by:
	
•	
Earth Pressure with uniform value of K* over the top two-thirds of the retained 
height of the wall.
	
•	
Earth pressure then varying from K* to Ko upto retained height of wall.
	
•	
Below that depth, pressures are according to the in-situ value Ko.
	
For wall type abutments with fixity at base, the following equation which is based 
on wall friction, δ= φ/2 has been used to calculate the relationship between K*, the 
retained height (H) and thermal displacement of the top of abutment,(d) :
	
K* = (d/0.05H)0.4 x Kp
	
K* shall however not be taken less than the ‘at-rest’ earth pressure ‘Ko’
v)	
Flexible Support Abutments :
	
For flexible support abutments, the earth pressure shall be taken from the details 
as given above as per the chosen structural arrangement. For combined behaviour 
with RS wall, the relevant provision of IRC guideline on RS wall shall be referred.
6.5	
Partial Load Factors
6.5.1	
Integral bridges should be designed for limit state design approach for load 
combinations and corresponding partial load factors as shown in Annex B of IRC:6.
6.5.2	
Earth pressure coefficients on abutments should be multiplied by a material partial 
safety factor, γm = 1.0
6.5.3	
Passive earth resistance forces on abutments should be calculated in accordance 
with clause 6.4 and treated as a permanent load effect with partial safety factors of:
	
FOR ULS 1.5
	
FOR SLS 1.0
7 ANALYSIS
7.1	
The IBs, are complicated structural systems for design. Apart from considering 
the primary loads (i,e. dead, live, wind …etc.), secondary loads (such as creep, shrinkage, 
settlement, temperature effects ..etc.) need also to be considered under serviceability limit 
state as well as ultimate limit state.
7.2	
Methods of analysis, methods of modelling of structure for analysis, as given 
in existing code IRC:112 (For reinforced/prestressed concrete structures), IRC:22 (For 
composite structures) and IRC:24 (For steel structures) will be applicable for integral bridges 
as well. Linear Elastic analysis may be used for both the serviceability and ultimate limit 
states.

IRC:SP:115-2018
7.3	
For the determination of action effects, linear analysis may be carried out 
assuming:
	
i)	
Uncracked cross sections
	
ii)	
Linear stress-strain relationship and
	
iii)	
Value of the modulus of elasticity as per IRC:112.

For the thermal deformation, settlement and shrinkage effects at the Ultimate Limit State 
(ULS), a reduced stiffness corresponding to the cracked section neglecting tension stiffening 
but including the effects of creep, may be assumed. For the Serviceability Limit State (SLS) 
a gradual evolution of cracking should be considered.
7.4	
Limit Equilibrium method of analysis :
For full height abutments on spread footings which accommodate thermal movements by 
rotation and/or flexure, the design value of the earth pressure coefficient for expansion K* 
may be calculated from the equation, as given in Clause 6.4.6 in this guideline.
For abutments that accommodate thermal movements by translation without rotation, such 
as bank pad and semi-integral end screen abutments, the earth pressure coefficient for 
expansion, K*, maybe calculated from the equation, as given in Clause 6.4.6 in this guideline.
7.5	
Soil-Structure interaction analysis needs to be performed for analysis of 
integral bridges under following situations :
	
a.	
abutments and piers founded on single row of piles;



======================================================================

embedded wall abutments;
	
c.	
abutments with over-consolidated backfill material;
	
d.	
abutment on cohesive soil
	
e.	
abutment in layered soil
As an alternative to the limit equilibrium method described in 7.4 and for bridges excluded by 
the requirements of 7.4 such as piled abutments and embedded wall abutments, the horizontal 
earth pressures on integral abutments may be evaluated using recognized soil–structure 
interaction methods incorporating an appropriate numerical model of the soil properties.
In situations where limit equilibrium method is not applicable, specialist literature may be 
referred incorporating appropriate soil structure interaction matrix. In all other cases, where 
abutments or piers are founded on spread footing or on pile cap with more than one row of 
piles, the simplified ‘limit equilibrium analysis’ method can be used for the design of integral 
bridges. However for the design of pile foundation proper, soil structure interaction may be 
considered. The sensitivity analysis also shall be carried out using upper and lower bound 
modulus of subgrade reaction.
8 DESIGN and DETAILING ASPECTS
8.1	
General
Integral bridges should be designed to resist all the vertical and lateral loads acting on them 
individually and in combination. The combined load effects on the structure at various stages 
of construction and stage by stage development of stresses in structural members should be 
considered in the design. The stages at which the structure is simply supported, then made 
integral with abutments, and backfilling are of primary importance. Design should be carried 
out according to the limit state provisions of current IRC codes, using the same limit state 
principles as any other bridge type, taking appropriate partial safety factors.
8.2	
Structural Forms
All types of structural forms can be adopted with Integral abutments. The possible types 
commonly used are :
	
a)	
Precast RCC/PSC Girder with in-situ RCC deck slab for composite action.
	
b)	
Steel Girder with RCC in-situ RCC deck slab for composite action.
	
c)	
Cast-in-place Solid Slab/Voided Slab deck
	
d)	
RCC/Prestressed Box Girder deck
The selection is governed by the project economics and functional requirements, in the same 
manner as for the traditional bridges.
Integral abutment forms such as piled abutments, spread footings, full-height abutments, and 
RS walls are mainly dictated by geotechnical considerations.
Detailing of the connection between Superstructure and Substructure requires special 
considerations when precast concrete superstructure is adopted. Particular attention is

required for the following:
	
a)	
Embedment of precast concrete beams into the abutment
	
b)	
The reinforcement detail for the moment connection between the abutment 
and the precast beams
	
c)	
Detailed construction staging consideration of beams and abutments for 
prediction of beam end rotations due to creep and shrinkage.
8.3	
Component Design Considerations
8.3.1	
Girder Design
	
a)	
Precast Girders (bare and composite) may be designed conservatively 
assuming no fixity at abutments for DL, LL and SDL assuming conventional 
approach.
	
b)	
The connection between deck and abutment can be considered to be ‘fixed’ 
or ‘pinned’ somewhere between ‘fixed’ and ‘pinned’, depending upon the 
sequence and stage of construction.
	
c)	
The beneficial effects of axial compression induced in the girders due to 
earth pressure should not be included in the design of the girders.
	
d)	
The design details used to achieve a rigid connection between the 
superstructure and the substructure vary for different types of superstructures. 
In addition, specific considerations may be required to reflect other design 
aspects, such as lateral movements, vibrations, sub surface soil conditions, 
backfill requirements …etc. These aspects may have a considerable effect 
on the performance, integrity, and durability of the integral abutment design. 
Typical details generally adopted are shown in Fig. 8.1 & Fig. 8.2.
	
e)	
In case precast girders / steel girders are used, natural / elastomeric rubber 
pads, supported on 150 mm high concrete pedestal may be used to support 
the girder initially. This will allow for rotation of girder end to take place before 
attaining fixity with abutment. The rubber pad can be eventually embedded 
into concrete, as shown in Fig. 8.1 & Fig. 8.2.
	
f)	
The longitudinal forces induced in the superstructure due to movements are 
directly related to the lateral resistance of the integral abutment. In designing 
the substructure, attention should be paid to details that provide flexibility 
and reduce unwanted restraints. Where piles are bored into stiff soils, pre-
drilled oversized holes filled with loose sand should be provided to reduce 
resistance to lateral movements and reduce pile stresses.
8.3.2	
Abutment Design
	
a)	
It is recommended to have a symmetrical structural arrangement with both 
the abutments of same height. A difference in abutment height causes 
unbalanced lateral loads resulting in side sway.
	
b)	
The distribution of moments from wing walls to the abutments should be 
considered in the design of horizontal reinforcement in the abutment.



======================================================================

======================================================================
23

IRC:SP:115-2018
	
c)	
The maximum bending moment obtained from frame analysis should be 
assumed to act at the corner of the idealized frame at the junction of abutment 
and deck. The design bending moment at the critical section, located at the 
soffit of deck, should be derived from frame analysis.
8.3.3	
Foundation Design
	
a)	
Spread footings, Single row as well as double row of piles can be used at 
abutments. The top of the pile should be suitably embedded into the abutment 
walls/capping beam and should be adequately reinforced to transfer the 
forces.
	
b)	
In stiff soils, piles should preferably be placed in pre-augured holes filled with 
loose sand.
	
c)	
Wherever settlement of soil is likely, adopt appropriate ground improvement 
measures.

8.4	
Drainage
	
a)	
An efficient drainage system as per relevant IRC Code/Guideline should be 
incorporated in the design. To avoid water intrusion behind the abutment, the 
approach slab should be connected directly to the abutment and appropriate 
provisions made to provide for drainage of any entrapped water.
	
b)	
Integral abutments should have permeable backing as specified for earth 
retaining structures in relevant IRC codes. The permeable backing should be 
drained with a pipe of at least 150 mm diameter which has a suitable slope 
for outfall.
8.5	
Bridge Approach System
The approach system of an integral bridge, comprising of the backfill, the approach fill, the 
approach slab, the sleeper slab and the foundation soil, are important elements for the long

term performance and serviceability behavior of integral bridges. Imposed deformations from 
the bridge deck are transferred to the abutment and the approach slab, which leads to a 
strong soil-structure interaction in the approach zone. Fig. 8.3 below shows various elements 
of an approach system.
Fig. 8.3 Elements of Bridge Approach System for Integral Bridge
To ensure efficient performance of the approach system, the following guidelines should be 
followed :
	
a.	
Minimum recommended length of approach slab is 6 m. The approach slab 
should be positively attached to the back-wall by reinforcing bars (Fig. 8.4).

b.	
The connection between approach slab and bracket should be detailed to 
act as a pin with tension steel transferred across the approach span into the 
back-wall of integral abutments. The detail should allow for some tolerance 
between the approach slab and the bracket of back wall such that no damage 
occurs due to settlement.
	
c.	
A sleeper slab is placed at the roadway end of the approach slab. The intent 
of this slab is to provide a relatively solid foundation for the far end of the 
approach slab and to provide a location for limited expansion and contraction 
(Fig. 8.5). Sufficient allowance for expansion of the super-structure must be 
accommodated in the sleeper slab. Otherwise compression can be introduced

into the slab by closing the expansion gap and subsequently activating the 
passive pressure behind the sleeper slab, or from contact with the adjacent 
roadway pavement. The latter can often be a major issue for spalling and 
heaving of the adjacent pavement.
	
d.	
Crash barrier and kerbs should have a clear discontinuity with joint at the 
junction of bridge proper and its approaches.

Wing Walls
Wing Walls, wherever required, should preferably be independently supported and should 
not be a part of the integral bridge structure.
8.7	
Expansion Joints
To cater for the cyclic movements of the bridge abutments / approach slabs, a suitable type of 
expansion joint (buried, asphalt plug, compression seal, or strip seal type) shall be provided 
as per IRC:SP:69 at the location of sleeper slab between end of approach slab and pavement 
as shown in Fig. 8.3.
9 INSPECTION and MAINTENANCE CONSIDERATIONS
9.1	
General
Generally, from the performance of integral bridges built in different countries, it is seen 
that though most of them are performing well, they require regular inspection, but reduced 
maintenance. To have a comprehensive maintenance strategy, it is important to inspect the 
bridge periodically with the understanding and knowledge of strategic bridge elements and 
locations which are vulnerable to distress.



======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 40
======================================================================
27

IRC:SP:115-2018
9.2	
Inspection
During inspection of integral bridges, the inspector should look for distress in following 
vulnerable areas:
	
a.	
Crack at the connection between abutment/pier and bridge superstructure: 
Significant change in temperature during initial concrete setting may cause 
distress at the junction.
	
b.	
Cracks in deck slab: In the case of skew integral bridges, diagonal cracks 
are often seen at the acute corner of bridge deck. Straight cracks may be 
seen over previously placed concrete end diaphragms. Transverse cracks at 
relatively uniform spacing, may occur as a result of insufficient continuous 
and temperature/shrinkage reinforcement on deck slab over end diaphragm.
	
c.	
Cracks in abutment, piers, girders, crash barrier…etc.
	
d.	
Longitudinal and transverse cracking of approach slab: Longitudinal cracking 
develops when voids are formed under approach slabs. If the backfill material 
is not perfectly elastic, voids are formed with cyclic movement due to diurnal 
temperature fluctuations.
	
e.	
Wet areas around seating level
	
f.	
Condition of expansion joints at the end of approach slab
	
g.	
Differential settlement between approach system and bridge abutments
	
h.	
Performance of drainage system at backfill.
9.3	
Maintenance
The preventive maintenance measures for integral bridges are similar to conventional bridges.
	
a.	
Crack repair of abutment wall, wing wall, deck slab, crash barrier, approach 
slab and at junction between abutment and bridge superstructure.
	
b.	
Overlaying, grouting or replacement of approach slab or backfill adjustments. 
when it settles excessively.
	
c.	
Repair or replacement of expansion joint at the location of sleeper slab.
	
d.	
Repair/replacement of damaged kerbs, crash barriers.
	
e.	
Periodic cleaning of clogged drains and drainage spouts.

SP:40 shall be referred.
10 PERFORMANCE MONITORING
This Section deals with performance monitoring of integral bridges. Condition assessment 
is generally carried out during service through visual inspection, as discussed in Section 9, 
which involves subjective judgment of inspectors and which enables detection of only local 
and visible defects. However, visual inspection cannot evaluate the reserved strength or 
deformation capacity of a bridge. In many situations local defects might not have significant 
effect on the global performance.

IRC:SP:115-2018
Sensor based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has revolutionized the traditional bridge 
inspection in a more timely, objective and quantitative manner. Performance monitoring of 
bridges can be used to verify the current design approaches and suggest future improvement 
in design. The results of monitoring can be used for making scientific decisions in terms of 
prioritization of bridges for strengthening or retrofitting.
From the design practices of integral bridges around the world, it is seen that geotechnical 
considerations and thermal effects have vital role in the performance and in deciding the span 
limit upto which this type of bridges with reduced maintenance requirements can be adopted. 
More insight can be obtained through performance monitoring of some of the integral bridges 
being constructed in our country in line with international practices. A very brief discussion 
on performance parameters and sensor type that can be used for monitoring of bridge is 
included in this guideline.
10.1	
Performance Parameters
While planning the instrumentation scheme due attention is to be paid to measure the 
parameters required to capture behavior of various bridge components. Number and type of 
sensors and its locations are to be decided carefully based on mathematical modeling and 
analysis under the loading conditions which are very important for the design. Therefore, to 
understand the performance, the parameters to be measured and sensors that can be used 
are given in Table 10.1 as some of these sensors will have to be embedded during different 
construction stages of a bridge. Also, location of bridge, span length, height of abutment, 
geotechnical parameters and so on will have to be considered in deciding the instrumentation 
scheme.
