FOREWORD
The Special
Publication Number 30 on "Manual on Economic Evaluation of
Highway Projects in India" was first published by the Indian Roads Congress in the
year 1984 and subsequently revised version of this manual was published in 1993. Since
1 984, this manual has been recognized as an invaluable tool for the highway engineers,
who are not professional transport economists by education or training, to understand and
evaluate the economic implications of a highway project.
It was very well received by highway
professionals all over the country.
However, during the last decade, the equations for Vehicle Operating Cost (VOC)
and other parameters provided
in the manual has become obsolete considering two
important reasons. Firstly, the economic liberalization process initiated in India more than
fifteen years ago has resulted in the entry of vehicles having better fuel-efficiency and also
possessing excellent pick-up in the Indian market. Due to this,
it has become imperative
that the research on road user cost has to be reviewed and updated periodically so as to
adequately represent the changed conditions. Secondly, the cost parameters considered
in the first revision of this manual has also undergone radical changes during the intervening
period due to cost escalations.
In view of the above, the research scheme sponsored by the Ministry of Shipping,
Road Transport and Highways (MOSRTH) titled, "Updation of Road User Cost Data"
conducted by Central Road Research
Institute, New Delhi
in 2001 has served as the
backbone for bringing out this updated version i.e. second revision of this manual. Further,
the research findings obtained from other studies have also been incorporated
in this
updated version. The updated VOC equations incorporated in this manual accounts for
changes in the new generation vehicles in terms of their operating characteristics coupled
with design characteristics of the roads. Therefore, this manual is expected to be a valuable
tool for working out economic justification of medium and large sized highway projects.
It
is hoped that the highway engineers as well as consultants will be able to use this revised
manual for making comparative evaluation of choices with respect to the road development
programmes.

1 INTRODUCTION
IRC:SP:30-2009
1 .1
During the last forty years, a number of research studies
1
3
4 10 12 14 15 16 have been
conducted to understand the relationship between the standards of road design (which
depends upon the investments/costs) and the road user cost. Further, the changing
vehicle technology, traffic mix and road conditions have necessitated the research on
road user cost to be reviewed and updated periodically so as to adequately represent
the changed conditions. For a proper assessment of economics of road projects,
it is
felt prudent to develop a uniform method of economic evaluation based on realistic
quantification of costs and benefits. Moreover, this would facilitate rapid evaluation so
that a large number of schemes/alternatives can be broadly evaluated to assist the
decision makers in their job. Based on the above studies, the Manual on Economic
Evaluation of Highway Projects in India was first published in
1 984 and subsequently
revised in 1993. However,
it was noted that this Manual had become outdated and
therefore
it was felt essential to update this Manual
in the light of Road User Cost
(RUC) data developed based on the research scheme of the Ministry of Shipping,
Road Transport and Highways (MOSRTH) conducted in 2001
. In view of this, Transport
Planning, Traffic Engineering and Road Safety Committee (H-1) of Indian Roads
Congress had decided
in
its first meeting held on 16 June 2006 to undertake the
'second revision' of this publication. The composition of the H-1 Committee is as given

In the second meeting of the H-1 Committee held on 26 September, 2006, Ms. Amanita
Singh, Feedback Ventures Limited, New Delhi and Dr. S. Velmurugan, Scientist, Central
Road Research
Institute (CRRI), New Delhi gave presentations before the H-1
Committee based on
their research work. After detailed discussions, the H-1
Committee constituted a sub-committee consisting of Dr.LR.Kadiyali (Convener) and
Dr.S.Velmurugan for finalising the revised document combining these efforts. The H-1
Committee approved the draft revision of SP:30 submitted by the above sub-committee
in
its meeting held on 11 January, 2008 subject to incorporation of comments by a
sub-group consisting
of S/Shri S.C. Sharma, V.K.Sinha,
Dr.
L.R.
Kadiyali and
Dr.S.Velmurugan. This sub-group highly appreciated the excellent work done by
Dr.
L.R.
Kadiyali and
Dr.S.Velmurugan
in
bringing out this revised document.
Subsequently, H-1 Committee again considered the draft document of IRC:SP:30 during
*
the meeting held on 4 November, 2008 and recommended that
it may be forwarded to
the Council through Highways Standards and Specifications (HSS) Committee. The
HSS Committee approved the modified draft in
its meeting held on 23, November
2008. Thereafter, the Council of IRC in its meeting held at Kolkata on 13, December
2008 considered the 'second revision' of IRC:SP:30 and approved for publication.

1 .2
For a developing country like India, roads and road transport play an important
role in economic growth. The construction of roads brings about a variety of benefits
that are enjoyed practically by all sectors of the economy. The scarcity of resources
and competing demands from various sectors are the dominating features of a
developing economy.
It, therefore, becomes extremely necessary to allocate the scare
resources in the most beneficial manner amongst various sectors and, within a sector,
amongst various schemes.
In the absence of an adequate database, highway
planners
in India have been selecting schemes on a tentative basis, depending
primarily on past experiences.
It is quite likely that such an ad-hoc approach might
lead to the selection of wrong solutions. For example, the planners so far placed a
heavy reliance on the cost of construction of the facility initially, which they could
estimate accurately, when selecting alternative schemes. Other important aspects
such as the cost of maintaining the facility in future and the cost borne by the road
user were disregarded.
1.3
With the accomplishment of the Road User Cost Study (RUCS) completed
in
India
in 1982 and the subsequent updating of RUCS data carried out
in 1992 and
2001
,
it is now possible for the highway planners to evaluate the benefits from highway
projects on an accurate basis. Consequently, economic analysis of highway projects
has become more scientific and rational.
1.4
Highway economic analysis, also known as highway project appraisal
is a
technique whereby the costs of and benefits from a scheme are quantified over a
selected time horizon and evaluated by a common yardstick. The technique is also
known as Benefit-Cost (B-C) analysis.
1.5
Economic evaluation serves a number of purposes 6 7 13 18 19 which included the
following:
i)
Preparation of highway plans at the national, regional or local level within
the overall development plan.
ii)
To rank schemes within the highway sector plan competing
for scare
resources in order of priority.
iii)
To assess in phasing the road programme over a period of time depending
upon the availability of resources.

iv)
To compare mutually exclusive schemes and select the most attractive.
v)
To determine whether a scheme under consideration is worth investing.
vi)
To evaluate alternative strategies such as stage-construction or
full
construction; alternative specifications such as flexible pavement or rigid
pavement; alternative policies such as increased outlay on maintenance or
increased outlay on
rehabilitation;
alternative design standards and
alternative policy options on axle loads.
The present manual is intended to help the highway planners and engineers in India to
undertake economic evaluation of highway projects under non-urban conditions. The
manual has been prepared from various published books and other sources which
have been referenced so that the more inquisitive reader may be able to reach the
original material
if need be.
2 BASIC CONCEPTS OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
2.1
The subject of highway economic analysis has developed during the past five
decades through the contribution of analysis belonging to various disciplines and
notably highway engineers and economists. There were many issues on which
conflicting view points prevailed in the early stages of the evolution of the subject, but
with the passage of time, there is now a general agreement on many important concepts.
The analyst now has the advantage of the collective wisdom of the earlier practitioners
of the art.
'
\ ^eonal View Pmni
In the highway sector, the construction and maintenance of the highways are financed
from government funds, whereas the highway user is the general public. This implies
that the costs of construction and maintenance are borne by the government, whereas
the benefits arising out of highway construction and improvements are reaped by the
general public. The construction of a highway or its improvement may also have an
effect on another mode of transport, such as the railways, wholly owned and operated
by the government.
It
is, therefore, logical that the multiplicity of interests can be
encompassed
if the economic analysis is done from a national view point, rather than
a restricted view point of the government or one of its wings or the public at large. This
implies that consequences to any person or anybody in the country should be accounted
for in the analysis.

IRC:SP:30-2009
2.3
Difference between Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis
In financial analysis, one is concerned with the ways and means of financing a project
(by floating bonds or by levying
toll) and the financial
profitability of the project.
Economic analysis, on the other hand, is not concerned with the sources of financing,
the availability of funds and the allocation of funds 17
18
. As such, funding of projects is a
management decision. For example, the construction of a tolled highway or expressway
has to be examined on the basis of its cost and the expected toll collections and the
management may take a decision to construct the same
if the toll collection seems to
be attractive enough. Such an analysis is financial in nature. Economic viability which
concerns with the consequences to all segments of the society, will still be necessary
in such a case to establish its economic viability. However, even after the economic
viability of a project has been established, the government may not take up the project
due to lack of funds or because of the fact that the financial analysis has indicated that
the returns are not attractive for the funding and recovery procedure selected.
2.4
Analysis is a Study of the Future
Economic analysis is not concerned about past events and investments.
It is essentially
a study of the future. The analysis, therefore, should estimate future traffic, costs and
benefits.
2.5
All Possible Alternatives should be Considered
The very basis of economic analysis being the selection of the most attractive option
and
in this regard,
it is necessary that the analyst evaluates a number of possible
alternatives. Of course, the basic alternative is the 'do-nothing', or the continuation of
the present situation. All other alternatives are evaluated against this basic condition.
2.6
Marginal Differences
When considering a number of alternatives,
it is not sufficient to evaluate each of them
against the basic "do-nothing" alternative.
It
is also advantageous to consider the
marginal differences
in costs and benefits between two alternatives and carry out
incremental analysis to establish whether the increment
in investment also yields
justifiable incremental benefits.
2.7
All Consequences should be Considered
The investments on highways bring about a variety of consequences, some of which
can be quantified into monetary terms and some cannot. All consequences which can
be quantified monetarily should be considered and included
in the analysis. Non-
quantifiable effects should also be identified and presented to the decision maker.

For example, impact of the project on the environment
is an extremely important
consideration in building highways. But
it is very difficult to quantify in monetary terms
the adverse effect on environment. All the same, at the Project Appraisal stage, the
highway engineer must at least qualitatively highlight the effect on environment.
2.8
Analysis Period should not Extend Beyond the Period of Reliable
Forecasts
There is considerable uncertainty of forecasts beyond a certain reasonable period.
Human behaviour may change, travel pattern may undergo a shift and technology may
experience transformation. Thus
it is worthwhile to limit the analysis period to one of
reliable forecasts. Moreover, since future costs and benefits are to be discounted, the
inclusion or omission of costs or benefits beyond a reasonable period is hardly likely
to influence the results. A period of 1 5-20 years beyond the completion of the project is
generally considered for highway projects whereas in the case of expressway projects,
the analysis period is considered up to 25 years.
2.9
All Future Cash Flows to be brought to a Common Time Datum
The present and future costs and benefits occur at different points of time. In order to
evaluate them on a common basis, they should be reduced to equivalent values at a
common date. This procedure is known as discounted cash flow and is based on the
concept of time value of money.
2.10 Cost and Benefit Components of Equal Magnitude
There may be some cost and benefit components which remain equal in magnitude
for all the alternatives. They may be omitted since they will in any case cancel out in the
analysis.
3 TIME VALUE OF MONEY
3.1
Concept of Time Value of Money
Money appreciates in value in course of time due to the interest
it earns. To illustrate
the concept, consider Rs
1 00 today, which
if invested at
1 0 percent compound rate of
interest, becomes Rs 673 at the end of 20 years. Thus, Rs
1 00 today is worth Rs 673
at the end of 20 years. In other words, Rs 673 at the end of 20 years is worth only Rs
1 00 now. This concept helps the analyst in reducing all future costs and benefits to a
common date and thus evaluate on a common basis. The concept is thus the foundation
on which the entire structure of economic analysis is built.

3.2
Definition of Commonly Used Terms
Interest is defined as the money paid for borrowed money.
It also indicates the return
obtainable by the productive investment of capital.
Interest Rate is the interest paid or the return obtained at the end of one year, expressed
as a percentage of the capital at the beginning of the year. Interest rate can be either
simple rate (where the interest is paid to the lender every year) or compound rate
(where the interest accrued is added to the capital).
Present Worth is the present value of a future payment or a series of future payments
at the given rate of interest.
In the example given
in Para 3.1
, the present worth of
Rs 673 at the end of twenty years
is Rs 100 at a rate of interest of 10 percent per
annum (compound).
Discounting is the process of calculating the present worth of a future payment. Thus,
in the above example, Rs 673 at the end of twenty years, when discounted at
1 0 percent
per annum, amounts to Rs
1 00 at the present time. Discount rate is the interest rate at
which future payments are reduced to a common time.
Rate of Return is the term commonly used in economic analysis for the rate at which
economic benefits are obtained by a project. Though
it generally means the same as
interest rate of discount rate are more appropriate
in economic analysis. The term
interest rate is more commonly used while borrowing capital.
Minimum Attractive Rate of Return (MARR)
is that rate of return which must be
ensured in any project
if
it has to be selected for implementation.
3.3
Compound Interest Equations
The mathematical problems involving compound interest have been simplified by the
use of six standard equations presented in Table
1
.
The ready-made tables indicating the values of the above mentioned factors for various
values of interest rates are given in Annex A. The use of the tables presented in Annex
A is illustrated in the following examples:
Example 1
:
Find the future worth of Rs
1 00 000 at the end of 20 years invested at a compound rate
of interest of 12 percent per annum.
From Table 45,
=
9.6463
CA (12%, 20 years)
=
Rs 100 000
x 9.6463
Therefore, future worth at the end of 20 years
=
Rs 9 64 630.

4 TOTAL TRANSPORTATION COST
In highway economic analysis, one has to consider the total transportation cost, which
comprises the following:
1)
Cost of construction of the facility initially
•
2)
Periodic cost of maintaining the facility over its design life
3)
Road User Cost
The three components are interdependent, and the designer has to choose that
alternative which holds the sum total of the three to a minimum. Road User Cost is
composed of the following main components:
1 )
Vehicle Operating Cost
2)
Time Cost
3)
Accident Cost
The detailed discussions on the determination of costs and benefits for economic
analysis are given later.
5 DETERMINATION OF HIGHWAY COSTS
5.1
The first two components of the total transportation discussed earlier, viz. the
cost of construction of the facility initially and the periodic cost maintenance of the
facility over its design life are known collectively by the term 'highway costs'.
5.2
The cost of construction of the facility includes the following:
i)
Survey, investigation and design costs
ii)
Land acquisition costs
iii)
Construction costs
iv)
Physical contingencies (unforeseen items and unforeseen increase in cost
not attributable to escalation and unforeseen increase in quantities)
v)
Supervision, quality control and administration charges
5.3
The cost of maintenance of the facility includes the following:
1 )
Ordinary repairs such as patch repairs, pot-hole filling, dressing earth work, etc.
2)
Periodic repairs, such as renewals and resurfacing
3)
Any emergent or special repairs
4)
Operational expenses, such as traffic signals,
traffic aid posts,
lighting,
policing etc.
5)
Supervision and administration charges.
10



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 368
======================================================================
IRC:SP:30-2009
5.4
When dealing with the highway costs,
it is necessary to phase the same year by
year. For example,
if a project estimated to cost Rs
1 00 crore is sanctioned now, the
expenditure will generally be incurred over a period of 3-5 years depending upon various
factors.
It is necessary to break-down the outlays in each year of its construction. As
an illustration, the breakdown of cost for a road project amounting to Rs
1 00 crore is
given in Table 2.
Table 2 Breakdown of Cost Outlay

1
10.0
2
20.0
3
30.0
4
40.0
Total
100.0
Similarly, in the case of maintenance costs, year-by-year costs have to be identified.
Thus,
if the yearly maintenance cost of the highway project illustrated earlier are Rs
0.50 crore and the cost of renewal of the surface once in five years is Rs 2.00 crore,
it
will be represented as given in Table 3.

5.5
Difference between Economic Costs and Financial Costs
In economic analysis, one is concerned with economic costs and not financial costs.
Financial costs are easy to determine, because they represent the actual amount one
has to pay to get a road constructed and maintained. They are the engineer's estimates
to get the project sanctioned and they are shown in the account books and budgets. In
a perfectly competitive market and where taxes are not levied, the financial cost is
very nearly equal to the economic cost. But when the market is imperfect and where
taxes are levied, the financial costs and economic costs are not the same. Economic
costs are based on the "opportunity cost" of each of the constituent costs such as
labour, material and machinery. In order to derive the economic costs, these constituents
have to be isolated, quantified and adjusted on the basis of certain principles discussed
in the succeeding section.
5.6
Shadow Pricing
In many developing countries, a considerable amount of distortions have arisen in the
prices as a result of government policies, regulations and bad investment planning.
This scenario is true in the case of Indian situation as the domestic prices of many
commodities are administered by the government and the traded prices are not at par
with the international market prices. The minimum wages, especially of unskilled labour
are also fixed statutorily by the government, and in an over-populated and labour-surplus
economy like India, the wages do not truly reflect the economic cost. Foreign exchange
is extremely precious for the Indian economy, but the official exchange rate does not
reflect this. Adjustments needed in the prices of goods and wages to make them reflect
truly their market value are known as shadow pricing.
The wages of unskilled labour are regulated by the government and are also determined
by the bargaining power of the trade unions. Since there
is a large unemployment
problem in this sector in the country, the wages paid do not reflect the surplus conditions.
If true market forces were to be at work, the wages might probably come down. The
exact determination of the shadow wage rate depends upon a number of factors and
this indeed is a complicated matter. For Indian conditions,
it is assumed that the shadow
wage rate is half the actual wages paid. For semi-skilled and skilled labour, there is no
need to do shadow-pricing since there is generally a scarcity of these categories and
the market wages more or less reflect this situation.
If the analyst has reasons to believe
that the statutory wage rates are low, there is a justification for an upward shadow-
pricing of semi-skilled and skilled labour wages. The current practice in the Project
Appraisal Division of the Planning Commission is not to segregate labour component
and not to use shadow wage rate 5
.
India is by and large self sufficient in highway construction machinery and materials
needed for the project. Nevertheless special occasions may arise when some items
of modern equipment or some materials have
to be imported.
For example,
12



======================================================================
PAGE 27 of 368
======================================================================
IRC:SP:30-2009
sophisticated state of the art hot mix plants, paver finishers and concrete paving
equipment may have to be imported for major projects. Foreign exchange is scarce in
a developing country like India and to value the import cost at the official exchange
rate would be to disregard this fact. Hence, the general practice in the country is to
shadow price foreign exchange at 25 percent above the official rate.
Certain commodities are both produced locally and imported. Atypical example
is
fuel oil. The domestic price may not reflect the true international price. In such cases,
it
is desirably to consider the border price (price at the country's border, which is the
c.i.f. price).
It is, of course, a debatable point whether the border price should further
be adjusted to reflect foreign exchange out-go in the case of imports.
If such adjustment
is done,
it should bear a relation to the ratio of import to domestic production of the
commodity.
Taxes are levied by the Government on a number of items of goods which are inputs to
the cost of highway project. They include import duty, excise duty and sales tax. Such
taxes do not represent an economic cost as they are not part of the cost of resources
used
in the production of the goods. They are
in fact transfer payments within the
economy. Similarly, license fees fall into the same category. Certain commodities may
be sold in the country of subsidized rates. Such subsidies should be disregarded in
economic evaluation.
All the above principles of shadow pricing apply equally to the cost streams (namely,
highway construction and maintenance cost) and the benefit streams (namely, road
user benefits). As an approximation in many of the projects taken up in India, a factor
of 0.80
- 0.90 has been used to convert financial costs of road works to economic
costs.
5.7
Treatment of Inflation
The construction of a highway project takes a number of years and during this period,
the cost of labour, materials and equipment may undergo an inflationary trend. Similarly,
the benefits of reduced Vehicle Operating Costs may be higher in future years due to
inflation. Since general inflation results in the price rise in all goods, the relative prices
remain constant. Hence,
it is the practice to disregard escalation and inflation, both on
the cost stream and the benefit stream. However, changes in relative prices should be
allowed at least upto the extent that they can be foreseen accurately which can help in
demonstrating how they affect costs and benefits differently.
5.8
Interest on Capital Cost of Construction
Highway projects in India are at present financed from government funds as well as
from private funds in the case of National Highways Development Project (NHDP)
road projects implemented under Build Operate and Transfer (BOT).
In the case of
13



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 368
======================================================================
IRC:SP:30-2009
government funded projects, there is no need to include yearly interest on the initial
cost of construction in economic analysis whereas in the case of BOT projects,
it is
necessary to include interest charges.
6.1
The quantification of economic benefits from highway projects is usually much
more difficult than determination of costs. This is because of the following reasons:
Benefits from highway are varied
in nature, some of them are direct and
some indirect. Direct benefits such as reduced Vehicle Operating Costs can
be easily measured, whereas indirect benefits such as improved agriculture
and accelerated growth of the economy cannot be measured easily.
Even when the benefits are direct, some of them are difficult to quantify.
Examples are: value of passenger time savings, value of reduced
air
pollution, value of reduced noise levels and value of improved aesthetics.
Benefits which occur in the future are closely related to future traffic, forecast
of which is difficult.
Benefits can be determined only when alternatives are considered. Since
there are many alternatives possible, benefits vary with each comparison.
If
the analyst misses an important alternative,
it
is likely that an accurate
measurement of benefits is missed and what is achieved by evaluation of
other alternatives is either an understatement or over-statement of benefits.
6.2
Sometimes, confusion is likely to occur in the minds of analysts whether to treat a
particular item, as "costs" or "benefits". Under these circumstances, the simple rule to
be followed to avoid such confusion is to denote the cash out-flows as negative and
hence costs, and cash in-flows as positive and hence benefits.
6.3
Types of Traffic Receiving Benefits
Benefits due to highway projects are received by the following categories of traffic:
i)
Normal traffic
ii)
Diverted traffic
iii)
Generated traffic or induced traffic
Normal traffic is the traffic which would have developed on the existing facility whether
or not any improvements would be made.
Diverted traffic is the traffic diverted on to, or away from, the route or mode being
studied. Thus, the construction or improvement of a road may take away traffic from a
railway line.
In that case, what appears as a benefit to the highway project due to
6 DETERMINATION OF BENEFITS
14



======================================================================
PAGE 29 of 368
======================================================================
IRC:SP:30-2009
increased
traffic
is actually a loss to the railways. Both should be quantified and
accounted for. Similarly,
if a bypass is constructed for a congested city, the existing
road will be decongested due to traffic diversion and will thus receive some reduction
in VOC. This also should be accounted for. Generated (or induced) traffic is the new
traffic that develops because of new travellers making use of improved or new facility.
The benefits to normal traffic and diverted traffic are evaluated by multiplying the change
in user costs by the change in traffic. However, while dealing with generated traffic, the
benefits are found by multiplying half the change in user costs by the change in traffic818
.
6.4
Benefits from Highway Improvements
The benefits from highway improvements can be broadly classified as under:
a)
Road User benefits
1 )
Vehicle Operating Cost (VOC) savings
2)
Value of travel time savings
3)
Value of savings in accident costs
4)
Savings in maintenance costs
b)
Social benefits
1 )
Improvements in administration, law and order and defence
2)
Improvements in health and education
3)
Improvements in agriculture, industry, trade and mining
4)
Improvements in environmental standards
5)
Appreciation in value of land adjacent to roads
Considering the existing state of knowledge in the country,
it is possible to monetarily
quantify only the direct road user benefits. Only when sufficient research is carried out
on other aspects can the full quantification of benefits be possible. The present Manual,
therefore, restricts itself to only the direct road user benefits.

The analyst should obtain the actual values from field measurements and use the above
values only when no such measurements have been made.

is measured in terms of metres of Rise and Fall (RF)

RF and CV are highly correlated and
it is generally sufficient to consider one of the two
in the analysis. The number of intersections per Kilometre
(J) on a road section
influences accident rate. In highway economic analysis, the effect of traffic on speeds
is important. The research studies conducted 3 410 have enabled the formulation of the
speed-flow equations and the same are presented in Annex B.

in Annex D. As the number of
diesel cars is gradually on the increase, the proportion of cars has been taken in the
ratio of 75 percent petrol driven cars to 25 percent diesel driven cars based on extensive
market surveys from recent studies

. The VOC values worked for different vehicle types
are as per March 2009 price levels and are exclusive of taxes in the case of economic
costs and inclusive of taxes in the case of financial costs. The prices of VOC inputs
used for preparing the Tables are also presented in Annex D. To obtain the VOC values

IRC:SP:30-2009
for intermediate values of Roughness and Rise/Fall values (that is, other than those
presented in Annex D), the VOC values presented for a given vehicle type needs to
be interpolated accordingly.
It is an established fact that road user cost would increase in accordance with increase
in Vehicle Operating Cost which implies that Road User Cost depends upon the change
in Wholesale Price Index (WPI). Generally, weekly, monthly as well as yearly WPI data
can be obtained from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (Office of the Economic
Advisory Board) 5
. From their website,
it is possible to obtain the weekly WPI data for
various commodities including Transport Equipment and Parts, Petrol and High Speed
Diesel (HSD) as well as the overall WPI for all commodities. For quick estimation of
VOC for any year, the WPI index for all commodities can be directly applied. Accordingly,
the WPI as on 7 October, 2000 namely on the reference analysis year when the VOC
equations were updated by CRRI 4 was
1 57.4 whereas the WPI as on 21 March, 2009
is 228.5. Using the ratio between the above two WPI indices, the VOC for the base
year {March 2009) can be obtained by multiplying the VOC for the year 2000 (obtained
from the updated VOC equations evolved
in URUCS 2001 study4
) by a factor
of 228.5/1 57.4. Similarly, the ratio of WPI for other relevant individual commodities
5
can be worked as under:
Transport Equipment and Parts
=
175.5/141.0
=
1.248
Petrol
=
224.2/159.8
=
1.403
High Speed Diesel
=
452.2/249.0
=
1.816
Out of the above factors derived through comparison of WPI, the relevant one may be
used by the user for the computation of updated VOC as presented in Annex D.
6.7
Travel Time Savings
Generally, savings in travel time are enjoyed by bus passengers, car passengers and
two-wheeler riders. Values at March 2009 price levels 5 are presented in Table 6.

IRC:SP:30-2009
Since the passenger travel time savings
in a developing country like India are not
sometimes considered
in economic analysis, the analyst may perform economic
analysis with and without this component. The occupancy of cars, two wheelers and
buses should be found from actual surveys.
In the absence of the same, the values
suggested below may be adopted:
Average occupancy of a car
=
4.8
Average occupancy of a two wheeler
=
1.5
Average occupancy of a bus
=
43.0
However,
it is to be noted that the above values vary from region to region. For a major
project like Expressway, where travel time savings are very significant, the accurate
value of time of passengers and commodity in transit may have to be determined. The
rates suggested for passenger travel time values have been appropriately accounted
by considering 85 percent work trips and
1 5 percent social/leisure trips based on the
studies conducted by CRRI 34
.
In the case of commodities, lesser travel time signifies smaller inventory cost. Speedier
travel means that for transporting the same quantity of goods in a certain period, lesser
number of commercial vehicles can be used. Speedier travel leads to reduction in the
fixed charges per km which every operator has to pay. Quicker travel also results in
time savings to the vehicle crew. The savings in travel time are an important component
of the benefits from highway improvements. Theoretically,
it is possible to visualize the
savings in cost of holding inventories by working out the value of goods held during the
transport and deriving the interest payment thereon per hour. The value of commodity
in transit may be considered separately for different types of commercial vehicles plying
on primary and secondary routes. The values presented in Table 7 are the updated
values of the study titled, "Updation of Road User Cost Data" conducted by CRRI in
2001 4 by considering the WPI price levels as of 21 March 2009.

Accident Cost Saving
As
it is possible to predict the reduction in accidents on account of road improvements,
the accident cost values evolved from the earlier studies can be used after updating
using the ratio of WPI for the economic cost of different types of accidents and economic
cost of vehicle damage. The values presented in Tables 8 and 9 are the updated values
of the study titled, "Evaluation of Road Accident Costs" conducted by TCS in
1 999 17 by
considering the WPI price levels as of 21 March 2009.

Congestion Effect
The VOC Tables given in Annex D are for uncongested free flow conditions. As traffic
volume on a road increases, the vehicles have to overtake, cross, accelerate and
decelerate. These manoeuvres
result
in drop
in speeds and increase
in
fuel
consumption along with wear and tear of vehicles. The effect of congestion on VOC
can be considered separately for the distance-related and time-related components.

The study conducted
in 2001 4 has yielded updated relationships given in Table 10.
This can be used for arriving at factors which
in turn can be utilized for multiplying
the distance-related and time-related VOC components presented
in the Tables at
Annex D.
As regards the time-related VOC components, they can be easily worked out from the
Speed-flow Equations given in Annex B as under:

In the above computations, the Volume

in Table

. The peak hour volume
is
assumed to be 10 percent of the daily volume in arriving at the values given
in this
Table.

IRC:SP:30-2009
It should be noted that congestion occurs most severely in the peak hours and less
severely during the rest of the day. The hourly traffic variation on the road will then
determine the appropriate congestion factors. For the determination of both distance
and time-related congestion factors, information on peak hourly traffic flow in terms of
PCU
is essential. When such information
is lacking or not available normally,
8-10 percent of daily traffic volume is considered to represent the peak hourly traffic
flow. The congestion factors obtained on the basis of peak hourly traffic are true only to
the peak hour conditions and
it is inappropriate
if the congestion factors are used for
24 hours. Therefore, a correction factor would have to be applied to obtain a realistic
value.
To arrive at a correction factor traffic census data available for typical sections of
National Highways can be utilized in deriving a factor. From this data, the percentage
of traffic for each hour can be established. For two-lane road in plain terrain, a capacity
of 30000 PCU/day has been considered appropriate 6 and this can be distributed over
the 24-hour period in accordance with the percentage of volume found in each National
Highway. For each hourly traffic, distance and time-related congestion factors can be
computed using equations given in Table
1 0 and Annex B respectively for the following
categories of traffic.

6.10 Benefits from Low Volume Roads
In the case of low volume rural roads, like village roads, the quantification of benefits
due to the savings in VOC is not the correct approach for economic analysis. This is
because the number of vehicles using village roads is very insignificant which can be
as low as 200 vehicles per day. Considering this,
it is prudent to assess the benefits
on the basis of Producer Surplus. This approach expresses the project benefits directly
rather than indirectly namely in terms of value of net output and income rather than in
terms of savings accrued to road users. This production-oriented interpretation of
project benefits is consistent with the present mandate of the government focusing on
accelerated
rural development through the Pradhan
Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana
(PMGSY) because
it focuses directly on farm level changes and augmentation of road
24



======================================================================
PAGE 39 of 368
======================================================================
IRC:SP:30-2009
connectivity to villages. The application of the producer surplus approach means
that a
significant
statistical and other data
collection
CTfort
is needed
to obtain
the following:
a)
An accurate description of the principal economic activities (which may
largely
fall
in the primary sector) and production techniques and
conditions;
b)
An assessment of the minimum incremental amount of expenditure needed
to generate increased output in the given economic activities;
c)
Estimates of changes in yields, farm gate and market prices (for agricultural
produce); and
d)
Determination of marketable surpluses taking into account farmer's own
consumption, requirement for seeds, fodder etc.
This statistical effort need to be supplemented with farm budgeting-costing. The value
added approach focuses on the difference in the net income of producers (by economic
activity) and transporters
"with" and
"without" the road investment and the
complementary incremental investments and expenditure (operating and maintenance
costs for generating production) in each sector/sub-sector of the economy. Since this
is an "economic" approach, all the expenditure related to project and revenue should
reflect economic costs (namely, shadow or accounting prices) which infer and allow
for transfer of payments, subsidies and other distortions in prevailing market prices.
By definition, the value added approach does not focus on the financial incentives
generated by proposed rural investments. These incentives are, however, critical to
the viability of projects and merit considerable attention in the appraisal process.
6.11 Benefits from Construction of a Large Bridge Project
In bridge project appraisal,
it is important first to study the present traffic flow pattern.
It may comprise of the following:
a)
Service across the river by a small ferry, carrying passengers and
light
vehicles, and/or
b)
Detouring of vehicles by alternate route, generally over long distance
This will be followed by forecast of average daily traffic over the proposed bridge for
the time horizon of the study. This will represent the normal traffic growth and the volume
generated by the proposed bridge. The main elements of traffic required for economic
25

PAGE 40 of 368

IRC:SP:30-2009
analysis are as follows:
a)
Ferry Traffic
i)
Normal growth
ii)
Volume generated by the proposed bridge
b)
Diverted Road Traffic (from alternate route)
i)
Normal growth
ii)
Volume generated by the proposed bridge
6.11.1 Project costs
The project costs basically include the following:
a)
Capital costs, annually phased over the construction period
b)
Recurring and maintenance costs, and
c)
The sum of (a) and (b) will be the total cost of the project.
6.11 .2 Project benefits
The economic appraisal consists primarily of determining the least cost solution to the
problem of moving traffic across the river. Two alternatives, bridge and ferry, differ not
only in capital and operating costs, but also in the quality of services in that, ferry takes
more time and
is less convenient. As a result, the traffic levels would,
in fact, differ
substantially under the two alternatives. The benefits accruing due to the bridge, in case
of ferry alternative without any diversion of traffic by alternate route primarily consists of
the avoidance of the ferry capital and operating costs and the elimination of delays for
vehicles, drivers, passengers and goods. These will be calculated as the time savings
for road traffic.
In the case of alternate route, VOC and time savings for the diverted
traffic (both passengers and goods) would also form part of the benefit streams.
6.11.3 Ferry costs
The capital costs will be for the ferry system as a whole which includes the cost of
vessel and the terminal facilities. Similarly, the cost of operation will be for both ferry
and terminal. These costs will be worked out for the normal traffic.
6.11.4 Elimination of delay
Assuming reasonably efficient ferry services, the difference between
it and the drive
across the proposed bridge need to be determined.
It should be determined taking
into account the waiting time for the ferry and boarding and alighting time for passengers
and goods as well as vehicles. Based on the normal growth
in traffic, annual time
savings must be worked out and valued in monetary terms.

6.11.5 Vehicle operating costs
IRC:SP:30-2009
As already indicated in the manual, Vehicle Operating Costs (VOC) will be worked out
under two scenarios namely "with" and "without" project condition. Under "without project
condition", the VOC will be determined year by year, on the existing route with the
given value of rise and fall, roughness, traffic volume and composition and the travel
distance (lead) whereas under "with project" condition, VOC will be determined for the
proposed route taking into account all the above road and traffic characteristics. VOC
savings in "with project condition" will arise first, due to short distance and secondly,
on account of less congestion.
6.12 Benefits from Replacement of Railway Level Crossings by Road
Overbridge (ROB)
The benefits from the replacement of Railway Level Crossings by ROB are as under:
Travel Time savings of passengers for the duration of the closure of the
gates and immediately after opening of the gates.
Value of commodity in transit detained for the duration of closure of the
gates and immediately after opening of the gates.
Savings in idle fuel consumption.
Savings in the cost of maintenance of the level crossing (wages ofgateman
etc).
Savings due to prevention of accidents,
if such data is available from past
records.
The expected increase in road traffic coupled with increase in railway closures should
be considered over the analysis period and the possibility of doubling of track leading
to more closures should be considered.
For performing economic
viability of
constructing the ROB, the relevant information may be collected during the traffic surveys
for the estimation of benefits.
7 TECHNIQUES OF ECONOMIC EVALUATION
7.1
Study of Alternatives
It has been emphasized that in the earlier studies 2 7 11 13 19 that economic analysis is
carried out to determine the most realistic solution from among a number of alternatives.
27



======================================================================
PAGE 42 of 368
======================================================================
IRC:SP:30-2009
Thus the analyst must visualize the various alternatives that are possible, including the
"do-nothing" or "null" alternative, and evaluate each of the alternatives against the "do-
nothing" alternative. The results will enable him to determine whether each of the
alternatives
is worthwhile at
all and
to rank the alternatives
in the order of their
attractiveness.
7.2
Marginal or Incremental Analysis
Apart from carrying out the analysis of each of the alternatives against the "do-nothing"
alternative, the analyst should also carry out marginal or incremental analysis from one
alternative to the other. To illustrate this, let us consider a two-lane road which needs
pavement strengthening. Traffic forecasts may indicate that the carriageway needs
widening to four-lane divided carriageway as well
in the next few years. Thus four
alternatives present themselves as follows:
Alternative
1
:
Do nothing
Alternative 2
:
Strengthening two-lane pavement
Alternatives
:
Strengthening two-lane pavement now and widening the
carriageway to four-lanes when
it is due
Alternative 4
:
Strengthening two-lane pavement now and widening the
carriageway to four-lanes right now.
The above alternatives are in the order of their increasing present costs. The analyst
must carry out incremental analysis of:
Analysis (1)
Alternative 2 against Alternative 1
Analysis (2)
:
Alternative 3 against Alternative 2
Analysis (3)
:
Alternative 4 against Alternative 3
The results will establish whether the incremental investments will yield the desired
benefits.
7.3
Methods of Economic Evaluation
Three common methods of economic evaluations normally adopted are as follows:
1)
Net Present Value Method
2)
Benefit - Cost Ratio Method
3)
Internal Rate of Return Method
28



======================================================================
PAGE 43 of 368
======================================================================
IRC:SP:30-2009
All the three methods are based on the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) technique of
discounting all future costs and benefits to a common year.
7.4
Net Present Value (NPV) Method
In this method, the stream of costs/benefits associated with the project over an
extended period of time is calculated and is discounted at a selected discounted rate
to give the present value. Benefits are treated as positive and costs as negative and
the summation give the Net Present Value (NPV). Any project with positive NPV is
treated as acceptable. In comparing more than one project, a project with the higher
NPV should be accepted. The NPV is algebraically expressed as:
NPVo =
where,
(B0 -CQ)+(Br CJ + (B9 -C,)+
(Bn -CJ

C
t
=
Value of costs which occur in the year t
/'
=
discount rate per annum in decimals
n
= number of years taken for analysis
The method 12 is illustrated using a simple example given below:
Example 7:
The cost of improving an existing road, 25 km long, is Rs 4.00 lakh per km. Road user
costs (with and without the improvements), accident costs
(with and without the
improvements) and maintenance costs (with and without the improvements) are given
in Table
1 2 for a
1 0-year period after the completion of the improvements. Assuming a
discount rate of
1 0 percent, find out whether the project is economically justifiable?
Use the NPV method.
Solution:
The calculations are presented in Table 12.
Cost of improvements (C) = Rs 25 x 4 = Rs 100 lakh
NPV = (+ Rs 165.4 - Rs 100) lakh = Rs 65.4 lakh
Since the NPV is positive, the project is economically justified.

Benefit-Cost (B/C) Ratio Method
There are a number of variations of this method, but a simple procedure is to discount
all costs and benefits to their present worth and calculate the ratio of the benefits to
costs. Negative flows are considered as costs whereas positive flows as benefits.
Thus the savings in the transport costs are considered as benefits.
If the B/C ratio is
more than one, the project is worth undertaking.
Example 8:
The B/C method 9 is illustrated using a simple example
An existing single lane road, 30 km long,
is to be widened to two lanes. The cost of
widening
is Rs 10 lakh per km. The vehicle operating costs, accident costs and
maintenance costs, with and without widening, for a
1 0-year period are presented in
Table 13. The discount rate is
1 2 percent. Is the project worthwhile?

Internal Rate of Return Method
The Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
is the discount rate which makes the discounted
future benefits equal to the initial outlay. In other words,
it is the discount rate which
makes the stream of cash flows to zero. Equation in para 7.4 can be rearranged as
below (Bo being zero):

(Br C,) + (B2 -C2 ) +
(Bn -CJ

The solution to the above equation can be done by trial and error. However, the task of
computing IRR is rendered very simple now-a-days due to the availability of this function
as an in inbuilt one in all statistical software.
If the IRR calculated from the above formula is greater than the rate of interest obtainable
by investing the capital in the open market, the scheme is considered acceptable.
7.7
Comparison of the Various Methods of Economic Evaluation
The three methods of economic evaluation described above have their own advantages
and short-comings. The B/C ratio method is very widely used by the highway engineers.
It, however, suffers from the following drawbacks:
a)
It requires an assumption of a discount rate, which should bear relation to
the opportunity cost of capital.
It
is, however, rather difficult to know the
opportunity cost of capital accurately.
b)
The significance of the B/C ratio is ambiguous, and its relative value is difficult
to understand and interpret. For instance,
if there are two proposals, one
with a B/C ratio of
1 .05 and the other with a ratio of
1
. 1 0, the difference is
very difficult to appreciate.
c)
It is somewhat confusing and difficult to decide which items should be termed
as costs and placed in the denominator and which as benefits and placed
in the numerator.
The IRR method is popular with international lending agencies like the World Bank.
It
lends itself admirably well for use
in a computer-aided design model.
It avoids the
need for selecting a discount rate initially. The rate derived from computations can be
easily compared with the market rate of interest, with which economists, financial
experts and bankers are familiar.
Its disadvantage is that the computations are tedious
and a solution can be obtained only by trial and error. The NPV method suffers from
the same disadvantage of B/C ratio method that a rate of discount has to be assumed.
7.8
Selection of Discount Rate
As seen from the discussions above, the selection of an appropriate discount rate (or
interest rate) is crucial in the B/C ratio and NPV methods.
The choice of the discount rate
is governed by a number of complex factors and
is
dependent on the future availability of finance and the various opportunities for its use.
The attitude of the society towards present consumption as against savings for future
is an important factor. Will the present generation prefer to consume the resources
32



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:30-2009
now or conserve
it for future use by the current or future generation? The answer to this
question will give the "social time preference rate of interest". Another approach is to
find out the social yield that the resources employed by a marginal public project would
have otherwise generated. This determines the "social opportunity cost rate of interest".
In a truly competitive economy, the two rates of interest would be equal and investments
and consumption would then be ideally allocated. But such a situation
is difficult to
find, and more so in a developing country where capital is very scarce. In such situations,
some general guidelines can be given for selecting an appropriate discount rate. Such
a rate should not be less than the rate of borrowing or lending by the Government or
the market rate of interest. A rate of 1 2 percent is used by the Planning Commission 5 15
.
A typical worked out example given below explains the various steps involved in the
economic analysis.
Example 9:
A two-lane black topped road with earthen shoulders passing through a congested
town has the following traffic in the year 2009:

IRC:SP:30-2009
The roughness of the road through the town is 4000 mm/km and is maintained at the
same status by carrying out routine repairs and renewals. The road is in plain terrain
with RF = 0m/km.
It is proposed to construct a bypass to the town with a two-lane asphalt pavement of
7.0 m wide with
1 .5 m
black topped shoulders on either side. The roughness of the
new pavement will be 2000 mm/km and this value will be maintained through routine
maintenance and renewals.
The estimated cost of construction of the bypass is Rs 11 0 crore which is to be incurred
spread over a period of four years as given below:

Traffic growth rate is expected to be 9 percent per annum for all vehicle types.
Maintenance cost per km is as under:
Existing road through the town
Rs 250 000 per km/year
Bypass
:
Rs 250 000 per km/year
Similarly, the maintenance cost to be incurred for the existing road after the opening of
the bypass road would be Rs 250 000 per km per year. The length of the existing road
through the town is
1 0 km and the proposed bypass length is
1 1 km. The tax element
in construction and maintenance may be taken as 10 percent in all the above cases.
The accident costs and value of passenger time may be ignored in the calculations.
Calculate the IRR considering 15 year analysis period namely, 15 year period after
opening the road to traffic may be assumed. The capacity of the road is 3000 PCU/h
which corresponds to a maximum daily flow of 30 000 PCU with peak hour traffic of
1 0 percent of daily traffic.
Solution:
The calculation of Internal Rate of Return for the proposal of constructing bypass
involves the following steps:
34



======================================================================
PAGE 49 of 368
======================================================================
IRC:SP:30-2009
Step 1: To convert the given traffic data
in terms of PCU for the given alternative
proposals include the following:
Case
I
:
'Do Nothing Case': The traffic on the existing road alone is plying.
Case
II
:
After bypass is constructed, the existing road is used by partial traffic.
Case
III
: The traffic using newly constructed bypass road after it is opened for
traffic after a period of four years.
To
facilitate the calculation
of traffic volume for each
of the above scenarios,
the percentage of traffic using bypass road
is made available as basic data (refer
Table
14).
Step 2: To calculate yearly traffic volume in terms of PCU/day with a 9 percent growth
rate from the year 2009 to 2027.
1 0 percent of this daily traffic is considered as peak
hourly traffic for the purpose of calculating distance-related and time-related congestion
factors. Both these congestion factors are to be calculated for a rise and
fall (RF)
value of '0' m/km and Roughness (RG) of 4000 mm/km.
Step
3: The distance-related and time-related congestion factors are separately
calculated and are corrected by multiplying a factor of 0.8. This
is to consider the
effect of assuming
1 0 percent of total daily traffic to represent peak hourly traffic for 24
hours in the computations of congestion.
Step 4: Total Vehicle Operating Costs are calculated for the above three cases using
the economic costs of VOC given
in Updated Road User Cost study conducted by
CRRI 4 and the Congestion Factors determined in Step 3.
Step 5: IRR is calculated using the data developed in Steps
1 to 4.
The typical calculations involved
in the computations have been described
in this
paragraph. The conversion of vehicles into PCU is carried out using the IRC guidelines
as per Table
1 5. The traffic volume data in terms of PCU for all the three envisaged
scenarios is presented in Table 16. The traffic data calculated from the year 2009 to
2027 considering traffic growth rate of 9 percent for all the three cases stated in Step
1
is tabulated
in Tables 17, 18 and 19. Assuming 10 percent of total daily traffic to
represent the peak hourly traffic, the ratio of this traffic volume and the capacity of two-
lane road
is calculated and tabulated
in the last column on Tables 17, 18 and 19.
It
should be noted that the Volume - Capacity (V/C) ratio logically cannot exceed
1 and
if any value is greater than
1
it should be equated to
1
.

Calculation of Congestion Factors
VOC equations presented in the CRRI study report 3 on Updation of Road User Cost
Data have been used in this analysis after updating the various VOC inputs based on
the WPI analogy described in Section 6.6. The distance and time-related congestion
factors are calculated separately and the typical calculations are presented for cars.
The Congestion Factors are determined for 'Do Nothing Case' and evaluating the
same against the bypass road alternative coupled with comparison of traffic on the
existing road after the opening of bypass road.
Distance-Related Congestion Factor
From Table
1 7, the Volume-Capacity (V/C) ratio for the year 2009 is 0.81
. From Table
10, Congestion Factor (CFJ for distance-related VOC for two-lane road section
is
determined as follows:
CF D =
0.893 + 0.259 x (V/C)
=
0.893 + 0.259*0.81
=
1.095
38

======================================================================
IRC:SP:30-2009
In accordance with Step 3, this value is multiplied by a factor of 0.8 to obtain the corrected
distance-related Congestion Factor.
Distance-related Congestion Factor (CFJ =
1 .0945 x 0.8 = 0.88
However,
it is to be noted that whenever the CF D values are less than
1
,
it may be
taken as
1 as done in this sample exercise. These values are tabulated in Tables 20,
21 and 22.
Time-Related Congestion Factor
From Speed - Flow Equation given in Annex B (namely, SF-37) for Two-lane road with
Earthen Shoulders,
V c
=
85.180- 0.0170 xQ
=
85.180-0.0170x2440
=
43.697
where,
Q is peak traffic flow is PCU for the year in consideration.
For the year 2009, the value Q
is 2440 from Table 17. Logically, this value cannot
exceed 3000 PCU per hour for two-lane carriageways with earthen shoulders.
Therefore, any higher PCU values will be restricted to 3000 PCU only.

=
1.949
The value of CFT logically
is limited to a minimum of
1 and a maximum of 2.
In
accordance with Step 3, this value
is multiplied by a factor 0.8 to obtain the Time-
Related Corrected Congestion Factor.
Time-Related Congestion Factor (CFT) =

It may be noted that the VOC data available in Annex D are for the year 2009. The
VOC values for the future years may be obtained based on the WPI which is published
periodically by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry 5
. Using the data on estimated
traffic volume given
in Table 29, the VOC for various alternative proposals can be
worked out.

Maintenance Cost
The net maintenance cost for each year after accounting for the tax element of
1 0 percent is indicated in Table 33. For instance, the maintenance cost for the existing
road after construction of the bypass can be taken as Rs 2 50 000 x 90/100 x 10 =
Rs 22.50 lakh per year (without tax element). Similar analogy has been used for the
calculation of tax element in the case of construction cost of bypass road and its routine
maintenance cost as presented in Table 33.
Calculation of IRR
All the cost benefit data is tabulated as shown in Table 33. The Internal Rate of Return
(IRR) can be calculated using the standard procedures like trial and error method.
Both costs and benefits are discounted at different rates
till both are balanced in trial
and error method. The IRR obtained
in this economic exercise works out to be
29.31 Percent.

8 STAGES INVOLVED IN ECONOMIC EVALUATION
8.1
The process of economic evaluation involves a number of stages. The
normal stages involved in their sequential order are as follows 7 13
:
a)
Identification and Definition of the Project
b)
Collection of economic base data
c)
Traffic surveys on existing facility
d)
Selection of policy variables for analysis and decision criteria
e)
Inventory of existing road
f)
Traffic projections
g)
Engineering design of proposed alternative schemes
h)
Estimation of cost of new facility as per all alternatives considered
i)
Traffic analysis on existing and new/proposed roads
j)
Estimation of Road User Benefits
k)
Economic Analysis
8.2
Identification and Definition of the Project
The first step in the process is to clearly identify the project and define its scope. This
will help in establishing important factors such as its length, cost, traffic etc.
8.3
Collection of Economic Base Data
In order to carry out the economic analysis of the project, a good amount of economic
data is needed. This data will be especially useful in establishing traffic growth rates
and forecasting future traffic. Data on past trends of growth of national income namely,
Gross National Product (GNP), population, motor vehicle population, sale of petroleum
products, agricultural production, industrial production, etc. can be particularly valuable.
8.4
Traffic Surveys
Traffic surveys of the following nature are needed:
a)
Traffic census data at intervals of say 20 km, on the existing road, giving
average daily traffic (ADT) with composition.
b)
Past census data to establish traffic growth rates in the past.
c)
Origin
- Destination (O-D) surveys in case of a bypass.
d)
Speed and delay studies on the existing alignment.

IRC:SP:30-2009
8.5
Selection of Policy Variables for Analysis and Decision Criteria
The most important policy variable that has to be selected is the design life.
It is normal
to have highway economic analysis for a design life of
1 5-20 years. Any value above
this range is not likely to influence the analysis because of the effect of discounting.
Also, forecasts beyond this range are likely to be erroneous. Thus, for the present, the
analysis
in India may be done for 15-20 years.
If a lesser period
is selected, some
salvage value will have to be assigned to the facility at the last year of the design
period. This may vary from 10 to 20 percent of the initial cost of the facility.
The next point to be selected
is the discount rate or the minimum IRR that will be
considered acceptable. This factor has been discussed earlier and for Indian conditions,
a discount rate of 1 2 percent per annum is generally acceptable. There are many issues,
which need
to be addressed regarding shadow
pricing
of wages,
materials and
equipment.
It is good to arrive at a decision on these points right in the beginning.
8.6
Inventory of the Existing Road
The existing road should be fully surveyed and mapped along with the particulars such
as
terrain,
traffic, road conditions (geometry, roughness pavement width) and
pavement characteristics (strength, composition, thickness and deflection) should
also be collected. These will have an influence on the design and specification that will
be selected and also on the cost of the alternatives.
8.7
Traffic Projections
Since traffic affects pavement design, design of pavement width and road user costs,
its accurate forecast is necessary. This can be done by various methods such as:
a)
Time Series analysis of past traffic count data at the site
b)
Time Series analysis of past growth of motor vehicle population in the region
c)
Time Series analysis of past growth of sale of petroleum products in the
region
d)
Correlation between growth of traffic and growth of selected economic
indicators.
On the National Highways, the rate of growth is likely to be in the range of 8-1 2 percent
in the coming years.
8.8
Engineering Design of Alternatives
Based on the present condition of the road and present traffic, the future traffic
is
estimated and various alternatives are visualized to meet the demand. The alternatives
might consist of stage-construction strategies or full construction initially.

IRC:SP:30-2009
8.9
Estimation of Cost of New Facility for all Alternatives
For each of the selected
alternatives, cost estimates are worked out based on
engineering designs. Taxes and subsidies are deducted and shadow pricing is done
to arrive at economic costs. The cost of maintenance is also estimated for each of the
future years.
It has been roughly found that the cost of a road project exclusive of taxes
can be taken as 85 - 90 percent of the total cost.
8.10 Traffic Analysis
The analysis of speed-flow is carried out for each year of the design period, knowing
the traffic on the road each year. The analysis is carried out for both the existing road
and each of the envisaged alternatives. The design should consider widening the
pavement to the next stage when the traffic exceeds the design service volume, which
may be taken from Table 34.
If such widening is not carried out the effect of congestion,
described in Clause 6.9 should be added with VOC.
8.11 Estimation of Road User Benefits
Knowing the
traffic volume of each class of vehicle, the corresponding speeds,
roughness values, pavement widths and geometry (rise and fall and/or curvature)
, the
individual components of VOC can be calculated from the VOC Tables presented in
Annex C. These VOC tables can be presented by including and excluding passenger
time savings for each year of analysis depending on the requirements.

8.12 Economic Analysis
The economic analysis is then done for each alternative by comparing with the "do-
nothing alternative" and also for the incremental investments from one alternative to
the other.
If the results are acceptable, as per decision criteria already established,
the best alternative
is selected. There are ready-made packages for carrying out
Economic Analysis. World Bank's HDM IV (Version 2.0) is one such software.

ANNEX D
(Clause 6.9)
Vehicle Operation Cost Tables
Notes on the Use of Tables
The VOC tables presented
in this annex for each vehicle type are based on Updated
Road User Cost study4 and also based on March, 2009 price levels 5
. These can be used
for future years by applying WPI values periodically published by the Ministry of Commerce
and Industry 5
. Economic costs exclude taxes whereas financial costs include taxes. The
VOC costs presented
in this annex are for free traffic flow conditions. For congested
conditions, they should be increased by using appropriate factors recommended in clause
6.9. The unit prices of different VOC inputs are presented in Table 54. To arrive at the VOC
figures for intermediate values of Roughness and Rise/Fall values (that is, other than those
presented in Annex D), the VOC values presented in Annex D needs to be interpolated
accordingly.
