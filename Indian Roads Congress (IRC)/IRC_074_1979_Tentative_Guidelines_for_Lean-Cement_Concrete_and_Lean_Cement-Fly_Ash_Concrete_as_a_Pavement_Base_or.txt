TENTATIVE GUIDELINES FOR LEAN-CEMENT
CONCRETE AND LEAN CEMENT-FLY ASH
CONCRETE AS A PAVEMENT BASE OR
SUBBASE
1.
INTRODUCTION
Lean cement concrete and
lean
cement-fly
ash
concrete
are
semi-rigid
materials
having
distinctly
superior
load
dispersion
characteristics as compared to conventional granular bases and
sub-
bases
like
water-bound
macadam.
As such a smaller thickness of
these materials can be used
to
replace
the
conventional
base
and
subbase courses in flexible and rigid pavement construction.
Besides
superior
load-spreading
properties,
lean
cement
concrete and lean
cement fly ash concrete are resistant to softening
action of water and can serve as a good working platform
on
softer
foundations.
These would
be particularly useful as a base/subbasc
course in heavy rainfall areas, or in black
cotton
soil
areas (when
laid
over
lime
stabilised
black
cotton soil).
Lean cement-fly ash
concrete may be
used
with
advantage
wherever
good
quality
fly
ash
is
available
within economic
lead.
As
these
materials
will
enable reduction in thickness vis-a-vis granular base courses, they arc
specially suitable for areas
where
good
quality hardstone
for such
base courses has to be obtained from long distances.
In lean cement concrete mixes, the cement paste
is
rather
thin
due
to
less
quantity
of cement.
Addition
of
fly
ash
results in
formation of cement-fly ash
paste
of
thicker
consistency,
thereby
improving
the
plasticity and
adhesiveness of the mix and reducing
the tendency to segregation.
As disposal of
fly
ash
from
thermal
power
stations is a recognised national problem, use of lean cement-
fly ash concrete as a
structurally
superior
paving
layer
will
also
contribute towards relieving this problem.
These guidelines were approved by the Cement Concrete Road
Surfacing Committee (personnel given below) in
their
meeting
held
at Bhopal on the 8th December, 1976.

THICKNESS DESIGN OF LEAN CEMENT CONCRETE AND
LEAN-CEMENT FLY ASH CONCRETE BASE/SUBBASE
LAYER
2.1.
As Sub- base/Base Course in Flexible Pavement
2.1.1.
As failure in case
of semi-rigid
materials
is
by
tensile
cracking,
the CBR
method
of
design
is
not
strictly
applicable.
However, in the absence of an established procedure
for
the design
of
semi-rigid
bases
or
subbases
in
composite
construction,
the
thickness of lean cement concrete or
lean
cement-fly
ash
concrete
layer may
be
designed for the present as per the CBR
method
of
design,
vide IRC
:
37-1970
"Guidelines
for
Design
of
Flexible
Pavements", using an equivalency factor of 1.50*.
The thickness of
the
semi-rigid
layer
so
obtained
shall
thereafter
be
checked for
adequacy by calculating its
ultimate
load carrying
capacity
using
Meyerhof equations.
*Note
: The actual equivalency factor for lean cement
concrete/lean
cement
fly
ash concrete will depend on
its strength and other factors.
Even though
equivalency
factors
of 2.0—2.5 have
been
reported
for
compressive
strength in the range of 40-60 kg/cm 2 suggested in
these
guidelines,
a
value of 1.5
is recommended as a measure of caution.

2. 1 .2.
Since the lean cement/lean cement-fly ash concrete layer
will extend on either side of the surface
course,
the
edge
condition
of
loading
is
unlikely
to arise.
Therefore for calculation for load
carrying capacity,
it
should
be
adequate
to
consider
the
interior
condition only, for which the Meyerhof equation
is given below:
where

lean cement concrete/lean
cement-fly
ash
concrete
in
the
field
(one-sixth
to
one-eighth of compressive strength).
2.1.3.
To allow for load repetition during
the
design
life
of
the
pavement,
the
ultimate
load
carrying capacity, Pu , should be
higher than the design wheel
load,
P.
The
values
of
load
factor
(?«//>) recommended for the purpose are given in Table
1.

should,
however,
in
no
case be
less
than
10 cm.

As Subbase Course under Rigid Pavement
The
thickness of
lean cement
concrete or lean cement-fly ash
concrete layer for use as a subbase
course
under
cement
concrete
pavement
should
be
as per IRC: 15-1970, "Standard Specifications
and Code of Practice for the
Construction of Concrete Roads
(First
Revision)".
IRC:
15-1970
recommends
the
provision
of 10 cm
thickness of lean cement concrete subbase in lieu of
15 cm thickness
of water bound macadam.
2.3.
The
strength
requirement
of lean cement concrete/lean
cement fly ash concrete shall be as given in para 4.1.

PROPORTIONLNG OF LEAN CEMENT CONCRETE AND
LEAN CEMENT-FLY ASH CONCRETE
4.1.
Mix Design Criteria
4.1.1.
To
act
as
a
semi-rigid
pavement
layer, lean cement
concrete/lean cement-lime fly ash
concrete
should
be
designed
to
give a minimum compressive strength of 40-60 kg/cm 2 at 28 days in
the field.
As compaction
in the field is to
be done by
rolling, workabi-
lity shall be kept low, with 0-12 mm slump.
4.1.2.
Having
regard
to
process
variances
in the field, the
laboratory mix should be designed for
1.25
times
the
required
28
days field strength.
4.2.
Mix Design
4.2.1.
The
mix
proportions
for
lean
cement
concrete and
lean cement fly ash concrete are designed by trial and
error method.
To
facilitate
selection
of
suitable
proportions
of
the
trial
mix,
particulars
for
a
few
such
concrete
mixes,
designed with fly ash
conforming to IS: 3812 (Part II)-1966
"Specifications
for
Fly
Ash
for
Use
as
Admixture
for
Concrete",
medium
coarse sand, and
2ood quality crushed coarse aggregate of 20 mm max. size are given
in Tables 3 and 4.
4.2.2.
The maximum size of the coarse aggregate
in
the
mix
is
limited
by
the
thickness
of
the
lean
cement concrete or lean
cement fly ash concrete layer to be laid,
and
should
generally
not
exceed
40 mm
for
10 cm
layer
thickness.
While
selecting trial,
mix
proportions
from
Table 3 or 4, allowance should be made for
change in the maximum size and shape of aggregate,
as
increase
in
the maximum
size of aggregate and
its surface area requires reduc-
tion in water content; change from
angular
(crushed
aggregate)
to
rounded
(uncrushed
gravel) shape requires reduction in both water
and sand contents; and increase
or decrease in fineness modulus
of
sand requires a
like
change
in sand content.
Significantly, lower
strength may be expected when aggregates such as broken
brick
or
cinder are used.

9-11 per cent by weight
of
total
dry
materials,
for
lean
cement
concrete
mixes, when crushed stone
is used as coarse aggregate.
4.2.4.
In
case
of
lean
cement-fly
ash
concrete,
optimum
strength
is obtained
by
replacing
about
50
per
cent
of
sand by
weight in conventional lean cement
concrete
mix by equal absolute
volume of fly ash (vide Tables 3 and 4).
The water content require-
ment in this case is increased by
about
1 per cent, and the strength
obtained
is more than double vis-a-vis the corresponding lean cement
concrete mix.
The following procedure may,
therefore,
be adopted
to obtain mix proportions for lean cement fly ash concrete:
(1)
Select lean cement
concrete
mix
corresponding
roughly
to 50 per cent of the strength requirement for lean cement-
fly
ash
concrete
(vide
Table 3).
Let
this mix
be l:x:y
(cement: sand: coarse aggregate) by weight, with
a
water
content of w% by weight of total aggregate.
(2) Corresponding mix for lean cement-fly ash
concrete may
be taken as:
1: (1-p) x: pxn:y (cement:sand:flyash: coarse aggregate),
Where
n= ratio of specific gravity of flyash and sand,
/?= proportion of sand by weight in the lean cement concrete
mix to be
replaced
by
flyash,
on
equivalent
absolute
volume basis. As a broad guide, a value of 0.5
might
be
adopted for p.
(3) The water requirement in this case will be about (w+l)%
by weight of total
aggregate.
Perform
trial
slump
test
using this
water
content.
Adjust
the
water
content
to
obtain
the
desired
slump
(0-12 mm).
Let
the adjusted
water content be w%.
(4)
Similarly, determine water
content
requirement
for
two
additional trial mixes
1:(1-P) {x-l):p(x-l) my^^j
and
\:(l-p)(x+\):p(x + l)n:y (~")

(5) Cast test cubes for determination of compressive
strength
for
all
the
three
trial
mixes,
and
select
appropriate
design mix from the strength results.
Very approximately, the ratio of total aggregate
(including
fly
ash)
to cement will be in the range of 18-22, and water requirement
in the range of 10-12 per cent by weight of total
dry
materials,
for
the stipulated 28 day compressive strength in the range of 40-60 kg/
cm 2
, when crushed stone
is used as coarse aggregate.
5.
EQUIPMENT
5.1.
Batching and Mixing Equipment
Batching of materials for lean cement concrete/lean cement-fly
ash concrete should be done by weight, and
volume
batching may
be permitted only when
unavoidable.
Mixing
should
be
done
in
power driven concrete mixers of adequate capacity.
The stipulations
of IRC: 43-1972 "Recommended Practice for Tools, Equipment and
Appliances
for
Concrete
Pavement
Construction"
in
respect
of
weight batchers and mixers should be followed.
5.2.
Compacting Equipment
Compaction of lean cement concrete/lean cement-fly ash
con-
crete layer in the field should be done by means of an
8 to 10 tonne
smooth wheel roller for harder aggregates (like stone metal) and 6-8
tonne roller for softer aggregates
(like
brick
aggregate
or
cinder).
Alternatively, vibratory rollers of equivalent capacity
may
also
be
used.
6.
PREPARATION OF THE SUBGRADE/SUBBASE
6.1.
The subgrade or subbase
over
which
the
lean
cement
concrete/lean cement-fly ash
concrete layer
is to be laid,
should
be
checked for line, grade and cross-section, vide Chapter 7 of IRCSP:
11-1977, "Handbook
of
Quality Control for Construction of Roads
and Runways (First Revision)".
All
irregularities beyond the
per-
mitted tolerance should be rectified.
Soft
and
yielding
spots
and
ruts,
if
present,
should
be
corrected
and
rolled
until
firm. The
checking and rectification of the underlying layer should be done at
least 2 days in advance of laying lean cement concrete/lean
cement
fly ash concrete.
6.2. To prevent absorption of
water
from
lean
cement
con-
crete/lean cement-fly ash concrete, the underlying layer should either
be covered with water proof paper
or
brought
to
moist
condition
9

; 74-1979
without free water at the surface before laying the former.
For this
purpose, the underlying layer may be
saturated
with
water 6 to 20
hours in advance, followed by light sprinkling of water prior
to
lay-
ing of the semi-rigid layer,
if any areas have become dry.
7.
CONSTRUCTION
7.1.
Storage and Handling of Cement
The
provisions
in
clause
8.1
of
IRC:
15-1970: "Standard
Specifications
and
Code
of
Practice
for
the
Construction
of
Concrete Roads" should be followed as regards storage and handling
of cement.
7.2.
Storage and Handling of Fly Ash
Fly ash, being light and very fine, gets easily air borne.
As a
precautionary measure, it may be bagged, suitably covered, or soaked
with water
at
the
top
during
transportion.
When not bagged,
it
may be stored in regular trapezoidal pits dug for the
purpose.
The
top surface may be either kept wet or covered with tarpaulin.
7.3.
Storage and Handling of Aggregates
The provisions in clause 8.2 of IRC: 15-1970: "Standard Speci-
fications and Code
of Practice
for
the
Construction
of Concrete
Roads", should be followed in respect
of
storage
and
handling of
aggregates.
7.4.
Batching and Mixing of Materials
7.4.1.
The marerials for making
lean
cement
concrete/lean
cement-fly
ash concrete mix should be batched by weight using
ap-
proved weigh-batching equipment.
Volume batching may
be
per-
mitted only when unavoidable.
Water may be measured by volume,
using calibrated containers.
Proportioning of the
constituent mate-
rials should be on the basis
of designed
mix
proportions,
making
due allowance for moisture present in fly ash and aggregates.
While
loading the mixer, water should be added
first, cement
and
fly
ash
next, and aggregates the last.
7.4.2.
Mixing should be done in power driven
mixers
of
ap-
proved type, and uniform homogenous mixing of all the
ingredients
shall be ensured.
The mixer should not
be
overloaded, and
ade-
quate mixing time (1-2 min.) should be
allowed
to
ensure uniform
mixing.

7.5.
Transportation and Placement
The lean cement concrete/lean cement-fly ash concrete
should
be transported and so placed on the
prepared
subgrade/subbase
so
that the compacted layer has the required depth, slope and
camber.
The amount of surcharge required
is about
20-25
per
cent
of
the
thickness of layer to be laid.
The actual amount of
surcharge may
be determined through
field
trial.
Transportation and
placement
should
be
so
done
as
to
avoid
segregation.
Any portion of the
batch
which
becomes
segregated
during
placing,
should
be
thoroughly mixed with the main body of the batch
during
the pro-
cess of spreading.
7.6.
Compaction
7.-6.1.
When sufficient
length
of
lean
cement
concrete/lean
cement-fly ash
concrete has been laid to permit
rolling,
compaction
should be commenced (see para 5.2).
Rolling should start from the
outer edges of the pavement and proceed towards the middle
except
at superelevated portions where
it
should
commence
at
the lower
edge and proceed towards the higher.
Adequate number
of
passes
shall be given to ensure full compaction.
Eight passes are generally
considered adequate for the purpose.
7.6.2.
The grade and camber of the surface should be checked
during compaction,
and
all
irregularities
should
be
corrected by
removing or adding fresh material.
7.6.3.
Compaction should
be
completed
within
a
specified
period which shall not exceed 45 minutes
in
summer
and
1 hour in
winter after mixing.
The maximum thickness to be compacted
in a
single
layer
should
not
exceed
10 cm
in
case of smooth
wheel
rollers and
15 cm in case of vibratory rollers of equivalent
capacity
(vide para
5.2).
When lean
cement
concrete/lean
cement-fly
ash
concrete is to be laid
in
more
than
one
layers,
each
subsequent
layer should be laid within one hour of compaction of
the
preceed-
ing layer.
•
7.7.
Joints
No joints need be provided except
construction
joints
at
the
end of the day's work.
These shall be
formed
by
chamfering
the
edge
of
the
already
laid
layer
at
an
angle
of about
30° to the
vertical.

IRC: 74-1979
cement concrete/lean cement-fly ash concrete,
it should be cured for
the first 48 hours by covering
it with wet gunny bags or hessian
and
for a further period of not less than 12 days by spreading
wet
sand
or watering frequently in moderate quantities.
Curing
by
ponding
is not necessary.
No traffic should be allowed on this
layer
before
top courses have been laid.
7.9.
Rectification of Surface Irregularities
The finished surface should be checked
for
line,
level,
grade
and surface
finish.
Provisions
in
Chapter
7
of IRC:SP: 11-1977
"Handbook of Quality Control for Construction of Roads and Run-
ways (First Revision)" should be
followed
for
this
purpose.
The
checking and rectification of the surface, if required, should
be car-
ried out while the mix is
still plastic.
Any surface irregularities
left
in the hardened layer should be corrected by cutting out
sufficiently
large patches and relaying to
specification.
8.
SURFACE COURSE
8.1.
Lean cement concrete and lean cement-fly ash
concrete,
being semi-rigid materials, may develop transverse cracks on account
of thermal effects/drying shrinkage.
These cracks are
likely
to get
reflected on to the wearing surface if this semi-rigid layer is overlaid,
with a thin
bituminous
wearing
course
(e.g.
surface
dressing
or
premix).
To prevent such
reflection
cracking,
when
lean
cement
concrete/lean cement-fly ash concrete is used in composite pavement
construction,
it is recommended that an intermediate layer
of water
bound macadam, or bituminous macadam
should
be
incorporated
before providing the wearing course, so as to
absorb
the movement
at cracks in the semi-rigid layer, and to prevent
their
reflection on
to
the
surface.
Minimum
thickness
of
this
intermediate
layer
plus wearing course should not be less than 10 cm.
8.2.
In case of rigid pavement, where
lean cement
concrete/
lean cement-fly ash concrete is used as a subbase,
the
cement
con-
crete wearing course can be laid directly thereon
without
provision
of any intermediate layer, as due to greater
rigidity
of "the
cement
concrete
layer,
cracks
from
the
semi-rigid
subbase
do
not
get
reflected.
9.
QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control tests and their minimum
desirable
frequency
should be as given in Table
5.
