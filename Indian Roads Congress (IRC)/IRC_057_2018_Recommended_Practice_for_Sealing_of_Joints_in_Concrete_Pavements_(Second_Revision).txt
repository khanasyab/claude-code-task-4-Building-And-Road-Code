RECOMMENDED PRACTICE FOR SEALING OF  
JOINTS IN CONCRETE PAVEMENTS
1 INTRODUCTION
IRC:57, “Recommended Practice for Sealing of Joints in Concrete Pavements” was first 
published in the year 1974. It was revised in the year 2006. Due to considerable changes 
in the technology for road construction, a need was felt to further update this document 
and accordingly the task of revision of this document was assigned to Rigid Pavements 
Committee (H-3). The revised draft was prepared by the subgroup comprising Shri R.K. Jain, 
Col. (Retd.) V.K. Ganju, Shri M.C. Venkatesha and Shri Satander Kumar. Other than the H-3 
Committee members, valuable inputs were received from the officers of S&R Zone of the 
Ministry. The draft was deliberated in several meetings of H-3 Committee and was finalized in 
its meeting held on 9th September, 2017. The revised draft was placed before the Highways 
Specifications and Standards Committee (HSS) in its meeting held on 24th October, 2017. 
The HSS Committee approved the draft subject to the consideration of the observations 
of members. The draft document after carrying out the modifications was considered and 
approved by the Executive Committee of IRC in its meeting held on 2nd November, 2017 for 
placing before the Council of IRC. The Council in its meeting held on 3rd November, 2017 at 
Bengaluru considered and approved the document for printing.

2 SCOPE
The document prescribes about the practices of forming joints in a concrete pavement and 
sealing them either using field-moulded sealants or pre-formed compression seals. The 
technique of resealing of failed old joints has also been given in the document.
3 GENERAL
3.1	
Cement concrete pavements (roads, streets, airport apron, taxi-ways and 
runways, etc) are subjected to volumetric changes (expansion and contraction) caused 
by changes in their moisture content and/or temperature which leads to initial drying, 
shrinkage and irreversible creep. These changes cause movements of slabs. If contraction 
movements are excessively restrained, they will result in cracking of the pavement. On 
the other hand, the restraint of expansion movements may result in development of 
compressive stresses that are borne by abutting faces of the slab. Transverse joints are 
provided to accommodate these movements and thereby prevent development of distress 
in the pavement. Longitudinal joints are provided to relieve stresses due to wrapping 
and dividing the pavement into convenient lanes. Joints are also required to facilitate 
construction.
3.2	
Details of different types of joints in concrete pavements are outlined in IRC:15, 
“Code of Practice for Construction of Jointed Plain Concrete Pavements”. The present 
standard is intended to augment the provisions contained in IRC:15.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:57-2018

3.3	
The introduction of joints creates openings in the slab which must be sealed in order 
to prevent ingress of rain water to the sub-base/subgrade or other unwanted substances, like, 
grit into the openings. Foreign solid matter which is incompressible must be prevented from 
accumulating in the joints, otherwise the joints cannot close freely later. Should the joints get 
clogged with foreign solid matter, malfunctioning of the joints may occur and high stress may 
be generated in the slab leading to spalling of concrete and development of cracks. Sealing 
of these joints is done using either field-moulded sealants or preformed compression seal.
3.4	
The performance and life of a sealing compound depend not only on the properties 
of the sealing compound and the mode of application but also on the design of the joints. The 
types of joints normally formed in concrete pavements are described below.
4 SHAPE OF THE JOINT SEALING GROOVE
Shape of field-moulded sealant is important as the sealant is subjected to compression and 
tension during expansion and contraction phases of concrete slab. The sealants which are solid 
at service temperatures are likely to change in their shape but their volume will remain same 
during opening off these sealants. The shape of the sealant is important as strains developed 
in them during expansion and contraction should not exceed the permissible limit. The stresses 
generated in sealants during expansion and contraction phases are shown in Fig. 1.
Fig. 1 Stresses Generated in Field-Moulded Sealants due to Temperature Changes
The shape of the joint groove intended as a reservoir of sealant largely depends upon the 
type of sealant used. Shape factor of a sealant is defined as:
                             
                 
Shape factors normally recommended for various sealants are as under:
Hot-poured sealant	
:	 1.0-1.25
Cold poured sealant like Polysulphide	
:	 1.0-1.25
Silicone	
	
:	 0.75
Shape factor for expansion joints can be	 :	 0.5

Although theoretically the above shape factors are desirable, some authorities feel that ratio 
of 3:2 is to be preferred. Therefore, a compromise has to be made in deciding the shape 
factor based on the field experience so that the stress produced within sealant body is within 
the allowable limit specified by the manufacturers.
5 TYPE OF JOINTS

5.2	
Contraction Joints
These are purposely made weakened planes which relieve the tensile stresses in the 
concrete caused due to changes in moisture content (drying shrinkage) and/or temperature 
and prevent the formation of irregular cracks due to restraint in free contraction of concrete. 
They also relieve stresses due to wrapping.
Details of the contraction joints are given in IRC:15. They are formed initially by sawing a 
groove of 3-5 mm width up to about one-fourth to one-third the slab thickness as shown in 
Fig. 6. This facilitates the formation of a natural crack at this location extending to the full 
depth. In order to seal the joint, the top 10-20 mm of this groove is widened to 8-10 mm as 
shown in Figs. 3, 4 and 5. For heavy duty roads, these joints are provided with steel dowel 
bars to improve the continuity of slab and improved performance of joints, including load 
transfer. Typical cross-section of a contraction joint is given in Fig. 6(a).
Note: Width of contraction joint play an important role to improve the riding quality. As good 
quality saw cutting machines are available, which can ensure very thin joint as low as 3 mm, 
low viscosity sealants with higher Movement Accommodation Factor (MAF), good pouring 
tools are also available and therefore contraction joints with sealing groove width of 6 mm 
resulting in lower maintenance cost and better riding quality are possible to be designed and 
constructed.
5.3	
Longitudinal Joints
Longitudinal joints are provided in multi-lane pavements and also when the pavement is 
more than 4.0 m wide. They also relieve stresses due to wrapping. Initially joint is cut to a 
depth 1/4 to 1/3 of the slab. Tie bars are provided at the joints not for load transference but for 
keeping the adjoining slabs together. The details of such joints are given in IRC:15. The top 
10-20 mm depth of the joint is sawn to a width of 6-8 mm for sealing. Typical cross-section 
of a joint is given in Fig. 6(b).
5.4	
Expansion Joints
These are full-depth butt joints provided transversely into which pavement can expand, 
thus relieving compressive stresses due to expansion of concrete slabs, and preventing 
any tendency towards distortion, buckling, blow-up and spalling. The current practice is to 
provide these joints only when concrete slab abuts with bridge or culvert. Details of these 
joints are given in IRC:15. They are about 20-25 mm in width.
A joint filler board of compressible material conforming to IRC:15 is used to fill the gap 
between the adjacent slabs at the joint. The height of the filler board is such that its top 
is 23-25 mm below the surface of the pavement. The joint groove is filled by a sealant 
as shown in Figs. 3, 4 and 5. Typical cross-section of an expansion joint is given in Fig. 
6(c).

5.5	
Construction Joints
The need for such joints arises when construction work is required to be stopped at a place 
other than the location of contraction or an expansion joint, due to some breakdown of the 
machinery or any other reason. Such joints are of butt type and extend to the full depth of the 
pavement. The sealing of such joints shall be done in the same manner as for contraction 
joints, by cutting a groove 10-12 mm wide and 20-25 mm deep. The work should normally be 
stopped at the regular location of contraction or expansion joint.
5.6	
Groove Dimensions
The size of the joint grooves is shown in Figs. 3, 4 and 5. The grooves shall not deviate from 
the specified size by ± 1 mm both in depth and width.
A sample calculation for the width of contraction joint is attached as Annexure-I.
6 SEALING DETAILS
6.1	
Steps involved in sealing operation of field-moulded sealant:
	
•	
Widening of the first saw cut of 3-4 mm to the required dimension as shown 
in Figs. 3, 4 and 5. The grooves shall be checked for tolerance using width 
and depth gauges.
	
•	
Sand blasting the groove face if the sealant manufacturer recommends it.
	
•	
Cleaning the groove with air compressor
	
•	
Insertion of debonding strip
	
•	
Priming the sides of the sealant, if the sealant manufacturer recommends it
	
•	
Pouring of sealant
The sealants shall be applied only after the concrete slabs have been cured to the specified 
duration, and there is no trace of moisture in the exposed faces of the joint groove.
6.2	
Sawing of Groove
All joints (except the construction and expansion joint) be sawn. The sawing of joints should 
be a two-phase operation. In the first phase, the initial sawing is done to the required depth 
(one-fourth to the one-third the depth) with a 3 mm blade soon after concrete sets and is 
capable of taking the load of cutting machine and the weight of the operator. This cut is 
intended to induce the full-depth crack at the intended location. Since the next phase of 
sawing may be taken up after a lapse of time, the joint should be filled with a temporary seal 
such as jute rope. This seal will keep the incompressible material like stone pieces and dirt 
out of the joint and reduce the potential spalling. The second phase of saw cut is then made 
prior to the installation of the sealant. This saw-cut widens the groove to the finally designed 
size and provides a reservoir for the sealant material. When the second saw-cut is made, 
the temporary seal is pushed into the bottom of the widened groove so as to prevent all

extraneous material from entering the joint including slurry generated during sawing process. 
Depth/width gauges shall be used to control the dimension of the groove. If rough arises 
develop when grooves are made, they shall be ground to provide a chamfer of 3 mm width. 
If the groove is at an angle upto 10 degrees from the perpendicular to the surface, the 
overhanging edge of the sealing groove shall be sawn or ground perpendicular. If spalling 
occurs or the angle of the former is greater than 10 degrees, the joint sealing groove shall 
be sawn wider and perpendicular to the surface to encompass the defects upto a maximum 
width, including any chamfer, of 35 mm for transverse joints and 20 mm for longitudinal 
joints. If the spalling cannot be eliminated then the arises shall be repaired by an approved 
thin bonded arises repair material using epoxy mortar. All grooves shall be cleaned of any 
dirt or loose material by air blasting with filtered, oil-free compressed air. If need arises, the 
cleaning may be done by pressurized water jets. Depending upon the requirement of the 
sealant manufacturer, the sides of the grooves may be sand blasted to increase the bondage 
between the sealant and the concrete. Based on the recommendation of manufacturer, the 
joint grooves shall be primed before applying sealant. At the time of priming and sealing, the 
groove shall be clean and dry.
As per IRC:15, joint cutting equipment which can be used to cut joint at the early age of 
concrete is called as early-entry saw. This is light weight equipment and has a plate called 
‘skid plate’ on both sides of saw to keep concrete pressed at the location of saw cutting to 
basically control raveling. With use of early-entry joint cutting equipment, joints can be cut 
even earlier than that mentioned above with the permission of the Engineer. The depth of cut 
shall be minimum 10 % of slab thickness subject to 30 mm minimum.
Early-entry saw cutting are dry-cuts so their blades are designed for use without water for 
cooling. They are also “up-cut” saws, meaning that the cutting edge of the blade moves 
upward during operation. This helps to push debris out of the joint. In addition, they have a 
skid plate, which slides on the concrete surface and has slot through which the saw blade 
is inserted. The skid plate holds the concrete in place during cutting to minimize crumbling/
raveling/dislodging of aggregates from the joint edges. The gap between the blade and the 
edge of the slot is extremely narrow. Over time, abrasion may cause widening of the slot and 
increases the chance for edge ravelling of the joint. Therefore, early-entry saw cutting requires 
replacement of skid plate each time the blade is replaced for maximum effectiveness. 
6.3	
Paper-Backed Debonding Strip
Before sealing, the temporary seal provided for blocking the ingress of dirt, soil, stone chips 
etc. shall be removed carefully. A debonding strip is then inserted in the groove to break the 
bond between the sealant and the bottom of the groove and to plug the groove so that the 
sealant may not leak through the initial groove and ultimately into the cracks. The details are 
given in Figs. 3, 4 and 5. The heat resistant debonding strips are required for those cases 
where hot poured sealant is used. In the case of compressible debonding strip to be used 
in contraction joint, normally the strip is provided with a paper-back so that sealant is not 
absorbed by the debonding strip. If the strip is non-absorbant type no paper-back is required. 



======================================================================
PAGE 20 of 32
======================================================================
IRC:57-2018
12
The width of the debonding strip shall be more than the width of joint groove so that it is held 
tightly in the groove.
In the case of longitudinal joints there is no need to install compressible debonding strip but a 
debonding tape of 1.0-2.0 mm thickness is sufficient to plug the groove so that sealant does 
not flow downwards in the first cut groove. Heat resistant debonding strip, however, is to be 
used when hot-poured sealant is used.
6.4	
Debonding Strip and Backer Rod/Back-up Rod
In the case of sealing of joint grooves with field moulded technique, debonding strip of backer 
roads are required to prevent sealant flowing through bottom of the joint and prevent sealant 
adhesion to the bottom of the groove. The debonding strip is normally of rectangular cross-
section and of about 5 mm thickness and is provided with a paper backing to reduce the 
loss of sealant by absorption. The backer rod with round section is used without any paper 
backing as the closed cell foam used does not absorb sealant. The types of materials used 
for debonding strip and backer rod are:
	
•	
Polyethylene foam: This is a closed-cell foam that does not absorb water 
and is moderately compressible. As this material gets affected by heat, this 
is used for cold-poured joints.
	
•	
Cross linked polyethylene foam: This is compatible with hot-poured sealants. 
It is a closed-cell foam that does not absorb water and is moderately 
compressible, but will not melt in contact with hot-poured sealant.
	
•	
Polyurethene foam: It is of open cell foam which can absorb moisture 
but does not get affected by hot-pour sealant. It is very compressible and 
normally used with hot-pour sealant.
The backer/back-up rods shall conform to ASTMC 5249-95 or ASTMD 3575.
6.5	
Cleaning/Sand Blasting of Sides of the Groove
During the widening of the joint groove, water is fed to the diamond edged saw as coolant 
for grooving. The slurry produced normally gets coated as a thin film on the sides of the 
groove which acts as a barrier between sealant and concrete. Therefore, there is a need to 
clean the sides of the groove with sand blasting, water jet and subsequently, with an air jet 
as recommended by the manufacturer. As the surface of sides becomes smoother during 
grooving/widening it is generally necessary to sand blast the sides. The pitted surface of 
sides of the groove is helpful in improving the bond between sealant and concrete.
6.6	
Priming
A primer is used to improve the adhesive bond between sealing compound and concrete, to 
penetrate the pores of the concrete and to coat it with a thin film of viscous sticky material. 
The primer must have a very low viscosity so as to penetrate the pores of the concrete. The 
primer to be used shall be a recommended by the sealant manufacturer.



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 32
======================================================================
IRC:57-2018
13
The primer shall be applied to the joint faces by spray or brush as soon as the surface is 
prepared, cleaned and dried as per specification. The primer shall be applied carefully so that 
the joint surfaces are evenly coated. Pools of excess primer shall be avoided as these may 
be detrimental to the subsequent performance of the sealant.
Some sealant manufacturers do not recommend use of primer with their product, but cleaning 
and sand blasting sides may be necessary.

Hot-Poured Sealants
Rubberized-bitumen sealant is normally heated in the range of 120ºC-180ºC as per the 
recommendation of the manufacturer before using it. The relevant specifications for different 
hot poured sealants are given in Table 1.
In hot application sealant should be heated in a Melter and storage vessel to specified 
temperature, using oil jackets and thermometers for controlling the heat. A schematic view of 
a heating kettle is show in Fig. 7.
The sealant should be continuously agitated to avoid local overheating throughout the 
heating and pouring operation. The temperature of the material should not be allowed to rise 
above that stated by the manufacturer nor should the material be maintained at application 
temperature for a longer period of time than indicated by the manufacturer. The sealant shall 
be poured by means of pouring kettle or using extruding machines which pump the material 
into the sealing groove. The sealant shall be applied such that the top surface of the cooled 
sealant is at the required depth below the pavement surface within a tolerance of 3±1 mm.

The minimum depth of the sealant shall not be less than that specified. On super-elevated 
portions where the cross-fall is greater than 2.5 per cent, measures should be taken to ensure 
that the sealant does not flow along the joint by (i) placing the material in thin layers and 
allowing each layer to stiffen before placing the next or (ii) forming dams at intervals along 
the joint to check the flow. The dams should be thereafter cut and replaced with sealant. In 
order to avoid spillage of sealant on the concrete surface card-board or tape should be stuck 
on both edges before pouring sealant. The sealant may be pressed by a tool to have smooth 
surface. Sealing operation can be done by sophisticated melter and pourer. A kettle used for 
sealing manually is shown in Fig. 8.

6.9	
Cold Poured Sealants
There are three main sealants under this category which are used for pavements: 
	
•	
Polysulphide conforming to IS:11433 (Part 1) or BS 5212
	
•	
Silicone conforming to ASTM: 5893, ASTM C 793 and BS/EN 14187-5
	
•	
Polyurethane conforming to BS:5212 – Part II
They are poured at atmospheric temperature and after being poured, undergo a chemical 
reaction and give a seal of the desired consistency. They allow for repeated larger extension 
of 30 per cent. As against 20 per cent in the case of hot poured bitumen-based sealants. 
Because they do not need heating, the applications is simple. At the same time, a great

care is needed in selecting the product and applying them. They require greater care 
in preparing the edges and the bottom of the groove (drying, cleaning and coating with 
primer). They are costlier than hot applied sealants. But their higher cost is justified by 
longer life.
6.10	
Movement Accommodation Factor (MAF)
This is an important property of sealant which defines the capacity of the sealant to undergo 
expansion or contraction without any change in volume. The material will revert back to 
original shape on removal of load.
It can be defined as :
    ( )                                
              
       
                ( )                              
              
         
For highly elastic material, MAF value will be higher. Polysulphide sealants have MAF of 
more than ±25%. The MAF of silicone sealants is in the range of -50% to +100%. This 
sealant can be compressed to its 50% size whereas it can be stretched to 100% of its original 
length without any change in the volume of sealant.
Polysulphide sealants are generally supplied in the form of two components packed separately. 
They are to be mixed immediately before being used. They shall confirm to BS 5212-Part II. 
Sealing details of joints when polysulphide sealant is used are given in Fig. 4. Silicon sealants 
are single component type. They shall conform to ASTM Designation D 5893-96. This sealant 
hardens by absorbing moisture from the atmosphere. For it to harden in reasonable time, the 
sealant is placed in thin section.
The cold application sealants are applied in the field either by hand-held guns/syringe or 
machine in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The surface of the sealant shall 
be recessed by not less than 2 mm nor more than 4 mm below the pavement surface. 
Sealants applied at contraction phase of the slabs would result in bulging of the sealant 
over and above the slab. Therefore, the right temperature and time shall be established for 
applying the sealant. A thermometer shall be hung on a pole at the site for facilitating control 
during the sealing operation.
Details of sealing grooves are given for guidance in Figs. 3, 4 and 5. The groove dimensions 
are different for silicone sealants as thin sections are preferred for early curing.
During the sealing operations, it shall be seen that no air bubbles are introduced into the 
sealant either by vapours or during the sealing process.

Manufacturer’s certificate shall be produced for establishing that the sealant is not more than 
six months old or the shelf-life of the sealant.
The cold applied sealants shall be tooled so that the final surface of the sealant has a 
parabolic shape in the surface cross-sectional area or as per the recommendation of the 
manufacturer.
Any sealant that pulls loose from the joints or shows excessive bubbling within one week 
after opening of the pavement to traffic shall be replaced by a fresh application.
7 PREFORMED SEALS
The pre-formed joint scaling material shall be a vulcanized elastomeric compound using 
polychloroprene (Neoprene) as the base polymer.
The Joint Seal Shall conform to requirements of ASTM D 2628 as given in Table 2.

8 RESEALING OLD JOINTS
When existing sealant has cracked or has detached from the sides, the sealant shall be 
removed with a raker, and the surface are cleaned by brushing or using special tools or by 
sawing the groove afresh and air jet upto a depth of at least 20-25 mm. A raker normally used 
for cleaning the joints as shown in Fig. 9. Temporary seal with a jute rope shall be inserted 
to protect the joints from ingress of dirt etc. before resealing joints. If the grooves are too 
narrow, widening by sawing may be necessary. Any spalled edges shall be repaired with 
a cementitious material (epoxy or polymer based fine concrete). Primer shall be applied to 
the cleaned surface in the manner described earlier. If recommended and resealing done as 
described earlier.
