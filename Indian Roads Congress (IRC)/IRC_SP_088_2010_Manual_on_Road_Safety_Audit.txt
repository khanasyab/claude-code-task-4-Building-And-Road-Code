MANUAL ON ROAD SAFETY AUDIT
INTRODUCTION
This Manual on Road Safety Audit is based on the research study sponsored by the Ministry of
Road Transport and Highways to the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), New Delhi. The
study report was submitted by the CRRI in April, 2003 and the research work was initially done by
its
Project Team headed by
Dr.
S.M.
Sarin and
later by
Shri
R.K.
Bajpai and
Dr. (Ms.) Nishi Mittal under the directions of Prof. P.K. Sikdar, the then Director CRRI.
The draft of the Manual was considered and reviewed by the Transport Planning, Traffic Engineering
and Road Safety Committee (H-1 ) of the Indian Roads Congress. As desired by the Committee,
the draft document was revised by the CRRI team headed by Dr. (Ms.) Nishi Mittal under the
direction of Dr. S. Gangopadhyay, Director, CRRI and supported by Shri D.P. Gupta in editing the
whole document in the light of comments made by the Members of the H-1 Committee (Personnel

This Manual is aimed at decision-makers, engineers and technicians throughout the Indian
roads sector, irrespective of whether they work at National, State, District or Local level.
It is
intended for all those who can and should contribute to improve safety on Indian roads.
It
provides procedures for applying quality assurance to road projects, from the standpoint of
road safety. The methodology is known as 'road safety audit'. When its application becomes
widespread,
it is expected to make a significant contribution to the prevention of accidents
on roads.
The application of cost-effective measures on existing roads as a basis for accident reduction
is established through accident investigation procedures, whereas, the application of safety
principles in the provision, improvement and maintenance of roads as a means of accident
prevention can be established through road safety audit. Thus, the purpose of this audit is to
ensure that all road schemes should function as safely as possible, which means that the
road users will be exposed to minimal risks of accidents, on new roads as well as on existing
roads. The purpose of the Manual
is to introduce the subject of road safety audit and to
provide guidelines for conducting audit by qualified and experienced road safety auditors.
The Manual describes the concept of road safety audit, stages when the audit may be taken
up and the process for both new and existing roads. A section has been separately added
for rural roads with special reference to the PMGSY roads. Check Lists related to different
stages and various aspects of road safety have been added to facilitate the task of Road
Safety Audit.
The draft of the Manual, revised by the CRRI team, was considered by the Transport Planning,
Traffic
Engineering
and
Road
Safety
Committee
in
their
meeting
held
on
1 8 September 2009 and
it authorized the Convenor Shri S.C. Sharma to finalise the draft in
the light of comments made by the Committee members and send
it to IRC for consideration
by the Highways Specifications and Standards Committee.
The Highways Specifications and Standards Committee approved the draft in
its meeting
held on 20 October, 2009. Subsequently the draft was approved by the Executive Committee
on
31
October, 2009 and by the Council
in
its
189*^
meeting held
at Patna on
1 4 November, 2009. The document was finalized later taking into consideration the comments
made by the Council Members and those received subsequently, by a small group comprising
S/Shri C.Kandasamy, S.K.Verma and D.P.Gupta under the chairmanship of DG(RD) and
SS, MORTH, Shri Nirma! Jit Singh.

IRC:SP:88~2010
1.1
Road Safety Situation In India
India with
1 ,05,725 fatalities per annum (in year 2006), accounts for about 10 percent of total
world's road fatalities. The share of National Highways and State Highways
in the total road
network is just 6 percent but these cater to 70 to 75 percent of total road traffic in India. However,
the National Highways, which constitute less than 2 percent of the total road network, account for
20 percent of total road accidents and 25 percent of total road traffic fatalities occurring on Indian
roads. Further, the severity of road traffic accidents on National Highways is more because of
higher speeds as compared to other roads. The road safety situation
in India
is worsening.
Accidents, fatalities and casualties have been increasing dramatically over last 20 years - about
5 percent growth rate over last two decades - partly due to exponential growth of vehicles. The
death rate per vehicle is 1 0 to 20 times higher in India as compared to high-income countries like
Sweden, Norway, Japan, Australia, UK and USA.
It is much higher even when compared to many
low-income countries like Brazil, Mexico and Malaysia.
There is loss of productivity, property damage and costs to the hospital system and emergency
services.
In addition, there
is incalculable personal loss of loved ones. For India, the socio-
economic cost of road accidents in
1 999-2000 was estimated at 3 percent of GDP (Tenth Five-
Year Plan Vol.11 page 963). Pedestrians, bicyclists and motorised two-wheeler riders are the
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), which constitute 60-80 percent of all traffic fatalities in India. This
seems logical as this class of road users forms the majority of those on roads. On highways, the
proportion of VRU and other motor vehicle occupants are 32 percent and 68 percent respectively.
In addition, they sustain relatively more serious injuries even at low velocity crashes, unlike car
occupants who are protected by impact absorbing metallic body of the vehicles.
Table 1 .1 shows the worsening situation of road accident fatalities and injuries in India. Accident
prevention can be enhanced by the application of road safety audit over the road network at its
different stages of development.
1.2
Accident Prevention
Accident reduction and accident prevention are the two main strategies in road safety work. In
accident reduction, we use the knowledge of accidents that have occurred on our existing roads
to improve the design of the roads or to influence the behaviour of road users, so that similar
accidents do not occur again.
Accident prevention is the application of expertise in safe road design
- road geometry, as well
as the materials used - when we construct new streets and roads or redesign the existing roads,
regardless of the reasons for which an individual project is undertaken. This expertise
is the
result of research and to a significant extent of practical experience gained through working on
accident reduction.

Accident prevention should be the objective of any highway authority to ensure that the roads are
safe. A road is considered safe when only a few - or, in the best case, no accident occurs.
If many
accidents occur, a road
is not safe, regardless of whether
all standards and norms were
observed during
its planning and design, and regardless of whether any accidents can be
attributed to contravention of the law or other inappropriate behaviour on the part of road users.
In road safety work, the concept of 'contributing accident factors'
is used. There are factors,
which, by their very presence, or which, through their absence have contributed to the occurrence
of an accident. Such factors can be related to the road user, the vehicle and the road and
its
surroundings. Each element, constituting many factors within, contribution (in percentage) in the
occurrence of accidents is presented in Table 1 .2.

Road users are not perfect. Behaviour of road users appears as a contributing factor in all road

frequency of accidents. On the contrary,
it demands that we guide road users into law-abiding
and appropriate behaviour through the design of 'forgiving' roads.
1 .3
Road Safety Audit - Part of Road Safety Strategy
The management of accident risk is both a short-term and a long-term strategy, which requires
support of central and state authorities. The most effective way of managing accident risk is
through the development of a 'safety culture'. A safety culture is 'the ideas and beliefs shared by
all members of an organisation about accidents and the
risk of their happening'. Highway
authorities have the task of delivering products and services to road users, and there are many
practical ways
in which they can do to foster the interest of road safety. The most important
requirement within any highway authority is to have a commitment to road safety. This commitment
allows assuming responsibility for their actions, be
it designing a road, implementation on the
ground, approving a development access, allocating resources or training staff.
It is not necessary
for accidents to occur before steps are taken to both reduce the likelihood of them occurring and
minimize their consequences. Road safety audit should be viewed as part of an overall strategy
to reduce accident risk.
Road safety audit has the greatest potential for improving safety when
it is applied to a road or
traffic design before the project
is
built.
It can be conducted on any design proposal, which
involves changes to the ways road users will interact, either with each other or with their physical
environment. Purpose of the audit is to look at the accident potential and safety performance of
the proposal.
It is a formal process using a defined procedure and not an informal check. To be
effective,
it must be conducted by persons who have appropriate expertise, experience and
training and who are independent of the design team. An audit may also be conducted on an
existing road, since
it permits hazards to be identified and opportunity becomes available to
identify preferred road engineering measures to improve safety.
2 ROAD SAFETY AUDIT - AN OVERVIEW
2.1
What is Road Safety Audit?
Road Safety Audit (RSA)
is a formal procedure for assessing accident potential and safety
performance
in the provision of new road schemes and schemes for the improvement and
maintenance of existing roads.
However, its systematic application can also ensure that a growing awareness about good road
safety principles
is achieved throughout
in highway planning, design, construction and
maintenance organisation. The essential elements of the definition are that
it is:
a)
A formal process and not an informal check,
b)
Carried out by persons who are independent of the design and construction,
c)
Carried out by persons with appropriate expertise, experience and training, and
d)
Restricted to road safety issues.

IRC:SP:88"2010
The main aim of road safety audit is to ensure that all new road schemes operate as safely as
practicable. This means that safety should be considered throughout the entire cycle of design,
construction and pre-opening of any project facility and also during operation & maintenance of
the highway. Specific aims of RSA are
:
a)
To minimize the risk of accidents likely to occur/occurring on the project facility
and to minimize their severity.
b)
To minimize the risk of accidents likely to occur/occurring on adjacent roads
i.e., to avoid creating accidents elsewhere on the network.
c)
To recognise the importance of safety in highway design to meet the needs
and perceptions of all types of road users; and to achieve a balance between
needs of different road user types where they may be
in conflict with one
another.
d)
To reduce long-term costs of a project facility, bearing
in mind that unsafe
designs may be expensive or even impossible to correct at a later stage.
e)
To increase awareness about safe design practices among ail those involved
in the planning, design, construction and maintenance of roads.
Road safety audits assess the operation of a road, focusing on road safety as
it affects the users
of the road. These users include pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists, truck/bus drivers, on-road
public transport users, etc. The outcome of a road safety audit is the identification of any road
safety deficiencies and formulation of recommendations aimed at removing or reducing those
deficiencies.
2.2
Road Safety Audit and Quality Assurance
Road safety audit is an important aspect of Quality Assurance (QA), applied to the implementation
of a road project.
It is a management process in which the provider of goods or services assures
the customer or client of the quality of those goods or services, without the customer or client
having to check each time.
Quality assurance is done by the implementation, in the organization, of a set of procedures
designed to ensure that agreed standards are met. Quality assurance procedures for the design
and implementation of new road or traffic projects are to input road safety engineering expertise
into the design. Often the client and the customer are the same person or organization. In case of
roads, the client for whom the road is designed and built is usually the highway authority, whereas
the customer is the road user. A road safety audit is undertaken for the highway authority to
ensure that the customer is afforded a level of protection from unsafe design and construction.
'Getting
it right the first time' is the underlying theme of quality assurance. Road safety audits
seek to ensure the road operates 'right the first time' once
it opens and that the road users make
fewer mistakes. Quality assurance is a continuous process. So far as the safe design of roads is
concerned, quality assurance starts with a safety culture in an organization. While designing a
6



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 108
======================================================================
1RC:SP:88-2010
road, engineers will apply quality assurance techniques by established procedures and regularly
check the details of their own work. This regular checking includes checking safety aspects. This
type of assessment, however, is not 'road safety auditing' because
it is not done with a 'fresh pair
of eyes' and
it probably is not applying road safety engineering skills and experience required for
the task. Road safety audit, on the other hand, is a 'step-by-step' process, performed at all stages.
An independent road safety audit of the design
is sought, to permit independent road safety
engineering advice to be input, for the benefit of the future road users. Presently,
it has become
practice of involving safety engineers during the life of project, liaising informally with professionals
of all disciplines at all stages, from feasibility/concept stage to completion. In turn, quality assurance
can be applied to the providers of road safety audit services.
2.3
Where Did the Idea of RSA Start and How?
Traffic engineers in UK developed the idea of Road Safety Audit as a safety check for new and
improved road projects and schemes in the early 1980s. The Road Safety Audit process in the
UK started to gather momentum when safety engineers realized that they were carrying out
accident remedial schemes on relatively new roads. Common mistakes in carriageway layout,
positioning and type of street furniture, poor signing and marking, inappropriate surfacing
materials, lack of facilities for vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists were being
repeated over and over. There was no feedback from the safety facilitators to the highway designers
and constructors in the same way as vehicle crash investigators fed their findings into the car
design process. Safety audit was born.
Adopting the principle of 'precaution is better than cure', they decided to use some of the safety
experience they had gained from the remedial work and design safety into new road schemes.
The Institution of Highways and Transportation Guidelines on Accident Investigation and Prevention
produced during that time emphasized on 'safety checking', as an accident prevention mechanism.
The widespread growth in the use of road safety audits has been helped by two facts namely, the
concern with improving road safety and the application of quality assurance principles to road
projects. The road safety audit is a snapshot in time that checks to see
if the quality is being
implemented. Many countries have formulated comprehensive strategies to reduce crash toll,
which in turn have identified safety audits as a part of overall strategic approach.
2.4
Why Road Safety Audit?
Road safety audit must assess projects on the basis of road user knowledge, attributes and
skills, day/night and wet and dry road conditions. Safety audit is only a study of safety aspects
and an auditor may indicate road safety problems inherent in designs that conform to our road
standards. This is due to the fact that our road standards are an expression of a socio-economic
balance between road safety, accessibility, environment and economy.
The goal of road safety audit is to ensure that all new road projects
- and major operating and
maintenance activities on existing roads - are assessed from the standpoint of road safety, so
that any parameters of the project that are unsuitable from the standpoint of road safety are

corrected in time. The benefits of conducting road safety audit are that:
•
The likelihood of accidents on the road network can be reduced,
•
The severity of accidents can be reduced,
•
Road safety is given greater prominence in the minds of road designers and
traffic engineers,
•
The need for costly remedial work is reduced, and
•
The total cost of a project to the community, including accidents, disruption and
trauma, is minimized.
The cost of road safety audit and the consequent cost of changing a design are significantly less
than the cost of remedial treatments after works are constructed.
It
is easier to change the
lines/alignment or so on a plan than to move concrete structures. With less remedial work
included
in a highway authority's works programme, budgets can be kept down or the same
money can be utilized more effectively.
2.5
Road Safety Audit
: What is Done and Not Done
ROAD SAFETY AUDIT IS
:
a)
Minimizing the likelihood of crashes occurring through safety-conscious
planning and design;
b)
Ensuring that,
if a crash occurs, then the likelihood of the injury is minimized
(such as provision of anti-skid surfacing and crash barriers);
c)
Ensuring that safety related design criteria (e.g. critical sight distances) have
been met;
d)
Managing risks, such that the risk of major safety problems occurring is less
than the risk of minor problems occurring;
e)
Reducing the whole-life cycle costs of a design (unsatisfactory designs are
expensive to correct after they are built);
f)
Minimizing the risk of crashes on the adjacent road network (particularly at
intersections) as well as on the new road scheme;
g)
Enhancing the importance and relevance of road safety engineering
in
highway design work and to enhance consideration for the safety of
all
categories of road users in all new and existing schemes.
ROAD SAFETY AUDIT IS NOT
:
a)
A way of assessing or rating a project as good or poor;
b)
A means of ranking or justifying one project against others in a works programme;
c)
A way of rating one option against another;

2.6
Who Does The Safety Audit?
To be effective, the safety audit needs to be carried out by specialists, who are independent of
the design process.
In this way auditors will be taking a fresh look at the project without the
distraction of having been involved
in their design. Road safety audit involves one set of
professionals checking the work of other professionals. Crucial factor is that auditors should be
independent and impartial. Road safety auditor must not question the justification for a project
but must bring to light its consequences on road safety and endeavour to ensure that the project
as presented in the brief is as safe as possible. Auditors need to be objective in their assessments,
yet sensitive to the fact that no one likes criticism. Designers and clients need to consider audit
recommendations objectively as brought out from the audit outcome.
Expertise and experience in road safety engineering are the essential ingredients in any road
safety audit team. This should be linked to an understanding of:
•
Traffic engineering and traffic management, and
•
Road design and road construction techniques
A person who has an understanding of road user behaviour and human perception is also likely
to be able to develop road safety audit skills. This understanding
is
in fact a desirable
skill
because of the interactive nature of road user behaviour with the road environment. An audit
team leader must not only have knowledge and skills in road safety engineering, but also should
have received training and participated
in a number of audits.
It
is expected that the safety
auditors
will apply due diligence
in
identifying the deficiencies and evolving audit
recommendations which should be supported with reasons.
The Authority, which engage safety auditors should ensure that the team leader has:
•
Adequate road safety engineering experience for the stage of the audit,
•
Successfully completed a recognised audit training course,
•
At least five years experience in a relevant road design, road construction or
traffic engineering field, and
•
Undertaken at least three road safety audits including design stage, etc.
It is not practical or necessary to have a multi-member team conducting an audit. An audit of a
low budget project, a road safety audit by more than two persons may not be justified. For large
projects, three persons are needed where as for small projects two persons will be required.

2.7
Organisations Involved In Road Safety Audit
Road Safety Audit is based on the principle of an independent review. Road safety audit process
reveals that three parties will be involved in this process - Client, Designer and Auditor. For the
Public Private Partnership projects (PPP) the
client would be both the Govt, and the
Concessionaire with their respective obligations as provided
in the Concession Agreement.
One fundamental idea is that disagreements between the designer and the auditor are resolved
not by the designer but by the client. So
it is an interaction between different parties, whose roles
are predefined at specific stages. In India, for large and small projects client may be National
Highways Authority of India (NHAI)/Ministry of Road Transport and Highways/concerned Public
Works Departments (PWD). Designer may be one consultant and Auditor may be another
consultant. Sometimes design may be done by the design section of concerned client. Here the
client and the designer are same. In such cases, some other divisions of concerned highway/
road authorities could carry out the task of auditing. Main functions of the key stages in road
safety audit are shown in Table 2.1
. In case of PMGSY projects of road connectivity to villages
and other rural habitations, the National Rural Roads Development Agency (NRRDA) and the
State Rural Roads Development Agency (SRRDA) at the State level would be concerned. Their
State technical agencies would need to be sensitized to check the estimate, alignment, etc.,
from safety angle also, keeping in view the constraints of the availability of land. For roads in
urban areas, the client may be local urban bodies, municipal corporations, urban development
authorities etc.
2.7.1
Role of designer
Designer is responsible for planning/designing the project. Designer bears the responsibility for
ensuring that a road safety audit is conducted and that the necessary measures are agreed on
the basis of the auditor's recommendations and / or the client's decisions. The designer is also
responsible for ensuring that the audit input information is unambiguously defined and that all
circumstances are described in an easily understandable manner. For existing roads,
it is the
responsibility of operating organisation of the relevant highway authority which requests the auditor
to prepare accident analysis of the project and which arranges for the road operator to be notified
about the results of the audit. The project manager, or design engineer should be responsible for
initiating the safety audit process for each scheme and for responding to the audit. The role of the
designer is thus to:
•
Attend commencement and completion meetings.
•
Bring out the action proposed
in response to the audit report and
its
recommendations and to document these proposed actions.
•
Implement the decisions given by the client on the proposed action by
amending the original design
•
Feed the experience back into the designer's organization and to avoid similar
design problems recurring.

2.7.2
Role of client
Client is one who allots the project to the designer and owns the project. As the party responsible
for the basic conditions of the project,
it is the task of the client to decide in cases where the
designer and auditor disagree. Disagreements are presented to the client who conveys its decision
to the designer and the auditor. Road operator assumes this responsibility in case of existing
roads. The client should be responsible for ensuring that clear terms of reference are laid down
to cover the whole range and scope of audit and for commissioning audits at appropriate stages.
The role of the client is thus to:
•
Select an appropriate auditor,
•
Provide all the relevant and necessary documents, and
•
Hold a commencement meeting with the auditor and the client.
2.7.3
Role of auditor
Auditor's responsibility is to carefully review the presented project material in its entirety, in the
light of best road safety expertise and from the viewpoints of all relevant road users. Auditor also

indicates all circumstances that cause misgivings conceming road safety. Persons designated
as Road Safety Auditors work with, and have experience of, road accident analyses and road
accident reduction. Auditors must be familiar with road planning, design and construction work
and must undertake to keep their expertise up-to-date.
Auditors should comply with the terms of reference. They should comment only on the safety
implications of schemes and provide constructive recommendations as to how any potential
difficulties can be resolved. The role of the auditor is thus to:
•
Review all the documents and audit the drawings and designs,
•
Inspect the site (including during night time),
•
Repeat these two steps,
•
Prepare a report,
•
Hold a completion meeting with the designer or client or both,
•

2.8
What Type of Projects should be Audited?
Road safety audits are applicable to all types of road projects and to all categories of roads in
both urban and non-urban areas. Road safety audits can be conducted on road projects as
diverse as:
•
Expressways,
•
Major four-laning and multi-laning projects,
•
Reconstruction and realignment projects,
•
Intersection projects both signalised and non-signalised
•
Pedestrian and bicycle routes,
•
Rural roads providing access to villages/habitations
•
Access roads near project roads,
•
Local area traffic management schemes in urban areas
•
Accident reduction schemes,
•
Traffic calming measures through built-up areas
•
Approaches to bridges, rail over/under bridges
•
Grade separators and interchanges
Some road authorities require a percentage of design projects on major roads to be audited.
Others require all projects, or a percentage of projects, above a set value to be audited.
It is unrealistic
to audit all projects at all possible design stages. When deciding which projects should be audited
12



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2010
ahead of any other, the effective allocation of resources should be a deciding factor. Choose a
range of project sizes and seek to audit them earlier rather than later. Audits can also be conducted
on projects, which are 'off-road', but which affect nearby roads or create off-road areas, which
effectively operate like roads. Audits would also prove useful in rural roads being constructed under
the PMGSY and other state government programmes for the reasons that due to policy of land
contribution by the community, situations could arise in some stretches where geometries are
compromised. However, safety audit in respect of such roads should be simplified but process
should be effective. Chapter 7 describes the essential elements of such a process along with
safety aspects that may be considered by the road agencies in design stage itself.
For some schemes
it may be possible to omit or combine stages. For example, PPR and DPR
stages can be combined for smaller improvements, or for traffic management, feasibility and
PPR stages can be combined. Table 2.3 sets guidelines for organizing the road safety audit
system. There
is need for post delivering monitoring of RSA after
its recommendations are
implemented. This would provide feedback for its effectiveness.

Ways of Organising a Road Safety Audit
There are many ways of organizing a road safety audit. However, the two essential attributes of
road safety auditor are that the person should be skilled and independent. Practically, two options
are there for conducting a road safety audit:
•
Audit by specialist auditors,
•
Audit by those within the original design team or by other road designers.
13



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2010
In case of audit by specialist auditors, team needs to be a separate entity from the normal road
design functions of an organisation and team members should not, except for the purpose of an
audit, be involved with the design of the project. There needs to be a clear understanding, prior to
commencement of an audit, about how the audit findings and recommendations will be dealt
with. Someone has to consider the safety recommendations and resolve the inevitable
trade-offs i.e., project cost, road capacity, likelihood of severity of accidents, etc. In every case
where an audit recommendation is rejected, the reasons must be stated and documented. Other
ways of dealing with audit recommendations can include:
•
A requirement that each recommendation must be formally considered by the
client with a view to its acceptance in a normal course and the work cannot
proceed to the next stage until formal written approval has been issued by the
client based on the recommendations of the audit team.
•
The audit recommendations are considered by the designers, or by the project
manager. This has the risk that the safety concerns may be rationalized away,
in the atmosphere of keeping the project moving with minimal changes.
Instead of using specialist auditors, another designer or design team could undertake the audit.
This approach may be applicable in organisations, which have sufficient road design work to
have two or more separate design teams. This separation provides a level of independence. But
this arrangement does not provide for the one essential ingredient in any road safety audit
experience in road safety engineering. Using auditors from within the same organisation also
has
its limitations.
It may be considered that the original designer can audit his or her own
designs, on the basis that this
is better than nothing. However,
this option does not meet
requirement of independence. Experience shows that no matter how concerned a designer or
design team is about road safety,
it is almost inevitable that they will be too close to the issues in
the design to apply the 'fresh pair of eyes' needed to inquire into design policies, approaches or
details. A more effective way to organize a road safety audit is to engage specialist auditor(s)
who is(are) independent and possess requisite road safety engineering skills and experience.
The independence of the RSA Team is vital to ensure that the design team does not influence the
recommendations of the Safety Audit and, therefore, compromise safety at the expense of other
issues. This, however, does not mean that there should not be any interaction between the
Design Team and the Safety Auditors. A meeting between Safety Auditors at the start and at the
end of the audit process would be useful and Safety Auditors could be asked to provide advice
on safety issues during the design. However, the independence of the Audit Team is critical and
should not be compromised.
2.10
Road Safety Auditors and Key Personnel in RSA
2.10.1
Qualifications and background
A road safety audit is performed by an individual or team with expertise in one or more areas of
road safety. Typical backgrounds include traffic or transportation engineering, highway design
and construction, crash investigation and analysis and human factors/road-user behaviour.
14



======================================================================
PAGE 27 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2010
While
it is not always feasible or practical to use a team in conducting audits,
it is very important
that auditors possess an understanding of traffic engineering and road design techniques and
have some experience
in crash
investigation. An understanding of human factors
is also
important, because of the strong interaction between road users and road environment.
The desirable qualifications and background of the auditors at different stages of the Road Safety
Audit are as under:
a)
For Feasibility and Preliminary Project Report (PPR) Stages
•
Road Safety Specialist with experience in accident investigation, safety
management, safety engineering principles and assessment of
potential user risks;
•
Road Design Engineer with familiarity in geometric design standards;
•
Person with Safety Audit Experience and/or with specialist knowledge
of any aspect of proposal and who can generate discussion.
b)
For Detailed Project Report (DPR) Stage
In addition to the safety specialist person with specialist skills as
in DPR,
depending on the type of the scheme; e.g., experience in traffic signal control
of facilities for Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), experience in geometric design
standards, traffic control devices etc.
c)
For Pre-opening Stage and In-service Roads
Additional representatives are recommended, e.g.,
•
Police Officer experienced in regulation of traffic;
•
Engineer who will be responsible for maintenance of the scheme with
experience of similar roads; and
•
Person familiar with road user needs for schemes which are particularly
relevant for VRU.
d)
For Smaller Schemes
Two persons with safety and traffic engineering specialization.
2.10.2
Size of RSA team
The most appropriate size of an audit team depends on the size of the audit task; there is no
optimum number of members in a team. Teams of more than four persons, at times, can be
unmanageable. Major projects require at least two persons. Experienced auditors often discourage
one-man teams.
Experience has shown that two persons carrying out a Safety Audit will identify more potential
safety issues than a single Safety Auditor. In many cases, the Senior Auditor will be the Team
15



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2010
Leader with the second person being a team member. Ideally,
it is desirable to have a team of
individuals rather than a single auditor for the following reasons:
a)
Diverse backgrounds and different approaches of different experts are
beneficial.
b)
The cross-fertilization of ideas that can result from discussions is helpful.
c)
More than one "pair of eyes" can be an advantage
Therefore,
it is recommended that a Safety Audit Team should comprise normally two persons
who are independent of the team, involved in project design or construction.
2.1 0.3
Training of auditors and training content
Training in the audit process must be recognized, as vital,
if the road safety audit is to retain
credibility as a powerful road safety engineering tool. Training of Road Safety Auditors is essential
and any Audit Team member should have attended recognized road safety engineering and
Safety Audit training courses. The situation in India, at present, is that there is no formal qualification
in Safety Audit or Road Safety Engineering.
It is possible for staff with very little safety engineering
experience to produce audits that are at best a check on design standards. In the initial stages of
introduction of safety audit for road projects, the safety audit inputs may be provided by research/
academic institutions. Three groups of individuals need specific RSA training:
•
Those who need awareness
of the process
(typically road safety
professionals, senior managers);
•
Those who are to understand the audits; and
•
Those who are to use and respond to the audit outcomes (typically project
managers).
The minimum requirements of road safety audit training course should be:
•
Thedefinitionof an RSAandwhy itisneeded?
•
How road safety audit is applied and managed?
•
How to present an audit report, and how to respond to an audit report;
•
Geometric Design
Principles, Traffic Control Devices,
Intersections and
Interchange Design
•
At least one
real-life case study, preferably a design stage audit or a
pre-opening stage audit.
•
Road Safety Engineering and Principles of Traffic Flow
Other associated and preferable training in the following topics should be encouraged:
•
Black-spot investigations
•
Road side hazards and the use of crash barriers
16

•

•

•
Tlie preparation of response action reports.
It may be mentioned tliat the Transit New Zealand has a training process whereby a potential
auditor
is
first an observer on an audit team, then a team member on a group led by an
experienced auditor and eventually moves to a team leader position. This is interpreted as an
informal accreditation process.
2.11
Success Factors
It is understandable that some design engineers may perceive safety audits as unnecessary
check on design skills. The success of the road safety audit process depends on trust and
commitment from all parties. Audits identify deficiencies and could be viewed as threat to road
designers.
It is critical that the focus be on the process and audit report not be viewed as criticism
of the project design. A designer may have legitimate reasons for making decisions that consider
factors other than safety in the proposed design and the compromise could be identified in the
audit. Factors influencing a decision would be identified in a response to the safety audit. Since
a structured safety audit can usefully identify potential problems and make recommendations for
alleviating them, a safety audit, as such, should be regarded as an aid to design of safer roads.
2.12
Costs and Benefits
Due to infancy of the road safety audit process, there is only limited documented information on
costs and benefits. Evidence to date indicates that auditing a large-scale new project (requiring
audit at various stages) will add about 4 to 6 percent (total) to the road design costs. As design
costs can be in the order of 2 to 3 percent of total implementation costs for projects, the increase
in total project costs is insignificant. The cost of rectifying any inadequacies depends on how
early in the design process they are identified and the consequent amount of redundant design
time.
•
An evaluation study, (Schelling,
1 995) which involved a cost-benefit analysis of
1 3 projects in Denmark that had been subject to road safety audit, gave a first
year rate of return of 146 percent.
•
A study in the Middle East, which considered a number of projects that were
not subject to road safety audit but developed problems soon
after
construction, concluded that road safety audit would have provided a first year
rate of return of 120 percent. (Al Masaeid, 1998)
•
One British road safety expert (Sabey,
1 993) has reported that the systematic
application of road safety audit procedures (including audit of existing roads)
across
Britain has the potential to give a 3 percent saving
in casualty
accidents.

IRC:SP:88-2010
The benefits of road safety audit are numerous. They range from the more obvious direct
improvements in a design to aspects as broad as enhancement of corporate safety policies.
Other important benefits are:
Safer roads through accident prevention and accident severity reduction.
More explicit consideration of the safety needs of vulnerable road users.
Enhancement of road safety engineering.
Reduced whole life-costs of road schemes.
Eliminating or avoiding need to modify new schemes after they are built.
Incorporating safety parameters in standards and procedures.
There are clear, positive benefits from the road safety audit process. The cost of an audit is low
(in the order of 0.1 percent of the total project cost). With such low costs and potential for high
returns, road safety audit is a process that should become a practice at all levels of governments.
3 STAGES OF ROAD SAFETY AUDIT
Safety Audit can be applied on (a) new roads and (b) existing roads. On new roads, safety audit
will lead to avoiding building accident-prone situations and on existing roads, audit will lead to
improved roads from the safety point of view.
It should be realized that safety audits are a necessary
cost, and not an additional expense. As project is audited,
it provides further scope to improve/
enhance safety. In projects where there is a choice of route or standards, or there are known
safety problems, the designer should discuss these with auditors at the initial stage. The safety
audit shall be carried out on road and traffic improvement projects. Safety audit during construction
stage is a new concept and no country has developed any checklists for carrying road safety
audit during construction stage.

Stage 2 is recommended on completion of preliminary design, to assess horizontal and vertical
alignments, sight lines and layout of junctions including slip roads and lay-byes. After this stage,
land acquisition may be taken up.
Examination when preliminary design is completed i.e., where the alignment has largely been
decided, but can
still be modified before approval. Important subjects for assessment at this
stage are:
•
Project changes since Stage

Stage 3 is recommended on completion of detailed design and before preparation of contract
documents, to assess detailed junction layout, markings, signs, signals, lighting details, etc.
Examination when detailed design is completed and the limits of expropriation have been set,
but before the tender documents are prepared and tenders are
invited.
Vital subjects for
assessment at this stage are:
•
Project changes since Stage 2 Audit
•
Detail Design of junctions
•
Design of geometries
•
Cross-fall
•
Markings and Signs

Stage 4 Audit (During Construction Stage)
Construction zone is that area of the road which is affected by the works and which affects traffic
flow and safety of workers and road users. In this context
it can also be called Traffic Control
Zone'.
In
rural areas, problem at these zones
is accentuated by the reduced availability of
carriageway, acquisition of land for diversions, etc. In urban areas, the problems are even more
acute as diversions may have to be over adjacent road street of the road network as well as the
sharing of road space by different categories of road users. Traffic control zone can be divided
into three major components i.e.. Advance Warning Zone, Transition Zone and Work Zone. Manual
on Traffic Management at Construction Zones is published by the Indian Roads Congress as
IRC:SP:55 should be referred to. Steps involved in Stage 4 Audit are given in Fig. 3.4.
•
Examination of Terminal Transition Zone, Work Zone, Approach Transition Zone
and Advance Warning Zone with respect to safety point of view.
•
Examination of safety measures adopted for workmen and road users.
•
Examination of traffic control devices adopted at construction zone.

Motorists need to know about safe driving requirements in construction zones. Major problems
in work zones are attentiveness and speed.
It
is necessary to help the drivers to be more
attentive by using signages, rumble strips and any thing that brings alertness and gets them to
realize that there is something different about this stretch of road and there would be lower speed
limits in the work zones. Work zone safety measures should be aggressive and comprehensive.
It should include public service announcements, safety training for workers in work zones, lower
speed limits in work zones, rumble strips and other speed reducing measures, proper signages,
flagman to control and guide traffic, stepped-up enforcement.
3.5
Stage 5 Audit (Completion of Construction) (Pre-opening)
Stage 5 is recommended immediately prior to opening of scheme, involving the site staff and
local traffic police in car and truck. This should take the form of driving and when appropriate,
walking and/or cycling the new route. This is checked during night time also to ensure that required
night time safety standards have been achieved.
•
A final review of the finished construction, to check from the standpoint of road
safety that
it is ready to be opened for traffic.
It is particularly important to check
the location and
visibility of markings and other
traffic control devices
especially where changes were made during the construction period. The
finished scheme should be assessed from the road users' point of view
in
daylight and in darkness.
•
After opening for one or two months, the auditor should examine whether or not
road users are using the project facility in an appropriate manner.
Many schemes are constructed with the road open to traffic throughout the entire construction
phase. When there is no question of an actual opening for traffic, an overall examination is to be
carried out to audit whether the markings and
all
traffic control devices are
in place. This
examination is to be carried out by the auditor independently in the first instance and thereafter
along with the Project Manager of the Contractor. Steps involved
in Stage 5 Audit are given
in Fig. 3.5.

Stage 6 Audit-Audit on Existing Roads and During Operation and
Maintenence of Concession Projects
Safety Audit methodology is also successful on existing roads which includes both Operation
and Maintenance (O&M) of existing roads. The existing roads represent the present condition of
the road after completion of construction as well as any hazardous conditions that may have
been created during its lifetime such as encroachments, ribbon development or deterioration of
road conditions as well as traffic conditions, etc.
An analysis of any accident data and inspection of the scheme every year, with a view to
determine whether or not road users use the scheme appropriately. Subjects for monitoring
include:
a)
Does the prevailing speed correspond to the design speed?
b)
Are the visibility and sight distance criteria still satisfied?
c)
Have any changes been made which could affect road safety?
d)
For carriageway and paved shoulders examine things
like any breach or
blockade, roughness value, pot holes, cracking, rutting, skidding, damage to
pavement, edge drop at shoulders.
e)
Check the roadside furniture including road signs and markings damage to
their shape or position, loss of retro-reflectivity
f)
Street lighting and Highway Traffic Management System (HTMS)
g)
Rest areas - cleaning, defects in electrical, water and sanitary installations.
h)
Bridges - super structure, foundations, bearings, joints, etc.
3.7
What are tlie Safety Issues to be Focused in Different Stages of thie Project?
There are at least four distinct phases at which a road safety audit may be conducted. Only
experience with the process will enable one to determine how and when the audits should occur.
At different stages of the project, the safety issues focused will be different as these are not the
same at all stages. Table 3.1 details the safety issues that need to be focused at different stages
of the project. On the various highway upgradation programmes being carried out in India,
it is
suggested that road safety audit be carried out at RPR, DPR and Pre-opening stages.
It is to be
recognized that safety audits at DPR stage in case of EPC contracts and development stage in
case of BOT contracts would be most advantageous to all key players in the sector.
3.B
What are the Data Requirements for RSA?
The database for conducting an audit should include plans and drawings; site information, such
as detailed crash history and traffic volumes; design standards that have been used; environmental
effects; and on-site evaluations, which examine a location from the perspective of the road users
(motorists, drivers of buses and trucks, pedestrians, or bicyclists). The RSA must encompass a
review of
all types of movements, special needs of the elderly and disabled, weather and
environmental problems.

4 ROAD SAFETY AUDIT PROCESS
4.1
Audit of New Roadway Sections
Road Safety Audit is a relatively straightforward process. For smaller projects some of the steps
shown may be brief, but the sequence of the steps will still apply. Responsibility for the planning,
design and construction
of the project always remains with the road authority and the
implementation team. On new roadway sections Stage
1 Audit to Stage 5 Audit will be applied
depending upon the stage of the project. The steps in the road safety audit process are illustrated
in flow chart in Fig. 4.1
. The details of each step of the flow chart should be adapted to suit the
nature and scale of particular project.
It is not the role of the road safety auditor to take over or
redesign the project. The role of the auditor is to provide independent advice
in the form of
written recommendations. The designer and/or client then consider the advice and a formal

decision is taken by the road authority on whether or not to adopt each of the safety measures
recommended by the Audit Team. The key steps in a successful road safety audit are:
a)
Selecting an appropriate auditor and audit team
b)
Obtaining
all the relevant background information and related documents
covering plans, designs, etc.
c)
Conducting a site inspection.
d)
Providing a written report.
To carry out safety audit on new roadway sections scheme/rehabilitation scheme, the following
should be thoroughly cross-checked. The team should check planning, cross-sections,
alignment, road side furniture and facilities available, junctions, facilities for road users, signs,
markings and lighting and also road side hazards. The process is described in Sections 4.1 .1 to
4.1 .9. Some of the important considerations in a road safety audit include:
a)
Alignment inconsistency
- no unexpected sharp curves or steep grades.
If
unavoidable, such stretch should have proper road signages and speed
management measures.
b)
Cross-sections must be consistent - no narrow sections.
If unavoidable, they
should be preceded with cautionary signs.
c)
Hardshouldersof required width.
d)
Proper super elevation and extra widening (on curves).
e)
Side slopes and side drains.
f)
Signages on curves and other difficult sections.
g)
Signages and safety barriers at hazardous locations.
h)
Footways, parking areas and service roads in towns.
i)
Layout and design of intersections, interchanges, grade separators.
j)
Provision of lay-byes at bus stops and important truck stops.
k)
Road signs, pavement markings, other Traffic Control Devices, roadside
furniture and crash barriers.
I)
Guard rails, crash barriers on bridges and in medians on multilane highways.
m)
Marking of overtaking sections and treatment of sections with deficient sight
distance and substandard horizontal curves.
4.1 .1
Selecting road safety audit team
Objective: To select an audit team whiichi is independent, hias appropriate skills for the
particular project and would exercise due diligence in preparing the Audit Report.
The audit team may comprise of two members for small projects and three members for large
projects. One of the team members should be nominated as Road Safety Audit Manager.
27



======================================================================
PAGE 40 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2010
Where specific additional skills are required in case of complex projects, a specialist can be
invited to be part of the audit team for a limited time to provide advice on the relevant issues. The
one essential ingredient in any road safety audit team is road safety engineering experience.
Selection of audit team for different stages of audit is presented in Section 2.1 0. The audit team
should fulfill the following checklists:
a)
Is the auditor independent? - Can he/she apply 'fresh eyes' to the task?
b)
Is the auditor trained and/ or experienced?
- At least attended a training
workshop and worked on a previous audit.
c)
Has the auditor got the necessary
skills
in the areas of road safety
engineering,
traffic engineering,
traffic management, road design and
accident investigation and prevention?
d)
Does the auditor have an aptitude for the task?
- To see potential safety
problems from different road users' points of view.
4.1 .2
Enhancing availability of skilled personnel for road safety audit
The Audit Team should associate one person to get groomed in Road Safety Audit work under
orders of Auditor/Employer.
4.1 .3
Providing Tfie background information
Objective: To provide tfie audit team with thie necessary information and documents for
assessment of the project from safety point of view
The client should arrange to provide all the necessary information and documents in a usable
form for the audit team. This should not be left to the audit team to do. Information will include
project reports, design details, data, drawings, etc.
It may be necessary to collect additional
information, such as traffic volumes, vehicular speed, etc. This should be considered early enough
to avoid delays to the road safety audit process. As a minimum, the audit team is to be provided
with the following documents
:
a)
Statement of the Expected Outcome
The client should provide the auditor with the expected outcome from the audit.
This may require a written brief or a simple TOR (Terms of Reference) for the
proposed audit of the project.
b)
Project intent
This sets out the purpose of the project and the design standards adopted. The
client may highlight, any deficiencies that need to be addressed, any design
compromises that have been made and the reasons and any community input
from prior discussion, correspondence and consultations.

have been prepared by different consultants or in-house teams of the
client, a set of all such designs and drawings to be furnished.
Zero date for commencement of Audit would be after these documents are provided to the Auditor.
4.1.4
Commencement meetings
Objective: To acquaint thie auditor witli tiie badiground of the project, to hand over the
relevant information and documents and also share with the designers and the client
with the proposed audit process
Holding a meeting between client, designer and auditor, provides the opportunity to explain to
the audit team the project's purpose, any issues specific to the project and any particular problems
which have been experienced in achieving planning, design or construction objectives. The audit
team will not be able to inspect the site under all traffic or weather conditions, so
if particular
conditions are important, the auditors should be advised. The audit team's task is to identify and
document any road safety concern and recommendations.
4.1.5
Assessing the documents
Objective: To review the designs, drawings and other background information to form
an opinion on the safety performance and accident potential of the road.
This phase takes place at the same time as the site inspection, the documents being reviewed
both before and after the site visit. Before inspecting the site, initially study the documents to
record the first impressions:
list possible issues to be checked on site. Plans and drawings,
traffic and accident data and other information should be assessed.
29



======================================================================
PAGE 42 of 108
======================================================================
!RC:SP:88-2010
The audit team then identifies the areas, which are deficient in respect of safety or require further
explanation from the designer using the checklists as required. The audit team should confine
itself to relevant road safety aspects and consider the designer's compliance with engineering
standards and guidelines.
Safety does not come automatically by complying with the standards and guidelines. But they
provide the road user with consistent treatments and they should be applied unless,
in a
particular situation, they are unlikely to result in a satisfactory level of safety performance.
4.1 .6
Inspecting the site
Objective: To see how the project proposal interacts with its surroundings and nearby
roads; to visualise potential impediments and conflicts for road users.
This gives the audit team the opportunity to see how the project interacts with the surroundings
and to visualise the potential obstacles and conflicts, which the road user is likely to encounter.
Prior to the
site inspection the team should review the proposed checklists. A night time
inspection is also essential, except where road access is not yet available to the project site or to
its connection points to the existing road system. The information available to road users can be
markedly different at night time and
it can be surprising what additional issues can be identified
on a night time inspection, even where work has not yet commenced.
The inspection should also include adjacent sections of road as
it is at these locations that the
greater hazards could occur:-
•
Road layouts and devices that operated safely can be changed once traffic
volumes, speeds or movements have been altered.
•
Road users may be unaware that they must adjust their behaviour due to the
new project, which often disrupts the existing traffic and pedestrian movement
patterns.
The audit teams site visit leads
it to appreciate any future problems relating to the existing
arrangement and to visualise the proposals and their possible effects. The inspection should be
carried out from the point of view of all road user groups and not just motorists. The inspection for
different user groups should include different types of movements such as crossing the road,
entering the traffic flow as well as for travelling along the highway.
4.1 .7
Preparation of safety audit report
Objective: To report on the findings of the audit team and to make appropriate
recommendation, regarding how these deficiencies may be overcome.
The report should contain the features of the project, deficiencies which involve hazards and
make recommendations about corrective actions. The recommendations must reflect sound
judgement of the audit team and should be backed with convincing reasons for appreciation by

the decision makers. Further, these recommendations will indicate the directions rather than
details of the solutions to improve safety. The responsibility for acceptance of the directions will
rest with the client. On acceptance, the responsibility for detailing the solutions will rest with the
designer.
The report should be a concise, brief document setting out a summary of the measures to be
taken, the reasoning behind recommendation of such measures and the items identified that
require remedial measures/ treatment from the safety point of view. The recommendations should
be numbered or identified in a way, which make them easy to refer to in the follow-up reports.
Any safety issue, which is considered to be of sufficient concern to warrant immediate attention
should be identified in the recommendations with the words 'FOR IMMEDIATE ATTENTION'
and any safety problem, considered to have great potential danger should be identified as
'IMPORTANT'. In line with the need to maintain good communication with the designer and the
client, the audit team should share the draft Audit Report with them and endeavour to resolve any
uncertainties or misunderstandings by talking with the designer before drawing conclusions.
However, the audit team must maintain a position
of independence while finalizing the
recommendations and the Audit Report.
Consistent with the scale of the project and subsequent scale of the audit, the report should be
presented as under:
Project Information
-
A report title which gives the name of the project and
its extent, together with the stage of construction or
development at which the audit is being undertaken.
-
A very brief description of the proposal with an
overall plan.
Background Information

4.1.8
Holding a completion meeting
Objective: To discuss ttie recommendations for corrective action.
This meeting
will involve auditors,
client, road authorities or the concessionaire and the
designers to discuss recommendations in the report and should be conducted in a way that the
independence of the auditor
is maintained and respected. However,
it
is expected that the
auditor shall defend
his recommendations based on
his findings.
Financial and budget
constraints may sometimes influence the decision on, whether the recommendations can be
adopted. However,
it is not auditors task to take these into consideration;
it is the duty of client
and designer.
Efforts should be made to resolve misunderstandings
if any, prior to the report being finalized.
4.1 .9
Responding to the audit report
Objective: To deal witti audit recommendations in an effective manner; to decide wtiettier
and tiow thie recommendations of ttie road safety audit should be implemented and,
where it is decided otherwise, to give reasons in writing for the decision; to put agreed
audit recommendations into effect.
When audit report is received,
it has to be acted upon so that safety is enhanced. A management
and monitoring control system may be kept in place to keep the track of audits. The client would
do well to respect the outcome of the safety audit. The objective
is to deal with audit
recommendations
in an effective and objective manner; to decide whether and how the
recommendations of the road safety audit should be implemented and, where
it
is decided
otherwise,
to record the reasons
in writing
for such a decision;
to put agreed audit
recommendations into effect.
4.1.10
Implementing the agreed recommendations
Once the client has taken decision on the Audit Report and finalized the list of recommendations
that are accepted and agreed, they need to be implemented. The designer has to develop
design changes, which address the safety problems.
If audit has been carried out at the
pre-opening stage, the actions need to be implemented as soon as possible on site.
If a serious
problem is identified, temporary warning, delineation or other treatment may be needed until the
agreed solution is implemented.
As a way of gaining knowledge from audits, audited and unaudited design projects need to be
monitored for about three years after they are
built, to see whether accident problems are
occurring and,
if so, whether the problems were anticipated
in an audit. This can provide

valuable feedback to refine the audit procedures and
skill enhancement of the members
comprising the Audit Team and sensitize the Road Agencies to not only encourage the system of
Road Safety Audits for their important projects but also to enhance implementation of the
recommended measures.
4.2
Audit of Existing Roadway Sections
The steps described in Section 4.1
refer to new roadway sections. Existing road also can be
audited to assess their accident potential.
It provides a systematic way of being proactive in
reducing the future likelihood of accidents. Audits of existing roads involve a similar approach to
that for new road projects. The steps given in the flow chart in Fig. 4.1 should be followed, but the
steps of inspecting the site and assessing the documents will vary. Accident records will be an
important part of the information to be assessed, but they must be supplemented by informed
judgements about the potential for other types of accidents. The aim is to identify any existing
safety deficiencies of design, layout and road furniture, which are not consistent with the road's
function and use. There should be consistency of standards such that the road user's perception
of local conditions assists safe behaviour.
For conducting safety audit on existing roadway sections field studies
like road inventory,
classified volume counts, speed survey and study of first information reports from police records
are essential. Ideally audits of an authority's existing road network should be done on a regular
basis.
It may be several years between successive audits, but a rolling programme of audits
should be developed which covers every road in the network. As the road is already built, the
inspection plays an important role. As with a road safety audit of any type of project, the road
should be inspected from the point of view of all the likely road user groups and not just motorists.
The road should be inspected for each user group and for the different types of movement.
Following completion of road, safety audit report for an existing road, the highway authority will
need to make an assessment of the cost effectiveness of the recommended solutions. Some
solutions may be in the nature of maintenance treatment and can be easily implemented. Some
solutions may be expensive. In some cases lower cost options may be available and they may
provide benefits only marginally less than the expensive option, in some cases, expensive option
may be the only effective solution.
It will also usually be necessary to set priorities for action on
the road under review, as not all recommended improvements can be funded immediately. Audit
report should highlight those problems, which are considered so urgent that they require
immediate attention. Issues and problems will vary, depending on the road's environment, the
topography and terrain, when
it was built and whether it has previously been audited.
4.2.1
Road inventory
Highway features determine road traffic safety, besides road capacity and economic traffic
operations. Highway features are visible elements of highway and consist of various components.
So, the safe and efficient operation of highway is governed by road geometric parameters, traffic
control devices, lighting system of the stretch, composition of traffic, drainage condition, junction
layout, parking facilities, cross drainage structures and the adjoining land use of the stretch.
33



======================================================================
PAGE 46 of 108
======================================================================
!RC:SP:88-2010
Road geometry comprises parameters
like road width, shoulder width, footpath, height of
embankment, sight distance, horizontal curvature, vertical curvature, etc. The traffic control devices
comprise signs, markings, delineators, crash barriers, guard rails, etc.
4.2.2
Classified volume counts
The magnitude of traffic volume, composition and their variation has a decisive effect on the
accident rate and quality of traffic flow on all categories of roads. The traffic counts comprise of
fast moving vehicles like cars, jeeps, taxis, LCV, MCV, HCV, 2-wheelers, 3-wheelers and slow-
moving vehicles like bicycles, cycle-rickshaws, etc. The available traffic data is to be analyzed
systematically to determine the temporal and vehicle-wise traffic flow characteristics and the
directional distribution of traffic on the selected stretches. Volume/capacity ratio for different
stretches should be determined based on classified volume counts and road inventory surveys
and analyzed with the available guidelines.
4.2.3
Speed surveys
Speed is one of the most important characteristics of traffic and its measurement is necessary
for quality evaluation of traffic problems. Speed study is a necessary input for regulation and
control of traffic and for analysing causes of accidents, identifying any relation between speed
and accidents. This will be conducted to observe the speed characteristics at selected points of
the stretch to determine the prevailing speeds on the stretch. For this, measurements can be
done in peak and off-peak hours also.
4.2.4
First information reports from police stations
First Information Reports (FIR) should be collected from the concerned police stations on the
identified stretches. After getting the FIR information, database is to be created for analysis of
day-wise, month-wise, year-wise, km-wise distribution of accidents. This would help in identifying
the locations experiencing higher accident frequency.

SALIENT FEATURES AND PRINCIPLES FOR
SAFE ROAD DESIGN
5.1
Principles of Road Safety
Road Safety Audit is a formal process;
it describes how road safety considerations are brought
into scheme design
at the proper time and how road safety
is weighed against other
considerations at the appropriate level of responsibility. The principles of road safety form the
basis of the technical content of the design and audit process.
It deals with the conditions, which
are of particular significance to road safety when designing road geometry and traffic control
devices. When designing a road, consider safety by asking:
•
Can the road design be misunderstood by road users?
•
Can design cause confusion?
34



======================================================================
PAGE 47 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2010
•
Can
it create ambiguity?
•
Does the
road design
give
insufficient
information
or too much
information?
•
Does
it provide inadequate visibility or cause obstructions to vision?
•
Are there stretches where compromise on design standards has been made.
If answer is 'yes', to any of these questions, then a series of open questions (such as 'how', 'why',
'when', 'where', 'what', etc.) should be used to find the source of the problem and find possible
solutions. Drivers and other road users must perceive and process information, make decisions
and react,
all within specific time intervals. Comfortable and safe dnving and good road user
behavior occur when vehicles are operating well below a stressful processing and
decision-making rate and above a minimum level of arousal. This is a critical component in the
development and maintenance of a safe road environment.
Road users represent a broad cross-section of the public and there are limits what road users
can cope with when converting information - from the layout of the road, signs, markings, etc. into
their response and action. Road users overestimate their own abilities and misunderstand each
other's intentions when the situation becomes too complex, unclear or unusual to think and to
react.
It
is a vital task expected of the designers and road safety auditors to design out road
installations keeping human criteria and behaviour in mind, so that they do not demand too many
actions per unit time.
A safe environment should:
•
Warn the driver of any substandard or unusual features.
•
Inform the driver of conditions to be encountered.
•
Guide the driver through unusual sections.
•
Control the driver's passage through conflict points or sections, and
•
Be forgiving of the driver's errant or inappropriate behaviour.
Similar situations must be treated in similar way;
it is better to avoid:
•
Insufficient or deficient treatment
•
Incorrect or misplaced treatment
•
Exaggerated treatment
•
Dissimilar treatment for similar situations
Road Safety Audit is the systematic application of safety principles. Specific aims are:
•
To minimize the risk of accident occurring on the road project and to minimize
the severity of accident that does occur.
35



======================================================================
PAGE 48 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2010
•
To minimize the risk of accidents occurring on adjacent roads in the network as
a result of a scheme.
•
To recognize the importance of safety in highway design to meet the needs
and perceptions of all types of road users and to achieve a balance between
needs where they may be in conflict.
•
To reduce the long-term costs of a road project, bearing in mind that unsafe
designs may be expensive or even impossible to correct at a later stage; and
•
To improve the awareness about safe design practices among those involved
in the planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance of roads.
There are two basic concepts underlying the aims of road safety audit. The concepts are:
•
Prevention is better thian Cure: While efforts to reduce the accidents on
existing roads through systematic accident investigation procedures must be
sustained, safety audit seeks to minimize the risk of accidents occurring as a
result of changes to the highway.
•
Drive, Ride, Walk in Safety: The emphasis on the mode of travel on the roads
should highlight the needs of the more vulnerable road users. In a safety audit,
the road scene should be visualised through the eyes of
all the different
categories of road users.
Some special safety issues relating to road designs are brought out below. These illustrate that
safety
is influenced by a complex interaction of elements and that the standards do not
necessarily result
in the safest possible design. This can especially be the case when the
standards are adopted keeping purposes other than safety also in view.
5.2
Special Safety Issues Related to Road Designs
5.2.1
Designing for the users
A design should cater for all road users. Special attention needs to be given to the safety aspects
associated with heavy vehicles like trucks and buses. The requiriments of these vehicles may be
different from those of cars. Particularly, effort may be needed to seek data to assist the design
in safely handling such traffic. Also, the special needs of pedestrians and non-motorised traffic
are to be considered (Fig. 5.1 and 5.2).
5.2.2
Design speed
The design speed adopted should be compatible with the project objectives and be appropriate
for the adjoining roadside activity and terrain.
If drivers are
in a hilly terrain, the road should
continue to make them aware of
it. At intersections, the design speed for turning traffic should be
compatible with expected intersection activity. Fig. 5.3 depicts how the speeds are to be kept
low at critical and difficult locations even on expressways as overspeeding results in accidents
(Fig. 5.4) and speed controls are essential for safety (Fig. 5.5).

5.2.3
Design context
The safe designs are different for major and minor roads. Narrow sections or slow points may be
suitable on minor roads to slow down traffic and improve safety. However, on major roads such
squeeze points may well cause frustration and become accident blackspots. The function of a
road should be clear to its users and treatments should not give conflicting messages about this.
Functional grouping of roads is a necessary pre-requisite for a safe road network (Fig. 5.6).

Fig. 5.6 Schematic Relationship between Access and Movement Functions of Roads
5.2.4
Horizontal and vertical curves
Accident frequency increases at crests and in dips. Increasing the degree of horizontal curvature
also tends to increase accident frequency. To achieve coordination of alignments and terrain
fitting,
it is possible that a crest may mask the flow of the horizontal curve. Avoid tight horizontal
curves particularly in combination with crests or dips (Fig. 5.7 to 5.9). In attempting to maintain
intermediate sight distance, a design may adopt a vertical curve, which avoids the marking of
barrier lines. However, adequate safe overtaking opportunities may actually be reduced because
of the excessive length of the vertical curve. A combination of shorter vertical curve and a stretch
with barrier line may be safer in some circumstances.
5.2.5
Intersections
•
Priority and layout
The layout and control arrangement at an intersection should be simple and
obvious to approaching motorists (Fig. 5.10).
It
is useful to remember that
straight priority is usually expected and that modifications to this can require
additional visual reinforcement. Even where priority is straight, some existing
fencing lines or lines of trees on the minor legs can suggest the continuation of
the road so strongly that the control sign and markings are not noticed by some
motorists. Roundabouts are a form of intersection control with their own set of
priority rules.
It is essential that roundabouts look like roundabouts and that
other types of intersection island treatments do not. At roundabouts, the approach
radius should be tighter than the exit radius. Also remember that motorists tend
to drive in lines as straight as possible: re-entrant curves on outer kerblines will
not be trafficked and will collect debris. Within intersections with simple priority,
it
is
still possible to guide motorists with proper arrangements and hazard
markers (Fig. 5.11).

Visibility
Provide adequate visibility distances for emerging traffic; don't confuse visibility
distances with warrants for stop signs. Avoid creating obstructions by street
furniture or landscaping. Provide adequate visibility to control features; for
instance on crests and curves line marking and other devices can be hidden
yet they need to be visible for decision-making. Use line marking & signs to
improve driver's safety (Fig. 5.12 to Fig. 5.14).

and Enhance Safety
Other issues at Intersections
Provide safe pedestrian and cyclist crossing points. Consider central refuges,
which permit people to cross traffic from one direction at a time, which
is a
much easier task than judging gaps in both directions at once and safer than
waiting on a centerline (Fig. 5.15 and 5.16). Use appropriate corner radii.
Large radii allow excessive speeds and cause hazards for pedestrians. On
the other hand, radii, which are tighter than the turning path of a design vehicle
at a low speed, will result in these vehicles swinging out wide or hitting kerbs.
Balanced approach is required.

Access control
At each point on the road system where vehicles have access to adjacent land, there
is the
potential for conflict and accidents. Where service roads have been provided to separate through
traffic from
local
traffic movements, the spacing of breaks should not be reduced.
Further,
there should be sufficient warning ahead of such breaks. The same
is true for median
openings. Motorists need time to react at conflict points, particularly where traffic flows are
heavy (Fig. 5.1 7 and 5.1 8).

Cross-section
•
Narrow lanes
There is a view that traffic management has often gone too far in reducing the
lane-width (from standard 3.5 m lane) of urban roads to create additional lanes
on multi-lane roads. This becomes hazardous on horizontal curves where larger
vehicles need extra width to tract. The existing urban design standards do not
provide for curve transitions and widening. These may be satisfactory when
wide lanes - proper lane width are used but they are unsatisfactory when narrow
lanes are adopted (Fig. 5.19).

•
Shoulder widths
There is a safety benefit in providing reasonably wide shoulders throughout the
length of the road.
It
is best not to reduce widths or eliminate shoulders
(Fig. 5.20). Fencing can be very effective in discouraging parking. But fencing
should not itself create a hazard.
The shoulders should be adequate and well-maintained for enhancing road
safety (Fig. 5.21). Rumble Strips can be provided on shoulders on sharp curves
to alert drivers who have strayed from carriageway (Fig. 5.22).

•
Median widths
In rural areas, medians less than 3 m wide should be avoided. Where turning or
crossing vehicles do not require a greater width, there is little safety advantages
on median more than 10 m wide.
In urban areas minimum of 2 m width
is
necessary (Fig. 5.23). The minimum width of median, subject to availability of
right of way, for various locations shall be as given in Table 5.1

Trees
Survey information is often deficient on the location and size of trees within the road reserve. The
designer, therefore, cannot be sure that the plans have provided protection against vehicles hitting
roadside trees. Trees also grow so that what is not a substantial tree at the design stage may well
become a roadside obstacle by the time the road is built and is in operation (Fig. 5.24 and 2.25).

5.2.9
Road signs
It is often too tempting to use traffic signs instead of working out an appropriate design of road
signs on the project highway in an attempt to solve a real or perceived problem. Before using a
traffic sign:
•
Demonstrate a need for the sign
Use a sound traffic engineering assessment to determine the need. Check the
warrants and appropriate uses in the standards or guidelines.
If no standard
signs exist, ask why. Is one needed for this situation?
•
Ensure that the sign conveys a clear message to all users under all conditions
The ability to choose an effective and appropriate message and design an
effective sign is important. Signs given in IRC standards have been prescribed
keeping this in view and should be chosen for standard situations. Othen/vise
seek expert advice. Ensure that sign messages are compatible with the
messages of other devices like line markings. Keep
it simple. Locate
it where
the information can be received (Fig. 5.26 to 5.30).

Keep sign support structures away from the edge of the carriageway. Avoid or

v
Ensure that signs or their supports do not obstruct visibility of other devices or
the view between conflicting road users.
5.2.10
Merges
Adequate sight distance
is required
in advance of any merging situation to allow drivers to
recognize and plan their merge. Inadequately or improperly designed merging areas can be a
cause of road accidents (Fig. 5.31 and 5.32). The length of acceleration and deceleration lanes
should not be insufficient, otherwise,
it may lead to road accidents. In addition
it is important to
provide a length of mutual sight to allow the gap to be selected for the merging manoeuvre.
Merging should be avoided just prior to the start of left hand curves. They force the vehicles on the
left hand lane to veer to the right to merge and then be immediately faced with a movement to the
left to negotiate the curve.

Sight distance
The effect of horizontal and vertical curves and the cross-section is generally closely examined
during road design. However, trees, raised medians and concrete barriers can also affect sight
distance. Further, sight distance to the end of a queue, rather than to the control point at the start
of the queue, may need to be considered on approaches to busy intersections.
5.2.12
Niglit visibility
Perception of widths as well as distances is usually more difficult at nighttime or under poor light
conditions. Where minimum width lanes are used or there are island to narrow the road, a high
standard of street lighting and delineation should be used (Fig. 5.33). In the tunnels, adequate
lighting should be provided (Fig. 5.34).

5.2.13
Parked vehicles
Vehicles parked on the carriageway affect safety in several ways: as physical obstructions that
are run into or sideswiped, obstructions which cause sudden braking and nose-to-tail accidents,
obstructions which deflect vehicles into adjacent vehicle paths, hazards to passing vehicles from
opening doors, obstructions which hide pedestrians and obstructions which block visibility at
intersections and access points. For parked vehicles, designs should ideally avoid or remove/
relocate parking in traffic lanes. With isolated improvement schemes like intersection treatments,
parking can influence well beyond the limits of the design plan. Parking on side streets close to
busy arterial roads can be a hazard to turning vehicles. Check the interaction of parked vehicles,
turning vehicles and any queued emerging vehicles in these locations (Fig. 5.35). Do not rely on
parking control signs to eliminate parking in hazardous locations: enforcement will not always be
available.

SPECIFIC PARAMETERS TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE PRESENT
DAY TRAFFIC SCENARIO IN INDIA
Two of the most significant issues to be considered in tine present day traffic scenario in India are:
a)
Safety issues for non-motorized traffic and
b)
Safety issues on higli speed corridors
6.1
Safety Issues for Non-Motorized Traffic
6.1.1
Pedestrian walking facilities
As pedestrians form a significant group of vulnerable road users,
it is vital that the footpaths of
pedestrians one given full and detailed attention. Footpaths have great potential for enhancing
pedestrian safety. Every effort should therefore be made to segregate pedestrians and vehicles.
Separation makes travel much safer for vulnerable road users. In areas of high pedestrian activity,
it would be desirable to provide greater road space to pedestrian activity. Care must be taken to
ensure that footpaths are not encroached upon and that the surfaces are comfortable to walk on.
On some stretches, passing through habitations and settlements,
1 .5 m footways are provided,
which is the absolute minimum width recommended for any footway. At times, the footways are
only 1 .0 m wide while at other places there is none; in most cases any constructed footway is the
cover of a channel drain that is adjacent to the building line. Footways in urban areas become
blocked
in a matter of days by commercial use, rubbish or other impediments to walking
(Fig. 6.1 ). Where footways are not provided on highways, shoulders are used by the pedestrians
for walking. These shoulders become un-walkable due to water logging (Fig. 6.2).
Fig. 6.1
Inadequate and Faulty Pedestrian Facilities

======================================================================
PAGE 66 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2010
Fig. 6.2 Water Logging at Shoulders
Substantial conflict problems usually exist where the road passes through rural settlements as
the road often passes very close to existing buildings leaving no footpaths for pedestrians. Also,
in India, roads in open area are often used by the local population as footpaths; particularly in
the rainy season as these usually provide the easiest and most convenient routes between
communities. Also many intersection roads have a cross-sectional profile which makes
it difficult
to cater easily for pedestrians. The natural camber of the carriageway is carried over into the
shoulder and this is followed by a steeper slope into the side drain. The side drains too are often
deep U-type channels, which, particularly in mountainous terrain where the road is in a cutting,
force pedestrians to walk on the roadway and expose them to increased risk.
6.1.2
Pedestrian crossings
There is a strong necessity and desire for pedestrians to cross the road all along
it and suitable
provision must be designed to allow for
it at appropriate locations. There is clearly a case for
increasing both the capacity and safety of the new upgraded road sections. When located and
used correctly, these can be effective in reducing pedestrian-vehicle traffic conflicts. Pedestrians
usually tend to take the shortest routes between any two points.
If using a crossing imposes much
additional walking distance, or no perceived risk reduction (Fig. 6.3) then there will be a marked
reluctance to use
it. Great care is needed, therefore, in siting pedestrian crossings so that use is
maximized and pedestrians are clearly visible to drivers.
Crossings based on priority rules rather than signals demand a degree of driver compliance that
is
rarely found
in
cities and towns of
India. While there
is considerable improvement
in
enforcement for the past few years, driving culture and self discipline needs lot of improvement.
Pedestrian crossings on high-speed roads can lead to rear-end collisions
if drivers are not given
sufficient advance warning. Where driver compliance
is low and vehicle speeds are high,
pedestrian crossings can be amalgamated with road humps to give a raised pedestrian
crossing (80-100 mm high). These are very cost-effective but must be clearly marked and
require adequate advance warning.

IRC:SP:88"2010
Fig. 6.3 Poor Quality Design of Subway at Access Controlled Highway
It has also been observed that pedestrians often avoid using pedestrian bridges and
underpasses due to substantial differences
in elevation, perceived lack of public safety
in
underpasses, lack of maintenance and encroachments. Also, where pedestrian barriers have
been erected especially
in front of the school gates,
recreation grounds and footpaths,
pedestrians cross at any point along a length of road rather than be channelled to specially
provided crossings where the risk of accident is lower. Also pedestrian refuges which divide the
two traffic streams and create a relatively safe waiting area for pedestrians are often observed to
be narrow in width, too high to climb, unmarked and not provided with lighting thus becoming an
additional hazard.
There is need for special features to be constructed where pedestrians have to cross an open
drain or mount an embankment.
It is observed that required pedestrian crossing facilities are not
being provided and in the absence of these, the local population devise their own unauthorized
ways to facilitate crossing the highways. This type of activity is more hazardous at many of the
road sections passing through the inhabited areas proposed on high embankments. Therefore,
it
is essential that for all highway upgradation projects, careful thought
is given as to where
pedestrians may be allowed to cross and where they should be prohibited from crossing and
provision must be made to achieve the same.
6.1.3
Lay-byes/bus bays
Lay-byes and Bus stops are an essential element
in providing for access as they separate
stopping traffic from the main carriageway. However, their location
is critical and every effort
should be made to avoid physical or visual obstruction. They should not be located on the outside
of curves, or very close to junctions and pedestrian crossings so that buses do not obstruct
crossing pedestrians.
It is observed that mostly the bus bay dimensions are fixed, not allowing
any flexibility for busy stops. The location of the bus bays shall be fixed on the basis of following
principles:
a)
The bus stops shall be sited away from bridges and other important structures
and embankment sections more than 3 m high.
55



======================================================================
PAGE 68 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2010
b)
As far as possible, bus bays shall not be located on horizontal curves or at the
summit of vertical curves.
c)
The location shall have good visibility, not less than the safe stopping sight
distance.
d)
The bus bays shall not be located too close to the road intersections. A gap of
300 m from the tangent point of intersections to start/end of the bus bay shall
be desirable. At minor intersections (e.g. junctions with village roads), distance
of 60 m may be adopted. However,
if a substantial volume of buses is to turn
right at the intersection,
it
is necessary that the bus bay shall be located
sufficiently ahead of the intersection so that the buses can be manoeuvered
easily from the pick-up stop on the left hand side to the extreme right lane for
turning. The location of the bus bays may be fixed after due consultation with
the local communities expected to use such facilities.
e)
At major four-way intersections involving transfer of a substantial number of
passengers from one pick-up stop to the other,
it might be desirable to
construct a single, composite bus stop of suitable design to cater to all the bus
routes collectively.
f)
In hilly areas, the bus bays shall be located, preferably, where the road is straight
on both sides, gradients are flat and the visibility is reasonably good (usually
not less than 50 m). Subject to these requirements,
it will be advisable to choose
locations where
it
is possible to widen the roadway economically for
accommodating bus bays.
g)
Where grade separator is provided, the location of bus bays shall be as under:
i)
Sufficiently away from the ground intersection.
ii)
Sufficiently away from the longitudinal slope of the approaches.
h)
The bus bay and passenger shelter shall be designed to provide for safe and
convenient use by persons with disabilities as well.
There is a need to design a facility to meet the needs of the waiting passengers and the number
of buses (Fig. 6.4).
Also bus bays are most effective in terms of collecting the waiting passengers in a safe location
if they provide protection from the sun and rain.
If there is no natural protection from a tree, then
it
needs to be provided.
If the passengers wait in the shade off the road then the bus is likely to stop
in middle of the road or at some other unsafe
location. Many road agencies are now
planning such bus bays on their road upgrading projects. This is a good development.
It needs to
become a standard practice on all main highways.
It is important that this aspect is given due
recognition and importance by all road agencies.

6.1.4
Bicyclists, ricl<sfiaws and animal drawn carts
The mixed traffic conditions and the wide variety of road users on highways create a safety
challenge of significant magnitude. These non-motorized road users are an important part of the
traffic stream (Fig. 6.5). They deserve special consideration for their safety due to their different
characteristics of movement, poor conspicuity and vulnerability in the event of an accident. On
the highways, as they are exposed to motor vehicles travelling at much higher speed,
it
is
imperative that they are provided with as much lateral separation from the through motor vehicles
as possible. This should preferably be through the provision of separate tracks on which these
non-motorized slow vehicles, can travel in relative safety. An alternative to this is a minimum
2.5 m wide shoulder fully paved along the highways (excepting where service roads exist) so that
these road users move on a smooth surface with some separation from the faster vehicles. An
associated requirement is roadway lighting at locations that can enhance nighttime conspicuity
of these non-motorised road users.

6.2
Safety issues on High Speed Corridors
In India, highways pass through rural areas with high-density populations where most people do
not have access to motorised vehicles. These four-lane divided highways in India do not have
continuous parallel service roads for local traffic including non-motorised traffic. This forces the
local traffic to use these highways and cross them under hazardous conditions. So
it
is not
surprising to find that a majority of the victims in road traffic crashes on intercity highways are
vulnerable road users. On the existing upgraded highways, service roads provided are sometimes
invisible due to encroachments.
In the absence of adequate truck parking facilities on these
highways, truckers have a tendency to park their vehicles on service roads, thus negating the
benefits of service roads to these vulnerable road users (Fig. 6.6). In the absence of such service
-
roads, the pedestrian-vehicular conflicts increase and road safety is threatened.
Fig. 6.6 Parking of Vehicles at Service Roads
In India, the newly upgraded highways will lead to significantly increased speeds due to the new
smooth surface and increased width. While
it is expected that the road will produce many safety
benefits, there
is likelihood of increases
in both accident frequency and severity at certain
locations, particularly in urban areas, rural settlements and near schools, markets and factories
unless location specific measures are taken to ensure that the speeds are restrained to an
appropriate level (Fig. 6.7).
It is recommended that an appropriate speed management strategy
for upgraded highways should be developed as soon as possible and before they are open for
traffic. Such a speed management strategy should recognise the need for realistic speed limits
and for a differential in speeds between urban and rural areas. The changes in speed zones will
need to be well signed with duplicate speed signs at the commencement of a new zone and
repeater signs at agreed distances thereafter and physical measures on the carriageway.
Traffic calming measures are usually most effective
if several
different kinds are used
in
combination and in a co-ordinated manner to slow down traffic in stages. They should be used
with care on any highway but will be particulariy relevant where there is a cross-section change
from say six lane to four lane dual carriageway or from rural to urban conditions. Traffic calming
may also be needed on some important side and access roads at their approaches to the
highway and at the start of the service roads.

!RC:SP:88-2010
Fig. 6.7 Accident at Access-Controlled Highway
Uncontrolled access to premises abutting a main road can substantially impede traffic flows and
create severe road safety hazards as vehicles attempt to leave, merge with or cross traffic streams.
A difference in levels makes
it very difficult for non-motorised or other slow moving vehicle to
enter the main road safely as
it becomes very difficult to stop and re-start. Unless part of the side
road or access is constructed to similar standards to the main road,
it will quickly deteriorate,
start damaging the main road and lead to loose materials being deposited on the edge of the
main road. This can happen at all kinds of entrances or exits to petrol stations, parking areas,
factories or local communities. For these reasons, attempts should be made to limit or control
frontage access on primary and district distributors except for situations where this is not feasible.
On high speed and main roads, efforts should be made to keep cyclists off the main carriageway
by providing them with separate continuous cycle tracks (Fig. 6.8). Cycle tracks must be
attractive to use, coherent and direct. They should be well-maintained and should be minimum
2.5 m wide. The slow-moving road users need segregation whenever possible from fast traffic
vehicles. Where animal drawn vehicles are common, provision of wider shoulders can act as a
track for slow vehicles. The provision
of wider shoulders also benefits the cyclists and
pedestrians. These shoulders could be delineated with devices like, cat's eyes, studs, rumble
strips (300 mm in width) between the main carriageway and the shoulder. A provision of frequent
and convenient under-passes (at the same level as surrounding land with highway raised to
provide clearance) for pedestrians, bicycles and NMT.
The vehicular under/overpass structures should be provided at the intersection of the high traffic
density roads with all the National Highways and State Highways. The structure may be either an
underpass or an overpass depending upon the nature of terrain,
vertical
profile of road,
availability of adequate right of way, etc. Following aspects may be kept in view
:
i)
The width of pedestrian or cattle crossing shall not be less than 5 m.
ii)
The pedestrian crossings shall have provision for movement of persons with
disabilities.

iii)
Underpasses shall be preferred to overpasses.
iv)
Pedestrian underpass/overpass shall also be provided within a distance of
200 m from a school or hospital or factory/industrial area.
Whenever feasible, non-motorised vehicles should be separated from the carriageway by a
barrier or edge line marking. Barriers are not appropriate on National Highways and State
Highways in rural areas where separation by road marking is appropriate.
7 SAFETY AUDIT PROCESS FOR RURAL ROADS (OTHER DISTRICT
ROADS AND VILLAGE ROADS) WITH SPECIAL
REFERENCE TO PMGSY ROADS
7.1
Context
Rural roads are generally single lane with low design speeds and low volumes of traffic both
motorised and non-motorised. There has been a distinct improvement in the riding quality of
rural roads being constructed under the PMGSY and other state government programmes. Further,
due to economic uplift of rural areas, ownership of motorised vehicles is also increasing at an
accelerated pace. These factors are resulting in higher average speeds on the rural road network.
Because of constraints of land availability, some stretches of the rural roads may not be in
accordance with the required geometric standards. These may then be prone to safety hazards
unless the driver is alert. At the same time, some engineering measures can be identified for
such stretches while planning and designing such alignments.
60



======================================================================
PAGE 73 of 108
======================================================================
!RC:SP:88-2010
7.2
Safety Aspects in Rural Roads
The road agencies concerned with rural roads may consider the following aspects for improving
safety on these roads:
a)
Road signs and pavement markings should be
integral
part
of road
construction and upgradation works. These signs and markings
will also
require regular maintenance to serve the intended purpose. There should be
no compromise whatsoever on this requirement being ensured in all rural roads
projects and programmes.
b)
Where the existing geometries of the road alignment are poor, efforts should
be made to undertake spot improvements identifying such spots.
In the
meanwhile, appropriate cautionary and speed limit signs should be posted in
such
locations. Where there
is history of frequent accidents, physical
measures such as speed breakers (hump type), rumble strips should be
provided with proper advance warning signs.
c)
Intersections and junctions of
rural roads with main roads need special
emphasis. The layout design calls for special attention
in consultation with
traffic specialists. Provision of rumble strips on rural roads just ahead of their
meeting point with the main highway would be of help.
d)
Provision of bus bays at suitable location close to villages en-route and ramps
for providing access to agricultural fields may also be considered. At the end of
the road, adequate space needs to be ensured so as to enable turning of buses
and other commercial vehicles.
e)
Some states set-up
district level road safety committees because of an
all-round emphasis on improving safety on the road network in the state. The
Head of the PIU of PMGSY roads could be inducted either as a full-fledged
member or special invitee to such committees.
7.3
Safety Audit
7.3.1
Projects to be audited
Responsibility for the planning, design, construction and maintenance of rural roads would basically
remain with the concerned road agencies and the implementing teams. In case of rural roads,
safety audit may be considered initially in respect of PMGSY projects. After gaining experience
from the safety audits of these projects, the states may consider upscaling the same to other
rural roads for both new construction and improvement/upgradation of existing roads.
7.3.2
Audit team
The safety audit team should comprise two members. One member should have adequate traffic
61



======================================================================
PAGE 74 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2010
engineering and
traffic management experience and the other should be an engineer with
experience in road design and construction techniques.
7.3.3
Stages of safety audit
a)
For PMGSY roads, the safety audit may be confined to the following stages:
1)
Completion of design and estimate preparation stage
2)
Completion of construction, pre-opening stage
3)
On completed projects
b)
Stage 3 audit described
in para 3.3 may be applied for the completion of
design and estimate preparation stage. The findings and recommendations of
the Audit Team at this stage should be discussed with the PIU, STA and the
SRRDA Headquarters. Final decision for amendments
in design and BOQ
based on the recommendations of the Audit Team should rest with the SRRDA.
The SRRDA may keep NRRDA informed of such decisions.
c)
Stage 5 audit described in para 3.5 may be applied for the pre-opening stage
on completion of construction.
It would be sufficient to involve only the local site
staff. The Team should travel in a car, on two wheeler and also in a non-motorised
transport on the road stretch in question. Travel should be undertaken both
during the day and dark hours. The Team should check the presence and
effectiveness of road signs, pavement markings, speed management
measures (speed humps, rumble strips), intersection layout, etc. Findings of
the Audit Team at this stage and measurers recommended by
it should be
discussed with the PIU, STA and the SRRDA Headquarters. Final decision on
measures recommended should rest with the SRRDA. The SRRDA may keep
NRRDA informed of such decisions.
d)
Stage 6 audit described in para 3.6 may be applied for the completed projects.
Such audits amy be taken selectively on roads where there are reports of
accidents taking place. The Audit Team would be expected to determine
if the
safety needs of all types of road users including pedestrians, cyclists, animals
and animal drawn carts are being met. Findings of the Audit Team and
measurers recommended by
it should be discussed with the SRRDA
Headquarters. Final decision on measures recommended should rest with the
SRRDA. The SRRDA may keep NRRDA informed of such decisions.
7.3.4
Audit process
The steps in the rural road safety audit process would essentially be as indicated in Chapter 4.
For PMGSY roads, the designer may be either in-house staff of PIU or outsourced consultant.
Interaction of the Audit Team with the State Technical Agencies is also required since the latter
are mandated to oversee the design and project estimates.

, 1 7, 1 8 and 20 to 32 may not be
necessary. Similarly,
in check
list 5, item no.
11, 12, 13, 14 may not be necessary. Also the
auditors may add other checklist considered relevant for rural roads.
8 CHECKLISTS
8.1
General
Checklists are useful to assist the audit team. These checklists describe the performance and
situations that can affect the road safety of selected types of project and audit stage. Checklists
have been prepared for Stage
1
to Stage 6. These checklists will cover planning, alignment,
cross-section, junctions, link road, traffic signs, road markings, road lighting, roadside hazards,
road side furniture, vulnerable road users, cross-drainage structures etc. These checklists should
be used as a guide to focus audit towards important matters that should be covered and not
overlooked. Each project is different and will raise specific issues that may contain further safety
implications. When reviewing each of the points, the team should consider that the road user
would have to cope with conditions at night and in adverse weather conditions also.
The safety audit team should visit the site for identifying the deficiencies from safety angle of the
stretch and should suggest remedial measures. The team should check planning,
cross-sections, alignment, roadside furniture and
facilities available, junctions,
facilities for
vulnerable road users, signs, marking and lighting and also road side hazards as suggested in
the previous paragraph. Some sort of questionnaire should be prepared for each kilometre. The
questionnaire should include various aspects covered under the methodology of the safety
audit.
8.2
Purpose of Checklists
Road Safety Audit checklists are presented in Annex A. These checklists have been designed
as a prompt. They are not a subvStitute for knowledge of local conditions and experience: they are
an aid for the application of that knowledge and experience. The checklists are to help an auditor
not to overlook something important.
It is stressed that a road safety audit is not an audit of the
design standards, though these will need to be referred to, and their proper use makes a good
63



======================================================================
PAGE 76 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:88-2010
starting point with any design. The written audit report should contain sufficient explanation of its
recommendations, without any need to refer to notes on checklists. Designers can make use of
the checklists to help them identify potential safety problems and cover the solutions in their
designs.
8.3
When to use Checklists
The checklists are for use during an audit when
•
Assessing the documentation;
in particular, when the project drawings are
being examined
•
inspecting the site. At this point,
it is important to visualise how the project will
fit into the existing features
•
Writing the audit report
- to re-check that the relevant issues have been
addressed
These checklists can be used on existing roads, new roads, roadwork traffic schemes,
rehabilitation works, etc.
8.4
How to use Checklists
Determine which set of checklists is needed.
It should be remembered that an audit may cover
more than one stage in the design process. More details can be entered on checklists, on plans.
A successful audit is not achieved by simply ticking off checklists. The topics listed in Annex A
cover the more common elements of design and practice. While the list is sufficiently exhaustive,
the audit team should use their own skills, experience and judgement in refining and amplifying
these checklists.
9 ELEMENTS OF A GOOD RSA AND MEASURE OF ITS SUCCESS
As to what makes a good safety audit report will depend on the audit team and its due diligence
in assessing the designs and drawings and a detailed inspection of the project. A good safety
audit report will restrict itself to road safety issues, explain each of the safety issues in some
depth and provide practical and implementable recommendations. A good report would also not
indulge in blame game.
The success of a safety audit shall not be measured by cost-benefit approach, but by the depth of
analysis
of the design features,
identification of issues of safety concerns and the
recommendations that are accepted by client.
In the initial stages, good number of recommendations may be found to be acceptable by the
client. However, with more and more awareness raising among designers safety features would
get in-built into the design of the project and
it may not be surprising to find that the number of
recommendations from the audit team get reduced. The objective of carrying out RSA would
have then served its intended purpose.

10 HOW TO GET ROAD SAFETY AUDIT STARTED IN
THE ROAD ORGANISATION?
In order to ensure safety conscious planning, design, construction and maintenance and operation
of roads and highways,
it
is paramount that the agencies and organisations responsible for
development of roads and implementation of projects are committed to road safety. As the
experience from those countries which have undertaken Road Safety Audits of their roads and
road projects reveal, positive benefits towards enhancement of road safety, the top management
cadre of these agencies should include
it as an essential ingredient of the project cycle.
The various steps and actions for initiating road safety audit
in engineering organisations
(engineering departments at National. State or Local levels) including engineering consultants,
etc. are outlined in Fig. 1 0.1
.
It is not uncommon to find that the term 'audit' may generate negative
feelings because
it may seem to indicate that the aim
is to catch someone making an error.
Therefore, an important component of the process of introduction of road safety audit should be
to create the desire and resolve of all parties concerned to be committed to
it as part of overall
road safety efforts without blame game. Awareness raising among engineers of the road
agencies and other stakeholders at various levels would be an advantage.
The road organisations usually set apart some funds for engineering measures for road safety in
their budget. To start with, part of these funds could be utilised in initiating the process of RSA
and training in RSA for some of their projects.
