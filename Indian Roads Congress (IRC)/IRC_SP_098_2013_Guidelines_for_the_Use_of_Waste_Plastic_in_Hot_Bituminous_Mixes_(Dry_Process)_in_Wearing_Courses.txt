GUIDELINES FOR THE USE OF WASTE PLASTIC IN HOT BITUMINOUS
MIXES (DRY PROCESS) IN WEARING COURSES
1 INTRODUCTION
1.1
The H-2 Committee
in
its meeting held on
15*^ June, 2012 decided to formulate
guidelines for waste plastic Bitumen and entrusted this task to Dr. Sunil Bose. Accordingly,
Dr. Sunil Bose prepared the
initial draft and submitted to H-2 Committee
in March, 2013.
Thereafter,
H-2 Committee
deliberated on
this
draft
in
a
series
of meetings. The
H-2
Committee
finally, approved the
draft document
in
its meeting
held on
17**" June 2013.
The Highways Specifications & Standards Committee (HSS) approved the draft document
in
its meeting held on ^9^^ July, 2013. The Council in
its 200*'' meeting held at New Delhi on
11*^ and 12'^ August, 2013 approved the draft "Guidelines for the Use of Waste Plastic in Hot

1.2
Safe disposal of waste plastic
is a serious environmental problem. Being a non-
biodegradable material
it does not decay over time and even
if dumped
in
landfills, finds
its way back
in the environment through
air and water erosion, can choke the drains and
drainage channels, can be eaten by unsuspecting grazing animals causing them illness and
death, can contaminate the construction
fill, etc. The best way of disposal of waste plastic
is
its recycling to the maximum extent and many developed countries have recycled waste
plastics to manufacture various products, including some used
in heavy construction, e.g.
railway sleepers.
1.3
Studies
have
revealed
that waste
plastics
have
great
potential
for
use
in
bituminous construction as
its addition
in small doses, about 5-10%, by weight of bitumen
helps in substantially improving the Marshall stability, strength, fatigue life and other desirable
properties of bituminous mix, leading to improved longevity and pavement performance. The
use of waste plastic thus contributes to construction of green roads.
1 .4
Depending on their physical properties, they may be classified as thermoplastic and
thermosetting materials. Thermoplastic materials can be formed into desired shapes under
heat and pressure and become solids on cooling. On subjected to the same conditions of heat
and pressure, they can be remolded. Thermosetting materials which once shaped cannot be
softened/remolded by the application of heat. The examples of some typical Thermoplastic
and Thermosetting materials are tabulated in Table 1. Thermosetting materials are not used
in pavement construction.

Plastics can also be classified according to their chemical sources. According to
sources of plastic, there are six general groups: Cellulose Plastics, Synthetic Resin Plastics,
Protein Plastics, Natural Resins, Elastomers and Fibers. Table 2 gives the source of waste

There are two processes namely dry process and wet process for manufacturing
bituminous mixes using waste plastic.
In the dry process, processed waste plastic is added
after shredding in hot aggregates where as in the wet process, processed waste plastic in the
form of powder is added in the hot bitumen.
2 SCOPE
These guidelines deal with the specifications and use of waste plastic
in wearing course
using dry process, their advantages, application, manufacturing, transportation, storages,
and quality testing requirements.
3 ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATION OF USING WASTE PLASTIC
AS MODIFIER AND BINDER
Laboratory
as
well
as
field
performance
studies/investigations
carried
out
in
India
(Appendix-1) identifies following advantages in using waste plastic in bituminous mixes.
•
Higher resistance to deformation.
•
Higher resistance to water induced damages.
•
Increased durability and improved fatigue
life.
•
Improved stability and strength.
•
Disposal of waste plastic and thereby environment friendly.

IRC:SP:98-2013
However
following
need
to
be
ensured
in
order
to
achieve
the advantages
of these
specifications;
•
The material shall consist of only low density polyethylene (LDPE) or high
density polyethylene (HOPE), PU (available in limited quantity as waste) and
PET.
•
Black coloured plastic waste is a result of repeated recycling and should not
be used.
V
•
PVC shall not be used since they release lethal levels of dioxines.
•
The Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) of thermoplastics has revealed gas
evolution and thermal degradation may occur beyond 180°C. Thus misuse
or wrong implementation of this technology may result in release of harmful
gases, premature degradation,
if the temperatures are not maintained during
construction.
4 MATERIALS
4.1
Bitumen
The bitumen for bituminous mixes for wearing course with waste plastic shall comply with
the Indian Standard Specifications for viscosity graded paving bitumen
IS 73. Guidelines
for selection for grade of viscosity graded paving bitumen shall be
in accordance with the
IRC:111-2009.
.
4.2
Aggregates
The aggregates shall comply to IRC:111-2009, for dense graded mixes and IRC:14-2004,
IRC:SP:78-2008 and IRC:11 0-2005 for open graded mixes respectively.
4.3
Filler
The filler for dense graded mixes shall comply with IRC:111-2009.
4.4
Waste Plastic
•
The waste
plastic
shall conform
to the size passing 2.36 mm sieve and
retained on 600 micron sieve.
•
Dust and other impurities shall not be more than
1
percent. The process
is indicated
in Appendix-2. An easy method to determine the quantity of
impurity is to determine the ash content at 600°C.
•
To ascertain the ability of plastic to mix with the binder, the melt-flow value
shall be tested as per ASTM D 1238-2010, for which the range shall be as
follows:
.
,.,
For LDPE: 0.14-58 gm/10 min
For HDPE: 0.02-9.0 gm/10 min

Waste Plastic @ 6 to 8 percent of the weight of the bitumen can be used for Open-Grade Premix
Surfacing and Mix Seal surfacing mix. Quantity of bitumen can be reduced correspondingly.
6 MANUFACTURING OF BITUMINOUS MIX USING WASTE PLASTIC
The scope
of the present guidelines
is
restricted
to dry process
only
for the following
reasons;
Plastic is coated over stones
- improving surface property of aggregates.
Coating
is easy & temperature required
is same as road laying temp.
Use waste should be 6-8 percent by weight of bitumen depending on the
climatic conditions of high and low rainfall areas.
Flexible films of all types of plastics can be used.
Doubles the binding property of aggregates.
No new equipment is required.

•
Bitumen bonding is stronger than normal.
•
The coated aggregates show increased Stability of the mixes.
•
Better performance after construction based on the experience gained for
medium level city traffic.
'
•
No evolution of any toxic gases as maximum temperature is 180°C.
6.1
Dry Process
In order to ensure that the quality of the finished waste
plastic product
is consistent the
following process (Appendix-1) must be adhered to before considering its use in bituminous
construction:

•
In Tamil Nadu, length of roads around 1000 m
in various stretches were
constructed using waste plastic as an additive
in bituminous mix under the
scheme "1000 km Plastic Road", and found that, the performance of all the
road stretches are satisfactory.
^
•
The performance of the road stretches constructed using waste plastic
in
Bangalore (Karnataka) are also found to be satisfactory. More than 2000 km
have been laid so far.
•
In Delhi a number of test sections about 50 km were laid and most of them
are performing well.

Processing details:-
i)
collection of waste plastic
II)
cleaning and shredding of waste plastic
III)
mixing of shredded waste plastic, aggregate and bitumen in central mixing plant
iv)
laying of bituminous mix
a)
Collection of waste plastic:
Waste plastic is collected from roads, garbage trucks, dumpsites or compost
plants,
or from school
collection programmes,
or by purchase from
rag-
pickers or waste-buyers

b)
Cleaning and shredding of waste plastic:
Waste plastic
litter
in the form of thin-film carry-bags, use-and-throw cups,
PET bottles, etc. these are sorted, de-dusted, washed
if necessary.

c)
Shredding machine
Plastic waste which
is cleaned
is cut
into a size between 2.36 mm and
600 microns and of maximum size 2.36 mm length and 2.00 mm width using
a shredding machine.

d)
IVIixing of shredded waste plastic, aggregate and Bitumen
in Central
mixing Plant:
The aggregate mix
is heated
to 140-175°C
in Central mixing
plant. The
requisite percentage of waste plastic to the weight of bitumen is injected with
a pipe under compressed air in the drum of a drum mix plant through a pipe
at 2/3 length of the drum or through an opening over the pugmill in the case
of a batch mix plant. The waste plastic initially coats the heated aggregates.
In the next stage bitumen is added to the aggregates, the temperature of the
binder shall conform to the temperature depending on the grade of binder
and the type of mix. The plastics waste coated aggregate is mixed with hot
bitumen for 15 sees and the resulting mix transported for road construction.
Central mixing plant helps to have better control of temperature and better
mixing of this material thus helping to have a uniform coating and heated
bitumen is also sprayed.
