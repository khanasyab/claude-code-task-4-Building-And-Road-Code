Cement Stabilized Subgrade, Sub-base and Base Courses
1.0 
Introduction
Substantial length of the existing low volume rural roads in India is unpaved. Heavy rainfall and 
floods affect almost all these roads frequently. The unpaved roads are severely damaged due to 
flood, currents and wave action. This situation needs maintenance of these roads every year/
frequently. These adverse effects together with possibly inadequate compaction significantly 
impair the durability of these roads. The ultimate effect is comparatively low subgrade strength 
and eventually higher pavement thickness if paved roads are to be constructed. On the basis of this 
context, some treatment of locally available materials has become necessary for satisfactory and 
economic construction of roads in these regions. Cement stabilized bases or lime stabilized sub-
bases may be provided for the construction of rural roads for low volume/ light traffic. An increasing 
emphasis has been placed on the use of stabilized pavement materials in recent years. Through the 
use of stabilizing agents, low-quality materials can be economically upgraded to the extent that these 
may be effectively utilized in the pavement structure. Stabilized pavement materials are generally 
incorporated into the pavement structure as base courses and sub-bases. 
1.1	
What is Soil-Cement?
Soil-cement is a highly compacted mixture of soil/aggregate, cement and water. It is widely used 
as a low-cost pavement base for roads, residential streets, parking areas, airports, shoulders, and 
materials-handling and storage areas. Its advantages of great strength and durability combine with 
low first cost to make it the outstanding value in its field. A thin bituminous surface is usually placed 
on the soil-cement to complete the pavement.
Soil-cement is sometimes called cement-stabilized base, or cement-treated aggregate base. 
Regardless of the name, the principles governing its composition and construction are the same.
1.2 
Cement Stabilisation
The hydrated products of cement bind the soil particles, the strength developed depending on the 
concentration of cement and the intimacy with which the soil particles are mixed with cement. A 
high cement content of the order of 7-10% can produce a hard mass having a 7-day compressive 
strength of 20 kg/cm2 or more, and this usually goes by the term soil-cement. However, a smaller 
proportion of 2-3% cement can improve the CBR value to more than 25, and the material goes by the 
term "cement-modified soil", which can be advantageously used as sub -base/base for rural roads.
Cement stabilization is ideally suited for well graded aggregates with a sufficient amount of fines to 
effectively fill the available voids space and float the coarse aggregate particles. General guidelines 
for stabilization are that the plasticity index should be less than 30 for sandy materials. For fine-
grained soils, soils with more than 50 percent by weight passing 75µm sieve, the general consistency 
guidelines are that the plasticity index should be less than 20 and the liquid limit (LL) should be 
less than 40 in order to ensure proper mixing. A more specific general guideline based on the fines 
content is given in the equation below which defines the upper limit of PI for selecting soil for cement 
stabilization.

Cement is appropriate to stabilize gravel soils with not more than 45 percent retained on the no. 
4 sieve. The Federal Highway Administration recommends the use of cement in materials with less 
than 35 percent passing no. 200 sieve and a plasticity index (PI) less than 20. Based on this system, 
soils with AASHTO classifications A-2 and A-3 are ideal for stabilization with cement, but certainly 
cement can be successfully used to stabilize A-4 through A-7 soils as well. The Portland cement 
Association (PCA) established guidelines to for stabilizing a wide range of soils from gravels to clays.
1.3 
Application
Generally, granular soils free of high concentration of organic matter not greater than 2%, or 
deleterious salts (sulphate and carbonate not greater than 0.2%) are suitable. A useful rule for soil 
selection is that the plasticity modulus (product of Pl and fraction passing 425 micron sieve) should 
be less than 250 and that the uniformity coefficient should be greater than 5.
1.4 
Factors Affecting Soil Cement Stabilization
During soil cement stabilization the following factors are affecting.
a)	
Type of soil: Cement stabilization may be applied in fine or granular soil, however granular is 
preferable for cement stabilization.
b)	
Quantity of cement: A large amount of cement is needed for cement stabilization.
c)	
Quantity of water: Adequate water is needed for the stabilization.
d)	
Mixing, compaction and curing: Adequate mixing, compaction and curing is needed for 
cement stabilization.
e)	
Admixtures: Cement has some important admixtures itself which helps them to create a 
proper bond. These admixtures pay a vital role in case of reaction between cement and water.
1.5 
Advantages of Cement Stabilization
a)	
It is widely available.
b)	
Cost is relatively low.
c)	
It is highly durable.
d)	
Soil cement is quite weather resistant and strong.
e)	
Granular soils with sufficient fines are ideally suited for cement stabilization as it requires 
least amount of cement.
f)	
Soil cement reduces the swelling characteristics of the soil.
g)	
It is commonly used for stabilizing sandy and other low plasticity soils. Cement interacts with 
the silt and clay fractions and reduces their affinity for water.
1.6 
Disadvantages of Cement Stabilization
a)	
Cracks may form in soil cement.
b)	
It requires extra labour.
c)	
The quantity of water must be sufficient for hydration of cement and making the mixture 
workable.

Selection of Stabilizer
The selection of the stabilizer is based on plasticity and particle size distribution of the material to be 
treated. The appropriate stabilizer can be selected according to the criterion shown in Table 1. Some 
control over the grading can be achieved by limiting the coefficient of uniformity to a minimum 
value of 5, however, it should preferably be more than 10. If the coefficient of uniformity lies below 
5, the cost of stabilization will be high and the maintenance of cracks in the finished road would be 
expensive. If the plasticity of soil is high there are usually sufficient clay minerals which can be readily 
stabilized with lime. Cement is more difficult to mix intimately with plastic material but this problem 
can be alleviated by pre-treating the soil approximately 2 percent lime.

Requirement of cement for different types of soils
Stabilisation with cement is resorted to for soils and other locally available materials which do not 
respond to lime treatment and when comparatively higher and faster development of strength and 
durability characteristics are needed, especially for waterlogged and high rainfall areas. Granular and 
sandy soils are most suitable for cement stabilisation. By way of broad guidelines, the requirements 
of cement content for different soil types are as under.
For heavy clays/black cotton soils (PI more than 30), two stage stabilization may be adopted i.e. the 
clay is treated with lime in the first stage to reduce plasticity and to facilitate pulverization, whereas 
in the second stage, the resulting soil is stabilised with cement.

Specifications and Test Requirements for Stabilized Materials
3.1	
General Requirement
The pavement performance of a stabilized road will be largely governed by the gradation and the 
type of soil/granular material used for the purpose of stabilization. The quality of material to be 
stabilized should meet the minimum standard set out in specifications. Stabilized layers constructed 
from such material are likely to perform satisfactory even if, it is affected by carbonation during 
its life time. Materials which do not comply with the requirements given in the specifications can 
be stabilised but more additive will be required and the risk from cracking and carbonation will

increase. The strength of stabilised materials can be evaluated many ways, of which most popular 
are the Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) test and the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test.
3.2 
Stabilization with Cement
3.2.1 Requirement for soil modification/subgrade improvement
Cement stabilised materials can be used for soil modification or improvement of subgrade soil. It 
is recommended from economic consideration that mix in-place methods of construction be used 
for subgrade improvement and only granular materials and silty cohesive materials be used. The 
assumption being that more clayey materials would be more effectively stabilized with lime). The main 
requirements for cement modification or stabilization of subgrade soil are summarised in Table 3.

*In case of better mechanical equipment for spreading of cement, for breaking clods and blending is used, 
the minimum percentage of cement for stabilisation could be 0.5 percent. However extensive lab testing 
must be done to arrive at this minimum percentage. Sample at site of blended loose soil be collected and 
remoulded in lab to confirm that the desired CBR can be achieved.
3.2.2 Requirement for bound sub base/bases
The material used for cement treatment shall be soil including  gravel and  sand, lateritic soils, sandy 
silty material, crushed slag, crushed concrete, brick metal, granular material, kankar, laterite, brick 
aggregate, crushed rock, metallic slag or fly ash, pond ash or any locally available materials/industry 
wastes or any combination of these as approved by the Engineer etc., stabilised with either cement 
or lime-fly ash-cement or lime-fly ash, etc. may be allowed for use as capping layer over weak 
subgrade, as sub-base and base layer of pavement. The main requirements of stabilized layers for 
different layers of a pavement structure as indicated above are summarised in Table 4. 
Gradation for cement bound materials as per MORD specifications Table 400.5 can be adopted. 
For use in a sub-base course, the material shall have a grading shown in Table 5, and a uniformly 
coefficient (Cu)* not less than 5, capable of producing a well closed surface finish. For use in a base 
course, the material shall be sufficiently well graded to ensure a well-closed surface finish and have 
a grading within the range given in Table 5. If the material passing 425 micron sieve is plastic, it shall 
have a liquid limit not greater than 45 percent and a plasticity index not greater than 20% determined 
in accordance with IS:2720 (Part5).However, thickness of different stabilized layers, selection/choice

for adoption of a particular grading and strength requirements of these layers are to be decided on

Mix Design
Mix design should be worked out to specify the amount of cement to be added to obtain the required 
strength in terms of 7-day Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) and/or durability test under 
alternate wet-dry conditions. Pulverisation of soil clods, mixing of pulverised soil with the required 
amount of cement, compaction and curing of the compacted layer are important construction 
operations. The mix shall be designed for a minimum laboratory 7 days unconfined compressive 
strength of 3.00MPa for use in base course and not less than 1.7 MPa for sub-base.

Construction Operations 
4.1 
Procedure of Stabilization
The construction of stabilized road pavement layers follows the same basic procedures whether the stabilizing 
agent is cement, lime or other hydraulic binder.  The procedures can be divided in to two main groups:
1)	
Mix-in-Place stabilization	 	
2)	
Plant-mix stabilization



======================================================================
PAGE 10 of 28

4.1.1 Mix-in-Place Stabilization
The main advantage of the mix-in-place procedure is its relative simplicity and hence it is particularly 
suitable or work in remote areas where plant mixing could prove logistically difficult. Its disadvantages 
are not obtaining efficient mixing i.e. good distribution of the stabilizer, constructing thicknesses of 
more than 200 mm and of poor levels. In this process the material is stabilized in-situ which requires 
the stabilizing agent to be spread before or during the pulverisation and mixing of the soil and stabilizer. 
This is generally carried out with a purpose made machine although for small scale work in remote areas 
agricultural machinery can be adapted for use. In-situ stabilization involves the following operations:
•	
Fixing the type and dosage of Stabilizing agent/cement considering the properties of soil
•	
Preparation of ground to be stabilized
•	
Mixing of cement  with soil/aggregate
•	
Compaction and Finishing
•	
Joint Construction
•	
Curing of the compacted soil
4.1.1.1 Preparation of ground to be stabilized
This involves:
•	
Placing imported material to be stabilized on the formation
•	
The material then has to be graded to approximately the required levels
•	
Plough to loosen the material, one or two passes is normally sufficient.
4.1.1.2 Initial Preparation 
This involves excavating down to the in-situ material to be stabilized or placing imported material 
on the formation. The material to be stabilized then has to be graded to approximately the required 
levels. After which it is usually necessary to plough to loosen the material one or two passes is 
normally sufficient.
Before construction of any stabilised layer and before any transported material for stabilisation is 
dumped on the road, the underlying layer should be investigated to establish whether there is any 
damage, voids, wet spots or other defects. Any defects to the layer should be rectified with the 
material of having similar properties with the native material before the stabilised layer is constructed. 
Where the stabilised layer is constructed on the floor of a pavement excavation or on the top of an 
existing pavement layer i.e. where the underlying layer has not been reworked or reconstructed, 
the floor of the excavation or top of the existing pavement layer should first be watered and the 
compaction of the layer should be carried when layer become moist or comes at OMC. The material 
to be stabilised should be placed, or in the case of existing pavement layer, scarified to the full depth 
specified, broken down and watered if necessary and mixed to achieve a homogenous layer. Any 
oversize material should be removed. Normally maximum size of aggregate is 30mm.

4.1.1.3 Spreading the Stabilizer 
Spreading the stabilizing agent at the required dosage rate can be carried out manually or by machine. 
When manual methods are used bags of stabilizer are spott ed at a set spacing, they are then broken 
open and the stabilizer raked across the surface as uniformly as possible. The uniformity of the layer 
of stabilizer spread over the surface, before the mixing operati on, determines the uniformity of the 
mixed material produced.
Mechanical spreaders automati cally monitor the required amount of stabilizer to be spread on the 
surface of the soil. Their use results in a much more uniform spread of stabilizer over the surface 
than can be achieved by hand spreading. The equipment need to be calibrated before use to ensure 
that the correct rate of spread is achieved and subsequently checked at regular intervals to ensure 
that the rate of spread remains within specifi ed tolerances.

4.1.1.4 Additi on of Water
lf it is necessary to add water to bring the moisture content to the required value this can either be 
done as part of the mixing operati on or aft er the material has been prepared prior to the additi on of 
the stabilizer. To ensure a thorough distributi on of the added water, it is; preferable to add water as 
part of the mixing operati on. Water added during the mixing process should be through a spray system 
such that it is added in a uniform manner over the required area and uniformly to the required depth. 
Where the mixing plant does not enable water to be added or where it is not possible to add enough 
water during mixing it should be added to the prepared material using a spray system that enables the 
amount to be controlled over the whole area. The material to be stabilised should then be mixed prior 
to the additi on of the cement stabiliser to ensure the distributi on of the water throughout the layer.
 
Figure 4: Additi on of water
4.1.1.5 Mixing Soil, Water and Stabilizer
Robust mixing equipment of suitable power for the layer being processed is required to pulverise 
the soil and blend it with the stabilizer and water. The most effi  cient of the machines available carry 
out the operati on in one pass, enabling the layer to be compacted quickly and minimising the loss 
of density and strength caused by any delay in compacti on. Multi  pass machines are sati sfactory,

======================================================================

provided the length of pavement being processed is not excessive and each secti on of pavement can 
be processed within an acceptable ti me.
The plasti city of the material is overriding factor in the ability of mixing plant to mix the soil with 
stabilizer. A review of work showed that all plasti c soil could be sati sfactorily mixed with cement using 
the plant. For cohesive soils a factor of the plasti city index of the soil multi plied by the percentage of 
the fracti on of the soil which was fi ner than 425 micron in parti cle diameter may be used to suggest 
the values for the diff erent types of mixing plant available are given in Table 6.

*Selecti on of the appropriate plant should be left  to the decision of Engineer-in-Charge.
Grader have been used to mix stabilized material but they are ineffi  cient for pulverising cohesive soil 
and even with granular materials a large number of passes are needed before the quality of mixing 
is acceptable, For these reasons, the use of grader for mixing is not suggested.
Mixing is carried out in the fi eld using Agricultural Disc harrows, Disc ploughs or rotavators. Soil having 
high plasti city requires more powerful mixing device and a large number of passes are needed before 
the quality of mixing is acceptable. The uniformity of the mix should be ensured before compacti on.

4.1.2 Plant-Mix Stabilizati on 
In this process, the materials are separately batched and mixed at a mixing plant. They are then 
transported to the site where they are laid by a bituminous paver and compacted. The advantages 
of the process are the good control on proporti oning of the 'materials, multi -layer work can be 
executed and good compacted levels are readily obtainable. The disadvantages are that output is 
lower than in the mix in place process, cohesive materials cannot usually be mixed and in the case 
of cement stabilizati on, the mixing plant has to be relati vely close to the site so that mixing, laying 
and compacti on can all be completed within the sti pulated two-hour ti me limit. The process is not, 
therefore, applicable to small-scale projects unless there is a mixing plant near at hand. 
To ensure complete distributi on of the relati vely small quanti ti es of stabilizer, mixing should be 
carried out in a forced acti on mixer and except for non-cohesive granular materials, free fall mixes of 
the type used for mixing concrete should not be used. If it is proposed to use a mixer other than one 
with a forced acti on preliminary trials should be made to ensure that sati sfactory mixing is achieved. 
Vehicles transporti ng the mixed material should be of suffi  cient number and capacity to meet both 
the output of the mixer and spreading and compacti on operati ons. Internati onal standards and 
specifi cati ons, for plant mixed cement stabilized material require it to be spread by a bituminous paver 
and spreading by grader is not permitt ed. If graders are used for spreading, much of the advantage 
of plant-mix stabilizati on is lost as it is diffi  cult to control levels and thicknesses of constructi on. 
4.1.3 Compacti on 
Compacti on is carried out in two stages:
• 
An initi al rolling and trimming which may be carried out followed by a fi nal mixing pass of the rotavator. 
• 
Final compacti on and levelling in the case of cement stabilized material must be completed 
within two hours of mixing. 
Whatever method is used for mixing the soil with water and stabilizer material, the methods used 
for compacti on are the same. In the case of cement stabilized materials, once the cement has begun 
to harden, it is important that the matrix is not disturbed; hence the requirement that compacti on 



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 28
======================================================================
15
must be completed within two hours of mixing. The compacted density of the stabilized layer is a 
measure of the eff ecti veness of compacti on and hence of its strength. The degree of compacti on to 
be achieved in the fi eld can be specifi ed in two ways. In an end product specifi cati on, the density of 
the layer in the fi eld is determined and compared with a specifi ed target density. Provided that the 
measured fi eld density is greater than or equal to this limit the compacti on in the fi eld is deemed 
to be sati sfactory. The main disadvantages of an end product specifi cati on are that a large amount 
of site testi ng is required and many of the methods in use are ti me consuming. This means that the 
results of the tests may not be available in ti me to remedy any defi ciencies in compacti on. 
If the base course operati on is being performed in two layers, the two hour ti me limit will be measured 
from the ti me water and cement are added to the sand or gravel of the fi rst layer to the ti me of 
completi on of fi nal compacti on of the uppermost lift . If the target cannot meet within this ti me limit, it 
will be required to wait for the normal fi ve days curing period before applying the next layer.
The surface of the un-compacted, parti ally compacted or completely compacted cement stabilized 
base shall be kept moist at all ti mes unti l an asphalti c fog coat seal is applied.
Following compacti on, before setti  ng of the mixture, high spots on the cement stabilized base shall 
be removed by means of cutti  ng blades or other equipment, in a manner to cause as litt le disturbance 
as possible to the compacted material. The excess material shall be removed to the shoulder or 
adjacent subgrade. Loose material shall not be left  on the cement stabilized base surface. Filling low 
spots with cement stabilized material following compacti on will not be permitt ed.

4.2  
Joint Construction
•	
All joints shall be vertical and uniform in alignment.
•	
Longitudinal joints shall be formed or cut in a vertical plane to the subgrade surface, shall 
expose a face of thoroughly compacted material, and new material shall be spread and 
compacted against this face when constructing the adjacent lane or base section. 
•	
Transverse construction joints shall be made by trimming the end of the compacted material 
to a straight line normal to the centreline of the roadbed and with a vertical edge in well 
compacted material. 
4.3 	
Curing of the Compacted Soil
Proper curing is very important for three reasons:
a)	
It ensure that sufficient water is retained in the layer so that the hydration reactions between 
the stabilizer, water and the soil can continue
b)	
It reduces shrinkage, and
c)	
It reduces the risk of carbonation from the top layer
In temperate climate curing presents few problems. It is usually carried out by sealing the compacted 
surface to prevent the loss of water during the curing period (usually seven days) during which time 
all construction traffic must be kept off the stabilized material. Before spraying is started the surface 
should be swept free of loose material and any damp areas should be free of standing water. The 
following methods of curing are suggested:
a)	
Covering with an impermeable sheeting with joints overlapping at least 300 mm and set to 
prevent ingress of water.
b)	
Spraying with a bituminous sealing compound.
Spraying with a resin based aluminous curing compound such as is used for concrete. This has 
particular application where it is desirable to reduce the increase in temperature immediately under 
the surface which would result from the use of a black (bituminous) seal.
In a hot dry climate the need for good curing is most important but the prevention of moisture loss 
is very difficult. If the surface is constant sprayed and kept damp day and night the moisture content 
in the main portion of the layer will remain stable but the operation is likely to leach stabilizer from 
the top portion of the layer. If the spraying operation is intermittent and the surface dries from time 
to time (a common occurrence if this method is used) the curing will be completely ineffective.
Curing through spraying can be much more efficient curing system if a layer of sand 30mm to 40mm 
thick is first spread on top of the layer. In this case the number of spraying cycles per day can be very 
much less and there is a considerable saving in the amount of water used.
When the stabilized layer is to be covered by other pavement layers the construction of the upper 
sections will provide a very good curing seal but be taken to ensure that this work does not damage the 
top of the stabilized layer. During the period of time prior to the construction of the next layer some 
system of curing is required because this is the most critical period in terms of shrinkage in the layer.
Primer can also serve as a curing membrane but results have shown that a prime coat breaks down 
when it penetrates into the surface and completely loses any ability to seal it. A portion of any 
curing membrane must sit on the surface to achieve an effective seal If the top of the stabilized layer 



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 28
======================================================================
17
is sprayed lightly with water followed by an applicati on of a viscous cutback bitumen, the loss of 
moisture is eff ecti vely reduced to zero. Similarly the top of the stabilized layer can be sprayed with 
an emulsion to achieve the same result. It is essenti al however that all traffi  c is kept off  the curing 
membrane for several days at which ti me excess bitumen can be absorbed by sanding the surface.

Constructi on Equipment’s: 
Road constructi on equipment’s are found in a wide variety ranging from the very heavy equipment 
to portable and lighter equipment. These modern and high constructi on equipments make the 
constructi on job easier and quicker. For an applicati on to be successful the appropriate equipment 
together with experienced persons must be planned for in advance and be readily available on site

Analysis of Rates

Designs of Cement Stabilised Sub Base and Base
IRC SP-72 – 2015 “Guidelines for the Design of Flexible Pavements for Low Volume Rural Roads” has 
been recently published by IRC and it provides the design charts for working out design thickness for 
stabilised base/ sub base course based on subgrade strength CBR and various traffic categories. Design 
catalogues for using Cement stabilised soil sub-base and soil cement bases is given in Figure 10.
6.1	
Stabilised Soil Sub-base
For silty clays and clayey soils, including Black Cotton Soil, treatment with lime offers an appropriate 
and cost effective technique which may be in the form of modification by way of reducing the PI 
or in the form of a stabilisation technique for attaining the need strength as per Clause 403 of 
MoRD Specification for Rural Roads. For soils which do not respond to lime treatment and where 
comparatively higher and faster development of strength and durability characteristics are needed, 
especially for water logged and high rainfall areas, soil stabilization with cement is most appropriate. 
For cement treated soil sub-base courses, the relevant specifications are contained in Clause 404. 
The cement content for a cement treated sub-base should be determined by mix design, yielding a 
7-day unconfined compressive strength of not less than 1.7 MPa. From practical considerations, the 
thickness of sub-base, where provided, shall not be less than 100 mm.
6.2	
Soil-cement base 
Where hard stone has to be carted from long uneconomical leads, the use of soil-cement often offers 
an appropriate option. The soil-cement mix should be designed to attain a minimum laboratory 7-day 
unconfined compressive strength of 3 MPa. Special consideration must be given to pulverization of 
soil clods to the specified requirements and thorough mixing as laid down in Clause 404 of MoRD

specifi cati ons for Rural Roads. For clayey soils, pre-treatment with lime may be needed before 
stabilizati on with cement. The Thickness of base shall be as per pavement design catalogue for soil 
cement bases but should not be less than 100 mm.

 Quality Assurance 
7.1 
 General 
During the constructi on process regular checks are to be made on the stabilized material to ensure 
that all the requirements of the specifi cati on are being met. Many of the checks carried out are 
merely "good housekeeping" i.e. conti nual supervision to ensure that the constructi on process 
allows the design objecti ves to be achieved in full. In additi on to this there is producti on control 
tests carried out to monitor the work in progress to ensure, for example, that the correct thickness 
of stabilized layer is being laid and that a consistent product is being produced. Finally compliance 
tests are to be carried out on the fi nished product to demonstrate that it meets all the requirements 
of the specifi cati on.

This section, therefore, describes the tests that may need to be carried out to check on the quality of 
the material. It also discusses the various factors that influence the choice of a particular test that is 
used to establish the values for parameters such as moisture content, compacted density, strength, 
etc., set out in the specification. 
7.2	
Preliminary Trial 
As part of the quality control and in order to make a final decision on moisture content and stabilizer 
content, the information gained in the laboratory tests should be related to a preliminary field trial. At 
least 10 days before the main work begins, a trial area should be laid using the materials, mix proportions, 
mixing, laying and compaction plant to be used, to check the suitability of the methods, etc. 
7.3 
Sampling and Testing Frequency 
Samples for checking the moisture content, strength, etc. are most conveniently taken from the laid 
material before compaction. Frequency of testing depends on the size of the project and the facilities 
available on site but regular checks should, at least, be made on the moisture content, strength and 
in-situ density. Whatever the frequency, sampling should be spread out over the site so as to give 
a representative indication of the quality of the material within a given area. In order to achieve 
the specification for stabilized sub-bases and road bases, it is suggested that samples at equally 
spaced locations along a diagonal that bisects the area to be tested may be taken. For satisfactory 
performance of soil stabilized road, strict quality control measures are essential. It is prudent to 
conduct periodic testing during construction to confirm that the properties of materials being used 
are within the range of value anticipated during the design. For each consignment of cement, testing 
should be done to check quality. Quality control tests and their minimum desirable frequency are 
as given in Table 8 & 9. Strict control should be excised during the mix in-place operations, with 
frequent checks on mixing efficiency. This can be done by trenching through the in-place material 
and inspecting the colour of the mixture. Unmixed streaks or layers indicate poor mixing and the 
material in that area should be remixed until uniformity of colour is achieved.

Storage and Handling of the Stabilizer 
Unless cement and lime are properly stored and used in a fresh condition the quality of the pavement 
layer will be substantially reduced. Cement must be stored in a sound water-tight building and the 
bags stacked as tightly as possible. Doors and windows should only be opened if absolutely necessary. 
The cement which is delivered first should be used first. According to a study it was found that even 
if cement is properly stored the following losses in strength will still occur:

Lime should be stored in sealed bags, tightly stacked and covered with a water proof tarpaulin. 
The material which has been stored for more than three weeks should be tested for available lime 
content before use. Lime which is older than 6 months should be discarded. 
7.5	
 Control of the Moisture Content 
Throughout the stabilization work, the moisture content should be maintained slightly above its 
specified value. This means that rapid determination of the in-situ moisture content is necessary to 
allow adjustments to be made so as to bring the moisture content of the stabilized material to the 
required value. The definitive oven-drying method is, in general, too time-consuming to be of much 
practical use in the field and more rapid means have to be employed. Rapid heating methods may 
be used, but where these are inappropriate, the calcium carbide method may be used to give rapid 
result. The method depends on the reaction between calcium carbide and water in the stabilized 
material to produce acetylene at the ambient temperature according to the equation: 



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 28
======================================================================
22
CaC2 + 2H20 = Ca (OH)2 + C2H2
If the reaction is allowed to occur under standardised conditions in a closed container, the pressure of 
the acetylene generated in the container is a measure of the moisture content of the stabilized material. 
Nuclear density gauges for the determination of the in-situ density of compacted materials usually 
include a facility for the in-situ moisture content at the same time. This method can be used to 
determine moisture content when construction starts and also during the processing. 
7.6	
Control of the Stabilizer Content 
Whatever method of spreading the stabilizer is employed, it is important that a uniform spread rate 
is achieved as this will affect the uniformity of the stabilized material. If the stabilizer is placed in 
bags and spread by hand, the accuracy of the spotting of the bags must be checked and the manual 
spreading of the stabilizer should be visually assessed. If a mechanical spreader is used, metal trays 
or canvas sheets, one metre square, should be placed at regular intervals along the road to check 
the application rate. 
Determination of the stabilizer content, after mixing, is in principle easy to perform but in practice 
is time consuming and needs to be carried out with care if meaningful results are to be obtained. 
Both the methods described in the codes BS: 1924: Part 2 and in ASTM D 806 involve a comparison 
of the calcium contents of the stabilized material, the stabilizer and the material in an un-stabilized 
condition. However, the method given for the determination of calcium in BS: 1924 is to be preferred. 
Neither method is applicable if the calcium content of the un-stabilized materials is high or variable. 
7.7 
Routine Strength Determinations 
Continuous monitoring of the strength of processed material is required to ensure that the specified 
strength is being achieved. Representative samples of the full depth of mixed material should 
therefore be taken from the site immediately prior to compacting the material. As stated previously, 
the frequency of sampling should be related to the size of the processed area and its structural 
importance. In the case of cement stabilized materials, preparation of the test specimens should be 
completed within two hours of mixing. 
The moisture content to be used for the preparation of the test specimens will clearly be that of the 
mixed material and precautions should be taken to ensure that no drying out of the material occurs 
between taking the samples and completing the preparation of the test specimens. 
The density at which the test specimens are to be compacted depends on the density requirements of the 
specification and various methods which are in use. The test specimens should be prepared at the same 
density as the compacted material in the field. This has some logic because it means that there should be 
no differences in strength, which can be attributed to differences of density, between the laboratory test 
specimens and the strength of the material in the field. The difficulty is that an immediate measure of the 
in-situ density is required and this can only be achieved if nuclear density gauges are used. 
8.0 
 Precautions to be taken while using Stabilized Materials
8.1	
 General 
The two major problems that arise with the use of stabilized materials in road pavement layers 
are cracking and the long -term durability of the material. The extent to which either of these is a 



======================================================================
PAGE 23 of 28
======================================================================
23
problem is intimately related to the purpose of the stabilized layer in the road pavement as a whole 
and it is, therefore, difficult to divorce the two factors. However, in this Chapter the problems that 
can arise are discussed. 
8.2 
 Cracking in Stabilized Layers 
Many factors contribute to the cracking and crack -spacing of stabilized pavement layers. Some of 
them are listed below: 
a)	
Tensile strength of the stabilized material; 
b)	
Shrinkage characteristics; 
c)	
Volume changes resulting from temperature or moisture variations; 
d)	
The subgrade restraint; 
e)	
Stiffness and creep of the stabilized material, and 
f)	
External loadings such as those caused by traffic. 
As in the case of compressive strength, the tensile strength of stabilized materials takes time to 
develop. On the other hand, stabilized material in a road pavement layer, will be subject to volume 
changes from at least one of the factors listed above as soon as it is compacted. Cracking in stabilized 
layers due to changes in temperature or moisture content cannot, therefore, be avoided and must 
be accepted as inevitable although steps can be taken to reduce the effect. Cracking may also occur 
as a result of fatigue failure due to trafficking and is an entirely separate phenomenon from the 
initial cracking due to environmental changes. 
Cracks in stabilized layers used at capping and sub-base level are unlikely to cause significant problems 
but at base level the cracks may be reflected through the surfacing. The existence of cracks in a road 
surface may be assumed to indicate need for remedial action. The consequences of not doing so, 
may range from no problems at all to loss of interlock or to eventual failure when the stabilized 
layer has been reduced to unconnected blocks. Cracks may also permit ingress of water leading to 
weathering of materials at crack faces, de-bonding between pavement layers, or deterioration of 
moisture-susceptible layers beneath the stabilized layer.
8.3 
 Primary Cracking 
Cracks appear in cement-stabilized materials as a result of shrinkage and temperature fluctuations. The 
initial crack pattern is dependent on the early strength of the material and the properties of the material 
used. Materials which have low strength, normally also contain a higher proportion of plastic fines. The 
stabilized materials with lower strength and with high proportion of plastic fines have frequent but 
narrow cracks. Whether or not these frequent but fine cracks prove to be a problem depends to a large 
extent on the mechanical interlock at the face of the cracks. If the interlock is good the material performs 
satisfactory and the cracks are sufficiently fine for them not to be reflected through the pavement layer 
above. However, the lower strengths of these stabilized materials mean that they are generally only 
suitable for use in the lower layers of the road where cracking is less of a problem anyway. 
On the other hand, stabilized materials with high strength criteria and which have little, if any, plastic 
fines have fewer but wide cracks. These cracks are often wide enough for them to be reflected through 
the surface. In order to restrain the propagation of lateral reflective cracks, such materials therefore 
have to be covered with a greater thickness of construction material than would otherwise be required. 
The temperature at which the material is laid also plays a part in the type of crack pattern that is produced. 
Layers placed in cooler weather tend to develop fewer and narrower cracks as there is less thermal 
shrinkage. The stabilized layer may subsequently be in compression, apart perhaps from prolonged cold 



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 28
======================================================================
24
spells, so that cracks remain closed with good load transfer. Fewer cracks develop when the temperature 
difference between day and night during construction is not large, as thermal warping is reduced. 
Lime- stabilized materials are also subjected to cracking for the same reasons. However, the effects 
are not so pronounced; if the cracks occur before unreacted lime in the layer has been used up, 
either in pozzolanic reactions or by carbonation, the continuing pozzolanic reaction of the lime can 
result in self- healing (autogenous healing) of the cracks. 
Given that cracking is inevitable, the ideal condition is for materials to have low early strength which 
lead to numerous fine cracks but high long- term strengths which mean good mechanical interlock 
at the face of the cracks. As lime is slower to react than cement, this is another reason for favouring 
lime, provided it can achieve high long- term strengths. 
Another possibility is to use secondary additives to modify the hardening action of the cement to 
reduce its early strength without affecting its long-term strength. 
8.4 
 Traffic Associated Cracks 
Quite separately and much more importantly than the primary transverse cracks, cracks may appear in 
stabilized bases of inadequate strength or inadequate construction thickness in relation to the traffic and 
the sub-grade strength. Such cracking takes the form of "map" cracking which, in extreme cases, causes 
the stabilized material to deteriorate into small slabs with poor load transfer. Once started, deterioration 
is likely to continue until the stabilized base becomes little more effective than granular sub-base. 
When extensive cracking has developed as a result of the combined action of free water and traffic, 
then it often results in the "pumping" to the surface of fine material from the underlying pavement 
layers where it is deposited in the cracks. The fines discolour the surface along the cracks making 
them clearly visible. 
Unlike the primary cracking, the appearance of traffic-associated cracks is not inevitable. It should 
not occur if the road pavement has been properly designed to take account of the traffic likely to be 
encountered during the design life of the road. 
8.5	
 Durability of Stabilized Materials 
The failure of stabilized materials by disintegration into a loose mass is not common. It is most likely 
to be due to deficiency either in the amount of stabilizer, deficiency in the quality of the stabilizer, or 
deficient compaction or curing. These problems should not occur if a good standard of preliminary 
testing for suitability and of quality control are maintained. 
It is reported that the most common type of failure of stabilized layers is the peeling-off of surface 
dressings from stabilized layers. This is usually due to failure of top of the layers itself rather than any 
of the shortcomings of the surface dressing. The surface of the layer tends to disintegrate under traffic, 
the most likely cause of which is considered to be as a result of overstressing of the surface layer during 
the compaction of the stabilized material at the time of construction. This induces a series of shallow 
shear planes in the surface layer and result in a sharp falling-off density of the material towards the 
upper surface. Overstressing is most prevalent with uniformly graded non-cohesive sands. It can be 
avoided if special care is taken with the compaction and if towed vibrating rollers are used. 
A survey of known causes of lack of durability of stabilized layers confirmed that the most common 
problem was surface disintegration of the primed layer during construction and scabbing of the 
seal in service due to an inadequate bond with the stabilized material. These problems are a result 
of inadequate compaction and curing and are more likely to occur in hot, dry climates. Apart from 



======================================================================

======================================================================
25
the problem of surface disintegration, long-term durability may also be impaired by the effects of 
sulphates and by carbonation. 
8.6 
 Control of Reflective Cracking in Cement Stabilized Pavements 
Although the potential exists for reflection cracking when a cement-stabilized base is used in a 
pavement structure, proper construction and design techniques can minimize the potential that 
the pavement will be adversely affected. Proper construction practices to minimize drying, pre-
cracking soon after construction, and designing for stress relief are all valid methods that will reduce 
or eliminate the formation of reflection cracks in cement-stabilized bases. 
There are several factors as discussed in the previous chapter, which contribute to the cracking in a 
cement-stabilized base/sub-base. With regard to material characteristics, the type of soil, cement 
content, degree of compaction and curing, and temperature and moisture changes directly influence 
the degree of shrinkage. 
There are a number of preventative measures and design concepts that can be used to minimize 
shrinkage cracking in the cement-stabilized base, and to reduce the potential that base cracks will reflect 
through the asphalt surface. Methods of controlling reflective cracking include proper construction 
and curing of the stabilized base, reduction of crack size through the use of "pre-cracking", and relief of 
stress concentrations through the use of flexible layers in the pavement structure. 
A cement-stabilized base provides excellent support for asphalt surfaces. The stabilized base material 
is stronger, more uniform and more water resistant than an un-stabilized base. Loads are distributed 
over a larger area and stresses in the subgrade are reduced. However, cement-stabilized bases can 
also be the source of shrinkage cracks in the stabilized base layer, which can reflect through the 
asphalt surface. The cracks that develop are not the result of a structural deficiency, but rather a 
natural characteristic of cement-stabilized bases. The surface cracks tend to follow the same pattern 
as the cracks in the base, and are referred to as "reflection" cracks. 
In most cases, reflection cracks are narrow (less than 3 mm) and will not adversely affect the 
performance of the pavement. However, wider cracks can result in a rough riding surface and 
deterioration of the pavement. The wide cracks create an environment for water infiltration and 
subsequent pumping of the underlying subgrade. 
Several factors contribute to the cracking and crack spacing in a cement stabilized base which include 
material characteristics, construction procedures, traffic and restraint imposed on the base by the 
subgrade. With regard to material characteristics the primary cause of cracking is due to drying 
shrinkage of the cement stabilized base. The degree of drying shrinkage is affected by the type of 
soil, degree of compaction and curing, cement content, temperatures and moisture changes. 
Cement stabilized fine grained soils e.g. clays exhibit greater shrinkage than cement stabilized granular 
soils. Although stabilized clay soils develop higher total shrinkage than granular soils, the cracks are 
typically finer and more closely spaced often of hairline variety spaced 0.6 to 3.0 m apart. The granular 
soils generally produce less shrinkage but develop larger cracks typically spaced at 3.0 to 6.0 m apart. 
Fine grain grained soils have large surface area than granular soils and typically require higher moisture 
content for compaction purposes. In addition, cement content for fine grained soils are generally 2 
to 5 percent higher than granular soils in order to achieve adequate durability and strength. Both 
these factor contribute to higher moisture contents for stabilized fine grained soils and consequently 
higher drying shrinkage. 



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 28
======================================================================
26
The effect of compaction on shrinkage characteristics of cement stabilized material plays an important 
role. A well compacted mixture exhibits reduced shrinkage potential, because the soil/aggregates 
particles are packed tightly together resulting in reduced voids. It has been reported that compacting 
cement stabilized soil at modified proctor effort, reduces shrinkage significantly as compared to 
stabilized soil compacted to standard proctor density. The reason for the same can be attributed to 
the fact that the optimum moisture contents at modified proctor compaction are typically less than 
at standard proctor compaction which helps to reduce shrinkage. The least amount of shrinkage is 
obtained for the stabilized material at the highest density and lowest moisture content. 
Cement hydration contributes less to shrinkage than does many other factors. In fact, for soils that 
exhibit volume change without cement, increasing cement will decrease total shrinkage. However, 
excessive amounts of cement can exacerbate cracking in two ways: First, increased cement contents 
cause greater consumption of water during hydration, thus increasing drying shrinkage. Also, higher 
cement levels cause higher rigidity and excessive strength (both tensile and compressive). 
8.7 
 Methods of controlling reflective cracking 
Methods of controlling reflective cracking basically fall into the two categories: 
•	
Pre-cracking 
•	
Providing for stress relief at the base-surface interface 
Pre-cracking: Minimizing crack width with proper construction and curing procedures, as discussed 
in the previous sections, will eliminate much of the potential for wide cracks. Another method to 
reduce crack width is a relatively new procedure called "pre-cracking", where hundreds of tiny 
micro-cracks develop instead of single transverse cracks. The method has been successfully tried 
on several projects in the United States. The procedure involves several passes of a large vibratory 
roller over the cement-stabilized base one to two days after final compaction. This introduces a 
network of closely spaced hairline cracks into the cement-stabilized material, which acts to relieve 
the shrinkage stresses in the early stages of curing, and provides a crack pattern that will minimize 
the development of wide shrinkage cracks. In addition, since the pre-cracking is performed shortly 
after placement, the "micro- cracking" will not impact the pavement's overall structural capacity as 
the cracks will heal and the cement-stabilized material will continue to gain strength with time. 
Stress Relief: Another method of reducing the potential for reflection cracking is to relieve the stress 
concentrations that result from cracks in the cement-stabilized base. The following three methods 
have been successfully used to reduce the stresses that cause reflection cracks: 
1)	
A bituminous surface treatment (chip seal) between the stabilized base and the asphalt 
surface.  The additional flexibility of the surface treatment layer will help to reduce stress 
concentrations. This surface treatment also provides an excellent temporary surface during 
construction for traffic control. 
2)	
A geo-textile between the stabilized base and surface, or between the asphalt binder and 
wearing courses. Similar to the surface treatment, the geo-textile provides flexibility and acts 
to intercept cracks without letting them pass through the material. 
3)	
A 50 mm to 100 mm layer of unbound granular material between the stabilized base layer and the 
asphalt surface. This use of a "sandwich" or "inverted" pavement design adds additional structure 
to the pavement, and will prevent the propagation of cracks through to the surface layer.
