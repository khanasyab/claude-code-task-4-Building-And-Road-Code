Guidelines  on Preparation  and  Implementation  of   
Environment  Management  Plan
1  Introduction
These Guidelines recommend the manner in which an Environment Management Plan (EMP) 
should be prepared, implemented, monitored and evaluated and cover the whole project 
life-cycle, starting from the preliminary planning and design to construction, maintenance 
and operation of the project. The procedures for Environment Clearance (EC), involving 
submission of Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) and Environment Management Plan 
(EMP) notwithstanding, these Guidelines aim at bringing environment in the forefront of 
project development, execution and operation and are recommended to be followed even 
where environment clearance is not statutorily mandatory. Where latter is the case, these 
Guidelines would aid the Project Authorities in preparing an EMP.
The Committee on Reduction of Carbon Footprint in Road Construction and Environment (G-
3) deliberated on the draft “Guidelines on Preparation and Implementation of Environment 
Management Plan” in a series of its meetings. The G-3 Committee in its meeting held on 
20th December, 2014 approved the document for placing it before the General Specifications & 
Standards Committee (GSS). The GSS Committee approved the Guidelines in  its meeting held on 
13th January, 2015. The Council in its 204th meeting held on 19th January, 2015 at 
Bhubaneshwar (Odisha) approved the “Guidelines on Preparation and Implementation of 
Environment Management Plan” after taking on board the comments offered by the members.

2  Scope
2.1	
The Scope of the Guidelines Cover
	
i)	
The object of environmental impact (land, air, water, forest resources, wild and 
aquatic life, human life and health and social impact)
	
ii)	
The principles on which EMP should be framed, implemented, evaluated and 
monitored
	
iii)	
The assessment of the impact of the project on these objects
	
iv)	
Specific standards and measures under different situations
	
v)	
Measures to ensure proper compliance of the environmental requirements
2.2	
These Guidelines do not substitute or supplant the statutory requirements relating 
to environment including the compliance with the prescribed rules and procedures but only 
supplement them by facilitating better understanding of the problem by highway planners 
and professionals to help them deliver projects with minimal adverse impact on environment.
3  General
3.1	
An Environment Management Plan is required to be prepared and implemented in 
compliance with the statutory Environment clearance for a highway project. The clearances 
are accorded on the basis of submission of the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) by the 
Project Authorities. Promises made by the Project Authorities while submitting the EIA proposal 
and the conditions attached by the Ministry of Environment and Forest while according the 
clearance form the basis for the preparation of an Environment Management Plan (EMP), 
which is implemented during the project execution or operation by the contracting agencies 
and monitored by the Project Authorities.
3.2	
The preparation of the Project Feasibility Report or the Detailed Project Report on the 
one hand and the EIA on the other, are usually taken up concurrently in parallel or at best, the 
latter closely following the former. EIA is thus based on the preliminary (or detailed) project 
design. At the EIA stage, however, many specific issues relating to environment cannot be 



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:SP:108-2015
3
firmed up (e.g., the locations of quarries, borrow areas, camp sites, debris disposal sites, 
nature/type of land, soils, etc.). This is because either the studies of this nature are not part 
of Feasibility Studies or because these have to be finalized by the contractor/concessionaire 
after award of the contract. Accordingly, the specific solutions cannot be suggested at the 
EIA stage. These are proposed in the EMP subject to the standards and measures proposed 
in the approved EIA. Thus, EMP is an extremely important document containing specific 
measures and proposals aimed at preventing or mitigating the adverse impact of the project 
on the environment.
3.3	
Adverse impact of projects on the environment are caused in several ways (air, water, 
noise pollution, degrading the land, wasting top soil, interfering with the natural habitats 
of wild and aquatic life, etc.), which are well known. It is also well known that degrading 
the environment imposes a huge cost on the society, which the economists prefer to call 
‘externalities’ and strongly advocate that these be ‘internalized’ into the project costs (or 
usage charges), though a satisfactory and universally acceptable model for the assessment 
of externalities is still elusive. Also, there is no denying the fact that some production and 
construction processes and technologies are more energy intensive compared to some 
others and leave more carbon foot prints. It would be in the interest of the environmental 
cause that as far as possible, the less polluting technologies are used in construction in 
preference to more polluting conventional technologies. In this area as well the absence of a 
well-accepted model for quantitative evaluation of various technologies proves a handicap. 
There are procedures available, though, which enable earning of carbon credit for use of 
alternative less polluting technologies as opposed to conventional technologies thereby 
making the alternative technologies more attractive as well as cost effective.
3.4	
Notwithstanding the limitations in the quantitative evaluation of the cost of externalities 
and relative merits of alternative technologies, these Guidelines would recommend that the 
Project Authorities should be prepared to accept higher than the usual cost (which, in any 
case, does not reflect the actual social cost) of projects to be accounted for (a) by provision 
of better environmental safeguards and (b) by use of environmentally safer less polluting 
technologies. The latter may not necessarily be more expensive because of its potential for 
earning carbon credits. These Guidelines would, therefore, recommend that the EMP should 
focus on technology issues as well with externalities in the perspective.
3.5	
Even though preparation of an EMP assumes EIA as given, these Guidelines would 
recommend a fresh look at EIA as well. At the stage of preparation of Feasibility Studies or 
DPR (and hence at EIA stage), the technology question should be given due importance. 
Alternative technologies may be evaluated (from the first principle in the absence of standard 
procedures) vis-à-vis the conventional technology. After evaluation, there are two options to 
choose from (a) the technology option is frozen and the bidders are required to bid based on 
the technology chosen by the Project Authority; or (b) the choice of technology is left to the 
bidders: the bidder who bases his bid on the least polluting technology and promises the best 
possible measures in environment management should score the highest marks allocated 
for environmental factors during bid evaluation thereby improving his competitive position 
compared to other bidders. Option (a) is restrictive and might lead to technology monopolies 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:108-2015
4
while option (b) is more open, competitive and consistent with the design-build or design-
build-finance-operate philosophy. In any case, the technology option study at the EIA stage 
would not go waste because it would help evaluate option (b) in an informed and objective 
manner.
3.6	
Who prepares the EMP and in what manner, whether it is adequately compliant 
with the conditions specified in the EIA approval and if not how to enforce compliance, how 
to evaluate and monitor the implementation of EMP and what if the implementation is not 
proper, are some other important questions, which these Guidelines intend to address and 
recommend that the Project Authorities may incorporate suitable provisions in the bid and 
contract documentation with regard to these questions. It is recommended that the EMP 
should be prepared by the contractor/concessionaire in accordance with these Guidelines, 
the bid conditions as well as in compliance with the conditions attached to the environment 
clearance. As a bidder, the contractor/concessionaire should submit his approach to 
environment management, which should be evaluated as a part of qualitative assessment 
of the bids along with other assessment parameters (e.g. time, quality, safety) and follow 
that approach during execution in preparing and implementing the EMP. Compliance with 
the EMP should be a contractual obligation. The evaluation and monitoring of the EMP by 
the Project Authorities (or by the Authority’s Engineer) should be on the basis of measurable 
and objective criteria. Since the present procurement system does not permit this, the EMP 
prepared by the Contractor can be contractually enforced. (See para 4.4 below)
4  Object of Environment Impact
4.1	
A project impacts on land, air, water, forest resources, wild and aquatic life, human 
health, life and society as a whole. The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 empowers the 
Government to take any measures required for protection of environment. The Environment 
(Protection) Rules, 1986 under the Act prescribe the standards for emission or discharge of 
environmental pollutants from ‘industries, operations or processes’ and impose ‘prohibition or 
restriction’ on the latter by specifying for an ‘area’ the standards of quality and allowable limits 
considering factors such as topography and climate, biological diversity, environmentally 
compatible land use, adverse impact potential, proximity to ‘protected areas’ (under Ancient 
Monuments Act 1958, Wild Life Protection Act, 1972), proximity to human settlements and 
any other factor damaging to the environment by issuing notifications in the Gazette. The 
Rules further impose restrictions on handling of hazardous substances considering their 
substitution by local materials or technologically developed substitutes. The ‘prohibition 
and restrictions’ are governed by the procedures notified under MoEF notification of 
14th September 2006 (EIA notification), which requires prior Environment Clearance (EC). 
The objects of impact as per the notification are briefly stated below. The factors that cause 
these impacts for highway projects are added in brackets.
●	
Air quality (emissions from plants, vehicles, dust, noise)
●	
Hydrology and water quality (drainage, runoff, siltation, erosion, effluent discharge)

●	
Site and its surroundings (landscape, land use, land degradation, loss of top soil, 
loss of vegetation cover)
●	
Occupational safety and health (fumes, dust, noise, blasting)
●	
Disposal of effluents (liquid, air and solid) and the methods of alternative uses (debris 
disposal, surplus/rejected construction material, spillage, leaching, junked equipment 
parts, effluent discharge from plants/camp sites, recycling the wastes, dust palliation, 
safety gears)
●	
Transportation of raw material and details of material handling (quarrying, air pollution 
and ground pollution through materials in transit)
●	
Control equipment and measures proposed to be adopted (noise mufflers, dust 
palliation, covered transit, ground water recharge, restoring the landscape, 
rehabilitating the degraded land)
Preparation of Environmental Management Plan is required for formulation, implementation 
and monitoring of environmental protection measures during and after commissioning of 
projects taking into account all the possible impacts.

background note on Kyoto Protocol with regard to GHG emissions and policy measures 
for controlling them. The measures suggested in this document are indicative as a detailed 
treatment of each of these is beyond the scope of this document. Detailed project specific 
measures can be prepared with the help of the MoEF Manual on norms and standards for 
environment clearance of large construction projects (to the extent relevant to highways) of 
Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), National Building Code (NBC) and Central Ground 
Water Board (CGWB). Annexes 1 to 8 present the guidelines for various actions including the 
monitoring of the EMP.
4.4	
While the standards indicated in para 4.1 above are mandatory, these Guidelines 
recommend other proactive features to be included in EMP, such as recycling of wastes, 
conservation of natural materials, less energy intensive construction and use of clean 
technology. Initiative for this has to come from the Contractors, who have the freedom to 
choose any technology in EPC (i.e Design-Build) or DBFOT type of construction. This initiative 
will be forthcoming if incentives are offered or are available to the Contractors for adopting 
the best methods and technology suited to the cause of environment. One form of incentive 
that is already available is earning carbon credit for using less polluting technology. The other 
major incentive that could be offered to the Contractors is giving preference to such bidders 
who promise the best environmental measures (along with other value delivering factors 
like time, quality and safety) in their bid. EMP should, therefore, not confine itself to meeting 
the minimum requirements alone but go beyond it. Since the present bidding system does 
not permit the contracting authorities to offer such incentive, the only way to ensure this 
is through contractual means. The bid condition should specify certain bench marks to be 
met in energy reduction/GHG emission or conservation of materials compared to standard 
methods of construction and enforce it contractually.
5  Principles of Environmental Management Plan
5.1 
Procedures Apart, the Principles on which an EMP Should be Based are Briefly 
as Under:
	
i)	
Adverse impact on environment is an externality, which needs to be 
internalized
	
	
There is a social cost to the adverse impact of projects on environment in 
terms of hazards to human health due to exposure to pollutions of various 
kinds, damage to eco system and biodiversity due to interference with the eco 
system, reduced opportunities to posterity due to faster depletion of resources, 
contribution to climate change and global warming caused by emission of 
Green House Gases during construction and operation, loss of agricultural 
output due to degradation of land and shrinking arable area, loss of livelihood 
to persons and communities due to their displacement from project sites and 
involuntary relocation elsewhere, impaired social bonding due to severance of 
communities caused by projects, etc. The society as well as individuals suffer 



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:108-2015
8
the costs of these externalities, but these are not factored in cost of projects, 
which, therefore, do not reflect their real cost. Similarly, the usage charges for 
the projects do not reflect the real price that needs to be paid for the use of the 
projects. Artificially reduced costs (and hence the price for their use) causes a 
spurt in demand for projects and multiplies the adverse impact on environment 
if the supply matches the demand. While the economists agree that these 
externalities have to be internalized in the project cost or project use charges 
a satisfactory model for this has not emerged, mainly because it is not merely 
a question of economics but also one of public policy on which Governments 
may have different views. (For example, reducing demand by increasing the 
cost or price may be counterproductive to growth). These Guidelines do not 
intend to enter into a debate on an appropriate model. Nevertheless, it is 
strongly recommended that the fact of the externalities should be recognised 
and appreciated and the cost of projects should include the cost of effective 
preventive and mitigative measures to counter the adverse impact of projects 
on environment even if that means a higher than usual cost.
	
ii)	
Construction technology should be less energy intensive to reduce GHG 
emissions
	
	
All construction would need energy. The main source of energy are the fossil 
fuels, burning of which releases GHGs causing pollution and health hazard 
in the short run and climate change and global warming in the long run as 
these gases continue to remain in the atmosphere for all time to come, keep 
on absorbing radiation from the sun and warming the atmosphere. The long 
term effect of global warming is catastrophic and may endanger the human 
existence itself. For example, melting of polar ice may submerge large areas 
of the land mass, unpredictable spells of floods and drought in unexpected 
areas may upset human habitation, and their combined effect may result in 
huge migration of population. Besides, vegetation and plants as well as natural 
habitats of animal and aquatic life may be seriously affected causing extinction 
of many plants and animal species throwing ecological balance and biodiversity 
totally out of gear. So long as fossil fuels continue to remain the main energy 
source and are not replaced by cleaner fuels (which does not appear likely 
in the foreseeable future), global warming with the attendant risks would 
continue. Even though highway construction is not the main polluter through 
GHG emission in the overall transportation sector (95% pollution is caused 
during operation), it needs to do its bit to arrest the global warming by using less 
energy-intensive technologies.
	
	
Road construction uses both natural and manufactured materials. Bulk of the 
natural material is crushed rock because of their inherent crushing strength 
and resistance to deformation by developing inter-granular friction. Rocks have 
very high embodied energy due to the nature of their formation (heat in case of 
igneous and metamorphic rocks and mechanical compression due to millions of 



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:SP:108-2015
9
years of sedimentation in case of sedimentary rocks). Breaking and crushing of 
the rocks, therefore, consumes huge energy. This energy requirement can be 
reduced by reducing the need for breaking and crushing, which is possible by:
	
(a)	
recycling the already-crushed-rock of the past which is now in disuse 
(e.g. in demolished concrete structures, in failed bituminous and concrete 
pavements, in the in-situ pavements by milling the top failed layers and 
relaying);
	
(b)	
substituting the crushed rocks with low embodied energy materials (like 
soil and low grade aggregates) after chemically treating them for achieving 
the strength and durability
	
(c)	
developing standards, specifications, design procedure and technology 
for use of wastes and alternative materials
	
	
The main manufactured materials in road construction are cement, steel and 
bitumen. The raw materials for cement and steel are in the form of rocks 
(lime stone in case of cement and hematite in case of steel). Breaking and 
pulverization of the rocky raw materials requires energy, which releases GHG. 
In addition, the manufacturing process itself releases GHG (CO2 on calcination 
of lime stone and CO2 and SO2 on reduction of Fe3O4). Thus, both cement 
and steel production processes involve emission of GHG, which needs to be 
reduced by making more efficient use of these materials: reducing their quantity 
and enhancing their performance by proper design procedure and technology 
(e.g. high strength concrete, high performance concrete, blended cement, high 
performance steel).
	
	
Bitumen is a refinery by-product, which will continue to be produced as long as 
the petrol and diesel are produced as fuels for vehicles. Another construction 
material, fly ash, is a by-product of coal-based power plants and is used in 
various ways, such as blending of cement, stabilization of soil, construction 
of embankment. There is yet another by-product, blast furnace slag, which is 
used in blending of cement. These by-products including bitumen have zero 
GHG emission potential in their production (because the emission is caused for 
production of petrol/diesel or generation of power or production of steel, which 
have to be produced any way, bitumen or fly-ash or slag being only by products 
of these production processes) and their use should be encouraged, otherwise 
their disposal would create environmental problems of gigantic proportion.
	
iii)	
Earning carbon credit by reducing GHG emissions should be targeted
	
	
GHG emission can be reduced mainly in three ways, viz., by making a choice of 
less polluting construction technology, by use of clean fuel (which are not fossil 
fuels), and by developing carbon sinks to absorb CO2. The technology options 
are discussed in Section 6 of this document. Clean energy sources are solar, 
wind, hydro, biomass and bio fuel. Any of these clean energy sources can be 
harnessed to meet at least part of the energy requirement of the project (e.g. 



======================================================================
PAGE 18 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:108-2015
10
requirement of electricity, heating, air conditioning in construction camps can 
be met from solar powered plant). Increasing the share of cleaner energy in the 
total energy mix can be achieved either by generating and using the energy 
locally or by generating and feeding the energy into the grid. Carbon sinks, which 
absorb CO2 mainly through the carbon sequestration process (i.e the growing 
vegetation taking CO2 under sun light from the atmosphere and releasing O2 as 
a result of photo synthesis) can be created by growing plantation on degraded 
land within the project influence area. There are various carbon calculators 
available, which can calculate emissions under different types and conditions 
of energy use. Difference of GHG emission between ‘doing business as usual’ 
and ‘with emission control measures’ would lead to entitlement of carbon credit. 
The credit can be claimed and earned on certification of any international 
Carbon Emission Regulator. The credits earned can be internationally traded. 
The potential buyers are those entities, especially in the developed countries, 
which cannot meet their international obligations on emission control for various 
reasons (e.g. no scope for innovation and change from ‘business as usual’ 
operation for legacy reasons, or technical innovations to bring down emission 
levels are too expensive). India at present has no international obligations under 
Kyoto Protocol (ref Appendix II) to reduce the emission level, but has great 
potential for innovation and change and hence for earning carbon credits. The 
contractors and concessionaires who bring these innovations and earn carbon 
credits can, to a great extent, get compensated for their efforts in this regard.
	
iv)	
No indiscriminate exploitation of natural resources
	
	
While rocks have taken millions of years to form and once extracted cannot 
be replenished, some natural materials used in construction, such as sand 
and water, are continuously formed in nature and are replenished: sand as 
sediments carried by rivers due to erosion of hills, banks and beds; water in 
the form of water cycle of precipitation, infiltration, transpiration, run off and 
evaporation. Ideally, the rate of exploitation of such materials should not exceed 
the rate at which they form in nature. This does not always happen because 
these resources are contaminated and rendered useless for construction as 
soon as they are formed in nature (e.g. contamination of surface water and 
sand by pollutants discharged into the rivers). The advantage of natural 
replenishment of these resources thus disappears, and one turns to legacy 
resources formed in the past as a result of cleaner processes (e.g. deeper 
sand deposits, clean ground water formed centuries ago when pollutants were 
non-existent). Indiscriminate exploitation of the cleaner resources can cause 
their depletion at an alarmingly fast rate and pose serious problem to human 
existence. For example, sand beds of rivers hold the surface water and act as 
natural filter for recharge of ground water below river bed permitting clean water 
to enter the ground water aquifer. Thicker the sand bed cleaner and larger is 
the recharge. Construction requires clean sand and water, which are hard to 



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:SP:108-2015
11
get on the top surface of river beds because of pollutants getting their way 
into the rivers, forcing one to go subsurface (to extract sand) and underground 
(to draw clean water). Denuding the river beds, formed by hundreds of years 
of deposition, by deeper dredging does just the opposite of what is required 
for recharging the ground water aquifers. Besides, drawing underground water 
(because polluted surface water is not fit for use) depletes the ground water 
aquifer and lowers the water table. Thus, while the use of the new resources 
formed by natural processes is inhibited by man-made processes (discharging 
pollutants in the river), the legacy resources are exploited indiscriminately.
	
v)	
Disposal of debris and wastes should not pollute land, air and water
	
	
Road construction generates construction debris right from the stage of site 
clearance which requires removal of vegetation along with scraped ground 
surface and generates debris to be safely disposed. Other forms of debris may 
be dismantled structures (stone, concrete, steel, bricks, bituminous materials, 
aggregates), surpluses from cutting (soil, gravel, rock), unsuitable materials 
requiring removal from site (domestic wastes, plastics, biodegradable materials), 
spillage of oil, bitumen, cement slurry from concrete batching plants and hot 
mix plants, non-conforming or rejected concrete or bituminous mixes, other 
solid wastes like kitchen wastes, paper, plastic and metallic containers/packing 
materials, machinery or its parts including vehicle tyres, etc. Most of the debris 
is likely to be inert debris and can be dumped at suitable land fill sites. However, 
it is desirable that the debris be segregated, useful materials (e.g. stone, rock, 
aggregates, plastics, rubber) recycled and the residue dumped at designated 
sites. Usefulness of these materials does not lie in the price it can fetch, but the 
value these can generate by protecting the environment.
	
	
In no circumstances, debris in any form should be allowed to be dumped 
anywhere except the designated places and left uncovered as it can degrade 
the land, obstruct the channels and water courses, present unsightly landscape 
and increase dust pollution. The dump sites should be covered with suitable 
local vegetation.
	
	
Effluent generated from sewerage system (from construction camps) and plant 
operations should be tested before discharging into water courses. Where use 
of certain chemicals (e.g. chemical stabilization, curing compounds, bitumen 
modifiers, other chemical additives, etc.)is a part of construction process, the 
leachability of the constituents of these chemicals and potential contamination 
of land and ground water must be ascertained.
	
vi)	
Landscape should be improved rather than defaced
	
	
Construction activity should not deface the landscape or leave it scarred, which is 
the most likely situation in the absence of suitable intervention on borrow areas, 
quarry sites, cut slopes, debris dump locations, construction camp locations 
(especially after demobilization), and in general, along the construction sites. 



======================================================================
PAGE 20 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:108-2015
12
The project should aim at improving the surrounding landscape and attempt 
landscaping even those areas not directly part of the project but which present 
an unsightly landscape while travelling on the project highway. With proper 
intervention value can be added to the land surface and quarry ditches, e.g., by 
converting them into water storage areas or picnic spots or other recreational 
spot. The quarrying from hill slopes should be done in slopes consistent with 
the natural slopes of the hill and the same species as existing should be planted 
so that over time the cut slopes merge with the original landscape. Exposed cut 
faces of slope in the roadway should be planted with tufts of grass or creepers or 
any other suitable plant species. Camp sites should be planted with vegetation 
and nursed during the project duration so that vegetation survives on its own 
after demobilization. Borrow areas should be restored and vegetated. Value 
can be added by developing some community facility like water tank or fish 
ponds or some other facility useful to the local community.
	
vii)	 Recycling of wastes in general for use in construction for helping the 
larger cause of environment
	
	
The perspective of management of environment should not remain confined 
only to the project specific damages and mitigation measures. A larger view 
should be taken by asking the question how the project in question can help 
achieve the greater and global environmental goals. One of the serious global 
environmental problems is disposal of some of the industrial non-biodegradable 
wastes. Satisfactory disposal of these wastes is not possible through any of the 
conventional processes (e.g. dumping in land fill, incineration, discharge into 
rivers), which adversely impact the environment. Apart from fly ash and blast 
furnace slag (already discussed above, though not as waste but as industrial 
by-product, the problems of disposal remaining grave notwithstanding the 
difference), two more waste products generated in an industrial society are 
plastic and used rubber tyres of vehicles, which keep on piling up in the absence 
of satisfactory disposal methods. Incidentally, both these products have great 
potential for being used in road construction and this potential needs to be 
exploited. There are technologies and standards available for their use and 
discussed in Section 6 below.
	
viii)	 Communities should not suffer construction
	
	
Communities living close to the project highway are the worst sufferers of the 
adverse impact of environment in terms of noise and dust pollution, increased 
emissions, restrictions on access to their properties or work place, delays 
in travel time, community severance, visual intrusion caused by unsightly 
construction sites and high banks or structures in their backyard, etc. One of 
the most important principles on which an EMP should be based is to have 
community focus to environment problems. Measures to control dust (e.g by 
removing construction debris immediately when generated, mulching the areas 
around construction, water sprinkling to help the dust settle), noise (e.g. by 



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:SP:108-2015
13
attenuation measures like noise screens or barriers) and visual intrusion (e.g by 
blocking the construction site views by barriers and screens) should invariably 
be the part of EMP. Alternative access to properties or community facilities 
necessitated due to construction should be as good as the existing access, 
if not better, and that should also apply to situations where communities are 
severed due to construction.
6  Choice of Technology
6.1	
Choice of technology would depend upon (a) evaluation of the relative merits of 
the alternative technologies on certain objective criteria, (b) availability of design standards 
and procedures and (c) availability of equipment and technology vendors. Indian Roads 
Congress (IRC) has published a number of Guidelines for use of alternative materials and 
technology, which are more environment friendly, and is in the process of finalizing some 
more in a very near future. The main methods, technologies and measures, which can help 
introduce cleaner less polluting construction, use recycled wastes and minimize drawing of 
natural resources from the environment, are briefly discussed below.
i)	
Substitution of crushed rock by stabilized low grade aggregates and soil
	
The Guidelines for Design of Flexible Pavement IRC:37 have been modified 
in 2012 and the revised Guidelines now permit stabilized low grade aggregates and 
soils in substitution of the crushed rock. The Guidelines also provide the modified 
design procedures and material standards. The new design procedure is based on 
the mechanistic empirical design, which relies on the stresses and strains developed 
in various pavement layers and the strength of these layers in terms of elastic 
moduli and durability. The earlier design procedure was based on the strength of the 
pavement layers generated by inter-granular friction, which made the use of crushed 
rocks mandatory.
ii)	
Economy in cement and steel consumption by producing high strength 
concrete and modified design procedures
	
IRC has revised its concrete code in 2012, which is based on the ‘limit state design’ 
concept as opposed to the ‘working stress design’ principles in the earlier version. 
The code permits design and production of very high strength concrete approaching 
almost 100 MPa, nearly twice as much as that permitted under the previous versions. 
This brings economy in consumption of cement and steel, two of the most polluting 
manufactured construction materials.
iii) 
Use of fly ash in construction
	
There are several IRC Guidelines on the use of fly ash, the polluting waste of thermal 
power plants. These can be used in embankment construction (replacing soil), as a 
stabilizing material in combination with lime to give strength to soil and low grade 
materials (replacing crushed stone), as a blending agent with cement (replacing 
cement).



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:108-2015
14
iv)	
Use of warm mix asphalt technology
	
Most bituminous mixes are produced at a very high temperature (nearly 160ºC), 
mainly because bitumen is very viscous at low temperatures and cannot coat the 
aggregates unless heated to high temperatures. There are technologies available, 
which can facilitate the coating at low temperatures by increasing the surface area 
of bitumen (foaming) or by reducing the surface tension at the aggregate bitumen 
interface with use of certain additives, thereby making the mixing possible at much 
lower temperature (typically 110ºC), saving energy and releasing less pollutants in 
the atmosphere. IRC has recently published Guidelines on the subject.
v)	
Use of waste plastic in bituminous construction
	
IRC has also recently published a set of Guidelines on the use of waste plastic, which 
does not provide any dramatic functional advantages to the bituminous mix but has 
great compatibility with bituminous mixes. The only aim is the safe disposal of these 
non-biodegradable wastes polluting the environment. Cleaned and shredded plastic 
pieces are fed into the plant after the aggregates are heated. The plastic in contact 
with hot aggregates melts, coats the aggregates and mixes with bitumen.
vi)	
Recycling of bituminous pavement
	
The failed and damaged bituminous pavements have valuable aggregates 
and bitumen in them. It is desirable to extract value out of the waste 
bituminous pavements by reclaiming and recycling these materials and using them 
in construction instead of dumping it in landfills, which will use up scarce land 
resources and contaminate the soil. Use of such materials in a construction layer 
has been permitted in the revised Pavement Design Guidelines (IRC:37-2012). 
Detailed Guidelines on the practice of Recycling technologies are at present being 
developed by IRC. These technologies essentially involve reclaiming the damaged or 
unserviceable pavement materials by milling, mixing fresh materials with reclaimed 
materials, and producing mixes that can be laid on the road. The mixing process can 
be either in-situ or in plant.
vii)	
Gap-graded bituminous mixes using crumb rubber
	
The technology involves converting the used and discarded rubber tyres of vehicles 
into crumbs and mixing them with aggregate and bitumen to produce a strong and 
durable mix. The grading (or packing of various sizes of aggregates) is not close but 
leaves gaps to accommodate the crumbs in the mix, which after absorbing oil in the 
bitumen expand and make the mix dense, durable and more flexible. IRC is in the 
process of developing standards and guidelines on this technology, the twin aims 
of which are to improve the pavement design as well as utilize the rubber waste in 
construction rather than disposing it into landfills and use land resources for disposal 
of waste or by disposing it by the crude method of burning, which is highly polluting. 
The technologies available for waste tyre disposal (e.g. pyrolysis) are at present too 
expensive. Use of these wastes in bituminous construction is extremely environment


IRC:SP:108-2015
15
friendly and makes economic sense as well (because of higher performance, 
durability and less maintenance needs).
7  Criteria for evaluation of relative merits of  
alternative technologies
7.1	
These Guidelines recommend two criteria for evaluation of the relative merits of the 
alternative technologies from the point of view of environment; (a) the GHG emission potential 
of the technology assuming functional merits of each of the technologies permitted in IRC 
Guidelines is considered acceptable, and (b) the environment friendliness of the technology 
assuming GHG potential of the alternatives are of the same order.
7.2	
GHG emission potential directly depends upon the energy intensity of the technologies 
based on a fair assumption that the energy requirement is presently met predominantly by 
burning fossil fuels and that the proportion of clean energy in the total energy is rather small. 
It is recognized that comprehensive and reliable energy consumption data may not be readily 
available. There are standard carbon calculators, which can predict GHG emission potential 
in various construction technologies. Besides, such data can be generated by energy audit 
of the completed projects also. The aim should be to calculate the emissions in the ‘business 
as usual’ case as well as in the alternative cleaner technology option. The extent of decrease 
in GHG emission would give an idea how clean and less polluting the alternative technology 
would be. A clean technology should be one of the important criteria for choice of a construction 
technology.
7.3	
The GHG emission criteria suggested above excludes from its purview the other 
benefitting factors of a technology (e.g. reduction of wastes in the environment) and puts 
all technologies, which consume more or less the same amount of energy on par while 
disregarding the environment friendliness of a particular technology compared to the others. 
In such cases, the qualitative assessment of environment friendliness of the technologies 
having similar energy intensity should decide the preferred option. For example, a technology 
that uses wastes after processing should be preferred to one that does not, even if the energy 
intensity (and hence polluting potential) is of similar level in both cases.
8  ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PROGRAMME
The Environmental Monitoring Programme has been detailed out in Annex-8. Successful 
implementation of the Environmental Monitoring Program is contingent on the following:
●	
All the initial tests for monitoring ambient environmental parameters should be carried 
out in the early stages of the project life cycle, to establish ‘base data’ prior to impacts 
from the construction activities.
●	
A schedule of subsequent periodic tests to be carried out is prepared and adhered to.
●	
All the environmental monitoring tests and analysis of results are carried out.



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:108-2015
16
●	
Where indicated by test results, and any other relevant on-site conditions, appropriate 
steps are taken to:
	
-	
Modify the testing schedule (dates, frequency)
	
-	
Modify (add to or delete) testing locations
	
-	
Verify testing results with additional testing as or if required
	
-	
Recalibrate the testing equipment as necessary
	
-	
Withdraw from site, modify or defer the deployment of specific construction 
equipment, processes, etc., as necessary, which significantly contribute to the 
monitoring readings being in excess of the permissible or safe levels.
9  Responsibilities and accountabilities
9.1	
There is no denying the fact that the ultimate responsibility and accountability for 
environmental safeguards rests with the Project Proponent, which is usually the Project 
Authority. The Project Authority seeks various approvals like EC, EIA and EMP from the 
MoEF and monitors and evaluates the implementation of the safeguard measures. Without 
in any way diluting the responsibility of the Project Authority these Guidelines propose certain 
changes in the implementation mechanism with a view to bringing in fairness, competition 
and effectiveness in implementation of the environmental safeguard measures. Project 
Authorities can themselves bring about these changes where Environment Clearance is not 
a mandatory requirement and bring them in consultation with MoEF where such clearance 
is mandatory. These changes and the rationale for them are discussed in the succeeding 
paragraphs.
9.2	
As brought out in Section 3 of this document, the specifics of the EMP (where, what 
and the extent) are not known at the bidding stage, and therefore, the EMP can only be 
generic and not specific at that stage. The perceptions and interpretation of the contractor and 
the Project Authorities are, therefore, different with regard to the responsibility of undertaking 
the measures and cost involved therein. The difference in perception after award of contract 
would result in either contractual disputes or compromising the requirements. This can be 
avoided by:
a)	
Bringing about changes in the procurement system, which requires the bidders to 
submit with their bids (i) an EMP suggesting the specific measures they would take in 
specific situations envisaged in EIA clearance (which after award of contract would be 
modified by him to include specific locations, quantities, areas as well) in accordance 
with the generic EMP submitted with EIA, and (ii) the specific technologies that 
would be used by him, which would be evaluated objectively from GHG potential and 
environment friendliness criteria with reference to the bench mark technology (the 
‘business as usual case’) and that the one with better technology would be offered 
some preference in award.



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 92
======================================================================

IRC:SP:108-2015
17
b)	
Rejecting the bid in Technical Evaluation (or evaluating him poorly in comparison with 
other bidders) if the EMP proposal is not satisfactory, thereby making the contractors 
submit serious proposal after due diligence on costs as well as committing the 
implementation of the specific measures.
c)	
Enforcing the implementation of the specific commitments in the EMP contractually 
by the Project Authorities
9.3	
The need for preparation of EMP by the contractor is also consistent with the design-
build or design-build-finance-operate models of contracting where the contractors are offered 
choice of design and technologies. Accordingly, it is the contractor who would be in the best 
position to prepare and implement the EMP depending upon his technology and material 
choice. There should, therefore, be an understanding of and commitment to the EMP by the 
contractor as relevant to his way of working. He should submit an outline of EMP (at the time 
of bidding) and the detailed EMP (post award) and implement it. The implementation should 
be monitored by the Project Authorities. In short, the following should be the delineation of 
responsibilities:
EIA: The Project Authorities
EMP:
i)	
At the stage of environmental clearance: Project Authority
ii)	
At the stage of bidding: The bidder
iii)	
At the stage of execution: The contractor
iv)	
At the stage of implementation: The Contractor
Monitoring of EMP: The Project Authority.
9.4	
An EMP framed in accordance with these Guidelines, costed, committed and 
implemented by the bidder/contractor and monitored by the Project Authorities has a much 
better chance of delivering on environmental safeguards than one in which there is ambiguity 
with regard to the scope, the roles and responsibilities, and which can be interpreted in more 
than one way.

Appendix-II
Background Note on Carbon Footprint
There is a near unanimity among the scientific community that global warming is for the real. 
The evidence of it can be found in the rising air and ocean temperatures and reducing ice caps in 
the arctic regions, which are being monitored by some of the world’s most reputed institutions, 
e. g. National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) of the USA, Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC). If there is some debate on global warming and its impact, it is 
about the extent of this impact rather than its existence. Some discordant voices dub some 
of the global warming predictions as alarmist, but even they do not deny that the temperature 
of the earth’s surface is rising and this can have serious impact on the ecosystem and the 
human existence. There is unanimity on the causes of global warming as well. It is due to 
existence of greenhouse gases (GHG) and aerosols in the earth’s atmosphere, which trap 
the heat radiating back from the earth’s surface warmed by sun’s radiation.
Greenhouse gases remain permanently in the atmosphere unlike water vapour, which gets 
recycled in the form of precipitation and eventually finds its way to the ocean. As a result, 
the blanket of GHG goes on becoming thicker and thicker causing more and more warming 
over time. Reference years for global warming have been accepted as 1750, i.e., the pre 
industrialization era; 1990, when the first major efforts on climate change were initiated; and, 
2000, the beginning of the new millennium. In the pre-industrialized era, the global average 
temperature is reported as 15ºC and the CO2 concentration as 280 parts per million (ppm). 
In the last 100 years, the global temperatures rose by 0.85ºC and the rate of rise as 0.2º per 
decade. The concentration of CO2 increased to 379 ppm by 2005. By the turn of century, the 
best estimate of temperature rise varies from 1.8ºC to 4ºC, with upper range being 6.5ºC. 
The level of CO2 emission by the turn of the century is likely to be 882 ppm. This is going 
to have far reaching consequences on the climate, causing melting of ice caps in the arctic 
and glaciers, rise in sea levels, more frequent heat waves, floods, droughts and threat to 
extinction of species.
The possible response to the global warming can be either to live with it (adaptation) or to 
reduce the emissions (mitigation). In either case, or in a combined adaptation-mitigation 
strategy expensive measures have to be taken. For example in adaptation strategy, flood 
protection infrastructure has to be created, resettlement of people affected by flood has to be 
provided for, system of conservation of water in drought prone areas have to be created. In 
mitigation strategy, the emission levels have to be reduced through expensive technological 
upgradation of industry, which may cause national GDPs to reduce. In other words, financing 
of these measures is a major issue. Besides, climate change being a global problem countries 
have to join hands, negotiate and commit themselves to an agreed reduction target and 
cooperate in the monitoring of the measures taken.
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
UNFCC is the first major international effort in restricting Global warming. In the First World 
Climate Conference held in 1979, the problem came into focus but no concrete progress was 
made until 1988 when an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was set up jointly 
by World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and United Nations Environment Programme 



======================================================================

(UNEP). IPCC’s first assessment report and the Second World Climate Conference held in 
1990 called for a global treaty on climate change. Following up on this, an Intergovernmental 
Negotiating Team (INC) was set up. INC after negotiations adopted the treaty known as United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at the UN Headquarters, 
New York on 9th May 1992. The Treaty was kept open for signature at the Earth Summit held 
in the same year in Rio de Jeneiro and thereafter at the UN headquarters. By June 1993, 165 
countries including India had signed the Convention, which came into force on 21st March 
1994, after 90 days of ratification of the Convention by the fiftieth Country. India signed the 
Convention on 10th June 1992 and ratified it on 1st November 1993. At present, 195 countries 
are party to this Convention (Annex I Parties to UNFCCC). The Parties hold Conferences at 
regular intervals called Conference of Parties (COP) to further negotiate the issues relating 
to climate change.
The objective of the Convention is defined in its Article 2, which is extracted below:
Quote:
The ultimate objective of this Convention and any related legal instruments that the Conference 
of the Parties may adopt is to achieve, in accordance with the relevant provision of this 
Convention, stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level 
that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Such a 
level should be achieved within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystem to adapt naturally 
to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to allow economic 
development to proceed in a sustainable manner.”
Unquote
Accordingly, the Convention sets an overall framework for intergovernmental efforts to tackle 
the challenges posed by climate change while recognizing the climate system as a shared 
resource whose stability can be affected by industrial and other anthropogenic (i.e. caused 
by humans as opposed to natural causes like solar, volcanic, etc) emissions of carbon 
dioxide (CO2) and other green house gases (GHG). Under the Convention Governments 
have to share information on GHG emissions and national policies thereon, launch strategies 
for addressing GHG emissions and adaptation to the expected impacts, and cooperate in 
preparing for adaptation to these impacts. It needs to be appreciated that climate change 
is a complex problem, which does not remain confined to environment alone but also has 
consequences on global issues like poverty alleviation, economic development, population 
growth, sustainable development and resource management.
Kyoto Protocol (first commitment period 2008-12)
In the third Conference of Parties (COP3) at Kyoto in December 1997, the well-known 
Kyoto Protocol (KP) was adopted. It came into force only in February 2005 after ratification 
by the Parties. Kyoto Protocol is what operationalizes the UNFCCC. With the objective of 
restricting the global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrialized era, KP set 
legally binding emission reduction targets to 37 industrialized countries for reduction in GHG 
emission between 2008 and 2012 (called the first commitment period), which in overall terms 
meant a 5 percent reduction in the emission level compared to that prevailing in 1990. The 



======================================================================
PAGE 54 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:108-2015
46
countries which agreed to the targets are Australia, all members of European Union, Belarus, 
Croatia, Iceland, Kazakhstan, Norway, Switzerland and Ukraine.
Doha Amendments to Kyoto Protocol (second commitment period 2013-20)
In Doha Amendment of 2012 to KP further reduction in targets for the second commitment 
period (2013- 2020) has been adopted to bring the emission level down by 20 percent of the 
1990 level. Some countries such as Japan, Soviet Union and Russia, who participated in the 
first round of KP have not accepted the second round targets. United States of America did 
not ratify the KP and hence is not a party to KP. Canada, who earlier ratified the KP, withdrew 
from the Protocol in 2011. While the industrialized countries including economies in transition 
(referred to as Annex I parties to KP) have legally binding emission targets, the developing 
countries (referred to as non-Annex I parties) have no binding targets but are committed 
under the treaty to reduce their emission levels. This is a sore point with some industrialized 
countries. The developing world, on the other hand, feels that the industrialized nations have 
contributed most to the global warming and hence more stringent measures are required 
from them.
Kyoto Protocol Mechanism
KP devises three mechanisms for emission reduction and targets all parties to the treaty 
irrespective of their development status, viz. the industrialized countries including economies 
in transition, the developing countries and the least developed countries. Collectively, the 
mechanisms are aptly called ‘flexible mechanism’. The three mechanisms are International 
Emission Trading (IET), Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI).
The underlying principle in KP mechanism is that emission of GHG, irrespective of the part 
of the globe it originates from, only contributes to global warming and has to be reduced. 
Secondly, the emission of GHG is the undesirable consequence of development affecting the 
global community at large, and hence is an ‘externality’ in terms of economics. The ‘externality’ 
has to be ‘internalized’ by putting a cost to it to arrive at the true price of goods and services 
produced and consumed in a perfect global market. Thirdly, the cost of marginal reduction in 
GHG emission (i.e. reduction of 1 tonne of GHG emission from the present level) will vary in 
different countries. Some industrialized countries can do it in a more cost effective way than 
the others, exceed their protocol commitments and thereby generate an emission reduction 
surplus. This surplus can be traded with other industrialized countries which miss their targets 
for whatever reasons (IET mechanism). Fourthly, even though no emission reduction target 
is set for the developing countries, their emission levels are bound to rise with time while 
meeting their development needs. At their present stage of development, they can leap-frog 
to cleaner technologies, either on their own or in collaboration with industrialized nations, 
and thereby reduce their emissions relative to what would have been in the ‘business as 
usual’ situation. This reduction certified by a regulator, Certified Emission Reduction (CER), 
can be traded with countries struggling to meet their emission reduction commitments (CDM 
mechanism). Lastly, the industrialized countries can shift their production bases to developing 
countries or the LDCs with cleaner technologies, earn credits for reduced emissions and 
thereby meet their commitments while, at the same time, helping economic development of 
developing countries and LDCs (JI mechanism).

Annex-2
Guidelines for Rehabilitation of Dumpsites, Quarries and Borrow Areas
Dumpsites
The dumpsites filled rehabilitated by planting local species of shrubs and other plants so that 
the landscape is coherent only up to the ground level shall be rehabilitated as per guidelines 
below:
●	
The dump sites have to be selected suitably and should be is in harmony with the 
surrounding environment and landscape.
●	
Dump site is near to human settlements shall be restored in a manner useful to 
the community, e.g. converting it into a play field by spreading the dump material 
evenly on the ground and covering it with top soil, planting trees and shrubs along its 
periphery.
●	
Some of the dumpsites could be used either for plantation or for growing agricultural 
produce.
●	
Care should always be taken to maintain the hydrological flow in the area.
Quarries and Borrow Areas
●	
The borrow pit sites shall be restored to a safe and secure area usable to the public 
enabling safe access and entry to the restored site by filling the quarry/borrow pit 
floor to approximately the access road level.
●	
It is important to plan restoration from the outset and coordinate restoration with 
quarrying activities. Quarry rehabilitation objective should include creation of wetlands 
and natural reserves or recreation areas.
●	
Special quarry/borrow pit rehabilitation plan should be specified according to the 
location and shaping of the mining slopes after exploitation and overburdened dump, 
with different subsequent uses e.g. forest, meadow, water body and replanting 
methods.
Other criteria which should be followed for rehabilitation of quarry/borrow pits are as given 
below:
●	
Quarries and borrow pits shall be backfilled with rejected construction wastes and 
shall be given a vegetative cover. If this is not possible, then slopes shall be smoothed 
and depression shall be filled in such a way that it looks more or less like the original 
ground surface.
●	
Ensuringe preservation of trees during piling of materials; spreading of stripping 
material to facilitate water percolation and allow natural vegetation growth; 
reestablishment of previous natural drainage flows; improvement of site appearance; 
digging of ditches to collect runoff; and maintenance of roadways where a pit or quarry

is declared useable water source for livestock or people nearby shall be important 
considerations during construction. 
●	
The requirements in terms of “The Mines and Quarries Act” with regard to maintaining 
a naturally stable slope, adequate fencing to prevent access to the quarry area 
including top and bottom of the faces, etc shall be fulfilled.
●	
Depending on the location of the site its potential to be converted into a permanent 
lake must be exploited
●	
Choice of plant species for the planting programme shall be made in consultation 
with ecological consultant and local forest department. Depending on the limitations 
on the availability of appropriate plant material, harsh growing conditions (lack of 
irrigation and hot summer) and ongoing quarry rehabilitation operations there 
may be substantial loss of plantation and the planting programme may have to be 
continued for over 3-5 years. As plantings are progressively established they should 
be monitored before undertaking the next stage to ensure maximum plant survival 
rates.
●	
The quarry or borrow pit immediate surroundings should be developed as a low 
maintenance reserve, with significant areas of native trees and shrubs and areas of 
longer grass and tussocks forming the open spaces. Walkways around the borrow 
site may be constructed. Provision for a future drive-in picnic area and car parking 
area may be developed.

Annex-4
Guidelines for Siting, Operation, and Re-development of Borrow Areas  
(Earth and Gravel)
Siting
Specific locations of borrow areas to be used shall be identified in accordance with EIA 
report. The selection borrow areas site shall be based on environmental considerations apart 
from civil engineering considerations. Environment considerations dictate that:
●	
The borrow areas are located away from human habitation (not within 
800 m from the village boundary) to avoid breeding of mosquitos and other organisms 
during monsoon when the borrow areas are flooded.
●	
These should be generally on degraded land unsuitable for any productive purpose. 
Government or community land should be preferred to private land. Productive 
agricultural land should not, as far as possible, be used for borrowing earth, and 
where it is used, the productive top soil must be stored and reused.
●	
These should not, as far as possible, obstruct the natural drainage of the ground and 
bunds and/or boundary drains should be created on their periphery to restore the 
flow of natural run off.
●	
Community consultation is desirable before drawing materials from the borrow 
areas and the community needs (e.g deepening of ponds, levelling of high grounds, 
requirements of water storage tanks, development of fish ponds, etc.) should be 
taken into account before finalizing the borrow area sites.
●	
These should not be located too close to the toe of any embankment (natural or man-
made), which could trigger land slide or slip. As a general rule, it should be away from 
the toe by a distance equal to four times the embankment height plus 5 m.
●	
Borrow areas should not be selected near sensitive locations such as banks or beds 
of rivers or channels, which can adversely affect the river hydrology and hydraulics, 
or along the road or rail embankment, which, apart from threatening the embankment 
may enhance the severity of accidents if these happen, or close to public structures 
such as transmission towers whose foundation can be endangered.
●	
Borrow area sites must be authorised sites. If located on private land, there should 
be written consent of the owner a lease agreement permitting the use of the land for 
borrowing earth. If located on Government or community, land the permission should 
be of the appropriate authority.
Borrow Area Operations
●	
Excavation in the borrow areas should be planned keeping in view the end use of 
the borrow area land. The shape and dimensions of the area to be excavated from 



======================================================================
PAGE 63 of 92
======================================================================

IRC:SP:108-2015
55
(length, breadth and depth) should be accordingly decided. Generally the depth of 
excavation should not be deeper than 2 m from the consideration of safety of the 
humans or animals against accidental fall into the ditch.
●	
The eventual slope of the excavation should be 2 (H):1(V) from the consideration of 
safety of the slopes as well as humans.
●	
There should be safe access to the earth moving equipment and transport vehicles 
into the borrow areas
●	
The approach to the borrow areas from the public or private haul roads should have 
a reasonable design to withstand the movement of transport vehicles. 
●	
Dust palliation measures should be taken to minimise dust pollution on the approach 
roads (e.g. watering, spraying of lime or cement slurry or bitumen emulsion, etc)
●	
Spillage of materials under transit on to the haul roads or main roads through gaps in 
the transport vehicles should be guarded against buy plugging such gaps. Similarly, 
wind blowing of the materials in transit should be checked by suitable covers.
●	
Where productive agricultural land is used for borrow areas, the top soil in 
150 mm thickness should be scrapped, stock piled and re-used for rehabilitation of 
borrow areas. At least 10% of the temporary land should be earmarked for stockpiling. 
The top soil should be seeded and mulched to cover the slopes, or any degraded 
area in thickness between 75-150 mm.
Borrow Area Rehabilitation Plan
The borrow area must be rehabilitated after completion of the work and rehabilitation plan should 
be prepared in advance in consultation with the community. Some indicative rehabilitation 
measures could be community water storage facility, pisciculture ponds, recreational spots, 
landscape enhancement, or rehabilitation by re-vegetation of the borrow area. Where 
re-vegetation is done, it should be ensured that:
●	
Vegetative cover is established on all affected land.
●	
Topsoil is placed, seeded, and mulched within 30 days of final grading if it is 
within a current growing season or within 30 days of the start of the next growing 
season.
●	
Vegetative material to be used are grasses, legumes, herbaceous, or woody plants 
or a mixture thereof.
●	
Plant material must be planted during the first growing season following the 
reclamation phase.



======================================================================
PAGE 64 of 92
======================================================================
IRC:SP:108-2015
56
●	
Selection and use of vegetative cover should take into account soil and site 
characteristics such as drainage, pH, nutrient availability, and climate to ensure 
permanent growth.
●	
The vegetative cover is acceptable if within one growing season of seeding:
●	
The planting of trees and shrubs results in a permanent stand, or regeneration and 
succession rate, sufficient to assure a 75% survival rate;
●	
The planting results in 90% ground coverage.
●	
The site should be inspected when the planting is completed and again at one year 
to ensure compliance with the reclamation plan.

Annex-5
Guidelines for Sediment Control
Right at the initial stage of the work, the operations such as clearing and grubbing, roadway 
and drainage excavation, embankment/sub-grade construction, bridges and other structures 
across water courses, pavement courses and shoulders are undertaken. These activities 
generate huge wastes and debris, which should not find their way into drainage channels 
and water courses nor should remain exposed to wind at the site and allowed to erode and 
contaminate productive soils or generate wind blown dust particles in the atmosphere.
Erosion and sediment control measures shall, therefore, be planned to prevent soil erosion 
and sedimentation. These measures may involve temporary measures at construction 
stage, such as construction of temporary berms, dikes, sediment basins, slope drains, use 
of temporary mulches, fabrics, mats, seeding, or other control devices. Permanent erosion 
control measures aim at preventing erosion during the project life cycle and should be planned 
as a part of the project design. These may involve turfing or pitching the embankment slopes, 
turfing/mulching/vegetating the exposed areas, vegetating or reinforcing the cut slopes by 
appropriate methods such as shot-creting, rock bolting, soil-nailing, gabions, etc.
Sediment control, whether temporary or permanent, would be mostly project and site specific. 
However, some of the generic measures shall be as follows:
●	
Debris generated at construction site must be removed immediately and dumped 
at the designated dump sites after useful recyclable materials are sorted out, and 
properly stocked or stacked.
●	
The site cleared after removal of debris would usually be prone to erosion. These 
areas should be treated by mulching and other dust palliation measures.
●	
There could be many mulching options such as seeding top soil and spreading the 
mulch (organic) to permit growth of grass, or other methods like mulches of tiles, 
brick bats, stone chips, or any other non-erodible wastes, which cover the exposed 
soil, allow moisture to be retained within soil and prevent erosion.
●	
Dust palliation measures by any suitable commercially available dust palliatives, 
application of water, cement, lime or bitumen emulsion in thin application to bind the 
dust particles together
●	
Drains, channels, water courses blocked by debris must be dredged and the dredged 
materials dumped at the designated dump sites.
●	
All slush at construction sites, which after drying up become erodible must be either 
dredged and removed or treated appropriately in-situ (say by mulching)
●	
Temporary drains combined with sedimentation tanks should be created at the 
periphery or edge of the work sites to arrest the sediments brought by rains or 
construction activities requiring water (e.g curing of concrete) and discharge only 
sediment free water into the water courses.

Annex-6
Guidelines for Siting and layout of Construction Camp
Siting
The following guidelines shall be followed while siting the construction camps:
●	
The construction camps shall be located at least 500 m away from habitations. 
The living accommodation and ancillary facilities for labour shall be erected and 
maintained to approved standards and scales.
●	
Non-agricultural land should be used , as far as possible
●	
Not within 1000 m of either side of locations of Forest areas.
●	
All sites used for camps must be adequately drained. They must not be subject to 
periodic flooding, nor located within 300 feet of pools, sink holes or other surface 
collections of water unless such water surface can be subjected to mosquito control 
measures.
●	
The camps must be located such that the drainage from and through the camps shall 
not endanger any domestic or public water supply.
●	
All sites must be graded, ditched and rendered free from depressions such that 
water may get stagnant and become a nuisance.
Layout
A conceptual layout of a typical construction site has been presented in Fig. A. The Contractor 
during the progress of work shall provide, erect and maintain necessary (temporary) living 
accommodation and ancillary facilities for labour to standards and scales approved by the 
engineer. All temporary accommodation must be constructed and maintained in such a fashion 
that uncontaminated water is available for drinking, cooking and washing. Safe drinking water 
should be provided to the dwellers of the construction camps. Adequate washing and bathing 
places shall be provided, and kept in clean and drained condition. Construction camps are 
to be sited away from vulnerable people and adequate health care is to be provided for the 
work force.
Sanitation facilities: Construction camps shall be provided sanitary latrines and urinals. 
Sewerage drains should be provided for the flow of used water outside the camp. Drains and 
ditches should be treated with bleaching powder on a regular basis. The sewage system for 
the camp must be properly designed, built and operated so that no health hazard occurs and 
no pollution to the air, ground or adjacent watercourses takes place. Compliance with the 
relevant legislation must be strictly adhered to. Garbage bins must be provided in the camp 
and regularly emptied and the garbage disposed of in a hygienic manner
Shelter at workplace: At every workplace, there shall be provided free of cost, four suitable 
shelters, two for meals and two others for rest, separately for use of men and women 
labourers. The height of shelter shall not be less than 3 m from floor level to lowest part of

the roof. Sheds shall be kept clean and the space provided shall be on the basis of at least 
0.5 m2 per head.
Canteen facilities: A cooked food canteen on a reasonable scale shall be provided for 
the benefit of workers wherever it is considered necessary and should generally conform 
to sanitary requirements of local medical, health and municipal authorities including such 
precautionary measures as necessary to prevent soil pollution of the site.
First aid facilities: At every workplace, a readily available first-aid unit including an adequate 
supply of sterilized dressing materials and appliances shall be provided as per the factory 
rules. Workplaces remote and far away from regular hospitals shall have indoor health units 
with one bed for every 250 workers. Suitable transport shall be provided to facilitate taking 
injured and ill persons to the nearest hospital. At every workplace an ambulance room 
containing the prescribed equipment and nursing staff shall be provided.
Health care facilities: Health problems of the workers should be taken care of by providing 
basic health care facilities through health centres temporarily set up for the construction 
camp. The health centre should have at least a doctor, nurses, duty staff, medicines and 
minimum medical facilities to tackle first-aid requirements or minor accidental cases, linkage 
with nearest higher order hospital to refer patients of major illnesses or critical cases.
The health centre should have MCW (Mother and Child Welfare) units for treating mothers 
and children in the camp. Apart from this, the health centre should provide with regular 
vaccinations required for children.
Day crèche facilities: At every construction site, provision of a day crèche shall be worked 
out so as to enable women to leave behind their children. At construction sites where 20 
or more women are ordinarily employed, there shall be provided at least a hut for use of 
children under the age of 6 years belonging to such women. Huts shall not be constructed to 
a standard lower than that of thatched roof, mud walls and floor with wooden planks spread 
over mud floor and covered with matting. Huts shall be provided with suitable and sufficient 
openings for light and ventilation. There shall be adequate provision of sweepers to keep the 
places clean. There shall be two maidservants (or aayas) in the satisfaction of local medical, 
health, municipal or cantonment authorities. Where the number of women workers is more 
than 25 but less than 50, at least one hut and one maidservant should be provided to look 
after the children of women workers. Size of crèches shall vary according to the number of 
women workers employed.

Annex-7
Guidelines for Mitigation of Impacts on Protected Areas
1.	
 Areas, such as national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, biosphere reserves, coastal 
areas, and other eco-sensitive areas have been designated by law as Protected Areas (PAs). 
Any impact on PAs would mean to include impact on the human communities dependent on 
these areas. Special mesures are required to be taken when the projects are located in or 
near PAs.
2.	
The common impact of the project on the wild life in PAs are habitat loss and 
fragmentation, visual alterations on the landscape, alteration of surface drainage, spread 
of invasive alien species, loss of vegetation, increased incidence of fires, animal injury and 
mortality, changes in animal behaviour (including reproductive behaviour), increased human 
pressure, increase in pollution, and various other disturbances. The negative impacts on 
human communities is in the form of disturbances in their social fabric, market pressures, 
loss of land and relocation.
3.	
Presented in the following paragraphs are a framework of specific guidelines for 
design and implementation of road development projects passing through Protected Areas 
as applicable to wildlife issues without covering any design and engineering solutions, which 
have to b project specific.
The decision protocol for the design stage
4.	
Essentially, the following decision-making protocol must be followed in deciding the 
new highway alignment, and for any augmentation in the existing alignment. Arriving at the 
most feasible and acceptable option shall largely depend on a comprehensive ‘Analysis of 
Alternative’, backed by socio-economic and environmental studies.
Avoidance of impacts
5.	
The first and the best option for any development activity in protected areas is - 
to avoid undertaking any such activity in such areas. This is likely to increase the length 
of the highway alignment but is worth considering if the objective of the project does not 
involve providing connectivity to any obligatory point situated within the protected area but 
the alignment merely passes through it.
Minimisation of unavoidable impacts
6.	
In cases where re-alignment options are not available or socio-economically not 
viable, options may be considered with a view to affect minimum possible impacts on the 
protected area. Such option may include selecting the least sensitive route, augmenting the 
width of the alignment, imposing restrictions on traffic flow, and various engineering options.
Mitigation of impacts
7.	
As the last and unavoidable option mitigation should be considered only where the 
above options have be examined and overruled, with adequate justification.

Guiding principles to be followed at the project development stage.
Banned activities
8.	
The following activities are generally banned by regulatory authorities, and hence not 
allowed:
	
1.	
Dumping of wastes (all wastes should be segregated and carried to nearby 
townships or cities for safe disposal)
	
2.	
Soil or water pollution and open burning of wastes
	
3.	
Dumping of solids and any wastes, including waste water, oils, and liquids from 
washing and domestic uses, into rivers, streams, or any water bodies
	
4.	
Planting of non-forestry species and species not indigenous to the area.
	
5.	
Camping of workers and parking of vehicles inside natural areas,
	
6.	
Washing vehicles and equipment at or along streams, rivers, or water bodies,
	
7.	
Cutting of firewood within the natural areas,
	
8.	
Siting of labour camps within a specified distance from the protected area
Recommended activities
9.	
The following activities are generally required to be undertaken as part of pre-
conditions imposed by regulatory authorities while granting clearance:
	
1.	
Road removal through ripping, re-contouring or other intensive methods must 
follow best practices.
	
2.	
Construction of the linear intrusions should be in a manner that minimises, 
with adequate design and technology, the long-term impacts, e,g by using 
prefabricated and special methods to reduce the time taken in the erection/
construction of the intrusions.
	
3.	
Use of diverse mix of local species native to the corresponding natural vegetation 
type
	
4.	
Ensuring that restoration minimises any additional temporary disturbance, 
particularly soil erosion and loss of adjoining regenerating natural vegetation
	
5.	
Rehabilitation works, including slope stabilisation using native species, and 
natural ‘green’ methods involving natural regeneration of native species and 
ground cover instead of hard ‘cement and stone’ engineering approaches.
	
6.	
Avoiding work during nights to facilitate movement of many species, especially 
large mammals and carnivores.
	
7.	
Avoiding camping of people/workers and use of domestic animals.

gathered at the site must be covered by appropriate material such as tarpaulins 
to prevent dust spreading, pollution, or wastage.
	
9.	
Movement of vehicles should be strictly restricted to existing roads and tracks, 
and creation of new roads and tracks or off-roading shall be prohibited in 
connection with roads and power lines in natural areas.
	
10.	 Movements of vehicles and use of heavy machinery along riverine areas and 
water courses should also be avoided. Speed limits should be defined and 
enforced within all roads passing through protected areas, depending upon the 
prevailing conditions.
	
11.	 Continuous retention walls, fences or other structures that can act as barriers to 
animal movement should not be installed along roads, especially in hilly terrain.
	
12.	 Structures permitted to be installed or already installed along existing roads 
in natural areas should have sufficient gaps incorporated at regular intervals. 
The height of such structures should be such that movement of wildlife across 
the structures is not hindered. As far as possible, crash-guards with single bar 
(at 0.6 – 1 metre height) should be preferred over continuous sidewalls, with 
periodic gaps. This shall facilitate movement of both smaller animals under the 
bars and larger species through gaps.
Designing animal crossings
10.	
The effectiveness of animal crossings dependents on a variety of factors. In order to 
design effective wildlife passage structures, attention needs to be paid to following features 
that affect their utilization:
Placement
11.	
Placement of animal crossings is the most important factor requiring careful 
consideration. In general, the local forest staff is aware of the corridors used by the wild 
animals for their diurnal and seasonal movements. As a thumb rule, the natural drainages in 
forest areas can be developed as animal crossings, with little changes in the design of culverts 
and bridges. Travel distance (to reach a passage way) may be especially important for small 
animals. Mammals are generally capable of learning to use underpass or overpass systems 
and may transfer that knowledge to succeeding generations. This learning may result in 
improved mitigation success over time for more mobile species, even for underpasses that 
are not placed at traditional crossing points.
Size
12.	
It is difficult to determine critical size thresholds for passage structures because 
these size thresholds undoubtedly vary from species to species. In general, tunnel layouts 
that allow animals to see the opposite end of a wildlife passage are positively correlated with 
utilization. As a thumb rule, tunnelling effect should be reduced to minimum possible, the 
bigger the size, the better.



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:SP:108-2015
65
Ambience
13.	
As far possible, the ambience of animal crossings should match with the surroundings. 
Any drastic change in ground conditions, lighting, moisture, species composition, etc., should 
be avoided. 
Noise
14.	
Traffic noise can be a problem for some mammals, especially those sensitive to 
human disturbance. Effective noise mitigation measures must be undertaken along with the 
animal crossings, to lead to minimum disturbance to animals.
Fencing
15.	
Although some species may utilize underpass or overpass systems without fences, 
some form of fencing does appear to be necessary for most species. Fences help guide 
animals to passage systems and prevent wildlife from circumventing the system.
16.	
The above suggestions are generic in nature. However, some sensitive protected 
areas, especially housing some flagship species may require specific considerations suited 
to the requirement of the species. Elephant corridors, for example, would require to be 
designed with adequate vertical clearance (Not less than 6.5 m). Tunnelling effect, especially 
in sensitive areas, can be reduced by splitting the highway width in two or more parts with 
open- to-sky gaps.
