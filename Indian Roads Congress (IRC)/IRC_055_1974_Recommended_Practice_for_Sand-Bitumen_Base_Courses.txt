RECOMMENDED PRACTICE FOR SAND-

INTRODUCTION
This recommended practice
was
prepared
by
the
Bitumi-
nous
Pavements

(personnel
given

in
their

Later,
it was approved by the Specifications
and
Standards
Committee in their meeting held on the 31st January and
1st Feb-
ruary, 1974 and then by the Executive Committee in their
meeting
held
on
the
1st
May,
1974.
Finally,
it
was
approved
by the
Council in their meeting held on the 2nd May, 1974.
2.
SCOPE
This recommended practice deals with the basic
outlines
of
providing
one
or
more
layers
of base courses of sand stabilised
with
bituminous
materials
like
penetration
grade
bitumens,
cut-back
bitumens
and
other
special road oils laid directly over
the
sandy
subgrade
or
on
a
prepared
base/sub-base
of
the
pavement.
The
practice
is
mainly
intended for desert areas such as in
Rajasthan
or
bordering
close
to
it where no other construction
material
except
sand
is
economically available.

base course with a wearing course of 20 mm
premix
carpet
has
been found to be satisfactory for carrying normal traffic upto about
150
vehicles
per day (vehicles exceeding 3 tonnes loaded weight)
and also occasional heavy traffic of upto 1500 vehicles per day.
3.
DESIGN CRITERIA
The sand-bitumen mix should be properly designed based on
the Hubbard Field Stability Method and satisfy
the
requirements
given below:
Requirements of the Mix
(1) Hubbard Field Stability at 60° C
for paving grade bitumen
Minimum 360 kg
(2) Modified Hubbard Field Stability
at 25°C for cut-back bitumens
Minimum 540 kg
(3) Per cent voids
Maximum 20 per cent
Note
: (a)
It
is
preferable
to
keep
per
cent voids on the lower side than the
maximum limit as far as possible.
(b) For
mixes
in
which Kankar
is
incorporated.
Modified
Hubbard
Field
Stability
Method may
be
used
as
a
guide
with appropriate
modification
in
stability
values
as
desired
by
the
Engineer-in
charge.

MATERIALS
4. 1
.
Aggregates
4.1.1. Sand
:
The sand should be clean dune or pit sand
free
from
organic
and
other
deleterious
materials.
No
particular
gradation
is specified except that the percentage passing 75 microns
sieve shall be not
more
than 10 per cent
by
weight.
A
typical
grading of sand as obtained in Rajasthan is given in the footnote.
4.1.2.
Coarse aggregates for stabilization
: To
impart greater
stability to the stabilized sand mix, wherever possible and available,
coarse
aggregates
can
be
incorporated
in
the
mix,
up
to
a

maximum
of 25
per
cent
by
weight of the mix.
The
coarse
aggregates
should
be
either
gravel
or
kankar,
clean
and
free
from
fines
and
clayey
matter,
and
the
size
be
such
that
the
whole of it should retain on
I.S. 4.75 mm sieve with the maximum
size not being more than
1/3 the
compacted thickness of the layer
to be laid.
4.2.
Binder
The
binder
shall
be paving bitumen of suitable penetration
grade or cut-back bitumen conforming to I.S. 73-1961 *Taving Bitu-
men "(Revised)" or I.S. 217-1961 "Cutback Bitumen (Revised)".
5.
DESIGN OF MIX
5.1.
Selection of Type of Bitumen
The
selection
for the type of bitumen shall depend upon the
type of sand available and atmospheric conditions prevailing at the
time of execution of the work.
5.2.
Proportion of Bitumen
The proportion of bitumen in the mix shall be designed so as
to satisfy the requirements of the mix given in para
3.
6.
CONSTRUCTION
6.1.
Formation
The formation shall be prepared well ahead of laying the mix
in the usual manner, to get approximately the required cross slope
or superelevation and shall be compacted dry/wet as may be possi-
ble.
The
final finishing of the berms as well as providing the pro-
per cross slope or superelevation shall be done after the
sand-bitu-
men
work
has
been completed.
In the case of sandy subgrades,
the carriageway shall be marked with planks of depth equal to the
proposed loose thickness of the sand-bitumen layer. The subgrade
shall
have
the
required
camber or superelevation of the finished
road surface,
and
it shall
then be sprinkled with water and lightly
rolled with suitable rollers until
it
is well compacted.
6.2.
Edge Key
Grooves 8 cm wide and 5 cm deep shall be dug at the edges on
3

IRC

either side so as to give a thickened edge.
This
is essential to give
additional strength to the edge.
6.3.
Heating of the Materials
6.3.1.
Whenever
necessary,
the
binder shall be warmed or
heated
as
the
case
may
be to that temperature pertaining to the
grade of bitumen used and as specified.
Normally the temperature
shall
be
that at which
the viscosity of the binder
is 150-300 centi-
stokes
for
which
the normal heating temperature for penetration
grade
binder
is
between
150°-165®C
and
for
cutbacks between
80°-120°C.
6.3.2.
Sand
shall
be
dry.
If necessary and stipulated, the
sand and aggregates shall also be warmed and heated to the requi-
site temperature as specified,
such as 135°-163°C when penetration
grade bitumen
is employed.
At least tilting drum type of drier
is
recommended for this purpose.
6.4.
Mixing
The
mixing
of sand, aggregates and binder shall be done by
using a twin shaft paddle type of mixer using the appropriate quan-
tities of aggregates and the binder as per design.
The mixing time
shall be determined based on a few initial trials.
Normally
it will
be
between
1
to
2
minutes.
The mix shall be laid immediately
thereafter.
6.5.
Laying of Mix
The sand-bitumen mix shall be laid directly over the subgrade
to a loose thickness of upto 15 cm so as to be compacted to a 10 cm
thickness.
The
material
shall
be spread uniformly and rolled to
the
required
density.
It
is to be ensured that uniform density
is
obtained throughout the depth of the compacted layer.
6.6.
Curing
Where cut-back bitumen
is used, the mix, after laying should
be
allowed
for
curing
till
such time that initial rolling could be
started.
The curing period may vary from
1 to 7 days depending
upon
the
type
of cut-back used and the prevailing weather condi-
tions at the time of construction.
The curing time should be reck-
oned
from
the
time
of preparing the mix to the period when by
periodically
making
a
ball out of the aerated mix and applying a
light
pressure
with
fingers,
the ball crumbles.
The smell of the
solvent
in
the
cut-back
also
gives a good indication.
Properly
cured mix should not give the small of the solvent except in traces.

6.7.
Rolling
Where
penetration
grade
bitumens are used, rolling should
start as soon as the hot mix is spread and levelled on the sub-base.
In
the case
of cut-backs, initial rolling shall be done at least after
twenty four hours after laying.
In all cases, the initial rolling shall
be done where possible by light pneumatic tyred road roller.
The
final rolling shall again be done
with 8 to 10 tonnes smooth wheel
roller and continued
till the desired density is achieved, which may
be a week where cut-back bitumens are used.
6.8.
Opening to Traffic
Traffic may be allowed after 24 hours of completing the final
rolling
operation.
Only
light
pneumatic
tyred
vehicles may be
permitted
initially.
Normal
traffic may be allowed only after a
month.
But
the
final
wearing
surface
should
be
laid within 3
months.
7.
LAYING OF WEARING SURFACE
To
provide
a
running
surface and to protect the base from
abrasive action of traffic,
a wearing course such as a 20 mm thick
premix
carpet
should
be laid over the sand bitumen base, as per
IRC:
14-1977 "Recommended
Practice
for 2 cm Thick Bitumen
and Tar Carpets*'.
The ruts and undulations that might be formed
during
the
initial
use of the sand-bitumen base course should be
made
good
with
premix
aggregate
before
laying
the
wearing
surface.
8.
CONTROLS
Adequate quality control at every
stage of the work
is essen-
tial
and
as
such
a
field laboratory must be set up to ensure the
following controls
:
(1)
In
no
case
shall
the
difference
in
temperature
between
the
sand/
aggregate and binder exceed \4°C,
(2)
Density
:
For
every
500 square metres or less of compacted surface,
one field density test
is to be conducted.
This density shall not be less
than 95 per cent of the laboratory designed density.
(3)
Tests on the mix
:
At
least one sample
for every 50 m* of mix or a
minimum
of two
samples per shift
should be collected and tested for
stability, voids and determination of the binder
content.
(4)
The
finished
surface
shall
be tested with a 3 m straight edge and any
irregularities greater than 6 mm rectified.
