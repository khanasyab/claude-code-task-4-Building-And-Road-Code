In
case,
the
Independent Engineer is of the opinion that the proposal submitted by the Concessionaire is
not in conformity with any of the International Standards or Codes or evidence by successful
performance, then he will record his reasons and convey the same to the Concessionaire
for compliance. A record
shall be kept by the Independent Engineer, of non-compliance,
if any, by the Concessionaire. Adverse consequences,
if any arising from adoption of any
such alternative proposals shall be treated as "Concessionaire Default" and shall be dealt in
accordance with the provisions of the Concession Agreement.
1.12
Guidelines for Preparing Schedules of tlie Concession Agreement
Certain Paras
(fully or part)
in Sections
1
to 14 of this Manual
refer to the Schedules of
the Concession Agreement.
While
finalizing
the
feasibility/project
report
for the
Project
Highway, and the scope of the project, each of these Paras should be carefully examined and
addressed by the Authority with a view to making appropriate provisions
in the Schedules
of the Concession Agreement. A
list of the Paras that refer to such Schedules has been
provided at Annex-1 for ready reference.
1.13
General Considerations for Planning, Design and Construction
The objective of planning a 6 lane highway shall be to ensure that the long distance through
traffic is able to operate at a speed dictated only by the flow on the main highway and not by
any other factors, such as interference from local
traffic, access traffic or cross traffic. The
traffic having short distance or local O&D, access traffic and cross traffic shall be separated
from the long distance through
traffic. Service road shall be provided
in continuous length
on both sides. Unless otherwise specified
in Schedule B, the continuity will be broken
(i) at
locations of major bridges,
(ii) at locations of toll plaza in a length of 1 km,
(iii) in areas where
no cross traffic or access traffic is expected (e.g. forest/ghat areas, uninhabited areas, etc)
provided that the length of such section
is not less than one km. The service roads shall be
connected to the main highway through properly designed entry/exit ramps at locations given
in Schedule B. Traffic needing access to the main highway shall first come on to the service
road and then join the main highway through an acceleration lane/entry ramp. Similarly,
all
traffic exiting the main highway shall first come on to the service road through a deceleration
lane/exit ramp from where
it would distribute to the local road network for various destinations.
"However, when there is no settlement or road side development abutting the Project Highway
or the connecting roads are spaced more than 2 km, service roads may not be necessary
and access can be given directly through acceleration/deceleration lanes". The existing direct
access to-the highway shall also be modified accordingly. The locations of service roads and
entry/exit ramps shall be specified in Schedule 'B'.
The existing alignment and grade shall be followed, as far as possible and widening of the
carriageway shall be done depending upon the site situation by adding a lane, either on the
4

IRC:SP:87-2013
inside oroutsideofthe existing carriageway. The new 6 lane highway, as far as possible, shall fit
into the existing 4-lane section without rendering in fructuous the existing 4-lane facilities unless
essential or required to
fulfill the requirements laid down
in this Manual. The improvements
required
shall be
carried
out
within
the
available and proposed
Right
of Way (ROW).
The objective therefore
is to construct a 6-lane highway for
all road users as an active
infrastructure facility for people for their safety and services and as a catalyst in development
of economy based on an inclusive approach.
General consideration shall, without being limited, to be as follows:
a)
The constraints
The physical constraints in the existing highway are in the form of limitation of
right of way, un-regulated access, inadequate service roads and underpasses,
numerous at-grade junctions, lack of physical separation between local and
through traffic etc. The operational constraints arise out of the necessity or
possibility of closing a portion of the road for construction and/or diverting the
traffic to temporary diversions, thereby reducing the capacity and safety of
the existing highway. The solutions evolved by the Concessionaire shall be
such that these operational constraints are overcome through appropriate
planning, design and construction method, techniques and technologies and
by adopting suitable traffic management measures.
b)
Safety of design
All designs shall be safe to ensure that the Project Highway or any part thereof
(for example embankment, pavement, retaining structures, bridges, culverts,
etc) does not collapse (global stability) nor its serviceability/performance (for
example settlement, roughness, undulations, deflections, etc.) deteriorates
below acceptable
level as prescribed
in Schedule
'K' of the Concession
Agreement.
c)
Durability
The Project Highway shall not only be safe but also durable. This would mean
that the deteriorating effects of climate and environment (for example wetting
and
drying,
freezing and thawing,
if applicable, temperature
differences,
aggressive environment leading to corrosion, etc.)
in addition to the traffic
shall be duly considered
in design and construction
to make the Project
Highway durable.
d)
Mitigating disruptive effects of construction
The planning, design and construction of the highway shall be such that
the construction of Project Highway does not have adverse impact on the
environment and does not disrupt the
lives and business activities of the
people living close to the Project Highway.

INTERSECTIONS AND GRADE SEPARATORS
3.1
Introduction
As mentioned
in paras 1.13 and 2.12, there shall be no direct access to the main highway
and all access shall be from service roads which shall be provided on both sides of the main
highway and interconnected through underpasses, overpasses or grade separators. The
existing direct access to the highway shall be closed and alternative access through service
roads only shall be provided.
3.2
At-Grade Intersections
There
shall
be no
at-grade
intersection
of any
road
with
the main
highway.
But only
with
the
service
road. The
intersection
of the
Project Highway
with
another
National
Highway
(NH)
or
State
Highway
(SH)
shall
be
grade
separated. The
existing
direct
intersections shall be closed and remodeled accordingly. The intersecting roads other than
those mentioned above, shall be designed to facilitate all movements in following manner:
a)
Through underpass/overpass
for crossing the
Project Highway and then
right turn through a ramp to merge with the Project Highway or service road
if provided as per this Manual, or
b)
By
merging
with
service
road and
crossing
through
the
next
available
vehicular underpass.
There shall be interconnection between the service roads of both sides through underpasses
which
will facilitate cross movement of local
traffic from one side to the other side and to
facilitate change of direction of through traffic. Accordingly, the intersections on the service
road including those at underpasses shall be designed for safe movements for all turnings.
Encompassing safety requirement and also to have better traffic control following layouts are
suggested for at-grade intersections below structures on the project highway.

6.8.1.1
For culverts and bridges provision of suitable cross slope/camber and down take
pipes/spouts near the kerb, covered with gratings at the
inlet points shall be provided
at
regular interval to facilitate rapid draining of water from the deck without any ponding. The
length and location of these drainage spouts should be such that the water is not discharged
on any bridge element.
6.8.1.2
The bridges
particularly those
in
high
rainfall area
shall
preferably be
built
in
longitudinal gradient with suitably designed cross drains at abutment locations to facilitate
proper drainage.
6.8.2

not stagnate over the road or at entry and exit points of grade separated structure and
is
discharged into the draining system of the area. Care must be taken that the pipes are taken
down in such a way that they are aesthetically pleasing.
6.8.2.3
Typically, water spouts are provided at the kerbs at the rate of
1 No. per 12 sqm
of the surface in level portions and
1 No. per 15 sqm of the surface area on gradients. Water
spouts are connected to runner pipe of suitable diameter (minimum 100 mm) on either side
of roadway and taken down by downtake pipes at pier & abutment locations.
6.8.2.4
Drainage fixtures and downspouts shall be of rigid, corrosion resistant material
not less than 100 mm as the least dimension and shall be provided with suitable cleanout
fixtures.
6.8.2.5
The arrangement of floor drains shall be such as to prevent the splashing discharge
of drainage water against any portion of the structure. Overhanging portions of concrete
floors shall be provided with drip moulds.
6. 8. 2. 6
Catch water drains are necessary at the ends of viaduct portion so that water coming
from grade separated structure does not over saturate and affect the earthen embankment.
Similar catch water drains should be provided at the end of gradient so that water coming
from the structure is properly let out to nearest drain.
6.8.2.7
An integrated drainage plan for the water coming from the deck of structures, local
catchment area of the project and all other sources should be prepared so that no water falls
on any surface of the structures, or remain standing or flowing over the level roads. All the
water is collected through sumps and finally discharged into the local drainage system
i.e.,
storm water drain/pipes etc., either by gravity through connecting drains or by pumping into
the existing outgoing drains.
6.8.2.8
The rainwater from the deck of the structures usually does not flow transversely
but flows on the high gradient slopes of the road or approaches and
is collected in the valley
curve portion. As such attention
is to be paid to get this large quantity of water drained out
fast without accumulating there causing problems for traffic flow resulting in traffic jams. The
draining out systems should be designed with greater margins so as to avoid this problem, a
least for grade separators, inside the cities or inhabited areas.
6.8.3
Underpasses and subways
6.8.3.1
Where
rain water cannot flow
into the drainage system by gravity due to the
requirement of depressed road to get minimum head room, necessary provision for drainage
by vertical drains and/or pumping shall be made so that there is no disruption of traffic through
such location on account of water logging/flooding of underpass or subway.
6.9.
Existing Drains, Canals and Minor Waterways
6.9.1
For the existing drains, canals and waterways, to be over passed by the highway,
draining provisions shall be maintained and the effects of prolonged heavy rainfall must be
catered for.

Existing culverts
a)
All culverts which are structurally distressed or not having
sufficient
vent size or unsafe for design loads due to surcharge like in approaches
to structures shall be reconstructed as new structures of width as per
sub-para 7.3
(i) of this Section.
b)
All existing culverts which are not to be reconstructed shall be widened
equal to the roadway width of the approaches.
c)
The culverts and hume pipe structures shall be widened so as to make
the deck width same as specified
in sub-para 7.3
(1) of this Section.
If
the width of additional widening
is less than 0.5 m on either side, the
widening of the structure may be dispensed with and
traffic shall be
guided with the help of crash barriers in a transition of
1

b)
Components
like bearings, expansion joints,
railings, crash
barriers,
wearing
surface,
etc.,
which
are
not
in sound
condition,
shall
be
replaced. Minor non-structural works shall be suitably repaired.
c)
If the width of additional widening
is
1 m (0.5 m on either side) or less,
the widening of the structure may be dispensed with and traffic shall be
guided with the help of crash barriers in a transition of 1
in 20 on either
side approaches.
d)
Widening as also dismantling of the bridges having T-beam or box type
superstructure and deep foundations
is generally
difficult. Keeping
in
view the condition of superstructure, sub-structure and foundation, the
Concessionaire may retain the existing two lane bridge and construct
another two lane bridge by the side of the existing bridge effectively
providing four lane bridge for a three lane one way approach highway.
Alternatively, the Concessionaire may propose some innovative solution
viz., to dismantle existing superstructure and construct new three lane
superstructure to be supported by existing substructure and foundation
if their condition
is good and
if, on review by IE, the proposal
is found
to be feasible and safe. The bridge for a width of minimum 3 lanes for
each carriageway shall be ensured but independent single lane bridge
will not be permitted. The wearing course, bearings and rubberized
component of expansion joints which are damaged or older than 15
years of the existing bridge shall be removed and replaced and all repair
and rehabilitation required shall be carried out before commissioning of
the Project Highway. Typical cross sections of such types of existing
and new bridges are given in Fig. 7.4 through Fig. 7.7.
e)
The width of the new structures constructed on the other side of the
existing bridge shall be as specified in sub-para 7.3
(ii) of this Section.
f)
List of bridge structures to be reconstructed and/or widened shall be
specified in Schedule 'B' of the Concession Agreement.
g)
Any
deviations
to
the
above
provisions
shall
be
specified
in
Schedule 'D' of the Concession Agreement.
7.4
Structure Types
The Concessionaire may adopt any type of structure and structure system commensurate
with safety, serviceability and durability requirements. The general guidelines as below shall
be followed:
i)
The structure should aesthetically blend with the environment.
ii)
The type and span arrangement may be such as to provide maximum riding
comfort and involve minimum inspection and maintenance during the service
life of the structure.

SECTION - 9
TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES/ROAD SAFETY DEVICES/
ROAD SIDE FURNITURE
9.1
General
The multi lane highways being built under various road development programmes are adopting
the geometric standards specifications, signage, road markings etc. as per the provisions
contained in the codes of practice and the standards of the Indian Roads Congress supported
by the Ministry's specifications. However, accident data demonstrates that motorists leave the
roadway for numerous reasons including errors of judgment. To ensure long term road safety
on these highways, the following suitable engineering measure are considered essential for
adoption so as to help in improving road safety leading to reduction of accidents.
Traffic Control Devices, Road Safety Devices and Road Side Furniture shall comprise of road
signs, road markings, object markers, hazard markers, studs, delineators, attenuators, safety
barriers, pedestrian guard rails, boundary stones, km stones, etc. Guidelines given
in IRC:8,
IRC:25, IRC:26, IRC:35, IRC:67, IRC:79, IRC:103and Section 800 of MORTH Specifications
shall be used for providing these items unless otherwise specified in this Section.
9.2
Road Signs
The three types of road signs
viz., mandatory/regulatory signs, cautionary/warning signs
and informatory signs shall be provided as given
in IRC:67 and Section 800 of MORTH
Specifications. Proper signs shall be provided for main carriageways, service and slip roads
roads, toll plaza and other project highway facilities. Clustering and proliferation of road signs
shall be avoided for enhancing their effectiveness.
9.2.1
There
shall be corresponding road markings with stop
signs,
give way signs,
merging or diverging traffic signs, lane closed signs, road narrowing signs, slip roads/diversion
signs, compulsory keep left/right signs, or any other signs as per IRC:67.
9.2.2
The Specifications and Standards of road signs, which are not covered by IRC:67
would be as per International Standards.
9.2.3
All road signs shall be of Prismatic Grade Sheeting corresponding to Class C
Sheeting described
in IRC:67 and any of the sheeting types VIII,
IX or XI as per ASTM D
4956-09 fixed over Aluminum or Aluminum Composite Material. The sheeting for different type
of signs can be chosen based on the selection guidance provided in IRC;67 depending upon
the situation encountered by road users
in viewing the signs. Sheeting with high coefficient
of retro reflection at small observation angle are for a road sign to be viewed by a driver from
a long distance, whereas the sheeting with wide observation angle for better performance
at short distance viewing. The Type XI sheeting
will have better performance at short and
medium distances. Micro prismatic sheeting is preferred for gantry mounted overhead signs.
Type IV micro prismatic sheeting can be used for delineator posts.

The overall size of gantry mounted signs shall be evolved based on design of sign boards
given in IRC:67.
9.2.6
The road sign, traffic signal or any other device erected for traffic control, traffic
guidance and or traffic information shall not obscure other traffic sign. Further, the signs and
signals shall not carry any advertisement.
/
9.2.7
Wherever the Project Highway alignment
is on a curve, there shall be advance
cautionary signs for sharp curves (depending on whether
it
is on
left or right) and chevron
signs (rectangular in shape with yellow background and black arrow) at the outer edge of
the curve. The sign for the curve ahead particularly in mountainous and steep terrain shall
always be accompanied with chevron signs at the outer edge of the curve and appropriate
delineation. Following guidance shall be adopted while installing curve signs:
1)
The curves with radii upto 450 m shall be provided with curves warning sign
in advance of hazard and single Chevrons on outer edge of curve. Chevron
signs shall be always placed on outer edge of the curve and spaced uniformly

if there is any curve with radius less than 450 m,
the safe negotiating speed for the particular curve shall be placed along with
curve warning sign at both approaches. Generally
if the difference between
the approach speed and permissible negotiating speed of any curve is more
than 15 kmph, the curve warning and speed
limit sign shall be placed on
shoulder side and median side also.
ii)
The curves with radii 451 m to 750 m shall be installed with single Chevrons
on outer edge of curve at 75 m spacing

Alternatively, Solar Powered Road Markers are more effective and draw attention of drivers and
shall be provided at locations like at SI. 6 & 8 and also other locations where performance of
normal road studs are not that effective due to street lightings and other roadside activities.
9.6
Traffic impact Attenuators
Traffic Impact Attenuators shall be provided at hazardous locations and gorge areas so as to
act as energy absorber. The traffic impact attenuators or crash cushions shall be composed
of 'W'-beam fender panels supported by diaphragm with trigger mechanism or composed
of sand barrels as per Clause 814 the MORTH specifications and the contractor/supplier
shall furnish the certificate that the system to be installed has been tested
in accordance
with the NCHRP 350 and performs effectively at design speeds up to 100 kmph. The space
requirement to shield a fixed object should be considered while designing and constructing
the attenuators. Fig. 9.6 shows the area that should be made available for crash attenuators
installations. The design and size of attenuators shall be as per International Standards.
Following are the general criteria for providing crash attenuators:
a)
The
location where there
is
a
history
of more than average number of
accidents involving vehicles impacting obstruction
b)
The 85''' percentile speed of traffic plying through the traffic lane adjacent to
obstruction in diverge area is greater than 70 kmph
c)

of
vehicles
are
substantial
d)
Traffic
is required
to travel
in close proximity to the
potential obstruction
where
it is not feasible to install safety barrier in front of
it

The specific location shall be identified following the criteria given above and the type of crash
attenuators will be based on severity of the situation and shall be indicated in Schedule 'B'.
9.7
Road Side and Median Safety Barriers
There are two types
of safety
barriers
viz.,
roadside
safety
barriers and median
safety
barriers.
9.7.1
Road side safety barriers
i)
Warrants
: The longitudinal roadside barriers are basically meant to shield
two types of roadside hazards i.e. embankments and roadside obstacles and
also for preventing the vehicles veering off the sharp curves. Therefore,
all
embankments with height 3 m or more shall have safety barriers at the edge
of formation, with delineating reflectors fitted on them. W beam barrier shall
be provided along
all curves having radii upto 450 m for complete length of
curves including transitions and 20 m further before and after the curve.
Normally on shoulder side the lateral distance of at least 0.75 to
1 .0 m width from edge of
paved portion (i.e. carriageway + paved shoulder) should be available without any obstacles.
Wherever a permanent object cannot be removed for some reasons, provision of tandems
viz. W-beam metal crash barriers and hazard markers with reflectors must be made. Further,
frangible lighting columns and sign posts need to be used for minimizing the severity in case
of collision.
Irrespective of type of barrier being used, the slope in front of W-beam or wire rope or rigid
barrier shall be near to flat gradient so that safety barrier perform best when impacted by a
vehicle and the slope of ground in front of barrier shall not be steeper than 10:1.
Some of the commonly encountered roadside obstacles are bridge
piers, abutments and
railing ends, roadside rock mass, culverts, pipes and headwalls, cut slopes, retaining walls,
lighting supports, traffic signs and signal supports, trees and
utility poles.
9.7.1.1
Types of roadside safety barriers
'
There are three types of longitudinal roadside safety barriers viz:
a)
Semi-rigid type like
"W" beam type steel barrier
Thrie beam type steel barrier
b)
Rigid type (like concrete crash barriers)
c
)
Flexible type (like wire rope fencing)
The steel barriers with strong post type usually remain functional after moderate collisions,
thereby eliminating the need for immediate repair.
If damaged by a vehicle collision, both posts

and
rails of W-beam are to be repaired. Lack in maintenance can cause the W-beam
rails
to protrude into traffic way creating highly unsafe situation. The wire rope though technically
complicated, can be repaired with minimum costs. Though initial installation cost is relatively
high for concrete rigid barrier compare to W-beam and wire rope safety barriers, the repair
and maintenance issues can be minimized greatly in concrete rigid barrier. The psychological
shyness of drivers to keep away from the safety barrier will be the least
in
rigid concrete
barrier compared to other types. Since rigid barriers will not yield under any vehicle impact,
it shall be provided for bridges and ROBs and also to shield roadside objects/hazards where
the required set back distance cannot be retained with wire rope and W-Beam (due to any
site condition), as they are deflective in nature.
Invariably W-beam and wire rope barrier shall not be installed upon a structure. For a median
upon a structure,
it shall be concrete rigid barrier. Wire Rope Safety Barrier shall not be used
over major or minor bridges
9.7.2
Road side steel barriers
a)
Design aspects
: The W-beam type safety barrier consists of steel posts
and a 3 mm thick W-beam
rail. There shall be a steel spacer block between
the post and the beam to prevent the vehicle from snagging on the post, as
the snagging can cause the vehicle to spin round. The steel posts and the
blocking out spacer shall both be channel section of 75 mm x 150 mm size
and 5 mm thick. The posts shall be spaced 2 m center to center. Fig. 9.7
gives the typical details of w-beam
rail and splices and shall be procured
and installed from a reputed manufacturer.
The Thrie beam safety barrier shall have posts and spacers similar to the
ones mentioned above for W-beam type. The rail and splices design details
for typical Thrie beam are shown
in Fig. 9.8 and shall be from a reputed
manufacturer. This barrier has higher initial cost than the W-beam type but
is less prone to damages to vehicle collisions especially for shallow angle
impacts.
The W-beam, the Thrie beam and the posts spacers and fasteners for steel
barriers shall be galvanized by hot dip process and design elements and
installations shall be as per the details shown for crash barrier in this manual
so as to achieve the performance characteristics intended for W-beam. For
any structural elements and details missing
in this Manual for W-beam and
its various end treatments, the details from international guidelines/manuals
on W-beam which would conform to EN 1317 Part-2 can be adopted.
b)
End treatment for steel barrier
:
If
hit, an untreated end of the roadside
barrier can be hazardous, because the
barrier beam can
penetrate the
passenger compartment and cause the impact vehicle to stop abruptly. End

Piacement
: Placement recommendations determine the exact layout of the
barrier and shall be made by the design engineer keeping in view the lateral
offset of the barrier and flare rate. The final layout shall be as site-specific
combination of these factors. The barriers shall be as far away from the traffic
as possible and shall preferably have uniform clearance between the traffic
and the hazard. As far as possible, the safety barrier shall be placed beyond

9.7.3
Road side concrete barriers
a)
Design aspects
: Roadside concrete safety barriers are rigid barriers having
a sloped front face and a vertical back face. For unifornnity New Jersey type
concrete
barriers should be used where necessary.
Rigid crash
barriers
may however be required only in constrained urban location between main
carriageway and
service
road. The concrete
barrier may be
pre-cast
in
lengths of up to 6 m depending upon the feasibility of transport and
lifting
arrangements. Concrete grade
for the
barriers
shall
not be
leaner than
M 30. The minimum thickness of foundations shall be 25 mm thick cement
concrete or hot mix asphalt placed at the base of barrier to provide lateral
restraint. Where more than 75 mm thick over lay on the road pavement
is
anticipated, the foundation step may be increased
to 125 mm. However,
longitudinal roadside concrete barrier should have elaborate footing design
which
is structurally safe unless sufficient earth support is available.
Suggested
flare
rates depending
upon
the
design
speed
are
given
in
Table 9.2.

b)
End treatment
: Safety barrier shall be provided with an end treatment,
which
shall be obtained by tapering the height of terminating end of the
median barrier within a length of 8 m to 9 m.
c)
Placement
:
Placement
recommendations
for
roadside

Wire rope safety barrier
a)
Design aspects
: The wire rope barriers/systems are suitable for either
shoulder
and/or
median
side
application,
provided
there
is
adequate
clearance to account for their deflection, as per manufactures system design
specification and standards. The slope of surface between traffic way and
wire rope safety
barrier shall always be
flatter than
10:1 and there shall
not any object or raised kerb
in between so to enable the cables to readily
dis-engage from posts during impact and thereby minimizing snagging and
ensuring that the vehicle is smoothly redirected.

b)
Wire rope
barrier can be
repaired
quickly and
only damaged
posts are
to be replaced. High tension 3 rope or 4 rope wire system confirming the
requirements of EN 1317-2 for higher containment Level of H2 shall be used.
Typical details of wire rope barrier are given in Fig. 9.14 and wire rope barrier
with ropes interwoven are also presented in Fig. 9.15. The wire rope barrier
shall be the proprietary product of an approved manufacture and test result
shall conform to EN 1317 Part 2.
End treatment
: The end treatment shall be as per the manufactures details
conforming to EN 1317 Part 2. The Wire rope to W-beam transition shall be
done Modified Eccentric Loader Terminal (MELT) arrangement as shown
in
Fig. 9.16. The termination of Wire rope to a
rigid or concrete barrier or a
parapet shall be avoided and there shall be a transition from wire rope to

Placement
: The placement
of the Wire Rope
Safety
Barrier
shall be
determined by the design engineer and
shall be a combination
of the
deflection ratios of the barrier and the site-specific conditions. The barrier
shall be placed as far away from the traffic as possible and shall preferably
have uniform clearance. The
lateral slope of surface between
traffic way
and wire rope safety shall always be flatter than 10:1 so that vehicle bumper
trajectory will not change before an errant vehicle hit the wire rope.
When Wire Rope Safety Barrier is provided
in front of a hazard,
it shall be
so located caters to the deflection specified by the manufacture. The barrier
shall be extended at full height not less than 30 m in advance of the hazard
on the approach side, and shall continue at full height for 7.5 m beyond the
hazard on the departure side. The minimum length of fence shall be no less
than 50 m.
If there is a hazard present in the deflection area of the barrier,
then the distance between fence and the hazard shall not be less than that
deflection values described by the manufacture and will depend upon the
post spacing.
90



======================================================================
PAGE 103 of 160
======================================================================
IRC:SP:87-2013
There shall be at least 1 m setback distance between wire rope safety barrier
and the start of drop or embankment slope. While installing wire rope on a
highway carrying two/three-wheelers and other small vehicles, the deflection
as specified by the manufacturer shall be maintained as set back distance
from the start of drop or embankment. The deflection can be reduced by closer
post spacing, however the minimum setback distance shall be ensured. Wire
rope can be installed for curves radii more than 450 m only.
The Wire Rope Safety Barrier shall not be permitted in following situations:
•
Where a hazard
is present within the deflection area of the fence.
•
Where total fence length is less than 50 m.
•
On a horizontal curves of radius 450 m or less.
•
On vertical sag curves of radius less than 3 km.
•
Where rate of change in setback is steeper than
1
in 10.
9.7.5
Median barriers
i)
General
: Head-on-collisions, especially on highways with narrow medians,
caused by out-of-control vehicles jumping across the medians are a major
source of accidents. Fixed objects on medians also require shielding from
the traffic flow. Provision of median safety barrier
in such conditions
is an
important requirement.
ii)
Warrants
: For
all multilane highways where adequate land
is available,
it
is preferable to provide wide depressed medians having width of 7 m or
more but with W-beam metal crash barrier or wire rope safety barrier at the
edges of the median. Considering the vehicle trajectory over kerbs, when
safety barrier are to be installed along an existing multilane highways with
raised medians,
it shall be placed in such a way that vehicle bumper would
hit direcfly on the safety barrier than flrst with the raised median kerb. The
maximum lateral distance between vertical face of raised kerb and W-beam
shall not be more than 100 mm. Wire ropes are ideally suited in depressed or
flushed median situations in a mutii lane highway owing to their double side
nature and also not allowing crossover as wire rope never snaps. However,
while applying wire rope on a narrow flushed median,
it shall be placed at
the centre of flushed median, ensuring the sufficient deflection distance from
both
traffic way. The spacing of posts and the deflection stipulated by the
manufacture shall be strictly adhered. The placement of Beam and wire rope
barrier on median sides are pictorially presented in Fig. 9.13.
Median barriers shall also be provided to shield flxed objects
in a narrow
median.
If necessary, median barriers shall be flared to encompass a fixed
object, which may be a light post, foundation of overhead signs, bridge pier
etc.

iii)
Types of median barriers
: There are four types of median safely barrier
viz., W-beam type steel
barrier, (Strong post type), Thrie beann type steel
barrier, (Strong post type), Concrete barriers. Wire Rope safety barrier with
closer post spacing.
9. 7. 5. 1
Steel median barriers
Design aspects
: The W-beam barrier shall be similar to the roadside barrier described
in
para 9.7.2 (a).
The Thrie beam barrier shall be similar to the roadside barrier described in para 9.7.2 (a).
Placement
: Steel beam crash barrier shall be placed at both the edges of median along the
carriageway. The lateral placement and end treatment of W-Beam at median location as given
in Fig. 9.11 shall be followed. The Modified Eccentric Loader Terminal (MELT) arrangement
on approach side and Trailing Terminal (TT) arrangement on departure side shall be adopted
for W-beam end treatment in median location also.
9. 7. 5. 2
Concrete median barriers
Design aspects
: Concrete median barrier shall be New Jersey type. These should be used
in case of narrow medians of two meter or less along with an anti-glare screen for avoidance
of headlight glare. The concrete barrier cannot be altered easily, hence rigid barrier shall be
provided
in narrow median
in urban location to prevent pedestrian intrusion and other side
friction. The terminating end of the median barrier shall be tapered in a length of 8 to 9 m.
Placement
: Concrete median barrier shall be placed at both the edges of median along the
carriageway.
9.7.5.3
Wire rope median barrier
Design aspects
: The design aspects given in para 9.7.4 (a) will be applicable for wire rope
at median location.
Placement
: The requirements covered
in para 9.7.4 (c) for wire rope will be applicable for
median barrier also. Also, when Wire Rope Safety Barrier
is placed between two adjacent
carriageways which are at the same level,
it shall be placed at the center of the median with
deflection area not be less than that deflection values described by the manufacture from
either side of the fence.
In case of two carriageways which are at different levels,
it shall be
at both sides of the median edge. In the case of a split median,
it shall be on the carriageway
of higher side. Wire rope barrier for median location can be adopted as long as the median
is not raised and allowable deflection can be kept from both
traffic way sides as given
in
Fig. 9.13. The end treatment presented
in para 9.7.4 (b) will be applicable for wire rope at
median location also.
9.7.6
General
Raised kerbs or drains shall not be provided between the traveled way and the barriers.
These destabilize the vehicle balance and disturb its equilibrium before
it strikes the barrier,
92

(concrete/steel as specified in Schedule 'B' or Safety Audit Report).
The requirements of Safety Barriers for structures are given in para 7.17 of this Manual.
9.8
Road Boundary Stones (RBS)
Road boundary stones shall be provided at the boundary on both sides of the Right of Way.
These shall be spaced at 50 m. The boundary stones shall be of cement concrete as per
Type Design given in IRC:25. The boundary stones shall be painted with cement primer and
enamel paint and marked 'RBS' by paint.
9.9
Work Zone Traffic Management Plans (WTMPs)
The
traffic diversion plan during construction
shall be prepared as per IRC:SP:55 for the
entire project highway. Separate traffic diversion plan shall be prepared for structures and CD
works. Fig. 9.18 gives a typical Work Zone Traffic Management Plan (WTMP) for an existing
4-lane to 6-laning project. Once the service roads are completed, traffic will be diverted in to
them so that main 6-lane can be developed as given
in Fig. 9.19. Typical Work Zone Traffic
Management Plan given IRC:SP:55 for various scenarios shall be adopted, tailor-made to the
site condition. The traffic management is applicable during operational period also. Fig. 9.20
give traffic diversion when one lane of a carriageway is affected for some maintenance work,
whereas Fig. 9.21 gives the traffic diversion and safety arrangement when both carriageways
are affected for major maintenance work.

SECTION -11
LANDSCAPING AND TREE PLANTATION
11.1
General
The Concessionaire shall planttrees and shrubs of required number and type atthe appropriate
locations within the Right of Way and in the land earmarked by the Authority for afforestation
keeping
in view the IRC Guidelines on Landscaping and Tree Plantation. The Authority will
specify the number of trees which are required 10 be planted by the Concessionaire as
compensatory afforestation or otherwise. The Concessionaire shall also maintain the trees
and shrubs in good condition during the Concession Period as per the maintenance schedule.
The guidelines given in this Section shall be followed in plantation of trees and shrubs.
11.2
Design Considerations in Various Locations
11.2.1
Set-back distance of trees and other plantation
Trees on the roadside shall be sufficiently away from the roadway so that they are not a
hazard to road
traffic or restrict the
visibility. Most vulnerable locations
in this regard are
the inside of curves, medians, junction corners and cut slopes. Trees shall be placed at a
minimum distance of 14 m from the centre line of the extreme traffic lane to provide recovery
area for the vehicle that runs off the road. A second row of trees 6 m further away will also
be planted wherever possible. Preferably the first row of trees shall consist of species with
thick shade and other rows of vertical type providing thin shade. The distances for alternative
rows of trees shall be reckoned from the nearest edge of the unidirectional carriageway. No
plantation shall be allowed on the embankment slopes.
11.2.2
Set-bacl< of trees on curves
Experience has been that growth of thick vegetation close to the formation on
inside of
horizontal curve leads to serious reduction of sight distance and causes avoidable accidents
with cattle/children suddenly emerging from the side. Uncontrolled trees/vegetation may also
affect visibility of traffic control devices and road signs. Therefore, in plain terrain a stopping
sight distance of 180 m corresponding to the design speed of 100 km per hour may be
ensured on
all curved sections of the Project Highway along the innermost lane. However,
where there are site restrictions their requirement may be reduced to 130 m corresponding to
the design speed of 80 km per hour as a special case. The existing trees and vegetation on
the sides have to be suitably thinned/trimmed, or even removed
if necessary and a regular
programme of pruning of the offending trees shall be undertaken as part of the maintenance
operations.
In all cases, location of trees shall be checked to ensure that clear vision of all highway signs/
signals
is available at all times to the motorists. Also, the foliage or trees shall not come in
the way of roadway lighting.

PAGE 119 of 160
======================================================================
IRC:SP:87-2013
1 1 .2.3
Vertical clearance of trees and other plantations
For safe
traffic operation,
the
vertical clearance
available across the roadway
shall be
minimum 5 m. From this angle, the probable size of all plants shall be anticipated in advance,
at the time of initial planting. To allow for the effects of growth, wind and rain, the trees shall
be trimmed to 6 m and 6.5 m above the pavement in rural and urban areas respectively.
11.2.4
Plantation in medians
In the sections of the Project Highway where median width
is more than 2.5 m, shrubs shall
be planted and maintained to cut off headlight glare from
traffic
in the opposite direction.
Flowering plants and shrubs are eminently suited for the purpose. These shall be planted
either in continuous rows or in the form of baffles. The height of shrubs shall be maintained
at
1 .5 m to cut off the effect of traffic lights coming from the opposite direction.
In the sections, where the width of median
is less than 2.5 m, shrubs or flowery plants may
be planted
in between crash barriers or other means like plastic strips to cut off glare shall
be provided.
The shape of shrubs and plants shall be suitably regulated so that there
is no overgrowth
either vertically or horizontally beyond the edge of the median.
In the vicinity of road intersections and median openings, median plantation shall be avoided
or restricted to low-growing varieties to ensure adequate visibility.
1 1 .2.5
Spacing of avenue trees
The spacing of avenue trees
will depend on the type and growth characteristics of trees,
requirement of maintenance, penetration of distant views,
etc. A range of 10-15 m would
meet the requirement for most varieties.
1 1 .2.6
Choice of trees
The following guidelines shall be kept
in view while selecting the species of trees to be
planted:
i)
Trees
shall be selected with due regard to
soil,
rainfall, temperature and
water level.
11)
Trees which become very wide shall be avoided as their maintenance would
cause interference with traffic flow.
iii)
The species must be capable of developing a straight and clean bole up to a
height of 2.5 to 3.5 m from the ground level.
iv)
The selected trees shall, preferably, be fast growing and wind-firm. These
shall not be thorny or drop too many leaves.
v)
The trees shall be deep rooted, as shallow roots injure Pavements.
107



======================================================================
PAGE 120 of 160
======================================================================
IRC:SP:87-2013
vi)
In urban areas, the species selected shall be of less spreading type, so that
these do not interfere with overhead services, clear views of signs/signals,
and efficiency of roadway lighting.
11.3
Landscape Treatment
A suitable landscape treatment with provision of fountains and coloured
lighting so as to
enhance the overall aesthetics duly designed by a qualified and experienced landscaping
architect, shall be provided at grade separators, elevated sections, viaducts, traffic islands.

will be required to have a non-changeable and unique Tag
ID, which
must be read by the Transceiver at the point-of-sale.
136



======================================================================
PAGE 149 of 160
======================================================================
IRC:SP:87-2013
3.1.2
At the time of commissioning, the point-of-sale module shall read the unique Tag
ID and allocate an EPC code & a randomly generated initiation code.
It shall then write the
EPC, code, vehicle registration number, vehicle class code and the
initiation code
in the
EPC, memory area using the software module provided. The Tag
ID, EPC code, Vehicle
registration number, the vehicle class code and
initiation code shall also be stored
in the
central database.
3.2
Tag initiation
3.2.1
Tag initiation will be a process carried out during Tag commissioning or when the
original owner suspects a cloning of the Tag.
3.2.2
In the first case, the Tag initiation software shall generate a random initiation code,
write in the Tag and store in the central database as mentioned in 4.1.2.
Each time a Tag
is read by the Transceiver for Tag commissioning, a new
initiation code
will be generated, written on the Tag and stored
in the central database along with other
information.
3.2.3
In the second case, the Tag initiation software shall generate a random initiation
code and read Tag ID, EPC code, vehicle registration number & vehicle class code from the
Tag mounted on the windshield. After due verification from the central database, the value of
initiation code shall be updated on the Tag as well as on the central database. Old initiation
code and EPC code shall be marked for special handling for 'catching' the clone as and when
the cloned Tag comes into contact with Transceivers at the toll gates.
