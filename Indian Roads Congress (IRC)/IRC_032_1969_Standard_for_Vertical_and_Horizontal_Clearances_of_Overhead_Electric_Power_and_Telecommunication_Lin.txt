STANDARD
I OR VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL
CLEARANCES OF OVERHEAD ELECTRIC POWER
AND TELECOMMUNICATION LINES AS RELATED
TO ROADS
1.
INTRODUCTION
1.1.
The
"Standard
for Vertical and Horizontal Clearances
of
Overhead
Electric
Power
and
Telecommunication
Lines
as
Related
to
Roads
1
was
prepared by the Specifications and Stand-
ards
Committee and
later
discussed
by
the
Council
in
their
meeting
held at Trivandrum in September
1966.
The suggestions
made by the members
of
the
Council
were
considered
by
the
Specifications
and
Standards Committee at their various meetings
and
the
revised
standard
was
approved
by
the
Executive
Committee
in
their
meeting
held
on
the
1 3th
March. 1969 and
then by
the Council in their 7 1st meeting held at
Bhubaneswar on
the 26th and
27th
May, 1969 for being published as an approved
standard of the Indian Roads Congress.
1.2.
Overhead
electric
power and telecommunication lines
crossing a road or running within the road land should be provided
with adequate clearances so that safe use of the road
is not affected.
It
is
necessary to fix standards for these clearances in accordance
with the maximum permissible dimensions of vehicles.
1.3.
Some
of
the
Central
and
State Government Depart-
ments have issued executive directives in this matter, but there
is a
lack of uniformity in these
directives.
Standards
regarding
hori-
zontal
and
vertical
clearances
are
suggested
here
for
uniform
adoption on
all roads throughout the country.
2.
SCOPE
2.1.
These standards shall apply to overhead electric
power
and telecommunication lines erected
within
the
road
land.
The
standards
shall not apply to overhead power lines meant for tram
cars and trolley buses.
2.2.
The
standards
shall
not
be taken to confer authority
for over-riding any statutory provisions on the subject.

DEFINITIONS
3.1.
Vertical
clearance is the clear vertical distance between
carriageway crown and the lowest point of any overhead conductor
installation
which includes the conductor wire, bearer wire, guard
wire, stay wire, guard cradle, or screen.
The lowest point
should
be
determined
after
accounting
for the maximum possible sag in
the lowest member of the conductor installation.
3.2.
Horizontal clearance is the horizontal distance, measured
at right angles to road alignment, between roadway or
carriageway
edge
and
a
pole
carrying
an
overhead
utility line, or any pole-
supporting structure.
4.
VERTICAL CLEARANCES
4.1.
.Minimum
vertical- clearances for different categories of
overhead conductor installations shall be as under
:
(i) For
ordinary wires and lines carrying
very low voltage
upto
and
including
110
volts,
e.g.,
telecommunication
lines
5.5 metre
(ii) For
electric
power
lines
carrying
voltage
upto
and
including
650
volts
6.0 metre
(iii) For
electric
power
lines
carrying
voltage exceeding 650 volts
6.5 metre
These
clearances
have
been
fixed taking into consideration
the overall height of vehicles and the
statutory
provisions
of the
Indian Electricity Rules.
4.2.
Guard
cradle or screen should be provided for electric
power lines carrying voltage exceeding 110 volts while crossing
the
highway.
The
cradle
should extend desirably over the full right-
of -way.
However, guards may be omitted
in
the
case
of extra
high
voltage
lines
strung on self-supporting towers designed with
adequate factor of safety.
4.3.
In urban areas, in consideration of local factors such as
temple cars, tazia
processions,
fire-fighting
equipment,
etc.,
the
competent
authority may
prescribe
higher clearances than those
specified above.

HORIZONTAL CLEARANCES
5.1.
Poles
carrying overhead power and telecommunication
lines shall, excepting the
urban
areas,
be
erected
at
least
10.0
metres away
from the nearest edge of the roadway, provided also
that these are at a minimum distance of 5.0 metres from the
near-
est
line
of avenue
trees.
In
case
of roads having, at present, a
narrower roadway than that prescribed in the standards
in
force,
this
horizontal
clearance
shall be reckoned from what will be the
ultimate edge of the roadway after widening to the said
standards.
5.2.
The standards for horizontal clearance laid down above
shall not apply to roads situated in mountainous country.
In
such
areas,
poles should be erected preferably on the valley side, and as
far away from the edge of the road as
practicable.
5.3.
The horizontal clearances in respect of poles erected for
the purpose of street lighting shall be as under
:
5.4.
The
clearances
given
in
para 5.3 shall apply to poles
carrying electric power and telecommunication lines in urban situa-
tions.
5.5.
The
clearances mentioned in paras 5.1 and 5.3 shall be
deemed to apply not only to poles
but
pole-supporting
structures
as well.
6.

illustrates the standards specified above.
(i) For
roads
with
raised
kerbs
Minimum
300
mm from the
edge of the raised kerb; 600 mm
being preferable.
(ii) For roads without
raised kerbs
At
least
1.5
metre
from
the
edge of the carriageway, subject
to minimum
of 5.0
metre from
the centre line
of the carriage-
way.
