Introduction
The “Manual of Specifications and Standards for Six Laning of Highways through Public 
Private Partnership” was first published in 2010 and subsequently revised in 2013. The Project 
Preparation, Contract Management, Quality Assurance & Public Private Partnership Committee 
(G-1) felt the necessity to revise this document and accordingly constituted a sub-group under the 
convenorship of Shri M.P. Sharma with Shri Ashok Kumar, Col. A.K. Bhasin, Shri Nirmaljit Singh, 
Shri A.V. Sinha & Shri P.L. Bongirwar as members to review the Manual. The draft revision was 
discussed in a number of meetings by G-1 Committee before approving the same in its meeting 
held on 6th October, 2018 for placing before the General Specifications & Standards Committee 
(GSS) for consideration. The GSS Committee in its meeting held on 24th October, 2018 approved 
this document for placing before the Council for consideration and approval. The Council in 
its 216th meeting held at Nagpur (Maharashtra) on 22nd November, 2018 approved the draft 
revision of “Manual of Specifications & Standards for Six Laning of Highways” for printing. The 
Sub-Group received inputs from Shri Jacob George in drafting Sections on Road Safety and 
Cross-section drawings which is duly acknowledged.

Section 1
General
1.1	
This Manual describes the planning, standards, design, construction, maintenance, 
operation, safety and environmental requirements to be fulfilled in execution of the works of [ ] 
under a concession or Contract agreement and shall be read harmoniously and in conjunction 
with the latter.
This Manual is applicable for widening of highways from 4-lane to 6-lane through Public 
Private Partnership (PPP) mode. The general planning aspects laid out in this manual shall be 
applicable for widening from 2/4-lane to 6-lane or new construction of 6-lane highways. The 
scope of the work shall be as defined in the Concession Agreement. This Manual shall be read 
harmoniously with the intent of the Concession Agreement. The Manual may also be used for 
non-PPP projects.
1.2	
The Project Highway and the project facilities shall conform to the requirements of 
design and specifications set out in this Manual, which are the minimum prescribed. The project 
report and other information provided by the Authority shall be used by the Concessionaire only 
for its own reference and for carrying out further investigations. The Concessionaire shall be 
solely responsible for undertaking all the necessary surveys, investigations and detailed designs 
in accordance with Good Industry Practice with due diligence, and shall have no claim against 
the Authority for any loss, damage, risk, costs, liabilities or obligations arising out of or in relation 
to the project report and other information provided by the Authority.
1.3	
At least 2 weeks prior to commencement of the work, the Concessionaire shall draw 
up a Quality Assurance Manual (QAM) covering the Quality System (QS), Quality Assurance 
Plan (QAP) and documentation for all aspects of the bridge and road works, which shall 
include the Standard Operating Procedures which the Concessionaire, his personnel, his 
Contractors and their sub-contractors shall follow during execution and send three copies of 
each to the Independent Engineer (IE) for review. The class of quality assurance shall be as per 
IRC:SP:112-2017 “Manual for Quality Control in Road and Bridge Works.”
1.4	
The Codes, Standards, Technical Specifications and Guidelines applicable for the 
design and construction of project components are: 
	
i)	
Indian Roads Congress (IRC) Codes, Standards and Guidelines. 
	
ii)	
Specifications for Road and Bridge Works issued by the Ministry of Road 
Transport & Highways (MoRTH) hereinafter referred to as MoRTH or Ministry’s 
Specifications. 
	
iii)	
Any other standards referred to in the Manual and any supplement issued with 
the bid document.
1.5	
The version of the Codes, Standards, Specifications, etc. notified/published at least 
60 days before the last date of bid submission shall be considered applicable.
1.6	
The terms ‘Ministry of Surface Transport’, ‘Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport & 
Highways’ and ‘Ministry of Road Transport and Highways’ or any successor or substitute thereof 
shall be considered as synonymous.



======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 220
======================================================================
IRC:SP:87-2019

1.7	
a)	
The terms ‘Inspector’ and ‘Engineer’ used in MoRTH Specifications shall be 
deemed to be substituted by the term “Independent Engineer” for PPP projects 
to the extent, it is consistent with the provisions of the Concession Agreement 
and this Manual. The role of the Independent Engineer shall be as defined in the 
Concession Agreement.
	
b)	
In case of EPC contracts the term ‘Independent Engineer’ shall be replaced by 
‘Authority Engineer’ and the terms ‘Concessionaire’ and ‘Concession Agreement’ 
shall be replaced by ‘Contractor’ and ‘Contract Agreement’ respectively.
1.8	
In the event of any conflict or inconsistency in the provisions of the applicable IRC 
Codes, Standards or MoRTH Specifications, the provisions contained in this Manual shall prevail.
1.9	
This Manual generally provides for design and construction as per Codes, Standards, 
Specifications, Guidelines, etc. as published by IRC, MoRTH and BIS for road and bridge works. 
Where the Concessionaire intends to use an alternative to these Standards and Guidelines for 
delivering an equal or better product, he shall be permitted to use such alternative subject to the 
following conditions:
	
i)	
He shall demonstrate that the proposed alternative conforms to any of the 
following International Standards, Codes of Practice, Specifications, Guidelines, 
etc.
	
a)	
American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials 
(AASHTO)
	
b)	
American Society for Testing of Materials (ASTM)
	
c)	
Euro Codes and British Codes
	
ii) 	
In case the Concessionaire intends to use any alternative material, technology/
method, whether patented or otherwise, that is not specifically covered in the 
Indian or International Standards as listed above, but the use of which has been 
permitted on similar projects (similar in category of road, traffic and climatic 
conditions) as the Project Highway, he would be permitted its use on certification 
by the owners of such similar projects regarding the continued successful 
performance of such materials, technologies, methods, procedures or processes 
for design life of the project. Such a certification shall be supported with details 
of critical performance parameters.
1.10	
All items of building works shall conform to Central Public Works Department (CPWD) 
Specifications for Class 1 building works and standards given in the National Building Code (NBC). 
To the extent specific provisions for building works are made in IRC/MoRTH Specifications, the 
same shall prevail over the CPWD/ NBC provisions. For this purpose, building works shall be 
deemed to include toll plaza complex, road furniture, road side facilities, landscape elements 
and/or any other works incidental to the building works.
1.11	
Alternative Standards and Specifications
	
a)	
Where alternative Standards and Specifications are intended to be used 
in accordance with Para 1.9, all such proposals shall be submitted by the 
Concessionaire to the Independent Engineer together with certification and 
details mentioned in Para 1.9. In case, the Independent Engineer is of the opinion 



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 220
======================================================================
IRC:SP:87-2019
4
that the proposal submitted by the Concessionaire is not in conformity with any 
of the International Standards or Codes or evidence by successful performance, 
then he will record his reasons and convey the same to the Concessionaire 
for compliance. A record shall be kept by the Independent Engineer, of non-
compliance, if any, by the Concessionaire. Adverse consequences, if any 
arising from adoption of any such alternative proposals shall be treated as 
“Concessionaire Default” and shall be dealt in accordance with the provisions of 
the Concession Agreement.
	
b)	
Provisions under Para 1.9 and 1.11 (a) above shall also be applicable for EPC 
projects unless specified otherwise in the “Agreement”.
1.12	
Guidelines for Preparing Schedules of the Concession Agreement
Certain paras (fully or part) in Sections 1 to 14 of this Manual refer to the Schedules of the 
Concession Agreement. While finalizing the feasibility/project report for the Project Highway, 
and the scope of the project, each of these Paras should be carefully examined and addressed 
by the Authority with a view to make appropriate provisions in the Schedules of the Concession 
Agreement. A list of such para is enclosed at Appendix 2.
1.13	
General considerations for Planning, Design and Construction
The objective of planning a 6-lane highway shall be to ensure that the long distance through 
traffic is able to operate at a speed dictated only by the flow on the main highway and not by 
any other factors, such as interference from local traffic, access traffic or cross traffic. The traffic 
having short distance or local O&D, access traffic and cross traffic shall be separated from 
the long distance through traffic. Service road shall be provided in continuous length on both 
sides. Unless otherwise specified in Schedule ‘B’, the continuity will be broken (i) at locations 
of major bridges, (ii) at locations of toll plaza in a length of 1 km, (iii) in areas where no cross 
traffic or access traffic is expected (e.g. forest/ghat areas, uninhabited areas, etc.) provided that 
the length of such section is not less than one km. The service roads shall be connected to the 
main highway through properly designed entry/exit ramps at locations given in Schedule ‘B’. 
Traffic needing access to the main highway shall first come on to the service road and then join 
the main highway through an acceleration lane/entry ramp, Similarly, all traffic exiting the main 
highway shall first come on to the service road through a deceleration lane/exit ramp from where 
it would distribute to the local road network for various destinations. However, when there is no 
settlement or road side development abutting the Project Highway or the connecting roads are 
spaced more than 2 km, service roads may not be necessary and access can be given directly 
through acceleration/deceleration lanes. The existing direct access to the highway shall also be 
modified accordingly. The locations of service roads and entry/exit ramps shall be specified in 
Schedule ‘B’. 
The existing alignment and grade shall be followed, as far as possible and widening of the 
carriageway shall be done depending upon the site situation by adding a lane, either on the 
inside or outside of the existing carriageway. The new 6-lane highway, as far as possible, shall fit 
into the existing 4-lane section without rendering in fructuous the existing 4-lane facilities unless 
essential or required to fulfill the requirements laid down in this Manual. The improvements 
required shall be carried out within the available and proposed Right of Way (ROW).
The objective therefore is to construct a 6-lane highway for all road users as an active infrastructure

facility for people for their safety and services and as a catalyst in development of economy 
based on an inclusive approach.
General considerations shall, without being limited to, be as follows:-
	
a)	
The Constraints
	
	
The physical constraints in the existing highway are in the form of limitation of 
right of way, un-regulated access, inadequate service roads and underpasses, 
numerous at-grade junctions, lack of physical separation between local and 
through traffic etc. The operation constraints arise out of the necessity or 
possibility of closing a portion of the road for construction and/or diverting the 
traffic to temporary diversions, thereby reducing the capacity and safety of the 
existing highway. The solutions evolved by the Concessionaire shall be such 
that these operational constraints are overcome through appropriate planning, 
design and construction method, techniques and technologies and by adopting 
suitable traffic management measures.
	
b)	
Safety of Design
	
	
All designs shall be safe to ensure that the Project Highway or any part thereof 
(for example embankment, pavement, retaining structures, bridges, culverts, 
etc.) does not collapse (global stability) nor its serviceability/performance (for 
example settlement, roughness, undulations, deflections, etc.) deteriorates 
below acceptable level as prescribed in Schedule ‘K’ of the Concession 
Agreement.
	
c)	
Durability
	
	
The Project Highway shall not only be safe but also durable. This would mean 
that the deteriorating effects of climate and environment (for example wetting 
and drying, freezing and thawing, if applicable, temperature differences, 
aggressive environment leading to corrosion, etc.) in addition to the traffic shall 
be duly considered in design and construction to make the Project Highway 
durable.
	
d)	
Mitigating Disruptive Effects of Construction
	
	
The planning, design and construction of the highway shall be such that 
the construction of Project Highway does not have adverse impact on the 
environment and does not disrupt the lives and business activities of the people 
living close to the Project Highway.

Section 3
INTERSECTIONS AND GRADE SEPARATORS
3.1	
Introduction
3.1.1	
As mentioned in Paras 1.13 and 2.12, there shall be no direct access to the main 
highway and all access shall be from service roads which shall be provided on both sides of the 
main highway and interconnected through underpasses, overpasses or grade separators. The 
existing direct access to the highway shall be closed and alternative access through service 
roads only shall be provided.
3.1.2	
The exit and entry arrangement before and after a grade separator shall also be 
treated as part of the development of grade separator intersection
3.2	
At-Grade Intersections
3.2.1	
There shall be no at-grade intersection of any road with the carriageway, but only with 
the service road. The intersection of the Project Highway with another National Highway (NH) or 
State Highway (SH) shall be grade separated. The existing direct intersections shall be closed 
and remodeled accordingly. The intersecting roads other than those mentioned above, shall be 
designed to facilitate all movements in following manner:
	
a)	
Through underpass/overpass for crossing the Project Highway and then right 
turn through a ramp to merge with the Project Highway or service road if provided 
as per this Manual, or
	
b)	
By merging with service road and crossing through the next available vehicular 
underpass.
There shall be interconnection between the service roads of both sides through underpasses 
which will facilitate cross movement of local traffic from one side to the other side and to facilitate 
change of direction of through traffic. Accordingly, the intersections on the service road including 
those at underpasses shall be designed for safe movements for all turnings.
3.2.2	
The design of different elements of intersection shall be done as per IRC:SP:41 
“Guidelines on Design of At-grade Intersections in Rural and Urban Areas” including other criteria 
given in this Manual.
	
i)	
The design shall aim at simplicity and uniformity in design standards. Complex 
designs which may involve complicated decision making by drivers shall be 
avoided.
	
ii)	
The intersection control shall be of ‘Stop Control’ unless specified otherwise. 
This will mean that traffic on the cross road must stop prior to entering the service 
road.
	
iii)	
The traffic control by “STOP” or by “GIVEWAY” signs and pavement markings 
shall be decided based on the guidance given in IRC:67 and IRC:35. The visibility 
funnel given in IRC:35 shall be encumbrance free to ensure the mutual visibility 
between traffic plying in the service road/through road and that approach from 
side road.



======================================================================

iv)	
At the intersection, the alignment of project highway shall be as straight and 
the gradient as flat as practicable. Gradients in excess of 2 per cent will not be 
allowed at intersections.
	
v)	
The alignment and grade of intersecting roads shall be corrected to improve 
traffic conditions and safety. The intersecting roads shall be regraded, if required 
so that at least 30 m length of the intersecting road beyond junction is at the 
same level as that of main carriageway at the junction. The side road gradient 
even for the insignificant minor road that joins the service road at least for the 
length that falls within the visibility funnel shall be near to flat gradient.
	
vi)	
The sight distance to be adopted shall be at least twice the safe stopping sight 
distance as specified in Section 2.
	
vii)	
At multi leg intersections, the points of conflict should be studied carefully and 
possibilities of realigning one or more of the intersecting legs and combining 
some movements to reduce the conflicting movements shall be examined.
The objective shall be to simplify the design and appropriate control devices added to ensure 
more efficient and safe operation. The channelizing islands shall start from the edge of the 
paved shoulder.
3.2.3	
Design standards 
Design standards shall be as per IRC:SP:41. Salient features are given below:
	
i)	
Design Speed: The approach speed shall be taken as the design speed 
adopted for the section of Project Highway on which the intersection is located. 
The design speed for various elements of the intersection shall be taken as 60% 
of the approach speed.
	
ii)	
Design Traffic Volume: The traffic volume for the design of intersection and 
its distribution at peak hours shall be assessed, up to the operation period, 
taking into consideration the past trend, likely new development of land, socio- 
economic changes, etc.
	
iii)	
Design Vehicle: Semi-trailer combination (refer IRC:3) shall be used in the 
design of intersections.
	
iv)	
The number of lanes to be provided at the intersection shall be governed by 
peak hour traffic volume in each direction of travel and shall be determined 
based on the projected traffic for the year in which further capacity augmentation 
is considered. The minimum width of carriageway and slip road in junction area 
shall be as indicated in the junction layouts. Widening of carriageway shall be 
achieved depending upon the approach speed of traffic and based on taper 
rate stipulated below. Generally desirable minimum taper shall be followed. In 
unavoidable situations, absolute minimum values given in the Table 3.1 can be 
adopted.

v)	
Type and radius of curve of intersection: The type and radii of curves would 
depend upon the types of vehicles turning at the intersection and shall be 
decided based on the traffic data.
	
vi)	
Visibility at intersection: A minimum twice safe stopping sight distance, 
appropriate for the approach speeds, shall be available for the traffic on the 
Project Highway.

3.3.5	
Detailed design and data for review by IE
The Concessionaire shall submit the details of the ground surveys, traffic data, traffic forecast, 
design and drawings of the grade separated intersections and the structures, showing all safety 
features, to the Independent Engineer for approval
3.4	
Grade Separated Intersections and Interchanges
3.4.1	
General
	
i)	
An Interchange is a grade-separated intersection with connecting roadways 
(ramps) for turning traffic between highway approaches. Such an Interchange 
will be necessary at all crossings of a highway, which is to be developed to 
completely access controlled standards. An Interchange may also be justified at 
locations where traffic on cross roads is heavy and when an At-grade intersection 
fails to handle the heavy volume of turning, merging and diverging traffic leading 
to excessive delays and fatal and major accidents. Cost effectiveness will decide 
whether to provide full Interchange or grade separated intersection without 
ramps.
	
ii)	
An Interchange may be justified at the crossing of the Project Highway with 
another highway, and where the total traffic on all the arms of the intersection is 
in excess of 10,000 PCUs in peak hour.
	
iii)	
The decision to provide Interchange at such locations shall be taken by the 
Authority and the requirement shall be clearly spelt out in Schedule ‘B’ of the 
Concession Agreement, which shall also indicate specifications and traffic 
streams to be grade separated.
	
v)	
The detailed design and layout of the Interchange shall conform to broad 
parameters and requirements specified by the Authority in Schedule ‘B’ of 
the Concession Agreement. Based on detailed survey and investigations, the 
Concessionaire shall develop appropriate detailed drawings and designs and 
submit to the Independent Engineer for review and comments, if any.
3.4.2	
Types of interchanges
	
i)	
Interchanges are generally described by the pattern of the various turning 
roadways or ramps, which determine their geometric configuration. The common 
geometric configurations of Interchanges are the trumpet, diamond, cloverleaf, 
rotary and directional. Within each type of Interchange, there can be several 
variations such as split diamond, partial cloverleaf, etc. depending on the ramp 
arrangements.
	
ii)	
The type of Interchanges, the shape and pattern of the Interchange ramps and 
loops and their designs shall be governed by factors such as the importance 
of the intersecting highway, the number of intersecting legs, the design 
volumes of through and turning traffic movements including their composition, 
the design speeds, available right of way and topography. The Interchange 
site shall be studied in detail and alternative designs made, to determine the 
most suitable arrangement of structures and ramps satisfying the specified 
requirements.

3.4.3	
Geometric design standards for interchange elements
The geometric design standards shall be as per IRC:92 appropriate for the design speed adopted 
for the Project Highway. The design speed for ramps shall not be less than 40 km per hour. 
The desirable values of various parameters given in IRC:92 shall be adopted, unless there are 
severe site constraints.
3.4.4	
Design traffic
The traffic volume for the design of various elements of Interchange including ramps shall 
be assessed up to the end of the Concession Period or twenty years, whichever is more, 
taking into consideration the past trends, likely new development of land, socio-economic 
changes, etc.

Design of structures shall conform to Section 7 of this Manual. Minimum length of viaduct and 
RCC Retaining Wall/RE wall required to be provided shall be specified in Schedule ‘B’. In case 
length of Retaining/RE wall is not specified in Schedule ‘B’ the same shall be deemed to be 
included in the scope of work and shall be provided as per site requirements.
3.4.6	
Lighting
Lighting requirement shall be as per Section 12 of this Manual. The top and underside of the 
grade separated structures and interchange area at the ground level upto 50 m beyond the point 
from centre on all legs of interchange/crossing both at top and bottom shall be provided with 
lighting.
3.5	
Traffic Control Devices

A suitable filter of granular material or geo-textile to act as filtration and separation 
layer shall be incorporated, where necessary, between the sub-grade and sub-
base to prevent clogging.
6.8	
Drainage for Structures
6.8.1	
Culverts and bridges
6.8.1.1	
For culverts and bridges provision of suitable cross slope/camber and down take 
pipes/spouts near the kerb, covered with gratings at the inlet points shall be provided at regular 
interval to facilitate rapid draining of water from the deck without any ponding. The length and 
location of these drainage spouts should be such that the water is not discharged on any bridge 
element.
6.8.1.2	
The bridges particularly those in high rainfall area shall preferably be built in longitudinal 
gradient with suitably designed cross drains at abutment locations to facilitate proper drainage.
6.8.2	
Grade separators/flyovers/road over bridges
6.8.2.1	
Effective drainage shall be provided both longitudinally and transversely. The 
transverse drainage shall be secured by means of suitable camber in the roadway surface. 
Longitudinal drainage shall be secured by means of scuppers, inlets, or other suitable means of 
sufficient size and numbers to drain the run-off efficiently.
6.8.2.2	
Efficient drainage of the deck structure shall be ensured by providing a suitably 
designed drainage arrangement consisting of drainage spouts connected to horizontal and 
vertical pipe system such that the water from the structure does not fall on the road, does not 
stagnate over the road or at entry and exit points of grade separated structure and is discharged 
into the draining system of the area. Care must be taken that the pipes are taken down in such 
a way that they are aesthetically pleasing.
6.8.2.3	
Typically, water spouts are provided at the kerbs at the rate of 1 No. per 12 sqm. of the 
surface in level portions and 1 No. per 15 sqm. of the surface area on gradients. Water spouts 
are connected to runner pipe of suitable diameter (minimum 100 mm) on either side of roadway 
and taken down by downtake pipes at pier & abutment locations.
6.8.2.4	
Drainage fixtures and downspouts shall be of rigid, corrosion resistant material not 
less than 100 mm as the least dimension and shall be provided with suitable cleanout fixtures.
6.8.2.5	
The arrangement of floor drains shall be such as to prevent the splashing of drainage 
water against any portion of the structure. Overhanging portions of concrete floors shall be 
provided with drip moulds.
6.8.2.6	
Catch water drains are necessary at the ends of viaduct portion so that water coming 
from grade separated structure does not over saturate and affect the earthen embankment. 
Similar catch water drains should be provided at the end of gradient so that water coming from 
the structure is properly let out to nearest drain.
6.8.2.7	
An integrated drainage plan for the water coming from the deck of structures, local 
catchment area of the project and all other sources should be prepared so that no water falls 
on any surface of the structures, or remain standing or flowing over the level roads. All the 
water is collected through sumps and finally discharged into the local drainage system i.e. storm 
water drain/pipes etc. either by gravity through connecting drains or by pumping into the existing 
outgoing drains.

6.8.2.8	
The rainwater from the deck of the structures usually does not flow transversely but 
flows on the high gradient slopes of the road or approaches and is collected in the valley curve 
portion. As such attention is to be paid to get this large quantity of water drained out fast without 
accumulating there causing problems for traffic flow resulting in traffic jams. The draining out 
systems should be designed with greater margins so as to avoid this problem, at least for grade 
separators, inside the cities or inhabited areas.
6.8.3	
Underpasses and subways
6.8.3.1	
Where rain water cannot flow into the drainage system by gravity due to the 
requirement of depressed road to get minimum head room, necessary provision for drainage by 
vertical drains and/or pumping shall be made so that there is no disruption of traffic through such 
location on account of water logging/flooding of underpass or subway.
6.9	
Existing Drains, Canals and Minor Waterways
6.9.1	
For the existing drains, canals and waterways, to be over passed by the highway, 
draining provisions shall be maintained and the effects of prolonged heavy rainfall must be 
catered for.
6.9.2	
Special attention shall be paid to the drainage channels carrying industrial waste and 
effluent in particular to those draining chloride contaminated effluents which are detrimental to 
the RCC structures.
6.9.3	
Adequate care shall be taken while crossing irrigation canals to prevent contamination 
of the flow in the canal by spillage from the highway.
6.9.4	
When highway runs parallel to existing channels, adequate measures shall be taken 
in the form of bank protection and channel alignment to avoid water build up or stagnation 
against the highway slope endangering the pavement drainage. The drainage channels at the 
toe of the highway may have to be adequately protected or reshaped for discharge in to these 
channels. Where the discharge from road drainage is not permitted, separate cross drainage 
structures are to be provided on both sides of such channel.

another two-lane bridge by the side of the existing bridge effectively 
providing four-lane bridge for a three-lane one way approach highway. 
Alternatively, the Concessionaire may propose some innovative solution 
viz., to dismantle existing superstructure and construct new three-lane 
superstructure to be supported by existing substructure and foundation 
if their condition is good and if, on review by IE, the proposal is found 
to be feasible and safe. The bridge for a width of minimum 3-lanes for 
each carriageway shall be ensured. The wearing course, bearings and 
rubberized component of expansion joints which are damaged or older

SECTION 9
TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES/ROAD SAFETY DEVICES/ROAD SIDE FURNITURE
9.1	
General
The multi-lane highways being built under various road development programmes are adopting 
the geometric standards specifications, signage, road markings etc. as per the provisions 
contained in the codes of practice and the standards of the Indian Roads Congress supported 
by the Ministry’s Specifications. However, accident data demonstrates that motorists leave the 
roadway for numerous reasons including errors of judgment. To ensure long term road safety 
on these highways, the following suitable engineering measure are considered essential for 
adoption so as to help in reducing risk of road crashes.
Traffic Control Devices, Road Safety Devices and Road Side Furniture shall comprise of 
road signs, road markings, object markers, hazard markers, studs, delineators, attenuators, 
safety barriers, pedestrian guard rails, boundary stones, km stones, etc. Guidelines given in 
IRC:8, IRC:25, IRC:26, IRC:35, IRC:67, IRC:79, IRC:103. IRC:119 and Section 800 of MoRTH 
Specifications shall be used for providing these items unless otherwise specified in this Section.
9.2	
Road Signs
The three types of road signs viz. mandatory/regulatory signs, cautionary/warning signs and 
informatory signs shall be provided as given in IRC:67 and Section 800 of MoRTH Specifications. 
Proper signs shall be provided for main carriageways, service and slip roads, toll plaza and 
other project highway facilities. Clustering and proliferation of road signs shall be avoided for 
enhancing their effectiveness.
9.2.1	
There shall be corresponding road markings with stop signs, give way signs, merging 
or diverging traffic signs, lane closed signs, road narrowing signs, slip roads/diversion signs, 
compulsory keep left/right signs, or any other signs as per IRC:67.
9.2.2	
The Specifications and Standards of road signs, which are not covered by IRC:67 
would be as per International Standards.
9.2.3	
All road signs shall be of Prismatic Grade Sheeting corresponding to Class C Sheeting 
described in IRC:67 and any of the sheeting Types VIII, IX or XI as per ASTM D 4956-09 fixed 
over Aluminum or Aluminum Composite Material. The sheeting for different type of signs can 
be chosen based on the selection guidance provided in IRC:67 depending upon the situation 
encountered by road users in viewing the signs. Sheeting with high coefficient of retro-reflection 
at small observation angle are for a road sign to be viewed by a driver from a long distance, 
whereas the sheeting with wide observation angle for better performance at short distance 
viewing. The Type XI sheeting will have better performance at short and medium distances. 
Micro prismatic sheeting of Type XI is preferred for gantry mounted overhead signs. Type IV 
micro prismatic sheeting can be used for delineator posts.
9.2.4	
Shoulder kerb mounted signs shall be supported on GI pipes. Overhead signs shall 
be placed on a structurally sound gantry or cantilever structure made of Gl pipes. Its height, 
lateral and vertical clearance for installation shall be as per the guidance provided in IRC:67 and 
also as per MoRTH specifications.

The road sign, traffic signal or any other device erected for traffic control, traffic 
guidance and or traffic information shall not obscure other traffic sign. Further, the signs and 
signals shall not carry any advertisement. Between two signs, there shall always more than 
0.6 x V meters distance (where V is the 85th percentile speed in kmph). Signs are normally 
erected on the shoulder side of the road; but due to terrain and abutting land use, for better 
visibility for drivers sign can be installed on median side also. For extra emphasis a second sign 
may be placed on the right side of the road as well for critical sections. 
9.2.7	
Wherever the Project Highway alignment is on a curve, there shall be advance

the safe negotiating speed for the particular curve shall be placed along with 
curve warning sign at both approaches. Generally, if the difference between the 
approach speed and permissible negotiating speed of any curve is more than 
15 kmph, the curve warning for an acute curve with speed limit sign shall be 
placed on shoulder side and median side also.
	
ii)	
The curves with radii 451 m to 750 m shall be installed with single Chevrons on 
outer edge of curve at 75 m spacing.

normal road studs are not that effective due to street lightings and other roadside activities.
9.6	
Traffic Impact Attenuators
The Traffic Impact Attenuators shall be provided at hazardous locations and gorge areas so as 
to act as energy absorber. The Traffic Impact attenuators or crash cushions shall be composed 
of W-beam fender panels supported by diaphragm with trigger mechanism or composed of sand 
barrels as per Clause 814 of the MoRTH Specifications and the Contractor/Supplier shall furnish 
the certificate that the system to be installed has been tested in accordance with the NCHRP 
350 and performs effectively at design speeds up to 100 kmph. The space requirement to shield 
a fixed object should be considered while designing and constructing the attenuators. Fig. 9.8 
shows the area that should be made available for crash attenuators installations. The design and 



======================================================================
PAGE 91 of 220
======================================================================
IRC:SP:87-2019
81
size of attenuators shall be as per International Standards. Following are the general criteria for 
providing crash attenuators:
	
a)	
The location where there is a history of more than average number of accidents 
involving vehicles impacting obstruction. 
	
b)	
The 85th percentile speed of traffic plying through the traffic lane adjacent to 
obstruction in diverge area is greater than 70 kmph. 
	
c)	
At location where the lane changing manoeuvering of vehicles are substantial. 
	
d)	
Traffic is required to travel in close proximity to the potential obstruction where it 
is not feasible to install safety barrier in front of it. 
	
e)	
The obstruction with high value and if damaged by vehicle impact will have 
serious consequences. 
	
f)	
The gorge areas of all diverging which are one level above ground.
The specific location shall be identified following the criteria given above and the type of crash 
attenuators will be based on severity of the situation and shall be indicated in Schedule ‘B’.
9.7	
Safety Barriers
There are two types of safety barriers viz., roadside safety barriers and median safety barriers.
9.7.1	
Roadside safety barriers
9.7.1.1	
There are three types of longitudinal roadside safety barriers viz:
	
i)	
Metal beam safety barrier which is semi-rigid type like i) “W” beam type steel 
barrier and ii) Thrie beam type steel barrier
	
ii)	
Concrete Safety barrier- Rigid type
	
iii)	
Wire Rope safety barrier, Flexible type
9.7.1.2	
The steel barriers with strong post type usually remain functional after moderate 
collisions, thereby eliminating the need for immediate repair. If damaged by a vehicle collision, 
both posts and rails of W-beam are to be repaired. Lack in maintenance can cause the W-beam 
rails to protrude into traffic way creating highly unsafe situation. The wire rope though technically 
complicated, can be repaired with minimum costs. Though initial installation cost is relatively 
high for concrete rigid barrier compare to W-beam and wire rope safety barriers, the repair 
and maintenance issues can be minimized greatly in concrete rigid barrier. The psychological 
shyness of drivers to keep away from the safety barrier will be the least in rigid concrete barrier 
compared to other types. Since rigid barriers will not yield under any vehicle impact, it shall be 
provided for bridges and ROBs and also to shield roadside objects/hazards where the required 
set back distance cannot be retained with wire rope and W-Beam (due to any site condition), as 
they are deflective in nature.
9.7.1.3	
W-beam and Thrie beam perform well on the outside of curves and even those of 
relatively small radius. W beam is used when the design vehicle is not the truck. Thrie beam 
is used in location where barrier is likely to hit regularly, as Thrie beam rail make it less prone 
to damage. Thrie beam should be installed at locations there is a higher probability of heavy 
vehicles impacts, as higher rail increases the ability to contain heavy vehicles.

9.7.1.4	
The warrants for roadside barriers are given below
	
i)	
Embankment height 3 m or more shall have safety barrier at the edge of 
formation. The height of embankment for installation for safety barrier shall be 
measured from the top of finished road level to bottom level of Original Ground 
Level (OGL) or invert level of ditch.
	
ii)	
Safety barrier shall be provided for all curves upto 450 m radii.
	
iii)	
Roadside obstacles such as bridge piers, abutments and railing ends, roadside 
rock mass, culverts, pipes and headwalls, cut slopes, retaining walls, lighting 
supports, traffic signs and signal supports, trees and utility poles shall be 
protected with safety barrier.
	
iv)	
Concrete barrier shall be provided at following situation
	
a)	
Where embankment is retained by a retaining structure (concrete).
	
b)	
On valley side of highway in mountainous and steep terrain (concrete).
	
c)	
Between main carriageway and footpath in bridges (concrete).
	
v)	
The metal beam and wire rope safety barrier shall not be installed upon a 
structure. For a safety barrier upon a structure, it shall be concrete rigid barrier. 
Wire Rope Safety Barrier shall not be used over major or minor bridges.
	
vi)	
Steel barriers shall be provided in non-built-up sections whereas concrete 
barriers shall be provided in built-up sections
	
vii)	
At hazardous locations identified in Schedule ‘C’ or through safety audit 
(concrete/steel as specified in Schedule ‘B’ or Safety Audit Report). 
	
viii)	 The requirements of Safety Barriers for structures are given in Para 7.17 of this Manual.
9.7.2	
Road side steel barriers
	
a)	
Design aspects : The W-beam type safety barrier consists of steel posts and a 
3 mm thick W-beam rail. There shall be a steel spacer block between the post 
and the beam to prevent the vehicle from snagging on the post, as the snagging 
can cause the vehicle to spin round. The steel posts and the blocking out spacer 
shall both be channel section of 75 mm x 150 mm size and 5 mm thick. The 
posts shall be spaced 2 m center to center. Fig. 9.9 gives the typical details 
of W-beam rail and splices and shall be procured and installed from a reputed 
manufacturer.
	
	
The Thrie beam safety barrier shall have posts and spacers similar to the ones 
mentioned above for W-beam type. The rail and splices design details for typical 
Thrie beam are shown in Fig. 9.10 and shall be from a reputed manufacturer. 
This barrier has higher initial cost than the W-beam type but is less prone to 
damages to vehicle collisions especially for shallow angle impacts.
	
	
The W-beam, the Thrie beam and the posts spacers and fasteners for steel 
barriers shall be galvanized by hot dip process and design elements and 
installations shall be as per the details shown for crash barrier in this manual 
so as to achieve the performance characteristics intended for W-beam. For 
any structural elements and details missing in this Manual for W-beam and its 
various end treatments, the details from international Guidelines/Manuals on 
W-beam which would conform to EN 1317 Part-2 can be adopted.

b)	
End treatment for steel barrier: If hit, an untreated end of the roadside barrier 
can be hazardous, because the barrier beam can penetrate the passenger 
compartment and cause the impact vehicle to stop abruptly. End treatments 
should, therefore, form an integral part of safety barriers and the end treatment 
should not spear vault or roll a vehicle for head on or angled impacts. The end 
treatment on approach shall be Modified Eccentric Loader Terminal (MELT) 
arrangement as shown in Fig. 9.11 and on departure side it shall be Trailing 
Terminal (TT) arrangement as shown in Fig. 9.12. Following the same end 
treatments, Fig. 9.13 present the typical layout of W-beam whether on raised 
median sides or on depressed/flushed median sides. The international practices 
shall be adopted for those details which are not available in this Manual for 
MELT and TT arrangements for the end treatment of W-beam.
	
	
The W-beam to concrete transition shall be carried out by decreasing the post 
spacing, nesting one rail behind another and using steel section behind the 
W-beam. The transition between W-beam and concrete barrier is detailed in 
Fig. 9.14.
	
c)	
Placement: The exact layout of the barrier shall be made by the design engineer 
keeping in view the lateral offset of the barrier and flare rate. The final layout 
shall be as site-specific combination of these factors.
	
i)	
The slope in front of W-beam shall be near to flat gradient so that safety 
barrier perform best when impacted by a vehicle and the slope of ground 
in front of barrier shall not be steeper than 10:1. Metal beam safety barrier 
installed on shoulder side, there shall be a lateral distance of at least 
0.75 to 1.0 m width from edge of paved portion (i.e. carriageway + paved 
shoulder) should be available without any obstacles. 
	
ii)	
On embankments, a minimum distance of 600 mm shall be maintained 
between the barrier and the start of embankment slope of a hazard to 
prevent the wheels from dropping over the edge. 
	
iii)	
Raised kerbs or drains shall not be provided between the traveled way 
and the barriers. These destabilize the vehicle balance and disturb its 
equilibrium before it strikes the barrier thus defeating the essential purpose 
of safety and redirection of the impacting vehicle. When a kerb exists on 
the edge of road and on close proximity of traffic lane whether on shoulder 
side or median side, face of W beam shall always be less than 100 mm 
from the vertical face of kerb. Fig. 9.15 gives the lateral clearance to be 
maintained in different situations. 
	
iv)	
When metal beam is installed for shielding an object, minimum distance as 
specified by the manufacturer for deflection shall be maintained from the 
object/hazard. The distance between the barrier and the hazard shall not 
be less than the deflection of the barrier by an impact of a full sized vehicle.
9.7.3	
Concrete roadside safety barriers
	
a)	
Design aspects: Roadside concrete safety barriers are rigid barriers having 
a sloped front face and a vertical back face. For uniformity New Jersey type 
concrete barriers should be used where necessary. The concrete barrier may 
be pre-cast in lengths of up to 6 m depending upon the feasibility of transport 



======================================================================
PAGE 97 of 220
======================================================================
IRC:SP:87-2019
87
and lifting arrangements. Concrete grade for the barriers shall not be leaner 
than M30. The minimum thickness of foundations shall be 25 mm thick cement 
concrete or hot mix asphalt placed at the base of barrier to provide lateral restraint. 
Where more than 75 mm thick over lay on the road pavement is anticipated, the 
foundation step may be increased to 125 mm. However, longitudinal roadside 
concrete barrier should have elaborate footing design which is structurally safe 
unless sufficient earth support is available. Precast concrete barriers shall be 
properly anchored in cast in situ footing and entire assembly shall be check 
against sliding and overturning. Suggested flare rates depending upon the 
design speed are given in Table 9.2.

8:1
	
b)	
End treatment: Safety barrier shall be provided with an end treatment, which 
shall be obtained by tapering the height of terminating end of the barrier within a 
length of 8 m to 9 m. In structures with footpath, the rigid barrier is placed between 
traffic way and footpath to protect pedestrian from vehicle impact. The approach 
and departure end of rigid barrier shall be continued with Metal beam barrier for 
a suitable length to ensure the continuity of safety barrier. In order to ensure the 
continuity of pedestrian pathway, metal beam barrier installed as continuation of 
concrete barrier can be terminated with terminal end arrangement described for 
metal beam barrier and then it can be resumed leaving 2 m in between enabling 
pedestrian to change their position from one side of barrier to other side of 
barrier as pictorially depicted in Fig 9.14.
	
c)	
Placement: The exact layout of the barrier shall be made by the design engineer 
keeping in view the lateral offset of the barrier and site-specific requirements. 
Generally.
	
i)	
The slope in front of Rigid barrier shall be near to flat gradient so that 
safety barrier perform best when impacted by a vehicle and the slope of 
ground in front of barrier shall not be steeper than 10:1.
	
ii)	
Raised kerbs or drains shall not be provided between the traveled way 
and the barriers. These destabilize the vehicle balance and disturb its 
equilibrium before it strikes the barrier thus defeating the essential purpose 
of safety and redirection of the impacting vehicle.
	
iii)	
When a kerb exists on the edge of road and on close proximity of traffic 
lane whether on shoulder side or median side, face of Concrete barrier 
shall always be such that vehicle bumper would directly collide with barrier 
before wheel touches the kerb face.
9.7.4	
Wire rope roadside safety barrier
	
a)	
Design aspects: The wire rope barriers/systems are suitable for either shoulder 
and/or median side application, provided there is adequate clearance to account 



======================================================================
PAGE 98 of 220
======================================================================
IRC:SP:87-2019
88
for their deflection, as per manufactures system design specification and 
standards. 
	
	
Wire rope barrier can be repaired quickly and only damaged posts are to be 
replaced. High tension 3 rope or 4 rope wire system confirming the requirements 
of EN 1317-2 for higher containment Level of H2 shall be used. Typical details 
of wire rope barrier are given in Fig. 9.16 and wire rope barrier with ropes 
interwoven are also presented in Fig. 9.17. The wire rope barrier shall be the 
proprietary product of an approved manufacture and test result shall conform to 
EN 1317 Part 2.
	
b)	
End treatment: The end treatment shall be as per the manufactures details 
conforming to EN 1317 Part 2. The Wire rope to W-beam transition shall be done 
through Modified Eccentric Loader Terminal (MELT) arrangement as shown in 
Fig. 9.18. The termination of Wire rope to a rigid or concrete barrier or a parapet 
shall be avoided and there shall be a transition from wire rope to W-beam in-turn 
to concrete barrier as shown in Fig. 9.19.
	
c)	
Placement: The placement of the Wire Rope Safety Barrier shall be determined 
by the design engineer and shall be a combination of the deflection ratios of the 
barrier and the site-specific conditions.
	
i)	
The slope of surface between traffic way and wire rope safety barrier shall 
always be flatter than 10:1 and there shall not any object or raised kerb in 
between so to enable the cables to readily dis-engage from posts during 
impact and thereby minimizing snagging and ensuring that the vehicle is 
smoothly redirected. 
	
ii)	
There shall be at least 1 m setback distance between wire rope safety 
barrier and the start of drop or embankment slope. While installing wire 
rope on a highway carrying two/three-wheelers and other small vehicles, 
the deflection as specified by the manufacturer shall be maintained as set 
back distance from the start of drop of embankment. The deflection can be 
reduced by closer post spacing, however the minimum setback distance 
shall be ensured.
	
iii)	
Raised kerbs or drains shall not be provided between the traveled way 
and the barriers. These destabilize the vehicle balance and disturb its 
equilibrium before it strikes the barrier thus defeating the essential purpose 
of safety and redirection of the impacting vehicle.
	
iv)	
When Wire Rope Safety Barrier is provided in front of a hazard, it shall 
be so located caters to the deflection specified by the manufacture. The 
barrier shall be extended at full height not less than 30 m in advance of 
the hazard on the approach side, and shall continue at full height for 7.5 m 
beyond the hazard on the departure side. The minimum length of fence 
shall be no less than 50 m. If there is a hazard present in the deflection 
area of the barrier, then the distance between fence and the hazard shall 
not be less than that deflection values described by the manufacture and 
will depend upon the post spacing
	
v)	
The Wire Rope Safety Barrier shall not be permitted in following situations:
	
•	
Where a hazard is present within the deflection area of the fence.



======================================================================
PAGE 99 of 220
======================================================================

•	
Where total fence length is less than 50 m.
	
•	
On a horizontal curves of radius 450 m or less.
	
•	
On vertical sag curves of radius less than 3 km.
	
•	
Where rate of change in setback is steeper than 1 in 10.
9.7.5	
Median barriers
9.7.5.1	
There are four types of median safely barrier viz., W-beam type steel barrier, (Strong 
post type), Thrie beam type steel barrier, (Strong post type), Concrete barriers, Wire Rope safety 
barrier with closer post spacing.
9.7.5.2	
The warrants for median side barriers are given below
	
i)	
On highways with narrow medians causing out-of-control vehicles jumping 
across the medians to other carriageway 
	
ii)	
Fixed objects on medians require shielding from the traffic flow, which may be a 
light post, foundation of overhead signs, bridge pier etc.
	
iii)	
For all multilane highways where adequate land is available, it is preferable to 
provide wide depressed medians having width of 7 m or more but with W-beam 
metal crash barrier or wire rope safety barrier at the edges of the median
	
iv)	
Wire ropes are ideally suited flushed median situations in a mutli lane highway 
owing to their double side nature and also not allowing crossover as wire rope 
never snaps. Wire rope on a narrow flushed median shall be placed at the center 
of flushed median, ensuring the sufficient deflection distance from both traffic 
way. 
	
v)	
At hazardous locations identified in Schedule ‘C’ or through safety audit 
(concrete/steel as specified in Schedule ‘B’ or Safety Audit Report).
	
vi)	
The requirements of Safety Barriers for structures are given in Para 7.17 of this 
Manual
9.7.5.3	
Median side steel barriers
	
a)	
Design aspects: The W-beam barrier shall be similar to the roadside barrier 
described in Para 9.7.2 (a). The Thrie beam barrier shall be similar to the 
roadside barrier described in Para 9.7.2 (a).
	
b)	
Placement: Steel beam crash barrier shall be placed at both the edges of 
median along the carriageway as per the placement requirements given in 9.7.2 
(c). The lateral placement and end treatment of W-Beam at median location as 
given in Fig. 9.13 shall be followed. The Modified Eccentric Loader Terminal 
(MELT) arrangement on approach side and Trailing Terminal (TT) arrangement 
on departure side shall be adopted for W-beam end treatment in median location 
also.
9.7.5.4	
Concrete median barriers
	
a)	
Design aspects: Concrete median barrier shall be New Jersey type. These 
should be used in case of narrow medians of two meter or less along with an 
anti-glare screen for avoidance of headlight glare. The concrete barrier cannot 
be altered easily, hence rigid barrier shall be provided in narrow median in urban 



======================================================================

IRC:SP:87-2019
90
location to prevent pedestrian intrusion and other side friction. The terminating 
end of the median barrier shall be tapered in a length of 8 to 9 m.
	
b)	
Placement: The requirements given in Para 9.7.3 (c) shall be complied for 
placement of concrete median barrier. At locations where median is narrow, the 
exposed end on concrete barrier on median side can be provided with Traffic 
Impact Attenuators.
9.7.5.5	
Wire rope median barrier
	
a)	
Design aspects: The design aspects given in Para 9.7.4 (a) will be applicable 
for wire rope at median location.
	
b)	
Placement: The requirements covered in Para 9.7.4 (c) for wire rope will be 
applicable for median barrier also. Also, when Wire Rope Safety Barrier is 
placed between two adjacent carriageways which are at the same level, it shall 
be placed at the center of the median with deflection area not be less than that 
deflection values described by the manufacture from either side of the fence. In 
case of two carriageways which are at different levels, it shall be at both sides 
of the median edge. In the case of a split median, it shall be on the carriageway 
of higher side. Wire rope barrier for median location can be adopted as long as 
the median is not raised and allowable deflection can be kept from both traffic 
way sides as given in Fig. 9.15. The end treatment presented in Para 9.7.4 (b) 
will be applicable for wire rope at median location also.
9.8	
Pedestrian Facilities
9.8.1	
General
Pedestrians are vulnerable to being involved in accidents. Therefore, adequate consideration 
shall be given to their safety through provision of facilities. The facilities for pedestrians given in 
this Section shall be provided on the Project Highway, especially roads and junctions being built 
below 6-lane structures. 
9.8.2	
Footpath (Sidewalk)
	
i)	
The foot paths shall be provided in the built-up sections, on both sides. Pedestrian 
facilities for their safe and convenient movement along the highway and for 
crossing the highway shall be integral part of facility and therefore carefully 
planned and provided.
	
ii)	
The width of sidewalks depends up on the expected pedestrian flow, but shall 
not be less than 1.5 m. Land to be acquired, if need be.
9.8.3	
Pedestrian guardrails
	
i)	
Pedestrian guardrails are an important design element to prevent indiscriminate 
crossing and spilling over of pedestrians on to the carriageway. Their judicious 
use can help to ensure that pedestrians cross the highway at predetermined and 
safe locations. As the guardrails would confine the movement of pedestrians to 
the footpath, it is obligatory that sufficient width of footpath be made available for 
the use of pedestrians.
	
ii)	
Design: The design shall be such that the guardrails are neat and simple in 
appearance. The height of guardrail shall be 1.2 m from foot path level. The

visibility of the approaching vehicles by the pedestrians as well as the visibility 
of the pedestrians by the drivers of the approaching vehicles shall be adequate. 
The railings shall not have any thick horizontal member, other than the baluster 
to achieve the desired objective. It shall comprise of reinforced cement concrete, 
iron tubes, steel channeled sections and pipes, or steel sections appropriate for 
the environment. Refer to IRC:103.
	
iii)	
Application: Pedestrian guardrails shall be provided at the following locations/ 
situations:
	
a)	
Hazardous Locations on Straight Stretches: In particularly busy 
reaches, where the road is congested and vehicles move at a fast pace, 
guardrails shall be provided on both sides of the carriage way so as to 
channelize the pedestrians on to the planned crossing locations.
	
b)	
At Junctions/Intersections: Railing barriers shall be provided to prevent 
people from crossing the junctions diagonally at signalized inter sections. 
The barrier shall open only at planned crossing facility (at the Zebra 
Crossing). At signalized junctions they shall be provided for sufficient length 
to guide the pedestrians to the nearest planned pedestrian crossing.
	
c)	
Schools: Provision of guardrails near schools, where children would 
otherwise run straight in to the road, is essential. If there is a pedestrian 
crossing or a school crossing patrol nearby, the guardrails shall be extended 
up to it.
	
d)	
Bus Stops, Railway Stations, etc.: Guardrails shall be provided alongside 
walks with suitable access at bus stops, railway stations and other areas of 
heavy pedestrian activity such as cinema houses, stadia, etc. for guiding 
pedestrians safely in such areas.
	
e)	
Overpass, Subway, etc.: Guardrails shall be provided at these locations 
in order to compel the pedestrians to use the facilities provided for them.
	
f)	
Central Reserves: Where there is a central reserve or a median, guardrails 
shall be erected within it to deter the pedestrians from attempting a crossing.
	
iv)	
Gaps/Set back Distance: The guardrails shall be setback from edge of the 
carriageway by at least 150 mm
9.8.4	
Pedestrian crossing
Provisions of pedestrian crossing described in this section are primarily applicable to road and 
junction build under 6-lane structure.
9.8.4.1	
Where complete segregation of pedestrians from vehicular traffic is not provided, 
some form of planned road sharing principle shall be applied. Pedestrian crossings shall be 
provided where they will be well used. Pedestrian crossings shall be suitably integrated with the 
overall design of the inter section.
9.8.4.2	
At-grade pedestrian crossing (pedestrian cross walk)
Pedestrian cross walks shall be provided at all important inter sections and such other locations 
where substantial conflict exists between vehicular and pedestrian movements. Wherever 
possible, the cross walks shall be at right angles to the carriageway and properly marked so that 
the pedestrians are subjected to minimum inconvenience. Cross walks shall not substantially

IRC:SP:87-2019

increase the walk distance of pedestrians. Adequate visibility, freedom from obstructions and 
sufficient space for waiting are the other important requirements for location of cross walks. At-
grade pedestrian crossings can be uncontrolled or controlled. Uncontrolled pedestrian crossings 
shall be provided only where the intersection itself is left uncontrolled because of low volumes 
of both vehicular and pedestrian traffic even during peak hours and where accident records do 
not indicate any need to segregate vehicular traffic from cross pedestrian traffic. Uncontrolled 
pedestrian cross walk shall be marked by studs or paint line. Controlled form of crossing shall 
be achieved through provision of Zebra Crossings, whether at a non-signalized or signalized 
intersection. 
9.8.4.3	
Zebra crossing
A zebra crossing shall not be sited within 150 m of another such crossing. The zebra crossing 
shall be somewhat set back from the carriageway line. However, the setback distance shall 
not be so much as to cause an appreciable increase in walking distance for the pedestrians. 
Pedestrian guard rails may be necessary where the setback distance is appreciable or at the 
skew crossings. The width of the zebra crossing shall be adequate and shall generally lie within 
arrange of 2.0 m to 4.0 m. The crossing shall, as far as possible, proceed uninterrupted through 
the median strip. In the event of the median strip being used as pedestrian refuge, adequate 
width of median shall be provided. In case of raised medians, such portion could be suitably 
depressed with kerb height not exceeding 150 mm. In the vicinity of zebra crossing, guard rails 
of sufficient length shall be provided to deter pedestrians from crossing the road at any arbitrary 
point along the road. Fig 9.4 gives a typical layout for zebra crossing in a mid-block section.
9.8.5	
Grade separated pedestrian crossing
9.8.5.1	
Divided carriageway passing through built up area with narrow median makes their 
crossing more risky, as there is no pedestrian refuge space in the median side. This demands for 
a grade separated movement like Foot Over Bridge (FOB). The efforts require for a pedestrian 
to climb a FOB to cross a 6-lane highway is equivalent of approximately 500-700 m walking 
distance, which itself makes FOB not user-friendly. Provision of a lift or escalator at the FOB to 
encourage pedestrian to use FOB. At locations where maintenance of lift and escalator can not 
be ensured, other grade separated pedestrian crossing should be explored. Pedestrian subway 
is more user friendly as the first action of pedestrian is to go down on the steps and would be 
encouraging also, as total efforts required to use subway compared to FOB is very less
9.8.5.2	
Half-subway (or depressed PUP) is an alternative solution, wherein main highway is 
raised by 1.5 m, which can be achieved with a gentle grade and pedestrian has to go down in 
steps from Ground level by 1.5 m only. Thus the sunlight and outward exposure would still be 
inside the half-subway, which will have headroom of 3 m. Since the main highway is raised by 
1.5 m, it will not affect the visibility across the highway for the business establishments along 
the highway. Thus, the half-subway or depressed PUP should be considered as an alternative 
solution for grade-separated pedestrian crossing.
9.9	
Work Zone Traffic Management Plans (WTMPs)
The traffic diversion plan during construction shall be prepared as per IRC:SP:55 for the entire 
project highway. Separate traffic diversion plan shall be prepared for structures and CD works. 
Fig. 9.20 gives a typical Work Zone Traffic Management Plan (WTMP) for an existing 4-lane to 
6-laning project. Once the service roads are completed, traffic will be diverted in to them so that 
main 6-lane can be developed as given in Fig. 9.21. Typical Work Zone Traffic Management Plan 



======================================================================

given in IRC:SP:55 for various scenarios shall be adopted, tailor-made to the site condition. The 
traffic management is applicable during operational period also. Fig. 9.22 give traffic diversion 
when one-lane of a carriageway is affected for some maintenance work, whereas Fig. 9.23 
gives the traffic diversion and safety arrangement when both carriageways are affected for major 
maintenance work.
9.9.1	
Temporary diversion for CD structures
The layout Fig 9.24 shown is applicable when a Cross Drainage structure has to be constructed 
and where a temporary diversion will need to be constructed for maintaining the traffic flow. The 
diversion in most cases would be on embankment; therefore, delineation is essential for both 
day and night time. Temporary diversion shall be developed and maintained to accommodate all 
types of vehicles likely to ply through the road.
9.9.2	
Work at the center of carriageway
The layout Fig 9.25 shown is applicable for short term maintenance activities at the center of a 
carriageway. Generally, traffic cones are used so that it can be placed and removed easily.
9.9.3 	
Flyover/VUP construction
9.9.3.1	
The layout Fig 9.26 shows the Stage-1 in flyover/VUP construction. In the first stage, 
the traffic will be diverted to a service road or temporary road. The turning movements would 
continue at the existing intersection and construction of piers/embankment/RE wall would be 
taken up in the cordoned portion. Carefully planned pedestrian markings on the roads and 
protected safe passage for crossing of pedestrians shall be provided through work area.
9.9.3.2	
The layout of Fig 9.27 shows Stage-2 of flyover/VUP construction. In the second stage, 
the central portion will be taken up and junction will be blocked for direct cross road movement. 
During this short period of time, cross road movement will be accommodated like a circulatory 
movement using U-turn, whereas the through traffic will continue to ply through service road/ 
temporary road. Direction signs would be carefully planned and installed. Carefully planned 
pedestrian markings on the roads and protected safe passage for crossing of pedestrians shall 
be provided through work area.

IRC:SP:87-2019
114
i)
Electronic toll collection (ETC lanes) (Toll collection through RFID Tags 
and no stoppage of vehicles)
1200 veh/hour
Not less than 2 middle toll lanes shall be capable of being used as reversible lane to meet the 
demand of tidal flow.
Toll plazas shall be designed for projected peak hour traffic of 20 years. As mentioned in Para 
10.4.1, the stage construction of toll plaza in respect of number of toll lanes shall be allowed. If 
at any time, the queue of vehicles becomes so large that the waiting time of the user exceeds 
three minutes, the number of toll lanes shall be increased so that the maximum waiting time is 
brought down to less than three minutes.
10.7	
Pavement
Concrete pavement shall be provided in the Toll Plaza area including tapering zone, from durability 
and long time serviceability consideration and to permit the provision of toll lanes initially for a 
projected peak hour traffic of 10 years. The concrete pavement may be widened to provide for 
future toll lanes required as per stage construction. The rigid pavement shall be designed as per

10.9	
Traffic Signs
A well thought out strategy should be evolved for providing traffic signs and road markings in and 
around the toll plaza in accordance with IRC:67 and IRC:35. The concessionaire would design 
the configuration/placement of signs for toll plaza which are not given in IRC:67 and furnish to 
IE for review so as to ensure uniformity of signs in use on all the highways across the country.
Signs should be placed along the project highway, roadway of toll plaza to guide and render 
assistance to the drivers approaching the toll plaza. It is necessary to alert the driver about the 
existence of toll plaza one km ahead with a repeater sign 500 m ahead as shown in Fig. 10.4, 
Figs. 10.7A and 10.7B. Stop sign shall always be used in combination with certain road markings 
such as stop line and the word ‘STOP’ marked on the pavement.
The toll plaza sign should be supplemented by the sign advising the users of the notified toll rates 
(fees) for various types of vehicles and exempted categories of vehicles as shown Figs. 10.4, 
10.5A and 10.5B.
Overhead Lane Signs (OHLS) shall be mounted on the leading edge of the canopy covering the 
toll lanes above the centre of the lane to indicate to the user as shown in Fig. 10.3, Figs. 10.6A, 
10.6B, 10.6C and 10.6D.  Lane applicable to specific category of vehicle, lane with ETC System, 
reversible lane, etc. It shall also indicate whether the toll lane is open or closed for the processing 
of vehicles. A red cross signal would indicate that the lane is closed, whilst a green arrow would 
indicate that the lane is open to traffic.

SECTION 11
LANDSCAPING AND TREE PLANTATION
11.1	
General
The Concessionaire shall plant trees and shrubs of required number and type at the appropriate 
locations within the Right of Way and in the land earmarked by the Authority for afforestation 
keeping in view of the IRC Guidelines on Landscaping and Tree Plantation. The Authority 
shall specify the number of trees which are required to be planted by the Concessionaire as 
compensatory afforestation or otherwise in Schedule ‘C’ of Concession Agreement. In case the 
number of trees to be provided is not specified in Schedule ‘C’, the concessionaire shall not 
be required to plant trees. The Concessionaire shall also maintain the trees and shrubs in good 
condition during the Concession Period as per the maintenance schedule. 
11.2	
Design Considerations in Various Locations
11.2.1	
Set-back distance of trees and other plantation
Trees on the roadside shall be sufficiently away from the roadway so that they are not a hazard 
to road traffic or restrict the visibility. Most vulnerable locations in this regard are the inside of 
curves, medians, junction corners and cut slopes. Trees shall be placed at a minimum distance 
of 14 m from the centre line of the extreme traffic lane to provide recovery area for the vehicle 
that runs off the road. A second row of trees 6 m further away will also be planted wherever 
possible. Preferably the first row of trees shall consist of species with thick shade and other 
rows of vertical type providing thin shade. The distances for alternative rows of trees shall be 
reckoned from the nearest edge of the unidirectional carriageway. No plantation shall be allowed 
on the embankment slopes.
11.2.2	
Set-back of trees on curves
In plain terrain a stopping sight distance of 180 m corresponding to the design speed of 100 km 
per hour may be ensured on all curved sections of the Project Highway along the innermost 
lane. However, where there are site restrictions, their requirement may be reduced to 130 m 
corresponding to the design speed of 80 km per hour as a special case. The existing trees and 
vegetation on the sides have to be suitably thinned/trimmed, or even removed if necessary 
and a regular programme of pruning of the offending trees shall be undertaken as part of the 
maintenance operations. In all cases, location of trees shall be checked to ensure that clear 
vision of all highway signs/signals is available at all times to the motorists. Also, the foliage or 
trees shall not come in the way of roadway lighting. In urban/built-up sections of the Project 
Highway, trees can be planted on the raised footpaths, provided the distance between the edge 
of the kerbs and the nearest edge of tree is not less than 2 m.
11.2.3	
Vertical clearance of trees and other plantations
For safe traffic operation, the vertical clearance available across the roadway shall be minimum 
5 m. From this angle, the probable size of all plants shall be anticipated in advance, at the time 
of initial planting. To allow for the effects of growth, wind and rain, trees shall be trimmed to 6 m 
and 6.5 m above the pavement in rural and urban areas respectively.
11.2.4	
Plantation in medians
In the sections of the Project Highway where median width is more than 2.5 m, shrubs shall be 
planted and maintained to cut-off headlight glare from traffic in the opposite direction.



======================================================================
PAGE 163 of 220
======================================================================
IRC:SP:87-2019
153
Flowering plants and shrubs are eminently suited for the purpose. These shall be planted either 
in continuous rows or in the form of baffles. The height of shrubs shall be maintained at 1.5 m to 
cut off the effect of traffic lights coming from the opposite direction.
In the sections, where the width of median is less than 2.5 m, shrubs or flowery plants may be 
planted in between crash barriers or other means like plastic strips shall be provided to cut off 
glare.
The shape of shrubs and plants shall be suitably regulated so that there is no overgrowth either 
vertically or horizontally beyond the edge of the median.
In the vicinity of road intersections and median openings, median plantation shall be avoided or 
restricted to low-growing varieties to ensure adequate visibility.
11.2.5	
Spacing of avenue trees
The spacing of avenue trees will depend on the type and growth characteristics of trees, 
requirement of maintenance, penetration of distant views, etc. A range of 10-15 m would meet 
the requirement for most varieties.
11.2.6	
Choice of trees
The following guidelines shall be kept in view while selecting the species of trees to be planted: 
	
i)	
Trees shall be selected with due regard to soil, rainfall, temperature and water 
level. 
	
ii)	
Trees which become very wide shall be avoided as their maintenance would 
cause interference with traffic flow. 
	
iii)	
The species must be capable of developing a straight and clean bole up to a 
height of 2.5 to 3.5 m from the ground level. 
	
iv)	
The selected trees shall, preferably, be fast growing and wind-firm. These shall 
not be thorny or drop too many leaves. 
	
v)	
The trees shall be deep rooted, as shallow roots injure pavements. 
	
vi)	
In urban areas, the species selected shall be of less spreading type, so that 
these do not interfere with overhead services, clear views of signs/signals, and 
efficiency of roadway lighting. 
11.3	
Landscape Treatment
A suitable landscape treatment with provision of foundations and coloured lighting so as to 
enhance the overall aesthetics duly designed by a qualified and experienced landscaping 
architect, shall be provided at grade separators, elevated sections, viaducts, traffic islands, toll 
plazas, bus bays, truck lay byes, rest areas, O&M centre, etc. The locations where landscape 
treatment is to be given shall be specified in Schedule ‘C’. The landscape treatment shall also 
be provided for special areas as given in IRC:SP:21 (Para 8).
11.4	
Report to be submitted
The Concessionaire shall submit scheme for plantation of trees and landscaping treatments 
including their maintenance duly designed by a landscaping architect, and submit to the 
Independent Engineer for review and comments, if any.

location of bus bays to be provided by the concessionaire. The bus bays shall conform to the 
Specifications and Standards given in this Section. In case where bus stands are provided by 
the concerned State Government Transport Authority, the Concessionaire shall provide only 
access road within the Right of Way.
12.7.2	
Location
The location of the bus bays shall be fixed on the basis of following principles:
	
i)	
The bus stops shall be sited away from bridges and other important structures 
and embankment sections more than 3 m high.
	
ii)	
As far as possible, bus bays shall not be located on horizontal curves or at the 
summit of vertical curves.
	
iii)	
The location shall have good visibility, not less than the safe stopping sight 
distance.
	
iv)	
The bus bays shall not be located too close to the road intersections. A gap of 
30 m from the tangent point of intersections to start/end of the bus bay shall be 
desirable. At minor intersections (e.g. junctions with village roads), distance of 
60 m may be adopted. However, if a substantial volume of buses is to turn right 



======================================================================
PAGE 167 of 220
======================================================================
IRC:SP:87-2019
157
at the intersection, it is necessary that the bus bay shall be located sufficiently 
ahead of the intersection so that the buses can be maneuvered easily from 
the pick-up stop on the left hand side to the extreme right lane for turning. 
The location of the bus bays may be fixed after due consultation with the local 
communities expected to use such facilities.
	
v)	
At major four-way intersections involving transfer of a substantial number of 
passengers from one pick-up stop to the other, it might be desirable to construct 
a single, composite bus stop of suitable design to cater to all the bus routes 
collectively.
	
vi)	
In hilly areas, the bus bays shall be located, preferably, where the road is 
straight on both sides, gradients are flat and the visibility is reasonably good 
(usually not less than 50 m). Subject to these requirements, it will be advisable 
to choose locations where it is possible to widen the roadway economically for 
accommodating bus bays.
12.7.3

ramp for use of disabled persons (1 m wide minimum) with railing on either side 
shall be provided for climbing up/down from Bus Shelter to underpass/overpass 
to carriageway and vice versa. The cover of the steps shall be aesthetically 
pleasing and protect the users from sun, wind and rain. The entire area used by 
the pedestrians shall be provided with granite stone cladding and flooring. 
	
vi)	
The bus bay shall be provided with a shelter for passengers. The shelter shall 
be structurally safe and aesthetic in appearance, while also being functional 
so as to protect the waiting passengers adequately from sun, wind and rain. If 
the shelter is constructed on the hill side, slopes shall be properly dressed and 
suitably protected to avoid slips.
