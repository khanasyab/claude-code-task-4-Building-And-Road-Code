1 INTRODUCTION
The silica-fume, a very fine non-crystalline silicon dioxide
is a by-product obtained during
manufacture of silicon and ferrosilicon alloys from pure quartz and carbon
in
electric arc
furnace.
It
is also called
microsilica or condensed silica-fume.
It
is a reactive pozzolana.
The particles of silica-fume are extremely fine, most of them having diameter in the range of
0.03 and 0.30 micron. The specific surface of such fine particles can not be determined by
Blaine's air permeability method. The nitrogen adsorption method (BET method) indicates a
specific surface of more than 15 m 2/gm. Such a fine material has a very low bulk density of
about 200-300 kg/m 3
. As handling this light powder is difficult,
it is densified by condensing
with moisture, and then transported.
In condensed form, the bulk density of silica-fume
is
about 500kg/m3. Silica-fume
is usually used
in concrete
in proportion up to 10% by weight
of cementitious material
in the concrete mix, for development of high strength and abrasion
resistance.
Because of high
reactivity with calcium hydroxide
in concrete, the resulting matrix
is very
dense and has low permeability. Additional
benefits are reduced bleeding and improved
cohesion of the concrete mix. Consequently, the porosity of concrete is also reduced.
The Rigid Pavement Committee (H-3) constituted a sub-group comprising Dr. S.C. Maiti, Shri
Satander Kumar and Shri J. B. Sengupta for formulation of "Guidelines for Use of Silica Fume
in Rigid Pavements". The draft guidelines Prepared by the sub-group was discussed by the
Committee
in series of meetings. The Rigid Pavement Committee (H-3) finalized the draft
guidelines on 10th November, 2012 for placing before the HSS Committee. The Highways
Specifications and Standards Committee (HSS) in
its meeting held on 13
th December, 2012.
The Executive Committee in its meeting held on 1
9
th December, 201 2 approved this document.
Finally, the Council approved this document
in their meeting held on 8
th January, 2013 at
Coimbatore and authorized the Convenor, Rigid Pavement Committee (H-3) to incorporate
the comments of Council members and place the same before the HSS Committee before
publishing. Accordingly, H-3 Committee modified the draft which was approved by the HSS
Committee in
its meeting held on 19 July, 2013.

2 SCOPE
Silica
fume
up
to
10
as
part
replacement
(by
weight
of
cementitious
materials)
is
suggested
to be used
in concrete as per IRC: 15
for
rigid pavement. Pavement Quality
Concrete (PQC) with the use of silica fume shall have minimum flexural strength of 4.5 MPa
and the corresponding compressive strength of 40 MPa. Such concrete is very cohesive, has
low permeability,
is highly abrasion resistant, and has longer service
life. This concrete may
be used
in special cases
in State and National Highways especially
in coastal regions and
where high abrasion resistance is required.
3 INFLUENCE OF SILICA-FUME ON THE PROPERTIES
OF FRESH CONCRETE
The very large surface area of the particles of silica fume increases the water demand
in
concrete mixes. Therefore,
it
is necessary to use a superplasticizer in the mix. This would
make
it possible to use low water- cement ratio in concrete, for a given workability. The low
water- cement ratio results in increased strength of concrete and reduced permeability.
Concrete mixes with a high content of cementitiuos materials tend to be sticky and to avoid
'sticky' mix, the water content of concrete mix should not be less than 150 kg/m 3 of concrete.
2



======================================================================
PAGE 11 of 20
======================================================================
IRC:114-2013
Generally, silica fume is compatible with all superplasticizers. The mixing of such fine powder
in concrete should preferably be carried out in an efficient pan or paddle mixer or in a batching
and mixing plant as per IS: 4925 and IS: 4926.
4 INFLUENCE OF SILICA-FUME ON PROPERTIES
OF HARDENED CONCRETE
Concrete containing
silica fume develops early as well as
later compressive and flexural
strengths of concrete. Typical relationship between water-cementitious materials ratio and
28-day compressive strength of concrete is shown in Fig. 1.

Fig.
1: Typical Results for Strength Improvement
The presence of silica-fume in concrete has a beneficial effect upon resistance to abrasion
because,
in the absence of bleeding, no weak top layer
is formed, and also because of a
better bond between the hydrated cement paste and the coarse aggregate, differential wear
and loosening of particles do not occur.

5 ABRASION RESISTANCE OF SILICA-FUME CONCRETE
Low water-cement ratio high-strength silica-fume concrete shows greatly improved resistance
to abrasion with low permeability. Abrasion resistance is an important area of application for
silica-fume concrete such as at Toll Plaza and curves and where there
is frequent change
of grade
(hill road). When the road
is to be used by steel tyred or tracked vehicle, such as
iron-tyred bullock carts,
military tanks
etc. as per IRC:15, use of silica-fume concrete for
abrasion resistance has been recommended. This helps in reducing Foreign Object Damage
(FOD) problem in airfield pavement also. The Norwegian practice of using studded tyres on
cars during winter causes extreme wear of the road surface. Thus,
in recent years,
high-
strength abrasion -resistant silica-fume concrete has become the paving material of choice,
for high wear resistance. The Southern
Illinois University test results indicate more than
100% improvement in abrasion resistance (abrasion index) with 10% silica-fume in concrete
(Fig. 2) using ASTM C779 abrasion resistance test for horizontal surfaces (Ball revolution
test method).
The abrasion index, as defined by the Australian Paving Association, given below may be
adopted for determining the abrasion index:
Where,
IA = Abrasion Index
R = Ball race revolution, in thousands,
P = Depth of wear,
in mm.

These Guidelines recommend an abrasion index of 50 for rigid pavements.
6 STIPULATIONS IN INDIAN STANDARDS
IRC: 15 stipulates use of silica-fume (as per IS: 15388,
IS: 456 and IRC:SP:70
in concrete
up to
1 0 percent by weight of cementitious materials. IRC:SP:70-2005 stipulate use of silica-
fume
in concrete to develop High Performance Concrete
in bridges. The Indian Standard
specification for silica-fume
IS: 15388 covers the chemical and physical requirements of
silica-fume for use in concrete.
The chemical and physical properties shall be as per Table 1 and Table 2 respectively.

7 CURING
Immediately after the finishing operations have been completed, the entire surface of the
newly laid concrete shall be covered against rapid drying, and cured as per IRC:15.
Curing shall be done by one of the following two methods:
i)
By application of curing compound
is followed by spreading of wet hessian
cloth and
moistening
it
regularly.
In case
of
arid
areas where water
is
extremely scarce, two applications of curing compound with moist curing
by wet hessian cloth may be allowed at the discretion of the Engineer-in-
Charge. Curing compound shall be resin based aluminized reflective type.
ii)
For small works, curing can be done by manual methods using wet hessian
cloth which
is kept moist during curing period.
iii)
Curing shall be done for a minimum period of 16 days.
iv)
The water used for curing shall also be free from all injurious chemicals, like,
chlorides and sulphates and shall meet the requirements of IS:456.
8 OPENING TO TRAFFIC
In general, traffic shall not use newly constructed pavement for a minimum period of 28 days
as per IRC:15.
9 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR USE OF SILICA-FUME
IN RIGID PAVEMENT
Because
of good
abrasion-resistant
properties
of
silica-fume
concrete,
its use
in
rigid
pavement is recommended. The concrete having 40 or 45 MPa compressive strength (4.5 or
5 MPa flexural strength), although has good resistance to abrasion,
it is suggested that such
concrete should include silica-fume upto 10 as part replacement of cementitious material, so
that with better strength and abrasion-resistance characteristics of silica-fume concrete, the
service
life of the rigid pavements can be enhanced.
6



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 20
======================================================================
IRC:114-2013
Because of part replacement of cement, and because of additional strength characteristics,
the silica-fume concrete
will not be very costly, as the reduction of cement will be higher
than the percentage of silica-fume used, for the required flexural strength of concrete. The
silica-fume concrete, however, will need more curing, than that required for normal concrete
pavement, as is the case for concrete with all pozzolanic materials. In order to obtain improved
abrasion resistance of concrete pavement with silica-fume,
it is suggested to adopt a longer
curing period.
The
requirement
of
construction
methodology,
quality
control,
mix
design
and
other
requirement not covered above shall be followed as per IRC:15 and IRC:44.
