Guidelines  on  Wet  Mix  Plant
1.  Introduction
Use of Wet Mix Macadam (WMM) over the conventional Water Bound Macadam (WBM) 
as a pavement layer has proved to be quite effective in the sense that it ensures superior 
gradation of aggregates, faster rate of construction, higher standard of compaction that 
can be achieved, lower consumption of water and stricter standards of quality achievable. 
Specifications for Wet Mix Macadam are given in IRC:109-2015.
This document “Guidelines on Wet Mix Plant” caters to the mechanisation aspect of 
preparation of Wet Mix Macadam in a central mixing plant so that the laid down requirements 
of end result specifications in respect of sizes and grading of aggregates, optimum moisture 
content, proper mixing etc. are achieved.
The initial draft document “Guidelines on Wet Mix Plant” was prepared by Shri Anand Patel. 
Necessary inputs obtained from the Representatives of Industry and Shri Ananyabrata 
Maulikwere incorporated in the document. The Mechanization and Instrumentation Committee 
(G-4) deliberated on the draft document in a series of meetings and finally approved the draft 
document in its meeting held on 12th June, 2017. The document was approved by the General 
Standards and Specifications Committee in its meeting held on 24th June 2017 and thereafter 
by IRC Council in its 212th meeting held at Udaipur (Rajasthan) on 14th to 15th July, 2017.

2.  Scope
This document covers advantages and major assemblies of a Wet Mix Plant, typical average 
power requirement of various parts of the plant, pug mill performance, plant maintenance 
and safety.
This document is intended for use by highway engineers, field personnel within road 
construction agencies and contractors entrusted with the task of road construction and 
maintenance.
Emission and noise limits for a diesel genset used in a Wet Mix Plant have been provided in 
Appendix-I.
Sample calculation for output analysis of a Wet Mix Plant has also been included in 
Appendix-V
3.  Purpose
Wet Mix Macadam (WMM) is a base or sub base pavement layer below the bituminous layer, 
wherein clean, crushed, graded aggregates and granular materials, like graded course sand 
are mixed with water and other additives like lime, cement etc. in desired proportion in a 
mixing plant and rolled to a dense mass on a prepared surface.
A central mixing plant used for producing the wet mix macadam is called a wet mix plant. It 
has provision for:
 
● 
Controlled feeding of aggregates of different sizes in the required 
proportion.
 
● 
Addition of specified quantity of water.
 
● 
Addition of specified quantity of other ingredients like lime or cement.
 
● 
Forced/positive mixing of all the ingredients to produce a consistent 
homogeneous mix.
A wet mix plant can be used with slight modification and other optional devices for:
 
● 
Production of cold bituminous mix – addition of emulsion
 
● 
Certain type of soil stabilisation – addition of cement or lime
 
● 
Blending of material for GSB
4.  Advantages of Wet Mix Plant
Use of a central mixing plant provides the following advantages:
 
● 
Higher production
 
● 
Proper quality control
 
● 
Lower unit production cost

5.  Major Assemblies of Wet Mix Plant
A Wet Mix Macadam Plant shall consist of the following assemblies/sub assemblies:
 
● 
Aggregate Feeder
 
● 
Gathering Conveyor
 
● 
Oversize Removal Screen
 
● 
Charging Conveyor
 
● 
Pug Mill Unit
 
● 
Water Tank and Metering Unit
 
● 
Filler Fines Feeding System
 
● 
Gob Hopper
 
● 
Storage Silo (optional)
 
● 
Control Cabin (housing the control panel)
5.1	
Aggregate Feeder
Efficient wet mix plant operation starts with the cold aggregate feeder. The functions of 
the feeder system are to provide an even flow of accurately metered aggregates (meeting 
the gradation requirements) and provide surge storage capacity between the feeders and 
aggregate stockpiles. Surge capacity, as determined by bin size, keeps a ‘material head’ over 
the feeders for constant metering and determines how frequently the front end loader must 
cycle between the stockpiles and the cold aggregate feeder.
The feeder system consists of four or more bins, with separators between them, to avoid inter 
mixing of aggregates being loaded in different bins. Bins are welded modular units made with 
mild steel, duly reinforced and stiffened and mounted on a rigid frame of such dimensions 
that there is no distortion of the bins under fully loaded conditions. Bin walls and bin gates are 
so designed as to prevent sagging and ensure smooth flow of aggregates to feeders.
Only graded aggregates are to be fed to the feeder system. Otherwise, grizzly screens are 
to be put over the bins.
Each bin should have provision for the adjustment of total and proportional feed and should 
be capable of being locked in any setting. Bin gates should have a graded scale to control 
the gate opening. Variable speed drive provided below each bin to control speed of auxiliary 
conveyor belt also helps in controlling aggregate flow. Therefore, aggregate flow may be 
regulated by adjustment of either or both gate opening and conveyor belt speed.
The capacity of the bins should be sufficient to run the plant for minimum 
10 minutes. The bin containing fines is provided with a bin vibrator to avoid sticking of fines 
with the bin wall.

5.2	
Gathering Conveyor (Fig. 1)
Gathering conveyor collects aggregates of different sizes from the auxiliary conveyors fitted 
under each bin and discharges it into the slinger conveyor. The essential components of the 
gathering conveyor are the continuous belt, idler, driving unit, and pulley and take up unit to 
maintain the tension in the belt and supporting structure.
Gathering conveyor shall have belt of required width, reputed make and drive of adequate 
capacity through speed reducer or direct geared motor.
Fig. 1  Gathering Conveyor
5.3	
Oversize Removal Screen (Fig. 2)
A single deck vibrating screen of adequate screening area and suitable vibratory mechanism is 
provided at the discharge end of the gathering conveyor for rejecting any over sized aggregate 
before being fed to the slinger conveyor. The screen shall be robust, easily replaceable and 
heavy duty framed sieve (usually with square opening). The purpose of oversize rejection is 
to protect the pug mill from damage.

5.4	
Charging Conveyor (Fig. 3)
Charging conveyor (also known as slinger conveyor) is an inclined conveyor provided for 
transferring the aggregates received from the vibrating screen after removing the over sized 
aggregates into the pug mill. The angle of inclination of the conveyor should not be more than 
18º in case of plain belt. However, with use of V cleated belt the angle of inclination can go 
up to 30-40º.
A continuous electronic weighing arrangement with load cell is mounted on the slinger 
conveyor to continuously monitor the total weight of aggregates being fed into the pug mill 
and synchronize it with the feed of water and other filler additives.
The aggregate metering system should be calibrated before commencement of work and 
thereafter at regular intervals as recommended by manufacturer.
Charging conveyor consists of head and tail pulleys, carrying idlers, return roller and tensioned 
device. It shall have belt of required width, reputed make and drive of adequate capacity 
through speed reducer or direct geared motor.
Fig. 3  Charging Conveyor
5.5	
Pug Mill (Fig. 4)
The charging conveyor feeds aggregates into pug mill. Inter-lock is provided between pug 
mill and conveyor drive to start and stop simultaneously. 
A twin-shaft Pug Mill performs the following functions:
 
● 
Receive materials to be blended (aggregates from charging conveyor and 
requisite, precise amount of water from water system and filler additives from 
filler fines feeding system) at one end.
 
● 
Continuous, uniform, homogeneous mixing as the materials are pushed 
towards the pug mill’s discharge end.
 
● 
Discharge the mix to gob hopper/load out conveyor.

Mounted on a sturdy chassis, the pug mill is fabricated from heavy duty Mild Steel plate and 
has a twin shaft of carbon steel mounted on heavy duty anti friction bearings in Cast Iron 
pedestals. Each shaft is equipped with high abrasion resistant, easily replaceable sets of 
paddle arms and tips to facilitate forced action-mixing of aggregates and water (Fig. 5). The 
pug mill is so designed as to ensure continuous outflow of homogenous mix at discharge 
end. The mix material shall not accumulate in pug mill at any point.
The pug mill should have replaceable inner liner plates. It should be fully covered and 
must have safety mechanism to prevent accidental powering on of the pug mill while being 
accessed during inspection or maintenance or cleaning.
Fig. 4  Pug Mill
Fig. 5  Typical Paddle Arms in a Pug Mill
5.6	
Water Tank and Metering Unit
It consists of a water storage tank, pump, pump drive motor, water pipelines, flow meter and 
spray bar. Addition of controlled amount of water in the pug mill (meeting the design moisture 
content requirement) is facilitated by the spray bar with the help of a variable speed centrifugal 
pump or electronically operated hydraulic control valve and electronic flow meter (for accurate 
metering). The water tank shall have adequate surge capacity. In case of fabrication from 
Mild Steel, the water tank should be painted with corrosion proof paint inside and outside. 
The spray bar should be installed transverse to the direction of aggregate flow in the pug mill 
for uniform mixing with water.
The metering system should be calibrated before commencement of work and thereafter at 
regular intervals as recommended by the manufacturer. A mechanically operated totalizer 
should be installed in the water pipeline after the delivery valve, to record the cumulative flow, 
and is to be used to calibrate the electronic flow meter.
5.7	
Filler Fines Feeding System (Fig. 6)
It consists of a filler silo of adequate capacity with a bucket elevator arrangement or a 
pneumatic conveyor for transfer of bagged or bulk filler like lime or cement into the silo. 
Dozing arrangement consists of a rotary metering valve coupled with a precision screw 
conveyor or a continuous weighing system (for cases where very precise control is needed) 
to deliver the specified quantity of fines to the pug mill.

5.8	
Gob Hopper (Fig. 7)
It is made of heavy duty wear resistant steel plate and is fitted into the discharge end of pug 
mill (or at the end of load-out conveyor). The gob hopper arrangement allows the discharge 
of mix into tipper truck without any settle-down/slippage. Gob Hopper shall be of adequate 
capacity having clamshell gates hydraulically operated for quick opening and closing without 
causing segregation of mix. 
The angle of inclination of the load-out conveyor should not be more than 24º in case of plain 
belt. However, with use of V cleated belt the angle of inclination can go up to 30º-40º.
In case the pug mill has an integrated gob hopper arrangement, its elevation level with respect 
to the ground should be approximately 2700 mm. A trench is generally made in the ground to 
allow the tipper truck to pass through.

5.9	
Storage Silo (optional)
It is advantageous to have a storage silo (Fig. 8) as it ensures continuous production of mix 
even when no tipper truck is readily available for loading. This also leads to saving in the 
number of trucks required. It is recommended to use a silo for plant having capacity in excess 
of 100TPH.
Fig. 8  Storage Silo
Mix is carried from the pug mill to the silo by the load-out conveyor. The silo should be 
rigid, easy to erect and transfer. It is equipped with fast operating hydraulic/pneumatic 
operated clamshell gates to facilitate quick discharge of mix into the tipper trucks without 
segregation.
The load-out conveyor shall have belt of required width, reputed make and drive of adequate 
capacity through speed reducer or direct geared motor.
5.10	
Centralized Control Cabin and Panel (Fig. 9)
A centralized control cabin houses the control system for centralized plant operation. It should 
be designed and erected to enable full view of the plant from inside. Alternatively, CCTV 
system may be used to provide real time view of the entire plant. The control cabin should 
have air conditioning, proper illumination and furnishing. It should have a public address 
system for addressing/warning people outside. In addition, the control cabin should have the 
following features:
 
a) 
The cabin should be vermin proof. The controls should be integral with 
the cabin to provide clear working area and accessibility to the panels for 
connection and testing. There should be adequate illumination near the 
panel for operation and maintenance without glare or reflection. The floor of 
the cabin should be covered with rubberized material.

7.  Pug Mill Performance
A pug mill’s ability to achieve a homogeneous, thoroughly coated mix in a given number of 
seconds is influenced by many design variables:
7.1	
Pug Mill’s Shape, Proportions and Volume
 
i) 
The shape should be designed for continuous material flow without any 
unnecessary restriction.



======================================================================

ii) 
The width should be adequate to accommodate the paddle arms and tips. 
Sufficient clearance is to be provided to avoid premature wearing out of 
outer body and should be less than the maximum aggregate size so that the 
aggregates are pushed forward while mixing. The length of the pug mill is 
governed by the optimum time required for proper mixing.
7.2	
Paddle Tip Number, Size and Peripheral Speed
 
i) 
In order to have a consistent output capacity, a minimum of 230 sq. cm face 
area is suggested for tip size. However, this may vary from manufacturer to 
manufacturer.
 
ii) 
The number of tips provided should be sufficient to ensure consistency 
of homogeneous mixing. Based on data available for various reputed 
manufacturers, the thumb rule of 1 paddle tip for every 4.6 TPH of plant 
output capacity may be considered to work out the requirement of paddle 
tips. This is given in Table 2.

Minimum No. of Paddle Tips
100
22
200
44
300
66
7.3	
Paddle Arm and Tip Shape
Paddle arm should be strong and sturdy. The tips should be rounded in the corner for smooth 
operation. Tips should be made of material having high wear resistance.
7.4	
Paddle Arrangement
Paddles should be arranged for smooth operation and proper mixing.
7.5	
Power Input
Sufficient power should be provided for achieving the required output capacity.
8.  Plant Maintenance
Proper maintenance of the plant is necessary to ensure trouble free operation and reduce 
plant downtime. The success of an effective maintenance strategy lies in properly timing the 
replacement and overhaul of individual components, keeping in view factors like number of 
hours of operation, load factor, site conditions, age of plant, intuition and experience with the 
plant, environmental factors etc. Accordingly, the requisite maintenance interval for the plant 
and its components is worked out using suitable parameters for calculation/measurement 
like service hours or calendar time, whichever occurs first.

APPENDIX-VI
Plant Calibration
The purpose of plant calibration is to ensure that the plant accurately measures and proportions 
the aggregates and water. The aim is to adjust the settings, if required, to ensure increased 
level of accuracy so that deviation between the actual and expected results in measurement 
is negligible.
A.	
Calibration of Belt Scale (Load Cell)
For calibration of load cell/belt scale attached to charging conveyor, the following steps are 
to be followed:
 
i) 
Prior to calibration, run the conveyor belt for about one hour to warm up the 
system.
 
ii) 
Ensure that the belt scale reads zero without material on the scale. In case 
of deviation from zero reading, follow manufacturer’s guidelines to ‘zero the 
scale”.
 
iii) 
Set the cold feed gates at an opening that will allow a good material feed. 
Run approximately 10 tonnes of aggregate over the belt scale conveyor to 
ensure proper seating of the conveyor belt on the rollers and better weighing 
accuracy.
 
iv) 
Starting with empty belt, run the aggregate directly into a tipper truck (with 
known tare weight) via a bypass chute. Ensure that aggregate does not enter 
the pug mill.
 
v) 
Stop aggregate flow to tipper truck with an empty belt without overflowing the 
truck. Make sure the belt is empty before and after the test.
 
vi) 
Record the aggregate quantity loaded into the truck using metrologically 
certified weigh scale. It is calculated by subtracting tare weight of the truck 
from its final weight after loading.
 
vii) 
Record the aggregate quantity reading shown by belt scale.
 
viii) Compare the values obtained in steps (vi) and (vii).
 
ix) 
Adjust the belt scale based on manufacturer’s guidelines and follow steps (iii) 
to (viii) until the values obtained in steps (vi) and (vii) are within acceptable 
limit.
 
x) 
Repeat the above test sequence at different production rates (low, medium, 
high) to make sure the belt scale is accurate even with variation in load.
B.	
Calibration of Feeder
Once the belt scale has been calibrated, calibration charts for the different feeders at different 
speeds and gate openings have to be prepared.
The material flow characteristics for different sizes and types of material are different. Hence 
it is recommended that the calibration be done whenever there is significant change in the 
material size or type for any feeder bin. Each feeder belt should have a no flow switch to 
sense if any feeder belt is running empty.

Feeder output is regulated by gate opening only in case of constant speed drive while feeder 
belt speed coupled with gate opening influence feeder output in case of variable speed drive. 
Good practice is to achieve the right combination of belt speed and gate opening. Too close 
gate opening and fast belt speeds are detrimental to belt life and more prone to blockage of 
gate. Too large gate opening and too slow belt speed increases the weight on belt and affects 
motor performance at very low speeds.
B.1	
Constant Speed Drive
 
i) 
Select the bin to be calibrated. Feeders of other bins are not to be operated 
during the calibration process.
 
ii) 
Set the gate of the selected bin at a suitable opening (preferably between 
10% and 100%) and start the corresponding feeder.
 
iii) 
Calculate the aggregate feed rate at that opening using the following 
formula:
 
 
Feed rate (in TPH) = 0.06 x [Aggregate Weight on Belt (in kg) x Slinger 
Conveyor Belt Speed (in m/min)] ÷ Slinger Conveyor Belt Section Length 
(in m)
 
iv) 
Repeat the process for 3 more openings.
 
v) 
Plot the feed rates versus the corresponding gate openings to obtain the 
calibration chart of the concerned bin.
 
vi) 
Repeat the above steps to prepare calibration chart for each of the remaining 
bins.
Fig. 10 depicts a typical calibration chart for a wet mix plant with 4 bins.
Fig. 10  Typical Calibration Chart for a 4-Bin Fixed Drive WMM Plant
 
vii) 
Aggregate proportions conforming to the mix formula and in accordance with 
the desired plant capacity are calculated.

viii) For each bin, compute the gate opening off the calibration chart, based on 
the required feed rate of the aggregate.
B.2	
Variable Drive
 
i) 
Select the bin to be calibrated. Choose a suitable gate opening for that bin.
 
ii) 
Vary the feeder belt speed between 10% and 90% of maximum speed and 
record the corresponding values of aggregate feed rate. Belt speed should 
be measured using a tachometer or any suitable device.
 
iii) 
Plot aggregate feed rate versus percentage of feeder belt speed to obtain 
calibration chart for the concerned bin at the selected gate opening.
 
iv) 
Repeat the above steps to prepare calibration chart for each of the remaining 
bins.
Fig. 11 depicts a typical calibration chart for a wet mix plant with 4 bins, showing variation of 
aggregate feed rate with feeder belt speed. The chart can be used to determine the feeder 
belt speed settings one should use for each bin to meet the desired job mix target.
