1. INTRODUCTION
Surface evenness ofhighway pavements refers to the regularity
of surface finish both in longitudinal and transverse directions.
Almost in all major highway works executed, control of surface
evenness has been introduced as a mandatory requirement. The
existing standards and tolerances of surface evenness are prescribed
in IRC Special Publication
16-! 977 which was based on the
Report of the IRC Subcommittee on Surface Characteristics of
Pavements. The Subcommittee was constituted by the Specifications
and
Standards
Committee
in
November,
1968
under
the
Convenorship of Shri Mahabir Prasad. The Subcommittee presented
its Report in 1975 and was endorsed by the Specifications and
Standards Committee in
its meeting held on
5^^ January, 1976.
Later the Report was approved by the Executive Committee and
the Council at their meetings held on
14'^ April, 1976 and 27"^
August, 1976 respectively which was printed as IRC:SP: 16-1977.
The Flexible Pavement Committee (H-4) in its meeting held
on 23''' September, 2000 (personnel given below) decided to revise
the above mentioned document because of improvements observed
in the surface evenness and roughness values of the wearing surface
of highway pavements due
to
introduction of high
level of
sophistication and mechanization in road construction. The Committee
assigned the work of preparing the draft document to Shri R.S.
Shukla who gathered the evenness and roughness data fi-om various
projects and prepared the draft. The draft was discussed by the
Flexible Pavement Committee in their meetings held on 10^ February,
2001, V' September, 2001,
17^*^ May, 2002 and
16''^ November,
2002 and necessary modifications were incorporated.

IRC:SP: 16-2004
presents the First Revision of IRC:SP: 16-2004 "GuideHnes for
Surface Evenness of Highway Pavements".
2. IMPORTANCE OF SURFACE EVENNESS
2.1.
Surface evenness affects vehicle speed, comfort, vehicle
operating cost and safety and hence needs to be given careful
consideration during initial construction and subsequent maintenance.
2.2.
The standard recommended for surface evenness enables
the engineer to exercise control over the quality of construction.
2.3.
Standards
have
also
been
prepared
for
the
road
roughness of different types of surfaces to enable an evaluation of
the condition of the surface and prioritize and establish further
maintenance intervention levels.
3. MEASUREMENT OF SURFACE EVENNESS AND
ROUGHNESS
3.1.
Measurement of Surface Evenness
3.1.1.
Metre straight edge
: The measurement and checking
of surface evenness can be done by a 3-metre straight edge during
construction soon after the completion of a short stretch. In case of
layers involving bituminous pavements or cement concrete pavements
extra care is needed to rectify the defects before the material cools
down/sets.
The 3 -metre straight edge
is made of steel or box type
aluminum alloy bar, with sectional dimensions of 75 mm x 125 mm.
The edge should be perfectly straight and free from rust or other
defects.
Depressions under the straight edge are measured with a
graduated wedge. The wedge shall be metallic. The dimensions are:
600 mm long base, 30 mm thickness and 30 mm height at one end
4



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 32
======================================================================
IRQSP: 16-2004
tapering to
1 mm at the other. Graduations are provided at the
hypotenuse and on the sides in mm, relative to the height from the
base. These graduations are meant to read undulations upto 25 mm
with a least count of a minimum of 3 mm. The wedge is provided
with a handle of suitable length for facilitating measurements in
standing position.
For recording undulations in the longitudinal profile, the straight
edge is put longitudinally in the middle of each traffic lane along a
line parallel to the centre line of the road. For a single lane road
measurement ofunevenness is made on both sides of the center line.
The straight edge
is placed
at the starting point, wedge
inserted between it and the test surface where the gap is maximum
and recorded. The straight edge is then slided forward for about
half of its length, i.e., 1.5 metre and wedge reading repeated. The
straigl^t edge need not always be moved forward but may be
moved backward and forward to record the maximum undulations
existing at a location. The undulations in excess of the permissible
magnitude sh^all be marked with paint to be rectified immediately.
3.2.
Measurement of Surface Roughness
The roughness of pavement surface is commonly designated
as Unevenness Index Value and is expressed in surface roughness
is measured by a bump integrator.
3.2. 1
.
Bump integrator
: Either towed fifth wheel bump
integrator or car-mounted bump integrator can be used for measuring
the road roughness. These
are response type road roughness
measuring systems and are extensively used in the country for
measurement of roughness.
Towed Fifth Wheel Bump Integrator
The indigenous version of this device is the Automatic Road
Unevenness Research (ARUR). The equipment consists of a trailer
5



======================================================================
PAGE 18 of 32
======================================================================
IRC:SP: 16-2004
towed by a vehicle. A standard pneumatic tyre wheel inflated to a
tyre pressure of 2. 1 kg/sqcm is mounted within the trailer chassis,
with a single leaf spring on either side of the wheel supporting the
chassis/Two dashpots provide viscous damping between chassis
and axle. The frame is provided with a counter weight at the front
to make the device practically free from the effects of the vertical
motion of the vehicle. A mechanical integrator makes cumulative
measurements of the unidirectional vertical movement of the wheel
relative to the chassis. The distance travelled is measured by a
distance measuring unit. The test is conducted at a speed of 32 ±
I km/hour. Unevenness/roughness Index is defined as the ratio of
the cumulative vertical displacement to the distance travelled and is
expressed in mm/km.
The equipment is driven over the road surface at a speed of
32 ±
1 km/hour, keeping steady motion and avoiding swerving. The
observer will activate the main switch fitted on the panel board at
the beginning of the section and switch
it off at the end of the
section. The readings of the revolution counter and integrating
counters are noted and entered in the data sheet.
The bump integrator values are recorded when the wheel
revolution counter records 460 units v/hich correspond to
1 km.
The brief description of the road surface
is also noted as the
observer travels over the surface. The fifth wheel should preferably
travel
on
wheel
path.
For measurement
of roughness,
one
measurement in each lane is recommended for riding comforts
evaluation.
Car-Mounted Bump Integrator
The car-mounted integrator consists of an integrating unit as
provided in the fifth wheel Bump Integrator. The integrating unit is
fitted with the rear axle and mounted in the rear portion of the car
or rear floor of a jeep.
6



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 32
======================================================================
IRC:SP: 16-2004
There are two sets of counters, one each for measurement of
bumps and distance along with a switch on the panel board. Only
one set of counter is used at a time. The advantage of having two
counters
is that one may be kept in use while the other is kept
stand-by and will display the data of the previous run. In addition,
the switching of the counters with the help of toggle switch provided
in the panel board gives data exactly kilometre-wise. The power is
drawn from the car itself
The differential movement between the rear axle and the body
of the vehicle due to road unevenness is measured by the upward
vertical motion of a wire which is transmitted into unidirectional
rotatory movement of the pulley of the integrator unit. There is an
arrangement in the integrating unit for converting the rotational
movement into electric pulses which is recorded by the counters.
One count in electro-magnetic counter corresponds to 25.4 mm
relative movement between axle and floor of the vehicle. One count
in distance counter corresponds to 20 m length of distance travelled.
The road roughness is affected by the vehicle speed. A bump
gets magnified if the vehicle speed is not maintained. Vehicle load is
another factor which influences the roughness measurement. For
gerdng the realistic values the vehicle speed must be maintained at
32 i
1 kmph. The laden weight of the vehicle is also standardized.
While taking measurements the vehicle should carry maximum three
passengers. It should be ensured that the outer vehicle wheel travels
on the wheel path.
3.2.2.
Calibration of bump integrator
: Roughness of a
pavement is indicative of its riding quality and level-of-service. The
roughness values provide an important impact in taking decision for
surface improvement and maintenance measures. It is, therefore,
necessar/ that the measurements are accurate and reliable. However,
in response type devices, significant variations are often encountered
7



======================================================================
PAGE 20 of 32
======================================================================
IRO.SP: 16-2004
in roughness measurement. Physical changes in the instrument, like,
wearing of the tyre, braking or replacement of leaf spring, replacement
of clamping unit, towing hitch, etc. may lead to large variations in the
machine output.
Thus, in order to ensure repeatabiHty and reproducibility of
measurement by the same machine and consistency in measurement
from different machines,
it is essential that the response of the
device to the road surface roughness should be correct.
Initial
standardisation and subsequent recalibration of response type devices
are essential. The new measurements obtained from the response
type devices must be correct to the standard roughness scale by
calibration.
Procedures
for Calibration equipment commonly
employed are:
•
Dipstick
•
MERLIN-Machine for Evaluating Ro^d Roughness using Low
Cost Instrument
•
Rod and Level
A brief description of the above calibration equipments
including procedure for their use is given in Annexures 1, 2 and
3 respectively.
A number of test sites, 8 to 10, of straight sections of length
400 to 500 m, of different roughness level covering a wide range
of spectrum of surface roughness ranging from very smooth to very
rough are selected. Care is taken tO/ensure that sufficient approach
length on either side is available to attain vehicle test speed before
entering the starting point of the test section. The entire length of all
selected sites should have uniform riding quality and free of surface
defects. For better visibility, wheel paths are marked with a road
marking paint. Both the starting and the ending point of each site are
also marked clearly so that the operator can identify the starting and
ending point of the section during data recording. Section roughness

and the corresponding reference values for each section are recorded
through any of the above mentioned calibration devices for developing
the calibration. At each test site a number of runs are made till at
least three sets of consistent data are obtained. Average of the three
values is taken as the representative roughness value of the section.
The device to be calibrated also run on the identified sections
and the roughness
is measured. Based on these two
sets of
observations a correlation between the reference roughness and
roughness measured by the bump integrator is established. From
these relations the corrected roughness values are obtained.

The longitudinal profile shall be checked with a
3-metre straight edge at the middle of each traffic lane along a line
parallel to the central line of the road. The maximum permissible
number of surface unevenness in longitudinal profile in 300 m length
shall be as given in Table 2.
5. RECOMMENDED STANDARD FOR ROUGHNESS
VAI.UES
5.1.
The maximum permissible values of surface roughness
measured with a bump integrator for different surfaces are given in
Table 3.
5.2.
Newly constructed surfaces are expected to give
roughness values corresponding to 'Good' category while the
values under 'Average' and 'Poor' category indicate level-of-
service and intervention level for maintenance. Surfaces with very
low roughness values loose skid resistance and are not desirable
fi-om safety considerations. Such surfacings should receive prompt
attention for restoring fiictional resistance.

DIPSTICK FOR CALIBRATION OF BUMP
INTEGRATOR
1. INTRODUCTION
This specification covers the details of use of dipstick for the
calibration ofBump Integrator.
2. EQUIPMENT
Dipstick is a fully integrated data collection and processing
system that measures and records road profiles accurately and
quickly. The equipment consists of the following:
•
Dipstick road profiler
Micro computer
RS 232 interface
Software library for automatic calculation of IRI, F - Numbers,
True Profile plots and other standards
All cords and accessories
Sequential elevation differences are recorded automatically by
the on - board computer. Recorded information is then transferred
to a PC or compatible computer for analysis.
Software is included to calculate and print various profile
statistics including the Intemational Roughness Index (IRI), as well
as the individual point elevation and local surface curvatures. A
continuous scaled plot of surface profile can also be produced with
a printer that has IBM Graphics. For correlation with
5^*" Wheel
Bump Integrator Values, the following relation may be used:
BI
=
630 (IRI)'
'2
Where,
BI
= Bump Integrator Roughness in mm/km
IRI =
Intemational Roughness Index

IRCSP: 16-2004
3. PROCEDURE
The Dipstick Profiler stands on two support legs. The operator
simply
*Valks" the Dipstick along a survey line alternately pivoting
the instrument about each leg. In less than an hour, one technician
can measure, record and analyze upto 600 equally spaced, co-
linear elevation points to an accuracy of ±0.15 mm per reading.
Dipstick surveys take less than half the time and are more accurate
than both optic and laser surveys. Data analysis is fully computerized.
Two digital displays show the elevation difference between
the Dipstick two support legs. Each elevation difference reading is
measured and automatically recorded.
Audible and visual signals aleit the operator when each
measurement is complete. An optional manual trigger is also available
to allow the operator to initiate the recording of each reading.

'MERLIN' FOR CALIBRATION OF BUMP
INTEGRATOR
1. SCOPE
This specification covers the method for use of MERLES
(Machine for Evaluating Road Roughness using Low Cost Instrument)
for calibration of Bump Integrator.
2. EQUIPMENT
MERLIN has a rigid frame
1 .8 metre long with a wheel in
front, a curved foot at the rear and a probe mid-way between the
two which rests on the road surface.
If the road surface was
perfectly smooth, the probe would always lie on a straight line
between the bottom of the wheel and the rear foot. On an uneven
road surface the probe would usually be displaced above or below
the line. A computer simulation shows that the spread of these
displacements could be used to estimate on the standard roughness
scale.
To measure the displacements, the probe is attached to a
pivoted arm, at the other end of which a pointer moves over a
chart. The arm has a mechanical amplification of 10 so that a
movement of the probe of 1 mm will produce a pointer movement
of 10 mm.
3. PROCEDURE
The roughness of a section of the road
is measured by
wheeling MERLIN along the road with the frame raised. Once
ever}' wheel revolution, the frame is lowered so that the probe and
rear foot touch the ground and the resulting pointer position is
recorded as a cross on the chart. Two hundred measurements are

made to produce a histogram. The rougher the road surface, the
greater is the variabiHty of displacement. The speed of displacement
has been found to correlate well with road roughness as measured
on roughness scale. The width of the central 90 per cent of the
histogram is measured from the chart and this can conveniently be
converted directly into roughness from conversion equations that
are available.

ROD AND LEVEL METHOD
1. INTRODUCTION
This specification covers the rod and level method for the
calibration ofbump integrator.
2. EQUIPMENT
The equipment required are as under:
• Dumpy level
• A Graduated Rod
3. PROCEDURE
3. L
The procedure is as follows:
•
A
line close
to
the road centerline preferably
at wheel
path,
is randomly selected.
•
Elevation in mm at every 300 mm interval for a 120 metre
long sections corresponding to the minimum and maximum
wavelength
which
affects
significantly
the
dynamic
response of a negotiating vehicle are taken.
Since the vertical deviation in rod profile occur both in
positive as well as negative directions they tend to average out over
long distances. Two methods of profile analysis are used to avoid
this cancellation and summarize meaningfully the deviations.
3.1.1.
Root - mean - square deviation (RMSD)
: In this
method, the amplitudes of the deviations are squared and averaged
for the specific wavelength so that the values remain positive. The
positive square root of the average is reported as RMSD for the
specified wavelength.
3.1.2.
Average rectified deviation (ARD)
: In this method,
the absolute amplitude of the deviations are averaged for the
specified wavelengths so that the value remains positive. The
average is reported as the ARD for the specified wavelength.
