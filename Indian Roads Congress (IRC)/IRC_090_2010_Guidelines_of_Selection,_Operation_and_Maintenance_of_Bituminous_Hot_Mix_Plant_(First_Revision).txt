INTRODUCTION
There has been significant advancement
in hot mix plant technology over the
last
two decades. This has prompted the revision of the document titled "Guidelines For
Selection, Operation and Maintenance of Bituminous Hot Mix Plants" (IRC:90-1985)
to update the same. With continued emphasis on mechanisation
in road construction
it
is necessary to familiarize the consultants, contractors, concessionaires, planning
and construction engineers with the technology aspects of hot mix plants and enable
them to select the appropriate type of hot mix plant, operate the plant in an optimum
manner with minimum downtime.
It is hoped that this document will serve its intended
purpose. The changes
in the design of hot mix plants at various spell of time have
been described in detail.

1 BACKGROUND
U
The hot mix plant technology came into existence around 1870,
in which the basic
requirement for preparation of hot mix that
is drying, screening,
proportioning and
mixing were combined. These plants were crude and remained
in that shape upto
the end of 1900. By 1900, the plants were improved by including aggregates
bins,
cold elevators, rotary dryers, hot elevators, bitumen tanks and mixing platforms which
consisted of an aggregate
measuring box, bitumen bucket, and pug
mill mounted
at sufficient height to allow horse drawn carts pass underneath. The hot mix plants
up to 125 tonne per hour capacity were available by 1930. There was considerable
improvement in the design of hot mix plant during 1930 to 1940, when the conveyor
belts,
better quality of gates, feeders
in
cold feeder system,
large size of dryers,
cyclone type dust collectors, spring less scales and pyrometer recording system were
inducted. These plants were continuous as well as batch type.
In
early
1950,
higher capacity
of plants with automatic burner
control,
automatic
proportioning and cycling function came into use. The hot mix plant continuous type
15/20 tonne per hour capacity were imported and
inducted
in
India during
1963
under International Development Agency project. During 1970's
the most significant
development took place by emerging surge and storage bins; computerized control
system and improvement in noise and dust control system in hot mix plant, considering
health and safety aspect of operating
staff. These plants were based on continuous
production process, were simpler
in design and more portable. The hot mix plants
20/30 tonne per hour capacity were indigenously developed
in India during mid 70's
and a good fleet worked successfully upto 90's. During late 1970 and early 1980's,
there was sharp increase
in petroleum
price. Thus, further development took place
in the design of hot mix plant making
it more fuel efficient, reusing milled bituminous
pavement known as "Reclaimed Bituminous Pavement" (RBP) to preserve the natural
resources of aggregates
and keep the environment
free from pollutants.
In Europe,
USA and other parts of the world, asphalt is used as binder. Therefore, the pavement
to be
laid
is known as asphalt pavement and reused
milled asphalt pavement as
"Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement" (RAP).
In India bitumen
is used as binder. Therefore,
these terminologies are known as bituminous pavement and Reclaimed Bituminous
Pavement" (RBP). Since, heating, drying and mixing took place
in the same drum,
these plants became popular with the name "Drum Mix Plant".
By the end of year 2000, further development took place in the design of hot mix plant
for efficient utilization of heat produced in dryer drum and use of reclaimed bituminous
pavement. This technology was known as double barrel technology. In this technology.

IRC;90-2010
the concentric chambers of same drum are used to heat the virgin aggregates and mix
the same with molten bitumen,
filler and reclaimed bituminous pavement.
Effort has been made
in these Guidelines to get the highway engineers acquainted
with different type of hot mix plants available
in international market.
It will facilitate
selection of the hot mix plant in the region for preparation of hot mix depending upon
the quantum of work, availability of aggregates, fuel efficiency and use of reclaimed
bituminous pavement.
2 PURPOSE
of hot mix plant is:
To blend different sizes of aggregates in specified proportion.
To dry the aggregates (reduce moisture content to below 0.5 percent)
and heat them to the specified temperature.
To heat the bitumen uniformly at specified temperature.
To
feed
controlled
quantity
of bitumen
and
filler
in
the
specified
proportion.
To mix the aggregates with bitumen and filler thoroughly and uniformly
to produce homogenous mix at the specified temperature
To run in a safe, environment-friendly and reliable manner to carry out
the above tasks accurately and consistently.
3 CLASSIFICATION
The plant is classified based on its capacity, type of flow of aggregates and hot gases
in dryer drum, methodology adopted for preparation of hot mix.
3.1
Capacity of Hot Mix Plant
As per IS 3066-1965 and
IS 5890-2004, the capacity of hot mix plant
is given
in
tonne per hour and
is specified
in the following manner for two different values of the
moisture content in the aggregates
:
a)
Output of plant at 6 percent moisture content in aggregates
.
b)
Output of plant at 2 percent moisture content in aggregates.
The hot mix plant 40/60 tonne per hour capacity specifies that the output of plant
shall be 40 tonne per hour at 6 percent moisture content present in aggregates and
60 tonne per hour at 2 percent moisture content present in aggregates.

IRC;90-2010
3.2
Methodology Adopted for Preparation of Hot Mix
Hot mix is prepared
in hot mix plant either on continuous operation basis or in batch.
According to preparation of hot mix, hot mix plants are divided into two categories.
a)
Continuous type
b)
Batch type
'
3.2.1
Hot mix plant (continuous type)
in continuous type of plant, aggregates, fines and bitumen are continuously inducted into
pugmill/drum mix in desired proportion and hot mix discharged without interruption.
3.2.2
Hot mix plant (batch type)
'
/
In batch type plant, hot bitumen
is added with the batch of hot aggregates and
filler
(if necessary)
at desired temperature
in desired proportion
in mixing
unit. The mix
prepared
in batch
is transferred either into silo for its storage or directly fed into tipper
for transportation. This process of batch transfer continues one after the other. The
batch type hot mix plant
is classified based on capacity, type of flow of aggregates
and
hot gases, screening system adopted for grading the aggregates
, quantity of hot
mix prepared per batch and number of batches prepared per hour.
The
batch
type
hot mix
plants
upto 400 tonne
per hour capacity
are
available
internationally.
Flow of material (aggregates, bitumen and fines)
is similar for various designs of hot
mix plants except the method of screening, proportioning and mixing.
Plant capacity
is specified
in number of batches produced per hour.
Normally, one
batch
is prepared within 45 to 60 seconds.
3.3
Direction of Flow of Aggregates and Hot Gases
The direction of flow of aggregates and hot gases
in dryer drum specify the type of
flow in the plant.
It may be of two types.
a)
Counter flow type: In this type of plant, virgin aggregates enter the end
from where exhaust gases are discharged. The aggregates
and hot
gases flow in opposite direction
inside the dryer drum, which increases
efficiency of heat transfer process, lowers exit gas temperature, reduces
the plant emission and fuel consumption.

IRC:90-2010
b)
Parallel flow type:
In this type of plant, aggregates and hot gases flow
in same direction inside the dryer drum. This type of drum mixer has
certain limitations, which are given below:
1 )
The thermal efficiency of plant
is on lower side due to low heat
.
transfer inside the drum mixer. As a result, fuel consumption
is on
the higher side.
2)
The stack temperature
is high, as most of the drying process of
aggregates takes place near the burner zone.
3)
High blast of air from burner carries the dust from dry aggregates
through the exhaust, resulting
in environmental hazards.
3.3=1
Counter flow type dryer-mixer
Three different types of dryer-mixers under this category are described below:
a)
Counter Flow Drum Mix Coater (Fig. 1)
In this type of dryer-mixer, the virgin aggregates flow opposite to the hot gases in the
dryer and enter the coater. The reclaimed bituminous pavement may also enter into
the coater or mixing section along with the virgin aggregates in super heated condition,
which in turn heats the reclaimed material.
'
>
Fig.
1 Counter Flow Drum Mix Coater
The disadvantage of this type
of drum mixer
is that the hot virgin aggregates,
liquid
bitumen and reclaimed bituminous pavement are injected at approximately the same
time in the coater, thus the mixing time is short in the coater.
In case higher percentage of reclaimed bituminous pavement is used, the short mixing
time produces less homogeneous mixture.

b)
Counter Flow Drum Mixer with Embedded Burner (Fig. 2)
<;
In this type of mixer, the burner is in inserted position inside the drum. The reclaimed
bituminous pavement is injected down stream of the burner, where
it mixes with virgin
aggregates
and liquid bitumen. The disadvantage of this plant
is that mixing time
is
short and to maintain the burner is cumbersome process, since
its key components
are not accessible. Thus, this type of drum mixer could not become
popular.

c)
Double Barrel Drum Mixer (Fig. 3)
In this type of mixer, the transfer of heat from virgin aggregates to reclaimed bituminous
pavement
is very effective due to sufficient mixing time. Thus, the mix produced
is
homogenous.

Fig. 4 Parallel Flow Plain Drum Mixer
It is a common type of
parallel flow drum mixer and
is being widely used
in different
road projects in
India, since its induction in late eighties.
b)
Drum Mixer with Centre Inlet for RBP (Fig. 5)
This type of drum mixer was developed
in 1970's due to increase in crude oil prices.
It has resulted
in the use of reclaimed bituminous pavement,
it is similar in design to
plain drum mixer except a hole
in the shell of drum to induct Reclaimed Bituminous
Pavement (RBP). This plant is suitable for use of reclaimed bituminous pavement up
to 30 percent.

c)
Drum Mixer with Coater
(Fig. 6)
It
is a parallel flow type drum mixer,
in which hot gases and aggregates move
in same
direction and reclaimed bituminous pavement
is added
in cooler zone and mixed with
liquid bitumen in a mixer or coater located at the discharge end of the drum.
It gives more
time for mixing reclaimed bituminous pavement with virgin aggregates and liquid bitumen.
It produces good quality of homogenous mix using reclaimed bituminous pavement.
RBP
Virgin aggregates
Fig. 6 Parallel Flow Type Drum Mixer with Coater
In this type of drum mixer approximately 70 percent of reclaimed material is heated by
virgin aggregates and 30 percent by hot gases.
3.4
Mobility of Hot Mix Plant
The hot mix plant whether batch type or continuous type may be categorized based
on two factors, a) Stationary type and b) Mobile type. Stationary type plants are more
rigid and normally used in construction of flexible pavement, where quantum of work is
more and frequently available to keep the plant engaged.
In case quantum of work
is
small and plant needs frequent shifting, mobile type of plant is preferred. Major units of
mobile type drum mix plant are fitted with pneumatic tyres, which make
it convenient
to tow
it from one place to another. Mobile batch type hot mix plant does not require
a crane of bigger capacity for
its commissioning and dismantling. Nowadays a third
category of hot mix plant known as self-erecting or portable type is also in use.
In this
case,
the plants have an integrated foundation on which
it can be erected.

4.1.2
Cold elevator or coJd feed conveyor
It feeds the aggregates received from gathering conveyor to dryer drum. The conveyor
used
is known as slinger conveyor.
4.1.3
Dryer drum
It plays a vital role in the performance of hot mix plant.
It is revolving cylindrical drum
normally ranging between
1 .5 to 3.0 m in diameter and 6 to
1 2 m
in length depending
upon the capacity of plant. The drum
is in inclined position and
its length to diameter
ratio
is 4
to
6.
It includes burner and blower fan, which provides primary
air
for
combustion of fuel and an exhaust fan to create a draft through the dryer. The drum
is
fitted with longitudinal trough or channels called flights mounted with bolts and nuts.
The flights
lift the aggregates
and drop
it
in veils through the burner flame and hot
gases. The dwell time (retention time for aggregates
in dryer drum) will depend on the
slope of the dryer drum,
its revolutions per minute, diameter, length, number of flights
and their arrangement, and efficiency of burner. The balance between fuel and
air
supply should be maintained for complete combustion and efficient dryer operation.
Imbalance between
draft
air and blower
air velocities can cause a back pressure
within the drum, which should be maintained.
Normally, dryers are designed to heat and dry the aggregates at 4 to 6 percent moisture
content for maximum efficiency.
If moisture content present in aggregates
increases,
the feeding
of aggregates
into dryer drum
is reduced,
resulting
in drop
in
hourly
production capacity of plant.
The temperature
of the aggregates controls the temperature of mix. The
layer of
bitumen put on each
particle of aggregates during mixing achieves the aggregates
11

temperature
instantaneously.
The
aggregates
heated
at
high
temperature
can
harden the bitumen during mixing while underheated aggregates cannot get a proper
coating of bitumen. Therefore, aggregates should be heated uniformly at approphate
temperature to achieve homogenous mix. The temperature of aggregates should be
measured with pyrometers/ thermocouple or other suitable device by putting them at
appropriate location.
4.1.3.1
Burner and fuel
j
The burner used in hot mix plant is based on gas or fuel oil or a combination of them. In
India, light diesel oil or furnace oil
is used as fuel, hence burner should be suitable for
such application. Burner should have a blower of adequate capacity to ensure efficient
fuel atomization with low noise, auto ignition and flame failure detection device. The
important components and the function of an efficient burner are as under:
a)

It feeds the fuel supply.
It maintains the fuel pressure being fed to nozzle unit.
It regulates the return oil pressure from nozzle unit,
thus adjusting the quantity of fuel oil atomized at the
nozzle.
It supplies air for combustion including excess air.
It regulates the volume of air being supplied to
burner
in proportion with fuel oil and
is fitted at the
outlet of
blower. The damper closes when intensity
of flame is low and opens while
it is high.
These are low voltage, fully enclosed, fan cooled,
squirrel cage induction motors to drive blower and
fuel feed pump.
It is used to control opening of air damper and fuel
return line valve through automatic temperature
controller or manual switch.

All controls,
relays,
indicators, switches, timers,
pilot lamps, wiring for automatic or

The fuel oil tank should be located close to the burner and bottom of tank should be at
same elevation as burner. The pipeline between burner and fuel tank should be clean,
of adequate diameter with minimum bends to reduce suction resistance.
The viscosity of furnace oil is more specially during cold weather. Therefore, pre- heater
of suitable capacity is provided to keep uninterrupted supply of fuel into burner.
4.1.4
Primary pollution control device
It
is the primary dust collection System
(Fig.
9) of hot mix
plant.
Its function
is to
remove undesirable amount of dust coming from the exhaust.
It is cyclonic in shape, in
which dust is collected and removed/ added to dry aggregates,
if required.
It consists
of cyclonic separators and works on the principle of centrifugal separation.
It is fitted
at the rear of dryer drum. The flue gases leaving the dryer drum pass through these
separators. Single cylinder cyclone basically consists of a large diameter cylindrical
shell having a conical base. Dust laden gas enters this shell tangentially, which gives
it spinning motion and makes
it to travel upto bottom of cylinder. After reaching the
bottom,
it spirals up and
is sucked out (vacuum created by exhaust fan) through
coaxial cylinder fitted at the top. The larger size dust particles are thrown out towards
the wall of the cylinder due to spinning motion of gas. These particles slide down and
are collected in a hopper. These are removed through auger screw and sent to mixing

zone,
if desired. Multiple units of cones having longer length of cyclones, smoothness
of inner wall are the main factors responsible for higher efficiency of cyclone. These
are capable of
removing 60 to 90 percent of dust from the dryer exhaust. Hot Mix
Plant Emission and their Control are given in Annex-C.
Fig. 9 Primary Dust Collector
4.1.4.1
Exhaust stack
The exhaust gases are eliminated through the plant exhaust stack. These gases
further pass through the secondary pollution control device, that is bag house filter for
further filtration.
4.1.5
Hot elevator
The aggregates after heating and drying are carried by a hot elevator (bucket conveyor
system) to the gradation
unit. A stone box
is provided
at the edge of hot elevator
discharge chute, which lowers and smoothens the flow speed of aggregates falling on
screen sieves. However,
in case of tower model where the dryer is at the top, there is
no need for any hot elevator.
4.1.6
Screening unit
The primary gradation of aggregates
is done in cold bin feeder system. The secondary
gradation of aggregates,
in hot condition,
is carried out
in screening
unit. Thus
it
is
known as second gradation control unit of hot mix plant batch type. The screening of
hot aggregates
is essential
in batch type hot mix plants to feed appropriate quantity
of graded hot aggregates
in each batch. Normally, two designs of plants have been
adopted to separate different size of aggregates.

Hot mix plant (batch type) fitted with rotary screen (Fig. 13)
In rotary screening, cold aggregates are taken into screening drum, where screening and
heating takes place simultaneously. In both cases, graded material is collected in hot bins.
Fig. 13
Hot Mix Plant (Batch Type) Fitted with Rotary Screen
The heat losses in screening and dryer drum are lesser, thus thermal efficiency of hot
mix plant (batch type) fitted with rotary motion is higher. Besides, the maintenance of
this type of plant is also less.
In rotary screening unit, cold aggregates received from cold bin feeder are fed into drum, in
which drying and screening of aggregates takes place in same dnjm via counter flow process
(Fig. 14). The drum
is inclined and nx)unted on two tire rings. The shovel flights are fitted
to the internal surface along the dmm length to move the aggregates and form an efficient
drying curtain. Four sections of screens with saew flight plates on outer surface sieve the
various sized aggregates
and deposit heated aggregates
into different compartments of
hot bins. The over sized aggregates are removed for disposal. The vacuum drum pressure
device fitted
to control the rotary actuator at exhaust fan regulates the air flow.

4.1.6.3
Hot screens
•
For multi-deck vibratory screening
unit, the screen provided
at the top
is a scalping
screen,
which
rejects and
carries
off oversized
aggregates.
It
is followed
by two
intermediate sized screens decreasing in size from top to bottom and last is fine screen.
For rotary screening
unit, the screen configuration along the direction of aggregates
flow is reverse to that of multi-deck vibratory screening unit. That
is, the first screen
is
the fines screen, whereas the last screen
is the scalping or oversized rejection screen.
The function of the screens
is to separate the aggregates
into specific sizes. The
screens must be clean, robust and their capacity matching with the capacity of dryer
drum and pugmill. Induction of finer aggregates
into a bin intended to contain next
larger size fraction
is called carry over. The carry over affects the mix design formula.
Carry over more than the prescribed
limit can add the fines present in aggregates
in
total mix, thus increasing the surface area to be covered with bitumen. To prevent
excessive carryover, screens should be checked daily for cleanliness.
4.1.7
Hotbins
These
are used
to
store
the
. heated and screened
aggregates
of various
sizes
temporarily (Fig.
15). Each bin
is an individual compartment or a segment at large
compartment with division by partitions which are minimum 4 Nos. The capacity of
each hot bin should be sufficient enough to hold the aggregates
of each size and
avoid their intermingling, when the plant
is operating at
full capacity. Normally, the
capacity of all hot bins should be of about ten batches production.
Each bin should be equipped with an overflow pipe to prevent the excess amount
of aggregates
from backing up
into other
bins. The overflow pipes should be
set to stop
overfilling
of the bins. Overflow vents should be checked frequently
to ensure that they are
flowing.
If a
bin
overfills,
the screen above
it
rides on
the aggregates, resulting
in heavy carryover and the possibility of damage to the
screen. Each compartment
is equipped
with pneumatically actuated two stage
discharge gates controlled by the computer system.
It
is
fitted with a maximum
level indicator wired remotely to control the quantity of aggregates
in bins and
warn the operator when bins are full. Hot bins should not be allowed to run empty/
starving
also. Any shortage or excess of aggregates
in the hot bins should be

regularized, by adjusting the aggregates
supply from respective bin of cold
bin
feeder. Any leakage at the bottom of hot bins should be immediately repaired to
avoid improper mix gradation.

Hot bin levelling indicator
It detects the quantity of aggregates stored
in hot bins and indicates when
it falls
below a certain level (Fig. 16). The indicators may be operated either electronically
or mechanically.
Presently, electronic indicators mounted on the side of the bins
are used. Aggregates inside the bin apply pressure on the walls of the bin,
which
controls the operation
of diaphragm and
indicator.
In case aggregates drop
to
a predetermined
level,
it
is displayed through
indicating lamps/warning
sign
in
control panel.

4.1.7.3
Bin sampling device
This device (Fig. 17)
is provided
in the plant to take sample of hot aggregates
from
bins and to check their segregation.
It diverts the flow of aggregates from feeders or
gates under hot bins into sample containers.
It
is essential that sampling device be
located such, as to collect representative samples of material
in bins.
It is seen from
the flow of material over the screen
in the plant that fine particles fall to one side of
each bin and coarse particles to other side. Therefore, the position of sampling device
in stream of material discharged from a bin determines whether the sample contains
a fine portion, a coarse portion or an accurate proportion of material
in bin.
It assists
in calibrating the grading of aggregates.

4.1.8
Weigh hopper
The aggregates are withdrawn from hot bins
in desired quantity through
load
cell
and accumulated
in weigh
hopper. The sequence
of collection
of aggregates
in
weigh hopper is coarse aggregates first, intermediate sized aggregates next and fine
aggregates in the last. This sequence is designed to place the fine fractions at the top
of weigh hopper, so that they cannot leak out through the gate at the bottom of weigh
hopper. This system allows the most efficient utilization of available volume in weigh

4.1.8.1
Weighing equipment
It is used to weigh aggregates,
filler and bitumen separately to achieve specified mix
formula.
Earlier, the weight of different constituents was being measured with spring
balance system. Now,
this system has been replaced with load
cell which
is
lighter,
more reliable, easy to calibrate and low in maintenance cost. The weight of each weigh
hopper is measured through transducer, which sends electrical signal by a load
cell.
Load
cell
is installed at weigh hoppers with
ball rod-ends, rubber vibration dampers
and insulators. Following precautions are observed
in this connection:
a)
Lead wire of load cell may be tied 30 cm away from load cell.
b)
Severe shock or excessive load more than
1 .5 times the rated capacity
should
not be applied on load
cell which may cause damage to
it.
Normally, load
cell
is designed to bear 20 to 30 percent of rated load
when respective weigh hopper is full of rated load.

is weighed separately
in weigh bucket (Fig. 19) before being inducted into
pugmill. When the weight of bitumen reaches a pre-determined
level
in the bucket,
a valve
in delivery
line closes
it, which prevents
its excess entry
into bucket. The
bitumen
is then pumped into pugmill through spray bar.

capacity should be provided for smooth running of 165 tonne per hour capacity hot
mix plant. Dial indicator type thermometer is provided outside the tank to indicate the
temperature of bitumen.
The heating system of bitumen should be efficient, having good
fluidity of bitumen
for its easy pumping and spraying to get uniform coating on aggregates. The source
used for heating may be through direct heating, thermic oil heating or electric heating.
The viscosity of bitumen decreases with increase in temperature. Therefore,
bitumen
heating will depend on
its grade. The heating temperature of modified bitumen
is kept
approximately 10°C above ordinary bitumen temperature. The heating may be done
in any of the following ways:
a)
Direct heating system
In this system
, flue tube along with burner is provided in bitumen tank. Burner operated
with light diesel oil/ furnace oil heats the bitumen around flue tube.

Heating of Bitumen through Thermic Oil System
Mixing unit (pugmiil)
It
is the chamber in which bitumen and aggregates are mixed thoroughly to achieve
homogenous
mix. A
lined
mixing chamber
with two
horizontal
shafts
containing
several paddle arms and paddle tips are mounted. The paddle tips can be adjusted
and replaced
easily. Paddles arms and tips are made of wear resistant high nickel
hardened cast alloy steel for longer service
life and low maintenance cost.
It has hot
oil jacketing system to avoid drop
in mix temperature. The paddles must be set such
that there are no dead areas
in the pugmiil. The dead area
is a place where material
can accumulate out of reach of paddles and cannot be mixed thoroughly. Dead areas
can be avoided by assuring that clearance between paddle
tip and the liner
is less
than half the maximum aggregates
size. The quantity of material to be fed
in pugmiil
is very important to achieve the homogenous mix (Fig. 21).
If material level is too high,
22



======================================================================
PAGE 33 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:90-2010
the upper most material tends to float ^bove the paddles and does not mix thoroughly.
Conversely, too
little material
in pug
mill results
in raking of tip paddles through the
material without actually mixing
it.
Therefore, to achieve the maximum operating efficiency
, the paddle tips should be
barely visible at the surface of material during mixing.

Mixing cycle
It
is the cycle during which bitumen, aggregates and mineral
filler are blended
in
pugmill of hot mix plant.
4.1.10.2
Batch mixing time
It is the time between opening of weigh hopper gate and closing of pugmill discharge
gate.
During
this
period,
the aggregates and
bitumen
are
properly mixed
and
homogenous mixture of thoroughly cooked
particles achieved. The batch mixing
time should be minimum and such that homogenous mixture of evenly distributed
and uniformly coated aggregates particles
is achieved. The sequence of operations
in Pugmill
is shown
in Fig. 22. The improvement
in design and techniques result
in lowering the mixing time and achieve the mix as per specification. Longer mixing
time will adversely affect quality of mix, due to exposure of thin bitumen film to high
aggregates temperature
in the presence of air,
thus causing oxidation of bitumen.
It
will
also
result
in drop
in the capacity
of plant. Thus,
the production
cost
will
increase.
Normally, batch mixing time of the plant begins with 30 second mix cycle. The optimum
mixing time will depend upon type of aggregates, design of mix, presence of moisture
in aggregates, viscosity of bitumen, shape and size of pugmill; shape, size number of
paddle tips and their arrangement, peripheral speed of paddle tips, type and quantity
of bitumen flow, method adopted for adding aggregates and their sequence, size of
pugmill v/s batch size, condition of pugmill, operator's efficiency.

capacity for temporary holding
is provided at the discharge end of the mixer to store
the material until
it can be delivered
in a hauling truck.
If reclaimed material is to be processed
in the plant, the reclaimed bitumen pavement
material
is placed
in a separate cold bin and transferred to the pug

is done as they move through the pug mill.
4.1.11
Mineral filler/dust control system
The mineral
filler such as rock dust, hydrated lime or cement are used for the purpose
and stored
in a separate chamber to protect
it from dampness and to avoid
its choking/
hardening from moistures. The system consists of (a) a screw feeder which carries
filler
from
filler tank of adequate capacity (b) a screw feeder to carry
dust collected from bag
filter and merge both of them into a common chute known as filler stock bin. Transportation
of filler from filler bin to weigh hopper is conducted either pneumatically or mechanically.
In
pneumatic system, mineral filler is sent under air stream and handled as a fluid.
It is more
accurate control system which eliminates the chances of plugging. The mechanical system
consists of a receiving hopper, screw conveyor, dust tight elevator to charge an elevated silo

with a vane feeder to meter the fines into the plant. The rotary valve is installed at the outlet
of the filler bin, wherein rotary plates equipped within the rotor rotate and transfer the filler
through the flapper gate, which
is driven by air cylinder installed at lower part of the rotor.
It
opens/closes as per the requirement of filler into weigh hopper.
4.1.12
Control panel
In batch type plant, aggregates and bitumen are mixed in batch, which is controlled by
opening and closing of weigh hopper, discharge gate, bitumen valve, pugmill discharge
gate with preset automatically controlled timing device. Automatic proportioning and
cycling
control work together through
preset interlocking devices. Automatic dryer
control regulates the temperature of aggregates discharged from dryer automatically
within a preset range. The control panel for batching console contains switches, circuits
for automatic batching including preset controls for weigh batch,
interlock controls,
tolerance controls and limit switches.
The control panel consists of an
air conditioned cabin
to avoid the effect of heat,
dust and vibration; which can cause malfunctions
in the system.
It incorporates
all
controllers, indicators including bin leveler, relays, switches, timers, pilot lamps, wiring
for operation of all components. The function of complete plant including operation of
different electric motors
is controlled from control panel.

Secondary pollution control device (bag house filter)
It consists of a large metal housing containing hundreds of inverted, tabular, synthetic,
heat resistant fabric filters. The function of a bag house filter (Fig. 23) is like a vacuum
cleaner. The housing
is divided into two chambers.
Dust laden
flue gas enters the
dirty gas chamber and subsequently to
filter bags
through open mouth. This gas
is sucked out of the filter bags by the effect of suction
pressure created by a vacuum pump. As the gas comes out of the filter bags,
it gets
filtered and dust is left behind
on the inner walls of filter bags
. Shaker arrangement
(mechanical shaker or reverse air flow system)
is provided to shake a portion of bags
at a time, to clean them of dirt particles. The dust shaken out of the bags drops into
a hopper at the bottom and
is taken out/sent back to mixing chamber for its reuse,
if
desired.
It is a highly efficient filter arrangement capable to separate large size particles
up to
1 micron size with 99 percent efficiency. These filters are very expensive and
should be used with great care for their optimum utilization and higher efficiency.

Hot mix surge silo
The hot mix received from hot mix plant can be loaded directly into tipper. Alternatively,
same can be transferred into surge silo (Fig. 24) and stored temporarily till its controlled
loading in tippers.
It is a cylindrical shell with dual chamber, duly insulated with thermo/
ceramic wool and can maintain hot mix temperature upto 3 hours approximately. A
combination of hot oil circulation and thermo/ceramic wool
is capable to maintain hot
mix temperature upto 16 hours approximately depending upon ambient temperature,
quantity of bituminous mix and
its temperature, hot oil temperature and
its flow. Surge
silos are normally available in the range of 50 to 200 tonne capacity. A weighing system
may be connected to the holding bin of the

e)
The environmental effects that is noise, vibration, dust, water pollution;
should be considered in depth to prevent any harm to the residents or
farm location.
f)
Proper water drainage should be provided for smooth functioning of
plant.
4.3
Advantages of Hot Mix Plant (Batch Type)
The plant is fitted with secondary gradation control unit, thus the aggregates received
in pugmill are well graded. The aggregates and bitumen are measured
in desired
quantity per batch and mixed in pugmill. Thus, homogenous mix is received in desired
proportion.
4.4
Limitations of Hot Mix Plant (Batch Type)
a) The cost of the plant is high.
b)
The plant needs more space for commissioning.
c)
Smaller capacity plants, less than 90 tonne per hour are not available
in the market, their operation being
uneconomical and not feasible.
4.5
Requirement of DG Set for Hot Mix Plant (Batch Type)
Hot mix plants are commissioned
in remote area, to keep the environment pollution
free. Power
is not frequently available
in remote areas, besides minimum fixed per
kilowatt charges are also to be paid on monthly basis to Electricity Board and cabling,
commissioning has also to be borne by consumer. The working period of plant
is
also limited. Thus,
it is a costly and time consuming factor. The diesel generating set
should be commissioned for economical and uninterrupted power supply to hot mix
plants. Normally 500 kVA diesel generating set
is required for operation of 135/165
tonne per hour capacity plant.
5 DRUM MIX PLANT
5.1
Brief
The drum mix plant was adopted in India during late 1980's, for laying bituminous mix.
In drum mix plant, aggregates gradation is controlled at cold feed end and aggregates
heating, drying and bitumen mixing are done
in same drum.
It has been adopted
widely due to its
a) Portability b) Higher efficiency c) Economy in basic cost d) Lower
fuel consumption e) Reduction
in man power and maintenance cost

operation g) Ability to produce large quantity of mix at relatively low temperature and
h) environmental friendly.
The drum mix plant may be either Parallel flow type or Counter flow type.
In Parallel
flow type drum mix plant, aggregates and hot gases flow in same direction inside the
same drum. This is conventional type of plant and
is used
in India.
In Counter flow type drum mix plant, the aggregates
and hot gases flow in opposite
direction within the same drum. These may be of two types:
.
1 )
Drying and mixing of aggregates and bitumen takes place in same drum.
2)
Drying of aggregates takes place in first drum and aftenA/ards the dried
aggregates are transferred to another drum where mixing of aggregates
and bitumen takes place. This is known as dual drum plant also. A few
such type of plants are in operation in India.
5.2
Components of Conventional Drum Mix Plant (Parallel Flow Type)
All the major components of drum mix plant (Parallel Flow Type) are shown in Fig. 25.
In addition to these,
it includes mineral

Dryer cum mixing drum (Fig. 26)
It is a rotary shell made of heat resistance steel 10 to 12 mm thick, supported on rings
and rollers.
Its main function
is:
a)
To remove moisture from aggregates by heating
it at appropriate
temperature.
b)
To blend aggregates and bitumen in desired proportion to achieve
.
homogenous mix within 140°C to 160°C.
Aggregate
Burner
Fig. 26 Components of Dryer cum Mixing Drum
5.2.5.1
Design aspects
a)
Dryer cum mixing drum
is divided into two zones:
1 ) Combustion zone: The heating and drying of aggregates take place in this
zone.
2) Mixing zone: The mixing
of aggregates,
filler and bitumen takes
place in this zone.
b)
The drum
is provided with replaceable different shapes of flights,
which perform following functions:
1) Kicker flight
-
It pushes the aggregates
inside the drum
30



======================================================================
PAGE 41 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:90-2010
2) W flight
-
It eliminates showering of aggregates
directly into flame
3) Notched flight
-
It allows the aggregates
to fall scattered,
so that all particles are heated uniformly.
4) Cup flight
-
It forms a veil of aggregates so that flame
does not reach in mixing zone.
5) Aggregates
rotation ring
-
It collects the aggregates
received in
combustion zone and moves
it to mixing
zone.
6)
J. flight
-
It blends the aggregates
, bitumen and
filler/fines.
Quantity and arrangement of flights depends on the output of the plant.
c)
Rate of drying the aggregates depend upon the moisture content present
in
it. The dwell time
in dryer cum mixing drum, can control the drying of
aggregates and achieve homogenous mix.
It depends on following factors:
1) Length to diameter ratio of drum should be in the range of 4 to 6.
2) For drum mix plants up to 90 tonne per hour capacity; speed of
drum should be in the range of 10 to 12 revolutions per minute and
slope of drum not to exceed 9 cm/metre.
d)
Burner
1) The fuel used
in the burner
in drum mix plant
is
light diesel
oil/
furnace oil. Preheater is essential for use of furnace oil.
2) Burner used
in dryer cum mixing drum (Fig. 27) is based on forced
and induced draft principle,
in which approximately 55 percent air
by exhaust fan and 45 percent by air blower is inducted in drum for
complete combustion of fuel.
3) The flame should be shorter, more intense and highly radiatory.
45 to 50 percent through forced draft

4)
It should have auto flame failure detection system to avoid coating
of aggregates with fuel. Photocell
is used for detection of flame.
5)
It should have auto ignition system to avoid explosion.
6) There should be no dribbling from nozzle tip when burner is in shut
down position.
7) Excess
air,
approximately
25
percent
should
be
supplied
for
complete combustion of fuel.
e)
Bitumen line
1 ) Liquid bitumen is not sprayed into drum.
It is pumped to a point with
such pressure, from where
it discharges by gravity into drum.
2)
It should be close to flights so that same may not be picked up with
gas stream.
3)
It should be more inside the drum but within mixing zone due to
longer dwell time for better mixing.
f)
Bitumen fines receiver
The dust received from dust collector or
filler received from mineral
filler system
is inducted
in desired proportion
in mixing zone of drum
through bitumen fines receiver, (Fig. 28) which prevents the fines from
becoming rear borne.
Fig. 28 Bitumen Fines Receiver
5.2,6
Exhaust control system
Its main function
is to induce air in dryer cum mixing drum for complete combustion, to
remove evaporated moisture in aggregates and products of combustion.
It consists of:
a)
Exhaust fan:
It
is of centrifugal type and adequate capacity.
In case
it
is not of adequate capacity, the steam shall not be pulled out of drum
and complete combustion
will
not take place
resulting
in
higher fuel
consumption and coating of aggregates with fuel.
It should be fitted with
20 horse power motor for 40/60 tonne per hour and 25 horse power with
60/90 tonne per hour capacity plant to achieve optimum efficiency.

5.2.7
Bitumen unit
The bitumen unit mainly consists of:
a)
Bitumen tank
It is insulated, of adequate capacity (minimum one day storage) meeting to
the requirement of plant capacity. Minimum 2 Nos. bitumen tanks should
be provided along with the plant. Total 20 and 25 tonne capacity bitumen
tanks are adequate to run 40/60 and 60/90 tonne per hour capacity plants
respectively.
It consists of a tank fitted with burner
in flue tube. The fuel
used in burner is light diesel oil/furnace oil. Dialindicator type thermometer
is provided outside the tank to indicate bitumen temperature. The burner
should have thermostatic
firing
control
for automatic control
of bitumen
temperature within the specified range.
b)
Bitumen pump
It is a positive displacement pump driven by variable speed motor to induct
bitumen
in mixing zone of drum. The system ensures bitumen delivery
in
desired proportion to dry weight of aggregates. In case modified bitumen is
being used in plant, provision for 1 ) one no. additional positive displacement
pump just below flue tube 2) adequate number of agitators in bitumen tank,
should be made for its proper circulation
, mixing and maintaining uniform
temperature.
It may be ensured that Guidelines for use of modified bitumen
are strictly followed to maintain the quality of mix.

'
-
-r-^-..
It consists of hot
oil tank,
hot
oil pump and bitumen
line jacketing.
It
is
used to maintain uniform temperature of bitumen and avoids
its clogging
in bitumen line. The system may be used either as duct heating or indirect
heating as described here:
1)
Direct heating:
"
v
^
An insulated tank approximately 1 25 litre capacity containing hot oil with
independent burner in flue tube
is mounted on the chasis of bitumen
tank. Air and fuel from existing bitumen heating system are used for
heating hot oil. Hot oil in the range of 1 50°C-1 80°C is circulated through
bitumen pump and bitumen line jacketing with an independent pump.
2)
Indirect heating:
Hot
oil tank
is
installed
at the top of bitumen tank, from where hot
oil passes by gravity into the pipe
line passing through the bitumen
tank. Hot oil gets heated by bitumen tank temperature and circulated
in bitumen pump and bitumen
line jacketing
via independent pump.
This
practice
is
normally used
to

separate dust particles upto 5 micron size and eliminate certain amount of gases
also with varying efficiency. This system requires large quantity of water. The ponds
of adequate capacity are made to collect the slurry, reclaim and reuse the water. The
particles settled should be removed frequently preferably within 2 to 3 days for
its
better efficiency. These are of two types, the details of which are given below:
1).
Open spray tower type (Fig. 29)
The dirty gases enter the chamber and pass through water spray under pressure. The
dust particles in the form of slurry settle down and are removed from the bottom. The
clean air passes out of the chamber.

In venturi scrubber type, dust laden gases are made to pass through a venturi section
which
is constantly wetted through stream of water at high pressure. The flue gases
pass through this venturi section and atomize the liquid resulting in deposition of dust
particles with fine water droplets. In the complete process, clean air goes out and dust

Double Barrel Drum Mix Plant
In double barrel drum mix plant technology, the concentric chambers of same drum
are used to heat and mix the virgin aggregates
with
liquid bitumen,
filler material
and reclaimed bituminous pavement (if required). The heat produced in dryer drum is
utilized more effectively in following manner:
a)
The inner shell of the dryer drum de-moisturises and heats the virgin
aggregates
upto required temperature and discharges
it to outer shell.
b)
The outer shell (annular portion)
fitted with arms and
tips
is
utilized
to mix the hot and dried virgin aggregates with reclaimed bituminous
pavement,
filler material and
liquid bitumen.
It works as pugmill and
produces homogenous mix with use of reclaimed bituminous pavement
upto 50 percent.
5.6.1
Sequence for preparation of hot mix
a)
The aggregates
in desired proportion are fed from cold
bin feeder
to dryer drum (counter flow type) and shaken well with a vibratory
flap arrangement at the entry of dryer drum, which loosens the dust
particles sticking to the aggregates.
The dryer chamber consists of three sections fitted with different types
of flights for efficient drying of aggregates and effective heat utilization.
The arrangement of flights
is shown
in the (Fig. 31). The function of
different types of flights is also shown below:

The dryer drum
is
fitted with low noise and high efficiency burner at one end. The
dryer chamber
is fitted with flights of three different configurations to ensure proper
demoisturising and heating of virgin aggregates upto required temperature. The heated
aggregates travel by gravity assisted by rotational movement of the drum (towards the
burner side) and finally come out of the dryer chamber to the mixing chamber. The
annular portion of the dryer drum
is fitted with mixing paddles/blades for churning the
hot virgin aggregates
with externally added reclaimed bituminous pavement,
liquid
bitumen and other additives for homogenous mixing as per job mix formula. The hot

6.3
Precautions During Operation of Plant
i
The following precautions should be observed during various sequence of operations
of the plant to achieve better performance and optimum utilization:
6.3.1
Cold aggregate feeder
a)
Segregation of aggregates as well as intermixing should be prevented,
while loading aggregates into bins.
b)
Bins should contain the aggregates of correct size and kept loaded
fully, to allow even flow through the feed gate in a particular set position.
The approximate tonnage per hour for gate openings is provided in the
form of calibration chart for each gate.
c)
Arching of fine aggregates is prevented by placing a vibrator in the bin
containing fines.
d)
Moisture on fine aggregates should be avoided, so that clogging may
not take place.
•
-
e)
To avoid any damage of conveyor belt, by getting the aggregates stuck
between gate and
belt, the discharge gate openings of bins be kept
1.5 times the maximum feed size of aggregates.
If required,
grizzly
may be kept over the bins to prevent large pieces of stone coming
in
the bins, which may clog the gate.
f)
After completing the work for day, bins should be
left with minimum
material especially during
rainy season.
It will ensure less strain on
belts and drives while starting four bin feeder next day and their longer
life.
.
.
,
g)
The material build up should b i checked periodically to prevent rollers
from turning and remove the same.
^
.
6.3.2
Cold ag^gregate bucket elevator
a)
In
order
to
reduce
the feeding
height
of four
bin
feeder,
a
pit
of
approximately one meter depth should be dug, to place cold elevator
mounting frame.
b)
Ensure
the
buckets
receive
the
material
from
gathering
conveyor,
eliminating digging, although the edges are hard faced to give long
life.
c)
Ensure aggregates are not accumulated
in pit.
d)
In case of rains during previous night, ensure the water logging in pit of
cold elevator is removed.



======================================================================
PAGE 55 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:90-2010
e)
Don't start the feeder, until
the dryer burner has been incited.
Dryer unit
a)
Before starting the dryer, ensure the feed box bottom door is opened,
dust removed and cleaned.
b)
Before starting the plant, the nozzle and burner should be cleaned with
kerosene oil.
c)
Don't allow the aggregates to flow through the dryer drum, when the
vertical hot elevator bucket is not working.
d)
Before starting the dryer drum, the aggregates should not be inside
it;
since a very high torque
is required to start the dryer drum filled with
aggregates.
e)
If furnace
oil
is used
in the burner,
it should be pre-heated to bring
down
its viscosity, before passing
it through burner. The furnace oil to
be preheated between 100°C-110°C.
f)
Before starting a new installation, ensure that combustion chamber of dryer
\
drum and bitumen boiler are completely dry. Refractory lining of combustion
I
chamber should be dried with low wood fire and not by oil firing.
g)
Don't permit open fire around fuel oil tanks.
h)
Always stand and hold torch at desired length, to prevent getting burnt
in case burner puffs back.
i)
While
lighting burner, never allow excessive fuel to be sprayed
into
combustion chamber of drum.
j)
Don't keep the burner lighted for a long time preferably more than five
minutes, without aggregates inside the dryer drum, as the dryer drum
may bulge. Operate the burner on low flame, when
it
is not loaded
fully.
k)
Shape
of the flame
is
regulated
by means
of
air
swirling
action.
Maximum swirl will produce a short wide flame and minimum swirl a
long cigar shaped flame.
I)
If fuel pump delivery is irregular or negligible, prime the pump and see
the pump does not suck air through joints on suction side.
m)
Observe the exhaust smoke during operation.
If
it
is found
black,
it
means incomplete combustion
of fuel and feeding
of excess
fuel.
In case of white smoke,
it shows the presence of moisture
in
fuel.
Necessary action may be taken accordingly.
45



======================================================================
PAGE 56 of 96
======================================================================
Ensure no holes are formed
in the cyclone
unit, which may add to
excess dusty conditions at site.
The flow of material
in dryer drum should be uniform.
It should not
be over loaded by passing more quantity of aggregates from four bin
feeder to dryer drum.
It should be checked by measuring hot aggregates
temperature, to be maintained at about 180°C and moisture content
not to exceed 0.5 percent.
The heat loss of aggregates from dryer to mixer and hot mix from mixer
to laying site should be checked at regular intervals of time.
•
At the end of day, put off the dryer drum burner by stopping fuel
oil
supply and then the motor.
6.3.4
Burner
The burner
fitted on
dryer
unit should be
adjusted
properly
to maintain uniform
and desired aggregates temperature. Shorter and longer flame length
will heat the
aggregates and dryer ends properly.
6.3.5
.
Hot elevator
a)
Before starting the plant, the material at the foot of elevator should be
removed through flap door.
b)
Don't allow the aggregates to flow from dryer drum, when
vertical
bucket elevator is not working.
c)
Hot elevator discharge chute is provided with liners and to be checked
weekly to determine the extent of wear.
d)
Hot aggregates from dryer drum should be delivered to vertical elevator
only when the motor of elevator picks up the speed and runs at rated
revolutions per minute.
e)
Care should be taken to see that buckets receive the material directly
with out digging.
6.3.6
Gradation unit
6.3.6.1
Screening unit:
a)
The screen must be of adequate area, having correct size of openings
-
and arranged in sequence.
b)
The screen must be set at proper slope for smooth flow of aggregates.

c)
The screen should
not have
holes. The clogging
of screen
will not
allow the aggregates to pass through. Therefore, the screens must be
inspected and cleaned frequently.
6.3.6.2
Weighing hopper:
a)
Ensure that sufficient material is always stored in
all four hopper bins.
b)
The automatic leveling
control device to maintain minimum
level of
aggregates
in any
bin
stops the
plant,
if aggregate
level drops
to
predetermined
level; should be checked
periodically.
It may also be
ensured that over flow from any bin should not occur. The cold feed
should be controlled accordingly.
c)
The sample of aggregates should be taken from each hot bin at regular
intervals to check for proper grade.
d)
The proper gate openings should be ensured, since the output and
:
^
...
proportioning of aggregates depends upon the same.
6.3.6.3
Proportioning the aggregates:
a)
Ensure that aggregate feeder gates are set as per calibration chart
provided on each gate.
b)
Gradation tests may be carried out on each sample, collected at regular
intervals.
c)
Check up the scales for zero error at no load every day.
d)
The aggregates should be discharged from hot bins into weigh hoppers,
starting with coarse and progressing down to the finest,
in the batch
plant.
e)
The aggregates, filler and bitumen weighing scales should be calibrated
correctly and checked periodically preferably once in two weeks.
6.3.7
IVIixerunit
a)
The pugmill does the job of proper mixing,
if the tips of paddle arms are
found clearly above the mix. An under filled pugmill does not allow the
paddles to work properly.
In an over filled pugmill, the material floats
above the paddles and
is not fully mixed.
b)
The mixing
should be done
in
shortest
possible
time,
to produce
uniform
mix.
If the mixing time
is too
short, the
particles would
not have a uniform coating of bitumen.
If the time
is too long, the
bitumen coating will harden because of long exposure of bitumen
to heat and
air. An average time for dry mixing
could be about

======================================================================
1RC;90-2010
15 seconds followed by 30 to 45 seconds of mixing, after bitumen
is added.
c)
Over size aggregates entering the mixer, tend the mixer arms to bend.
The clearance between the paddle tips and inside lining of mixer box
should not be more than 2 cm.
d)
Check aggregates hopper gates and bitumen feed valve to see that
they close tightly and no leakage takes place into mixer after the feed
is stopped.
e)
Ensure sequence offeeding the material. Therefore, coarse aggregates
first, followed with smaller sizes progressively in order of size.
f)
See that the paddies and tips are set to ensure proper mixing action.
g)
See that the lining and tips are not worn. The tips have a tendency to
wear faster in macadam work compared to seal coat.
h)
Check
distribution
of bitumen
uniformly over entire width
of mixer
covering all parts.
i)
Check the temperature of mix frequently, as soon as
it is dumped into
tippers. Ensure that the temperatures of aggregates and bitumen are
within the specified range.
j)
Check the mix temperature frequently for laying and rolling.
6.3.8
Bitumen unit
a)
Ensure before filling the bitumen tank,
it does not contain water. Even
a small amount of water will cause hot bitumen to foam up several
times
its normal volume, resulting in
its over flow.
b)
Fill up the bitumen tank to its 80 percent capacity only, since the volume
of bitumen increases while raising the temperature. The over flow of
bitumen can be fire hazardous.
c)
The
boiler should be located nearest to the plant to ensure safety,
reduce the strain on the bitumen pump and prevent the clogging of
bitumen
line. The lead pipes should be insulated against risk to the
work man and maintain the bitumen temperature.
It should always
be at inclined position to enable the hot bitumen to run down to the
bitumen boiler when not in use. The boiler should also be erected with
slight downward inclination towards the hottest firing end. Cold bitumen
under the flue tubes will then drain down the inclination towards the
firing end and can be drained without choking.

d)
The top lids of the bitumen tank should be kept closed, since the water,
dust are the deterrents to good and clean bitumen. Clean the external
*
sides of barrels, before charging to prevent foreign matter going into
the
boiler. The dust and
fine
particles
settle down around the
flue
tubes, which results
in poor heat transfer,
local heating of flue tubes
and cracks are produced in welding resulting in leakage, which can be
fire hazardous.
e)
In case excess
fuel has been fed
into
flue tubes, shut
off the
fuel
supply and allow air to blow off the fuel and again start the procedure
for lighting the burner.
It is always safe to start the blower first before
turning on the fuel.
f)
Bitumen must be maintained
at specified temperature. Overheating
may cause cracking and
it may be difficult to pump.
g)
Whenever there is a change in type of bitumen to be used, the bitumen
tank should be drained and cleaned thoroughly with solvent before
further use.
h)
Certain
solvents
like
diesel
oil
to be used
for cleaning
are
highly
inflammable
and
must
be
thoroughly
drained
before
bitumen
is
circulated.
If the traces of such solvents reach the mixer and come ir
contact with the heated aggregates, risk of fire cannot be ruled out,
i)
Bitumen tank burner may be lighted, only when the level of bitumen
inside the tank is higher than the heating tubes.
j)
Circulate the hot oil for about fifteen minutes to melt the bitumen sticking
to the walls of the bitumen line.
k)
While inducting hot
oil into a cold
line, open the valve very slowly, to
allow piping and jackets heat up gradually. Rapid induction of hot
oil
into cold lines will result in uneven expansion of lines and may damage
the connecting points in line.
I)
The hot oil level should be checked regularly in the hot oil tank.
If the level
falls, check for any leakage in hot oil or jacketed bitumen pipe lines.
m)
Ensure that the dust does not enter the meter relay box and dial head.
6.3.8.1
Bitumen pump
a)
It is a rotary gear type of pump in which while working, suction develops
on the kettle side and pressure on the delivery side of the pump.
b)
The gear pump should be thoroughly drained
at the end
of each
operating period. The failure to clean the pump results in solidifying the
49



======================================================================
PAGE 60 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:90-2010
bitumen around the rotor and may break the gear teeth or driving shaft,
when the power
is applied. The only means of relieving the clogged
rotor is by heating the pump, which
is troublesome.
c)
Never run the pump in dry state.
d)
When "Weeping" becomes apparent at the bottom pump gland, tighten
the gland nuts carefully, one flat at a time.
If "Weeping"
is allowed to
persist,
it soon becomes a leak and gland packing
is to be replaced.
e)
It should be made a practice to disengage the pump drive at the end of
operation. Otherwise,
if the plant is started next day, before the bitumen
is sufficiently heated for circulation, the pump drive,
if still engaged will
place excessive strain on the driving shaft and might cause the shaft or
rotors to break. The pump rotor should also be reversed for about four
to five minutes, as soon as the plant is stopped, to empty the bitumen
pipe lines. Always observe that the pump rotors are free by applying
the V-belt drive gradually. Slipping of the belt over the pump driving
pulley indicates that the rotors are clogged and need heating to relieve
them. Never apply the drive quickly, as
it may cause damage to the
pump rotors or shaft.
In case chain drive is being used, engage the clutch slowly and ensure
that the pump gears are not clogged, which
is indicated by excessive
slipping of the clutch.
f)
If the rate of flow of pump
falls during operation, the cause may be
slipping of clutch.
In case
it
is not so,
it would mean that pump rotors
have worn out and need renewal.
g)
It has been practically found in the field that clogged bitumen pump is
relieved by heating the case, either by using a blow pump or igniting
the
oil soaked waste. These methods destroy the pump gland and
should not be used.
h)
Boiling water may also be poured continuously over the pump housing
to relieve the clogged rotor.
i)
When a new pump or pump with new rotor is fitted, the pump at times
may fail to
lift the bitumen. To overcome this, uncouple the pipe from
delivery side and pour a small quantity of heated bitumen approximately
ten
litres and at same time reverse the pump rotor by means of hand
wheel. Reconnect the pipe and start up. This difficulty would not occur,
once the pump has been operating satisfactorily.
j)
Bitumen to be used
in the mix should be heated to ensure
its fluidity,
before the pump
is started. The bitumen must be allowed to circulate
50



======================================================================
PAGE 61 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:90-2010
for atleast
fifteen minutes before the mixing commences, so as
to
keep the meter, spray bar warm and also relieve the solidified deposits
throughout the circuit. A test cock
in return
line, close to the kettle
is
provided to ensure that bitumen has completely circulated.
7 ESSENTIAL ACTIVITIES WHILE STARTING, OPERATING
AND SHUTTING DOWN PLANTS

last portion of aggregates leaves the dryer, the burner
should be shut off from the cock provided close to the burner, which
52



======================================================================
PAGE 63 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:90-2010
cuts off the fuel supply. Now shut off the dryer motor. When the final
batch has been mixed and discharged, both ends of paddle shafts
should be cleaned with
light diesel
oil or high speed diesel to ensure
that they are free to rotate at the time of starting the plant next day.
c)
The plant should not be stopped,
in case the material
is in transit. The
plant may be stopped
if dryer, elevator, screens. Dins, mixer are empty.
d)
Now, put off the bitumen tank burner by stopping the fuel supply. Stop
the bitumen pump and reverse
its drive immediately, either by hand
wheel
or reversing the motor
rotation. Move the
lever on pressure
regulator (metering system only) to draining position. Fix the discharge
of weigh/ spray system hopper in open pdSition. The bitumen system
must be drained thoroughly to ensure
its easy operation the next day.
All bitumen piping should have slope downwards to the kettles to assist
drainage, and a tap fitted in the delivery line just after the pump, which
may be
left open over night to prevent the clogging of the pump.
If
cleaning solvents are used, these should be thoroughly drained
off,
before re-circulating the bitumen.
e)
The fuel tank should be filled.
f)
Defects,
if any or unusual sound should be reported to the concerned
engineer and got rectified.
g)

8 MAINTENANCE AND UPKEEP OF HOT MIX PLANT
Proper maintenance and upkeep of hot mix plant is required for its long
life, control on
frequent breakdowns, maintaining quality of output and controlling the operating cost.
The schedules for maintenance of hot mix plants are prescribed by the manufacturers
and given in their maintenance manuals. Sometimes the working conditions of particular
'site need frequent checking of specific items due to their premature failure. These items
are added in the maintenance schedules as per requirement. The maintenance schedule
forms daily, weekly, fortnightly, monthly, quarterly, half yearly should be got printed, the
items checked as per format, signed by the maintenance staff and kept in records. The
history sheet of plant should also be maintained properly and transferred along with the
plant to assess the requirement of critical components at particular spell of time.
It may
be ensured during maintenance that recommended type and grade of oil, lubricants are
used in the plant. The Do's and Don'ts
for maintenance of hot mix plant are mentioned
at Annexure-G. A brief of normal maintenance schedule is given below:
8.1

level.
If
necessary top them up.
c)
Top up all drip feed lubricators.
d)
Tighten
all
bolts
after completing
day's
operation,
especially mixer
arms, tips, liners, elevator buckets, dryer lifters, roller paths etc.
e)
The following points should also be attended to during operation of the
plant:
i)
Bitumen cocks are operated for production of every batch of mix
material. These should be lubricated
at an
interval of every two
hours. Other cocks need lubncation daily.

It takes place slowly due
to slackness of belts/chains, loose bearings and other factors. The plant has open
gearing, open chain drives/flat belt/ V-belt drives, anti-friction metallic
bearings due
to
its low revolutions drive. The grease used for gear lubrication becomes a grinding
material, when
it absorbs the dust and fine sand. These should be cleaned at least
once a week and new grease applied.
a)
Lubricate all components as instructed in weekly lubrication chart.
b)
Clean the filters on suction side of the burner fuel and bitumen pump.

8.3
Requirement of Spare Parts and Lubricants for Repair and Maintenance
It !S essential that adequate inventory of fast moving spare parts and recommended
lubricants should be
available
for
repair and maintenance
of hot mix
plant. The
manufacturer's recommendations
for fast moving spare
parts may be followed.
It
would be appropriate to place the order for fast moving spare parts along with the
plant, so that the work does not suffer during operation. Normally, the procurement
of spare parts @ 10 percent cost of plant
is adequate. The bulk purchase of spare
parts and
lubricants should
not be carried
out, which involves space, blockage of
investment, chances of pilferage and
fire hazard.
In case the procureme.nt
is to be
done through import, time factor for placement of purchase order, opening of letter of
credit, shipping period, custom clearance, inland transportation should also be taken
into consideration.
9 SAFETYASPECTS AT HOT MIX PLANT SITE

10 MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PERFORMANCE
OF HOT MIX PLANT
The performance of hot mix plant depends on its design criteha, operational efficiency,
maintenance and availability^ of allied machines. The following are the major factors
which affect the performance of drum mix plant:
10.1
Presence of Moisture Content in Aggregates
The presence of moisture content
in aggregates plays a
vital
role
in
preparation,
production of hot mix and fuel consumption of hot mix plant.
If moisture content
is very high say 8-10 percent, the aggregates shall not
fall out
of flights
in a uniform
veil, thus there shall not be uniform and adequate heating of
:
60



======================================================================
PAGE 71 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:90-2010
aggregates. Thus, the increase in moisture content results in drop of production and
increase in fuel consumption also.
The indicative relation between moisture content and output is given in Annex-D.
10.2
Dust Content in Mix
With increase in dust content in mix, output falls because there
is more surface area
to be coated by bitumen which requires greater mixing time. The indicative relation
between dust content and output is given in Annex-D.
10.3
Altitude
The output of plant is derated approximately @ 3.5 percent every 300 m rise in elevation
above sea level. The requirement of plant in specific area should be assessed based on
this factor also. The variation of output with altitude is attached in the Annex-D.
10.4
insulation of Drum
The output of plant can be increased by 2.5 percent and fuel consumption decreased
by 4 percent by maintaining temperature difference between outer and inner shell
of drum approximately 60°C. The drum shell should be insulated with glass wool or
aluminium painted to avoid heat losses.
11 SUGGESTIONS
11.1
Following suggestions are made for selection of hot mix plant,
.its trouble
free operation, efficient running and to achieve qualitative mix:
a)
The hot mix plant should be of reputed make and proven design.
b)
The
capacity
of plant should be selected based on
availability
of
space for its
commissioning, quantum of work and time period for its
completion.
c)
The
Guidelines,
instructions, maintenance schedules
prescribed
in
manufacturers' manual should be strictly followed.
d)
History sheets/log books should be maintained properly.
It shall give an
assessment for the requirement of spare parts needed for replacement
at particular spell of time and their stocking for future use.
It will reduce
the inventory of spare parts in stock.
e)
Fast moving spare parts should be kept in stpre at plant site to avoid

ANNEX-J
(Clause 11.8)
CALIBRATION OF HOT MIX PLANTS
Calibration
is the process of adjusting the settings for known levels of accuracy. Every
time a measurement is made or a process is performed, there is an actual result and
an expected result. Because of random and variability with a definite pattern, the actual
result usually differs from the expected
result. Calibration
is done to either identify/
rectify the non-random variability or account for
it
in such a way that the difference
between the actual and expected results is negligible.
Calibration
is done
for the Cold
bin feeders. Temperature measuring devices and
load cells to measure the flow rate of aggregates and the Bitumen. The details of the
procedure of calibration vary with the type of plant and the manufacturer.
Calibration, for example, of a load cell in a drum mix plant is undertaken for three to
four control settings covering
the
production range anticipated for the material.
Calibration of the Load Cell
The load cell in a Drum Mix Plant is used to measure the flow rate of aggregates and the
Bitumen. The calibration is initially done in the static mode and then in dynamic mode.
a)
The default settings (factory settings) of the load cells are to be checked.
If there is any change, there
is a
requirement to calibrate. The speed
of the slinger conveyor is checked which is LN/60 where L is the length
of the slinger conveyor and N
is the RPM.
b)
Thereafterthestaticcalibrationoftheloadcell(beneaththeslingerconveyor)
needs to be done with the help of a standard weight .Therefore theoretical
value of the TPH is equal to Weight (Kg) x Speed of the slinger conveyor
(m/sec)x (3600/1000) TPH
c)
To
undertake the dynamic
calibration
of the
load
cell
the
Slinger
conveyor,
gathering
conveyor,
load
out conveyor and thermodrum
have to be started. The gate opening of the cold bin feeder is set as per
the manufacturer's recommendation. Only one feeder is kept in open
position. Also a trolley or a truck with known tare weight is selected and
is kept under the loadout conveyor.
The plant
is allowed to run for
a fixed time duration and the output is collected on the
trolley/truck. The weight of the material
is calculated after calculating the weight of the
loaded truck. The actual TPH is calculated from the weight of the material output from a
given feeder, time of output and percentage of this aggregate (from the job Mix formula).

IRC:90-2010
This process
is followed
for at least three control settings. The Load
cell constant
(Actual TPH/Theoretical TPH) is
then calculated.
Calibration of the Bitumen Flow Rate
The
Plant
is allowed to run at 100 percent load
and
3 percent (say) of Bitumen
.
The arrangement to collect the discharge of bitumen pump
in a vessel
is made. The
system
is allowed to run for duration of 30 seconds. The actual
weight of the output
is calculated by subtracting the difference between the empty vessel and the vessel
filled with bitumen. The theoretical weight of the output
for a Plant with output of 45
Tons per Hour is (TPH*(1000/3600)*30*(3/100)). This process
is repeated for at least
three observations.
If the actual weight
is less than the theoretical weight then the
speed of the pump is increased.
In the case of Batch Mix Plant the load
cell
is calibrated for Aggregates,
Filler, and
Bitumen. The details have to be followed as per the manufacturer's recommendations
Manuals.
For the sake of illustration. Manufacturers prepare a calibration chart for each of the
aggregates to be used in the hot mix.
An example of determining the control settings for each cold feed using the calibration
chart is as follows:
1)
Mix Design Criteria
Coarse Aggregate
20 percent (Cold Feed #1)
Intermediate Coarse Aggregate
40 percent (Cold Feed #2)
Fine Aggregate
30 percent (Cold Feed #3)
Filler
10 percent (Cold Feed #4)
Binder Content
5.0 percent
Flow Rate Per Cold Feed
Q
TB P
Q
Required Flow Rate per Bin (t/h)
T
Plant's Mix Production Rate (t/h)
B
Percent of Aggregates in Mix (as decimal)
80

P = Percent by Weight of Total Mix (as decimal)
Plant Production of 350 t/h
;
Q(Cold Feed #1) = 350\ .95 X .20 = 66.5 t/h
Q (Cold Feed #2) - 350 X .95 X .40 = 133 t/h
Q (Cold Feed #3) = 350 X .95 X .30 = 99.8 t/h
Q (Cold Feed #4) = 350 X .95 X .10 = 33.2 t/h
3)
The calibration chart to determine the control settings for each cold feed
is
used by locating the production rate for each cold feed on the vertical scale,
moving horizontally to the appropriate control line and then vertically down
to locate the control setting. The approximate bin settings are:
Bin
1 = 23 percent
Bin 2 = 53 percent
Bin 3 = 43 percent
Bin 4 = 18 percent
By making these determinations, the discharge rate of each cold feed supplies a balanced
flow of material. This balance is critical as
it provides a uniform flow of material.
