ROAD ACCIDENT RECORDING FORM A1 AND A4
1 INTRODUCTION
Road Accident data is the base measure of safety and without
it the scale and nature of road
safety problems cannot be established with certainity. The existence of a reliable accident
database
is thus a
crucial element
in the management of road
safety. Considering
this,
Transport Planning, Traffic Engineering and Road Safety (H-1) Committee of Indian Roads
Congress has constituted a Sub-group as under to revise the existing Road Accident Form
A1 and A4:
i)
Dr. Nishi Mittal
-
Convenor, Road Safety Group
ii)
Dr. GeetamTiwari
-
Member, H-1 Committee
iii)
Ms. Nimisha Pal
-
Member, H-1 Committee
The sub-group used the available theory and research
for carrying out the set task. The
Transport Research Wing of Ministry of Road Transport and Highways was also consulted
in respect to current practice, methodology followed by them
in collection and compilation
of accident data, requisite data collection forms etc. The draft document was discussed
in a
number of meetings of Transport Planning, Traffic Engineering and Road Safety Committee
(H-1) of Indian Roads Congress (personnel given below) and
finally approved during
its
meeting held on 13
th September, 2011
for placing before the Highways Specifications and
Standards Committee.

Thereafter, the draft document was approved by the Highways Specifications and Standards
Committee (HSS) in
its meeting held on 23
rd September, 2011 for placing before the Council.
The draft was finally approved by the IRC Council
in
its meeting held on 3
rd November, 2011
at Lucknow.
There are several different groups of people with road safety interests who require accident data.
These include road safety officers, highway engineers, the police, lawyers, research groups,
politicians, teachers, statisticians, insurance companies and members of the public. They
all
tend to have slightly differing needs and reasons for wanting the data. These include:
The investigation of particular sites or road user groups
c
Designing safety schemes
/ devices
•
Justification for highway planning
Enforcement planning or prosecutions
•
Education and training and
•
Insurance claims
However, the common underlying aim whatever the above purpose should be to acquire as
much relevant knowledge as possible from the data to help prevent accidents of similar nature
from occurring in the future. To satisfy fully all the needs mentioned above may mean recording
a rather large number of features about every accident. In order to do this,
it is not only essential
to have a reliable accident database but also one which is as comprehensive as possible.
2 NEED FOR REVISION OF ACCIDENT RECORDING FORM
The system
of accident data
collection
in the country remains
inconsistent and
irregular
as there
is neither uniform data
collection formats nor any robust system
of regular and
systematic data retrieval which is dependable and meaningful. The Transport Planning, Traffic
Engineering and Road Safety Committee (H-1) of Indian Roads Congress desired that Road
Safety Group may revise the existing A-1 & A-4 Accident Recording Forms with the basic
aim of making them user-friendly by possibly reducing the quantum size of information asked
for in these forms and at the same time recording
all the information that will be required for
mass reporting which can help
in developing
indicators for carrying out detailed accident
investigations at a subsequent stage.
3 USE AND RECORDING OF ACCIDENT INFORMATION
There are four basic elements or processes to the way
in which an accident database
is
assembled and utilized.

®
Accident reporting and recording system
•
Accident data storage and retrieval system
•
Accident analysis system and
•
Dissemination of data
Accident investigation
is generally carried out at different levels. The main three levels of
accident investigation could be
identified as:
(1) Reporting, where various facts related to
accident are recorded for the official accident record, (2) Investigation which involve collecting
additional information from accident spot/scene, witnesses and people involved
in accident,
sequence of events after the occurrence of accident (sometimes spreading over a period of
time), and (3) Cause Analysis where the effort is to determine 'why the accident occurred
i.e.
the combination of circumstances that caused a road operations system and human/vehicle
condition to break down at the time and place of accident with resultant injury and damage.
It
is therefore understood that only collection of facts and no opinion is required to be reported at
the first two levels while at level 3 of the accident investigation, various other details required
for developing a framework for accident cause analysis are carried out.
The basic aim and use of recording of accident information is
:
i)
Compilation of basic accident data at national level.
ii)
Basic Analysis of Accidents to identify the accident blackspots and effective
road safety countermeasures.
4 SOURCE OF ACCIDENT DATA
The best source of validated accident data
will be the
police force:
either the policemen
attending the scene of an accident or the officer at a police station who receives the report by
the involved parties/witnesses. Very careful thought should be given to the information asked
for
in a accident repairing system. These must contain sufficient information to meet local,
regional and national data needs, accident investigators and court requirements.
In practice the police obviously need to strike the right balance between the amount of detail
they record about each accident and their ability to do so in terms of their available time and in
certain aspects their expertise. The prime objectives of the data for police use (i.e. prosecutions
and enforcement strategies) will invariably have a strong influence on the details recorded.
Various information, which is of greater value to engineers or researchers, will need to be kept
to an absolute minimum otherwise the paperwork for the police will become too enormous a
task and thus less likely to be complete or reliable.
For the collection of detailed accident related information, a separate system (either within the
police or with the road owning agency) may have to be created which can collect and carry out
detailed investigations for certain types of accidents at certain type of locations or for certain
type of accidents through special and regular programs/projects.
5 PROCESS OF ACCIDENT RECORDING IN INDIA
All the accidents in India are reported like any other crime and written on First Information Report
(FIR) along with preparation of daily diary and case report, which generally covers a detailed
3



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:53-2012
account of the accident spot and statements of witnesses, victims and vehicles involved
in a
particular road accident. However most of the traffic police departments do not have computerized
accident recording units and, therefore, the accident storage and retrieval system
is also quite
poor.
In most of the states,
it
is recorded manually on some register and only one person
is
responsible for keeping the records. Also, the uniformity in recording accident data is sometimes
not maintained. Very few states publish their annual accident statistics in a comprehensive way
essential from road safety point of view. Also, the awareness about the
utility of the accident
statistics is very low and there is lack of trained skilled personnel for this work.
As the data is not computerized, hardly any meaningful accident analysis is done to find out the
accident black-spots, vulnerable road users, age and socio-economic background of drivers
and other road users involved in accidents, causes of accidents etc. which are so essential for
taking preventive measures. Road accident data
is hardly used for taking appropriate traffic
enforcement measures.
6 HISTORY OF ACCIDENT RECORDING/INVESTIGATION FORM IN INDIA
The need for keeping reliable and comprehensive road traffic crash records has been recognized
in India. The earliest form A-1 for recording road crash related information was suggested at
the fourth meeting of the Transport Advisory Council held in Delhi
in July,
1 939. But this form
did not help the police to prepare accurate and intelligible reports. So, in November, 1945, the
Govt, of India prepared a new form A-2 which was simpler and was better received in the then
Provinces. However,
it did not contain the classification of accidents into fatal and non-fatal.
In 1955, the form was again reviewed.
It remained same but
it was numbered as form A-4
thereafter. In October, 1959, under the auspices of Economic Commission for Asia and the Far
East (ECAFE), a new form based on the study of Accident reports forms being used in Japan,
New Zealand, Philippines, Indonesia and
British overseas territories was recommended.
In
1962, Committee on Motor Vehicle Insurance appointed by Govt, of India recommended the
use of the form recommended by ECAFE.
Another revision was brought out by the Indian Roads Congress (IRC)
in 1982 and these
forms were called A-1 and A-4 forms. The Traffic Engineering Committee recommended these
forms for uniform adoption in the country by the police and other traffic authorities who collect
and maintain road accident statistics. The revised coded proforma for reporting road accidents
was designed to facilitate mechanical analysis and the punch card system was recommended
for analyzing road accident data.
Despite these procedures, the database maintained by traffic police has been found to be
grossly inadequate from the point of view of recommended accident preventive measures. The
form recommended by IRC is not being used by most police departments as
it is understood
to be too lengthy and cumbersome to
fill.
7 LEARNINGS FROM VARIOUS RESEARCH AND DISCUSSIONS
ON ROAD ACCIDENT DATA COLLECTION
H-1 Committee desired that view point of all the stakeholders may be sought before revising
the forms. Accordingly, National Workshop on "Accident Recording and Analysis Procedures
in
India" was organized on 9
lh July, 2010 at CRRI
in which representatives of
all National
Accident collecting organizations
like MoSRT&H, NHAI, NCCRB, BPRD, Heads of Traffic
4



======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 32
======================================================================
IRC:53-2012
Police Departments of different cities, NT's ICMR, NGO's and private consultants were invited.
The accident data collection system prevailing at present at National, State and City level
was presented and panel discussions were also held aimed at finalizing simplified version of
accident reporting format.
CRRI had revised the Accident Recording Form
in 1988 and NT, Delhi had also carried out
some research studies on this aspect.
In 2006 CRRI, under CSIR Network project, carried
out a research project on Accident Recording and Analysis Procedures in India. In this project
national and
international data recording systems were reviewed and
simplified accident
recording form was devised. Some of the recommendations suggested in this study were
:
7. 1
Crea ting Awareness
The awareness regarding the usefulness of accident statistics
is to be created. At present,
accident reporting and analysis work
is given a very low priority in most of the Traffic Police
organizations and only one or two persons are deployed in maintaining the records of accidents.
The policy makers, planners, engineers, enforcement agencies, insurance companies, vehicle
manufacturers all are awfully unaware of the utility of good accidents data.
7. 2
Use of Simplified Form for National Accident Statistics
For National data on accident recording a simple uniform form has to be used by
all the
states. At present, there
is wide discrepancy in the accident statistics reported by MoSRTH,
National Crime Bureau and different city Traffic Police organizations which can be removed
by following a simpler and easy to
fill form for some important national accident parameters.
The parameters should be selected based on the viewpoint of different stakeholders of road
safety.
7.3
Creating Special Accident Recording & Investigation Units
In every Traffic Police organization, a special team
is to be created for accident recording
and analysis work and they should be specifically trained for
it. Barring few cities like Delhi,
Bangalore, Kolkata etc. other cities do not use computerized accident recording and analysis
system. These units be linked to the National Accident Data Centre so that the data can be
transferred on-line and there
is not time lag
in publishing the national accident records as
is the case at present. There
is a need to have single unified form for
all and
it has to be
computerized. The trained personnel should have permanent posting
in these units. These
units should possess trained personnel, computers, accident analysis softwares etc.
7.4
Involving Research Institutes & NGO's
For in-depth analysis, some fatal accidents are to be analysed by research Institutes or some
other NGO's. One department should take over this work so as to evolve scientific road safety
countermeasures. Every year some minimum number of fatal accidents should be analysed
in detail and should be stored. This will help
in identifying accident black-spots, vulnerable
road users, faulty road user behavior, vehicle defects and the like and based on this, some
scientific road safety countermeasures suited to the local environments can be applied.
5



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 32
======================================================================
IRC:53-2012
7.5
Dissemination of Accident Data
The accident data dissemination should be done scientifically. The user agencies of accident
data are to be identified and they should be involved
in the accident reporting and analysis
work.
7. 6
Creating National Acciden t Da ta Bank
Every state should be asked to computerize its accident recording and analysis work and this
data should be transferred at least quarterly
if not monthly to the national data bank. There
has to be some system of rewards or penalty for complying and non-complying states for this
work. At the National Accident Data Bank, a team of specialized personnel should analyse the
data and publish the data.
It should disseminate this information to all the user agencies and
it should be available on their websites.
8 PRESENT REVISION OF ACCIDENT RECORDING/ INVESTIGATION FORM
Based on these various inputs and further discussions within the H-1
committee, the sub
group designed and formulated revised A-1 and A-4 forms. The new form is mainly designed
to record various facts related to an accident covering the general identification details, road
features where accident occurred along with important details related to vehicle, victims and
property damage involved
in a particular accident, while at the same time keeping the data
entry / recording process simple and less time consuming. Additionally, the A-1 form has been
designed to be 'Optical Character Readable (OCR)' which can further reduce the time taken
for manually entering the data into a computerized system.
Similarly A-4 form has been revised in view of obtaining analysis tables important from macro
perspective. The form A-4
is totally based on the information collected/reported
in form A-1.
The revised A-1 and A-4 forms are placed below.
