PROJECT PREPARATION MANUAL  
FOR BRIDGES
The document on “Project Preparation Manual for Bridges” was first published in year 2000. 
The General Design Features (Bridges & Grade Separated Structures) Committee (B-1) in 
its first meeting felt the necessity to take up the task to revise this document to add focus 
on environmental impact assessment and environment management plan, social impact 
assessment and resettlement action plan, land acquisition schedules,etc and also to make it 
consistent with other new/revised IRC documents. For this purpose B-1 Committee constituted 
a Sub-group under Convenorship of Shri G. Sharan comprising Shri H.C. Arora; Shri Ashok 
Kumar; as a members. The Sub group convened a number of meetings and finalized the initial 
draft and placed before the B-1 Committee. The B-1 Committee after deliberations approved the 
draft document in its meeting held on 16.09.2017 for placing before the Bridges Specifications & 
Standards Committee (BSS).
The General Design Features (Bridges & Grade Separated Structures) Committee (B-1) of the

The BSS Committee in its meeting held on 23.10.2017 approved this document. Subsequently, 
the Executive Committee approved the document on 2nd November, 2017 for placing it before 
the IRC Council. The document was presented & discussed in the 213th meeting of IRC Council 
held on 03.11.2017 during the 78th Annual Session of IRC held at Bengaluru (Karnataka) and 
there were concerns regarding applicability of this document to single bridge or several bridges 
on the network and compatibility with IRC:SP:19-2001 “Manual for Survey, Investigation and 
Preparation of Road Projects (Second Revision)”. Thus, after deliberation Council authorized 
Executive Committee to take final call about publishing of this document as this is very important 
document used for DPR & project preparation.
Thereafter, B-1 Committee again deliberated on these aspects in its meeting held on 20.12.2017 
and modified the document. The modified documents was considered by Executive Committee 
of IRC in its meeting held on 26.06.2018 approved this for publication. 
1 INTRODUCTION
1.1	
Bridge structures are essential component of any road network. Preparation of 
bridge projects either stand alone or forming part of the highway project involves a chain 
of activities as relevant to the project such as survey and investigations, selection of site, 
social and environmental appraisal, fixing of waterways, selection of type of structure, design 
of structural elements, preparation of drawings and cost estimates, economic and financial 
evaluation, preparation of contract documents, quality assurance scheme, maintenance manual 
and time schedule. The preparation of a bridge project will be guided by codal provisions 
on different aspects. The structure should have an assured safety and level of performance 
over its expected life. These considerations demand that the project should be prepared after 
thorough investigations, collecting all relevant information, evaluating all possible alternatives 
for selecting the most appropriate solution, both from the technical angle and the economic 
point of view.
1.2	
The extent, nature and quality of investigations and analysis of data help in ensuring 
safety and cost-effectiveness of the structure. Adequate funds and time should be earmarked for 
all activities needed for planning, investigation and design. 
1.3	
Presentation of project details in a comprehensive and systematic manner helps in 
many ways. Such project report enables a quick scrutiny by technical, financial and administrative 
authorities who are required to judge the technical soundness, social and environmental impact 
and economic benefits and financial viability, as applicable, before according investment sanction. 
If private financing is envisaged, the selection of a project depends upon its financial viability to 
recover the investments within a reasonable time span. The project document ultimately also 
forms the basis for bidding, selection of the contractor and for its successful execution. 
1.4	
This manual lays down guidelines covering the various aspects which are to be 
detailed in the report for a bridge project. Use of these guidelines, would result in a uniformly 
good quality and comprehensive report which would help in a speedy evaluation and successful 
execution of the project.

IRC:SP:54-2018
2 SCOPE
The manual covers bridge structures for all classes of highways in urban and non-urban areas. 
The word “Bridge Structures” used in this Manual covers bridges across rivers, canals, viaducts, 
structure for interchanges including under-passes and flyovers across the road, flyover and 
under-passes across railway, aqueduct/siphon in combination with highway structures and 
retaining walls which may be considered critical for the design and safety of the main structure. 
The bridge structure (s) may be stand-alone or part of a highway project. When part of highway 
project, the project preparation of bridge (s) will form part of the project preparation of road 
project, which will be carried out in accordance with IRC:SP-19 ‘Manual for Survey, Investigation 
and Preparation of Road Projects’. In stand-alone bridge projects, the scope shall include at 
least 50 m of immediate approaches for which the project will be prepared in accordance with 
IRC:SP-19.
3 STAGES IN PROJECT PREPARATION
3.1	
Generally there are three stages in project preparation:
	
i)	
Pre-Feasibility Report,
	
ii)	
Feasibility Report/Preliminary Project Report, and
	
iii)	
Detailed Project Report
3.2	
Project preparation work starts with the identification of the project. This first stage 
is known as pre-feasibility study. For this stage, the broad features of the project are identified. 
The possible locations, nature of crossing, traffic dispersal system for different alternatives are 
identified. The effect of implementation on the traffic scenario in immediate vicinity is also broadly 
considered. The reconnaissance visit to the area of the intended bridge site is sufficient at this 
stage. This stage will be performed in case of major bridges, as directed.
3.3	
The second stage is called feasibility study/preliminary project report. In this stage, 
preliminary survey, data collection and investigations are carried out, alternative sites are 
investigated on the basis of technical, social, environmental and economic studies, outline 
design at critical sections, considering alternative span arrangements, superstructure types 
and their supporting systems, substructure and foundation types, alternative materials, 
alternative construction methodology and sequences, broad dimensions of various 
components of proposed bridge structure and preliminary cost estimates for various 
alternatives on selected alignments are made. Sometimes pre-feasibility and feasibility stages 
are combined into the feasibility stage. A feasibility report covering recommended alignment 
including alternatives considered, span arrangements, preliminary cost estimate, economic 
and financial viability (as required) is prepared. This should include recommendations 
regarding need for carrying out model studies, where required. Special design requirements 
for the project, if any, and schedule for all pre-construction activities shall also be included 
in the feasibility report.
3.4	
The third stage is called detailed project preparation. It is also commonly termed 
as detailed engineering. In this stage detailed surveys and investigations environmental and 



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 44
======================================================================
IRC:SP:54-2018
4
social impact mitigation measure are carried out on approved site alignment. Detailed designs 
are worked out on the basis of results of survey and investigation and detailed drawings are 
prepared. An accurate cost estimate is made along with the Bill of Quantities and the specifications 
are finalized. The Detailed Project Report (DPR) incorporating all these aspects is prepared. 
DPR should clearly indicate the, fund requirement. If required by the client, documents for pre-
qualification of contractors and the tender documents will also form part of DPR. In addition, 
the detailed engineering stage should also include preparation of a construction work activity 
schedule, the quality assurance system, environmental impact assessment and environment 
management plan, social impact assessment and resettlement action plan, land acquisition 
schedules, technical specifications for work items and materials specific to the project, 
construction manual for all specialized work items and maintenance manual.
4 PRE-FEASIBILITY REPORT
In the pre-feasibility report a matrix is evolved based on which minimum number of sites required 
for conducting feasibility study is identified. A matrix covering land acquisition requirements and 
problems, resettlement and rehabilitation issues, ease of forest/environmental/wildlife/CRZ 
clearance, nature of crossing, hydraulic considerations, likely foundation depth, length of bridge, 
river characteristics, bed material characteristics, water-spread, firmness of banks, vertical 
clearance, length and suitability of alignment of approach road, river training works requirements 
etc. are required to be examined and tabulated in the form of decision matrix by giving suitable 
weightage to each factor. From the decision matrix, 2 to 4 sites are identified for feasibility 
study. Pre-feasibility study need not be carried out for widening and rehabilitation project. Pre-
feasibility study is specially required in the case of major bridges on missing links or bypasses 
or new alignments. Suitable bridge site and approach alignments based on rough cost estimate 
and probable construction period will be recommended based on detailed merits and demerits 
presented suitably in tabular form.
5 FEASIBILITY REPORT/ PRELIMINARY PROJECT REPORT
5.1	
General
The report shall include techno-economic feasibility study prepared with the data readily 
available as well as that collected during the feasibility studies should indicate in detail various 
alternatives in respect of the technical, economic and social aspects. The quality of feasibility 
report depends upon the accuracy and extent of data, its analysis and the investigation that goes 
into its preparation. The nature and extent of data needed depends upon the type of crossing as 
well as on its size.
5.2 
Identification of Data Needs
5.2.1	
The data collection should be carefully planned. While the data collected should be 
comprehensive enough to aid engineering judgement, a disciplined effort is required to identify 
specific data needs for any given project. Data needs for long span bridges such as extra dosed, 



======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 44
======================================================================
5
IRC:SP:54-2018
cable stayed and suspension bridges, arch brides or P.S.C. box construction of cantilever method 
would be different from those for more conventional bridges. Site data requirement, discussed 
hereunder, can be treated as a general guide. 
5.2.2	
Depending on the requirements of a particular site, activities in respect of site 
data collection, evaluation of design data and structure design may have to be repeated 
on demand. Hence, these activities should be planned so as to afford the required site 
flexibility. Also the aspects wherein repetition can be avoided should be identified at the 
earliest.
5.2.3	
Data collected should be continuously reviewed, which may sometimes lead to 
identification of supplementary data needs or revision of data already collected.
5.2.4	
For selection of alternative bridge sites and approach alignments, reference may 
be made to “Pocket Book for Bridge Engineers” and “Pocket Book for Highways Engineers” 
published by IRC.
5.2.5	
Economic viability of the bridge project on alternative locations play a vital part in 
selection of the site.
5.3	
Data Collection
5.3.1	
Maps, Plans and Topographical Features
i)	
Index Map
An index map is needed to locate the project area with reference to its connection with the capital 
city of the State and near by major towns. It should give a bird’s eye view of the project area 
and the overall road and rail network in the State. The alternate sites investigated/the general 
topography of the country, the important towns, villages, etc., in the vicinity are to be shown 
in the index map. The largest scale topographical maps available (1:50,000) may be used for 
preparing the index map. Smaller scale (1:250,000) may be used in addition for major projects 
for covering larger area.
ii)	
Site Plan
A site plan drawn to a suitable scale should show details of the sites considered in the feasibility 
study and extending not less than 100 m upstream and down-stream from the centre line of 
the crossing. It should cover the approaches to a sufficient distance, which in the case of major 
bridge shall not be less than 500 m on either side of the channel. In case the river is meandering 
in the vicinity of the proposed bridge site, the course of the river extending a suitable distance 
not less than 2 loops on either side of the proposed crossing shall be plotted on the site plan. 
The name of the channel or the bridge and of the road and identification number allotted to the 
crossing are to be indicated, the direction of flow of water, the alignment of existing approach, 
angle of skew, location and value of permanent bench mark, the location of cross sections and 
longitudinal sections taken, location of trial pits or boring, other details such as building or any 
permanent structure, places of worships, well, nallah, burial ground, out crop area, etc., are also 
to be indicated.



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 44
======================================================================
IRC:SP:54-2018
6
iii)	
Contour Survey Plans
The contour plan of the stream should show all topographical features and extending upstream and 
downstream of any of the proposed sites, to the distance indicated below (or such other greater distances 
as the Engineer responsible for the design may direct) and to sufficient distance on either side to give 
a clean indication of the topographical or other features that might influence the location and design of 
the bridge and its approaches. All alternative sites considered shall be shown on the plan.
	
a)	
100 m for catchment area less than 3 sq.km
	
	
(scale not less than 1 cm = 10 m)
	
b)	
300 m for catchment area of 3 to 15 sq.km
	
	
(scale not less than 1 cm = 10 m)
	
c)	
1.5 km or the width, between the banks, whichever is greater, for catchment 
areas more than 15 sq. km)
	
	
In case of meandering river, the above provision has to be suitability reviewed.
iv)	
Topographical Map
The topographical map is essential for finalizing the site alignment. Such a map could be 
prepared from topographical maps published by the Survey of India. If deemed, necessary, due 
to the scope and size of the project, combined with scarcity of data, etc., aerial survey may be 
made to provide sufficient updated data. For very large bridge projects or for bridges in difficult 
terrain, satellite imagery may also be obtained to fix alternative sites. For major bridges, ground 
survey of site may be needed to include the relevant portion of approaches and the river reach 
relevant to the protection work.
v)	
Catchment Area Map
In order to determine the basic parameters of discharge, etc. it will be necessary to prepare the 
catchment area map from available topographic maps. In restricted areas where topographic 
maps are restricted, the concerned departments should make efforts to procure the same for the 
project. Actual parameters of scale and size to be used in the catchment area map depend to 
great extent on the needs of each individual project and a studies judgement is required on the 
part of the engineer responsible. 
vi)	
Geological Map
Geological maps, when required for reference in route alignment and bridge site selection for 
assessing geological stability, should be procured from the Survey of India, State Geological 
Departments, etc.
5.3.2	
Traffic data
Basic design parameters such as the number of traffic lanes required, the approach gradients, 
need for a central verge etc. are determined by the type, intensity and volume of traffic to which 
the bridge has to cater.
In case of bridges forming part of road projects, the traffic figures collected for the design of 
road could be directly utilized. In case of independent bridge projects, traffic survey should be 
conducted if adequate data is not readily available.



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 44
======================================================================
7
IRC:SP:54-2018
Depending upon the importance, relevance and complexity of the project and the traffic scenario, 
the type of data which will be needed are:
	
a)	
Classified Traffic Volume Count
	
b)	
O-D Survey
	
c)	
Speed and Delay Survey
	
d)	
Pedestrian Volume Survey
	
e)	
Socio-economic profile of the project influence are for the last 5 years
5.3.3	
River cross-section for a Bridge Project
The river cross-sections yield information on channel profile, bank characteristics, depths of water 
etc. However, these data are usually collected during lean flow periods, their direct application in 
estimation of the design discharge may not be feasible or reliable.
The number of river cross-sections should be such as to yield sufficient data for design of 
waterway, proposed structure and the approach embankment. At least one cross-section should 
be taken along the proposed alignment of the bridge for each alternative site. The location of 
cross-sections shall be indicated on the site plan. The number of cross-section studies should 
conform to the provision of relevant clauses of IRC:5.
5.3.4	
Hydrologic Data and River characteristics
The basic purpose of collecting hydrological data is to study the rain fall pattern like intensity, 
duration, frequency and run off characteristics of the basin under consideration, and thereby 
determine the likely discharge through the channel and thus decide upon the optimum waterway 
for the bridge. The extent of hydrological data collection and subsequent analysis should 
commensurate with the type and size of crossing under study. 
5.3.5	
Catchment Area characteristics
The catchment area of a bridge site should be identified and marked clearly on the topographical 
map. The identified catchment should also include the contour and existing land use pattern like 
forests, cultivated land, barren land, desert, etc., to the extent possible. The run-off a stream 
at a given site is determined by two factors: (i) precipitation and (ii) physical characteristics of 
the catchment area. In general, the size of the catchment area plays a dominant role in the 
determination of run-off. However, it is possible that some other characteristics such as slope, 
soil characteristics, etc., becomes equally important at specific sites. This possibility should 
be thoroughly investigated during the data collected stage and appropriate measures taken to 
obtain a full set of data. Likely changes in the catchment environment and land use should also 
be kept in view. Future development in the vicinity of the alignment specially for urban-areas 
which might influence the run-off characteristics, (if indicated in any perspective plan already 
developed) should also be looked into.

5.3.6	
River/Channel characteristics
All details of configuration of the river/channel as may be obtained from ground/aerial survey. 
All controls, natural (drops, rapids, bends, debris) and artificial (dams, barrages, weirs, spurs, 
road and railway bridges, etc.) should be identified and relevant information obtained. Details, if 
any, of future work that may affect the stream hydraulics should be collected. Degradation of a 
river channel may invite higher flood discharge whereas aggradation may result in higher flood 
levels and bank spills. These factors have a direct bearing on the design of waterway clearance 
and approaches as well as the bridge structure itself. All information which may help evaluate 
present or possible future aggradation/degradation of channel should also be collected. Efforts 
should also be made to collect data regarding the quantity, size and nature of debris and floating 
materials and the period of occurrence of debris in relation to flood peaks.
5.3.7	
Flood flow data
A reliable assessment of the flood discharge and of the corresponding water levels are basic for 
a proper design of the bridge and its approaches:
a)	
Historical Data
Major floods that arc known to have occurred at the site before the start of maintaining records 
may be called historical floods. A data relating to these events including the years in which they 
have occurred. The magnitude, the area flooded, flood water levels, flood marks or other positive 
evidence of the height of historical flood etc. should be collected from all available sources. 
Local enquiry can also provide useful data. A critical analysis of the reliability of such data is of 
paramount importance. Personnel with necessary experience in flood low determination can 
detect flood marks or other positive evidence of the height of historical floods, which may prove 
invaluable as additional data. 
b)	
Flood Data Records
Flood discharge data at the nearest gauging station and other flood related data that may be 
available from records of irrigation or other authorities/agencies shall be collected. It is readily 
recognized that gathering such data depends on the cooperation extended by the concerned 
authorities/agencies. The hydraulic performance of existing bridges or other structures under 
flood situations in the vicinity of the proposed facility should be used to augment the available 
hydrologic data. The effect of flood control structures in the upstream stretch needs to be 
investigated and appropriately assessed and accounted for. The discharge and linear waterway 
should be calculated as per IRC:5.
5.3.8	
Sub-soil Data
Information on the soil in bed and bank is necessary for evaluation of sediment, movement, 
and the stability of bed and banks in general. The size and particle distribution of soil, soil 
classification and other relevant information shall be obtained IRC: 78 and relevant IS Codes 
may be referred. Borings for foundation-soil exploration will yield data regarding scour, sound 
founding strata, S.B.C., settlement characteristics etc.

IRC:SP:54-2018
5.3.9	
Meteorological Data
All relevant meteorological records of temperature, wind, cyclones, etc. that may determine the 
loading and other design specifications of structure or affect construction operations shall be 
collected. This would be required in the case of major bridge structures only. Information on wind 
speeds, temperature variations in summer and winter, rainfall, humidity likely to prevail and their 
expected duration is also required for planning of construction operations. 
5.3.10	
Construction Materials
Information on availability of construction materials with special reference to their quality, quantity 
and proximity of their source should be carefully collected. Majority of the road bridges are built 
in reinforced or prestressed concrete. The prime object of material-surveys, is to identify good 
quality aggregate (conforming to specifications) sources at site or in its vicinity. It is important 
to appreciate that concrete of adequate quality can be made economically with aggregates 
of widely divergent characteristics and hence the number of sources to be investigated with 
respect to economic and technical viability will necessarily be large.
5.3.11	
Environmental Data
All data relevant to ‘environmental examination’ have to be collected for projects for which 
such study is demanded. A description of the environmental aspects of the site supported by 
sketches and photographs may be furnished where necessary. In general, care should be taken 
to minimise the degradation of the existing environment of the proposed site. 
Environmental Impact Assessment study and social impact assessment and need to be carried 
out as per prevailing regulations and laws of Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), 
Government of India for the affected area. 
Suitable technically feasible environmental management plan shall be suggested.
5.3.12	
Special Design requirements
5.3.12.1	
Special design requirements may be required or asked for some specific projects. 
These may relate to special road traffic requirements. Water-transport requirements, hydraulic 
model study, wind-tunnel testing, dynamic analysis and seismic design controls etc. 
5.3.12.2	
For major bridge projects the span arrangement is, to some extent, dictated by the river 
regime. Establishing flow patterns, discharge distribution etc. become difficult for many reasons 
(such as soil conditions, presence of obstruction in the form of other structures, meandering 
course of the river). Model studies can help in finding an optimum solution.
5.3.12.3	
In general, model studies are expensive and hence should be taken recourse to only 
in special situation. Model studies are more justifiable for major bridges and/or bridges located 
in strategic areas etc. Model studies give more definitive ideas about preferred alignment, flow 
patterns, discharge distribution, form, type and extent of guide bund etc., than analysis of data 
and studying of maps. It will also help to find out the effect of siltation particularly for bridges near

10
ports, jetties, etc. to assess the appropriate length. However, results of model studies require 
careful scrutiny and an intelligent interpretation. Situations leading to inaccurate results from 
model studies should be identified and corrective measures taken.
5.3.13	
Existing Services
A strip plan showing existing service facilities such as telephone lines, electric lines (high 
tension and low tension), underground cables, underground water lines, sewer lines, etc. is 
required to be prepared. The strip plan should also show the position of relocation of such 
service facilities.
5.3.14	
Labour Accommodation
Information regarding the supply and demand aspects of skilled and unskilled labour have to 
be collected, especially for major bridge projects. Availability of such labour locally has to be 
investigated. Land requirement for storage, labour accommodation, offices, etc. may be quite 
considerable in major projects and demand close scrutiny. In addition, requirements for labour 
camps such as drinking water, sanitation at site, housing, electricity and other facilities may also 
be investigated and reported to the extent necessary.
5.3.15	
Other Authorities
Information about other authorities whose clearance is required for the project should be 
collected. Interaction with these authorities to ascertain their specific requirements would 
help in collection of any additional data and preparation of the project in a well-planned 
manner.
5.3.16	
Data Regarding Existing Bridges
Functioning of existing bridges on the stream in the vicinity of proposed bridge location (Road’ 
bridge, Railway bridge etc.) should be studied and data collected. Data collected should include 
hydraulic data, geometric data and structural data to the extent possible.
5.4 
Organisation of Activities
Major activities required for preparing the feasibility report have to be identified and placed in 
proper sequence so as to provide a smooth flow of operation. Activities leading to preparation of 
a well documented feasibility report may be classified as given below:
	
a)	
Collection of data 
	
b)	
Preliminary investigations

5.5 
Source of Data
The sources of site data may include :
	
i)	
Maps
	
ii)	
Records
	
iii)	
Govt. Deptts. such as Industries, Agriculture, Planning Board etc.
	
iv)	
Field inspection
	
v)	
Information obtained from local enquiry
	
vi)	
Geological details
	
vii)	
Satellite imageries
At least one site inspection should be conducted. The purpose of site inspection varies with the 
level of the team involved. It ranges from identification of data needs and collection of raw data 
at the elemental level to a global appraisal of the project to aid in analysis, decision making and 
financing. Careful planning of field inspection activities is necessary for a successful site/field 
inspection visit.
The need for conducting data collection in stages, review of the collected data and the decisions 
based on the same, lead to multiple site inspections throughout the project preparation exercise. 
The initial field inspection should also identify the number and type of field inspection which 
may be needed in later stages. A reconnaissance survey may be carried out to examine the 
general character of the area. Data collected would be useful in deciding alternative sites to be 
examined.
5.6	
Preliminary Investigation
5.6.1	
General 
After collecting the data, preliminary investigation is to be undertaken keeping in view the data 
collected. As the preliminary investigation results are analysed, there might be need for more 
details in particular areas. The extent of gaps in investigation could be reduced by careful 
planning prior to taking up preliminary investigation.

5.6.2	
Topographic Survey
A review of the available topographic data should reveal the additional details required. 
Efforts should be made to collect these through an accurate instrument survey. The data 
collected should be accurate, detailed and exhaustive enough for use in the detailed design 
stage.
Ground surveys conducted at site help in preparation of site map and river cross sections. 
Keeping in mind that these maps are to be used in the identification of alternative locations 
and alignments, the surveys should be planned to be sufficiently exhaustive. Establishment of 
permanent bench marks at site linked to GIS levels which are to be used during detailed survey 
construction and maintenance must precede such survey.
5.6.3	
Hydrological Survey
For bridge projects across any stream/river, a hydrological survey should be carried out.
5.6.4	
Traffic Survey
Traffic survey should be carried out in accordance with relevant IRC Code.
5.6.5	
Sub-soil Investigation
In the feasibility stage, for minor bridge the sub-soil investigation on two locations, one in river bed 
and one in approach should be carried out. For major bridge, the sub-soil investigation at every 
100 m or part thereof in river bed and one in approach should be carried out. The investigation 
carried out should give sufficient details for various alternatives under consideration. 
5.6.6	
Geophysical Investigation
Geophysical investigation by any or combination of the following methods suitable to site 
requirement, should be carried out for identifying the a) subsurface characterization for depth of 
bed rock, type of rock, layers and fractures in rock, water table etc. b) locating buried utilities c) 
for indicative engineering properties of soil and d) for selecting borehole locations. Geophysical 
Investigation is also suitable for obtaining subsurface information in environmentally sensitive 
areas, on contaminated ground or where the drilling is either not possible or extremely 
cumbersome.
5.7	
Preliminary Engineering
5.7.1	
Design Philosophy
Design philosophy of criterion is a clear, comprehensive and precise elucidation of the general 
principles to be adopted and the significant parameters to be used in the actual design of a 
highway bridge structure. Design philosophy forms the basis of design and also serves as a 
reference for the design procedure. Design philosophy flows from design requirements as per 
codes; nature of data base; the extent of available data; special requirements specified for the 
particular bridge structure by the client viz. special loads, increased clearances for navigational

IRC:SP:54-2018
span and current practice. As far as possible minimum number of expansion joints should be 
kept in the structure for better serviceability by adopting larger span or continuity in structure.
5.7.2	
Analysis of Data
The data collected and investigation results should be analysed to determine the following:
	
i)	
HFL
	
ii)	
LWL
	
iii)	
LBL
	
iv)	
Erodibility of bed/scour level and scouring history
	
v)

vii)	
Safe bearing capacity
	
viii)	 Engineering properties of sub-soil
	
ix)	
Artisian conditions
	
x)	
Settlement characteristics
	
xi)	
Vertical clearances keeping in view the navigational span, if any
	
xii)	
Horizontal clearance
	
xiii)	 Free board for approach road
	
xiv)	 Severity of environment with reference to corrosion (severe/moderate)
	
xv)	 Data pertaining to seismic and wind load
	
xvi)	 Availability of suitable construction material
	
xvii)	 Requirement of model study
Data for various types of a bridge structure, such as a river-bridge, a flyover, an underpass etc., 
need to be analysed within the framework of function of the structure.
The analysis of data should be relevant and exhaustive enough to be of adequate use in the 
development of design philosophy.
5.7.3	
Finalisation of Design Philosophy
A design philosophy is arrived at based on the codal requirements for design, results of 
data analysis, special requirements specified by the client and current practices. The design 
philosophy should include general principles to be followed in the design, such as, relevant 
methods of analysis and design, parameters of design, like design loads, flood levels, special 
design requirements, namely traffic dispersal system, construction methodology etc., codes to 
be followed in the order of precedence, special literature etc.
While finalizing the design philosophy, aesthetic form and function of the bridge structure in the 
highway system should be given due consideration. Appropriate durability criteria should be 
adopted for bridge structures. For bridges in marine environment, requirement for protection of 
reinforcement against corrosion should be considered.



======================================================================

IRC:SP:54-2018

a) 
Additional Consideration for Aqueduct
It is possible that a site chosen for an aqueduct is also an ideal location for a highway bridge to 
cross the river. It is also possible that considerable savings in costs may be achieved where an 
aqueduct and a highway bridge are combined. In this case, it is quite likely that the approach 
roads of the highway may not follow the most preferred alignment.
Design philosophy for a combined structure should reflect the concerns and the needs for both 
the elements. Comprehensive design philosophy should detail out factors that are relevant 
to each element, viz. the aqueduct and bridge, and also those which are common to both. 
This entails concurrence of ideas of the various concerned departments such as the irrigation, 
bridges, highways, etc. The design philosophy should take cognizance of the relevant Codal 
provisions for aqueduct design and the IRC specifications, codes and special publications for 
highway bridges.
The factors which have to be worked during discussions among the concerned authorities, inter-
alia, are : the alignment, the formation level, slopes, if any, of the structure, relative positions of 
the two elements, the structural system, loads, construction methodology and sequences.
b) 
Additional Considerations for Subways and Underpasses:
Major factors to be given consideration in subway/underpass designs and construction are: 
	
i)	
stability of the structure against uplift due to buoyancy as a whole and also 
during construction; 
	
ii)	
water tightness of the structure to prevent seepage; 
	
iii)	
drainage of the subway; 
	
iv)	
construction aspects such as excavation, traffic diversion scheme etc.; 
	
v)	
existing services and future provision, if required; 
	
vi)	
ventilation consideration; 
	
vii)	
lighting and other utilities.
The structure should be checked for overall stability against uplift, the calculations for such a 
determination depend upon the level of the water table assumed. The highest water table level is 
arrived from the study of data collected over a reasonably long period in the past at the proposed 
site. In the absence of such data, the maximum water table level may be set at a depth of 0.5 
metre from the existing ground level. However, decision regarding the water table level shall be 
made on the basis of discussion among all concerned parties.
The methods to be adopted to overcome any uplift have to be indicated in the design philosophy. 
These methods generally fall into two major categories viz. those which increase the weight 
of the structure such as iron ore filling and those which anchor the structure such as providing 
ground anchors. When ground anchors are proposed, the suitability of the soil conditions have 
to be ascertained by additional tests, if necessary. When the weight of the structure is to be 
increased, the availability and economy of the heavier fill materials should be investigated. 
Artesian condition, if any, should be studied for finalisation of the foundation location and type 
of foundation.



======================================================================
PAGE 23 of 44
======================================================================
15
IRC:SP:54-2018
Underground structures, e.g., subways are highly susceptible to water leakage and subsequent 
structural damage which reduces serviceability and durability of the structure. To ensure water 
tightness, the structure may be designed as uncracked, or more prudently, with limited crack 
widths. Crack widths may be limited to values as specified in Table No.12.1 of IRC:11 and the 
same may be achieved by limiting the strain in steel and by providing smaller diameter reinforcing 
bars at closer spacings etc. These details need to be agreed upon by all concerned parties. 
Additional water proofing may be needed and details of the procedures for the same need to be 
mentioned in the design philosophy. Alternatively use of water pressure release system may be 
resorted to where feasible and after discussions with owner.
Drainage of subways is an important consideration. Wherever possible, gravity led drainage 
should be given preference. However, gravity assisted drainage should be augmented where 
required by providing a sump-pump facility. This will entail the incorporation of facilities such as 
pump house etc. in the overall plan of the structure.
The design philosophy for subways and underpasses should include details of the excavation 
procedure to be arrived at after a detailed analysis of nature of the soil, economy, suitability 
of the scheme envisaged in construction, traffic diversion programmes, location of existing 
underground services etc. Special precautions which need to be taken during excavation, such’ 
as safety of neighbouring structures, movement of pedestrain and vehicular traffic etc. have to 
be mentioned in detail. Proposed methods of dewatering during construction is also a major 
aspect which should be dealt with-in the design philosophy.
Provision for ventilation in case of subways should be based on acceptable levels of pollution 
and should be detailed in the design philosophy, keeping in view comfort of the public. 
Lighting of subways should also be detailed in the design philosophy. Glare-free lighting luminaire 
to achieve a lux level of 50 lux or as decided in consultation with concerned authorities, should 
preferably be adopted. Lighting levels in subways/underpasses should be critically examined 
under day light conditions to achieve acceptable gradient between the bright outside and the 
relatively dark inside. The design philosophy for electrical system should also indicate the type 
of wiring, provision of standby supply, etc.
The design philosophy, insofar it is developed at the feasibility report stage, should be agreed 
upon by all concerned parties before proceeding to the next phase.
5.7.4	
Approach Alignment and Siting of Bridges: Selection of various alternative alignments 
involve only preliminary engineering. These alternatives are usually based on subjective 
judgement, care should be taken to see that alternatives are not sought for the sake of alternatives, 
i.e., the alternatives should be meaningful and sufficiently distinct from one another.
Preliminary investigation of siting and alignment alternatives are usually required for major 
bridges where different approach alignment, and economy of construction are influencing 
factors. 
Alternatives may be grouped into two categories: (i) siting and approach-alignment alternatives, 
(ii) alternatives in the structural systems for superstructure and substructure.



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 44
======================================================================
IRC:SP:54-2018
16
Identification of feasible alternative sites and approach alignments may be made with the aid of 
topographical maps, road project maps, field survey maps etc. as available. Factors affecting the 
choice of structural forms/systems are enumerated in Clause 5.7.7 herein.
5.7.5	
Identification of Feasible Alternative Alignment: Preliminary bridge-site location and, 
along with it, alignment alternatives need to be decided upon at the start of feasibility study to 
enable planning relevant data collection efforts. At least some basic data in the form of broad 
topographic survey maps are needed at this stage. At various stages of project development, 
alternatives could be progressively shortlisted based on more data and analysis keeping in view 
the influence of geometric requirements of road alignment. Guidelines for bridge alignment given 
in Pocket Book for Bridge Engineers published by IRC may be referred.
Review of alternatives may include field inspection as well as scrutiny of data.
For selection of alternatives, a decision matrix could be made as in the case of pre-feasibility 
study stage. 
“For minor bridges (upto a total length of 60 m), alignment of approaches takes precedence 
over the bridge site, whereas for a major bridge (with total length of over 300 m) the requirement 
of a good bridge site is given priority. For bridges, within these two extremes a choice shall 
be made on the relative merits between the two viz. bridge site and alignment of approaches. 
Final choice shall require discussions with the concerned authorities before preparation of 
feasibility Report”.
5.7.6	
Geometric Design: For every feasible site and alignment, a geometric design which 
includes vertical curves, horizontal curves, super-elevation etc. need to be carried out.
5.7.7	
Span Configuration and Type of Superstructure Systems:
5.7.7.1	
Each site has its own unique conditions affecting the choice for the type of a bridge 
structure for optimum performance, economy and maintenance free design life service. Choice 
of a particular span arrangement and the type of superstructure systems depends upon several 
factors such as site characteristics, type of sub-soil strata, height and length of the bridge, design 
and construction aspects, availability of construction materials, construction technology, and 
time-frame of construction etc. In case of urban flyovers, the practical and economic viability 
of viaduct span vis-à-vis retaining walls for approaches may be examined without affecting the 
aesthetics and other requirements. 
5.7.7.2	
Design effort is an important parameter in selecting the span arrangement and 
so also is the availability of specialised centering and shuttering, construction/launching 
equipment, construction methodology etc. These factors often dictate an alternative span 
arrangement to be adopted. Successful tenderer’s suggestions regarding an alternative span 
arrangement are governed by the design and construction resources under his control. Such 
tender data from previous projects should be made use of in updating the feasibility analysis 
for the project at hand. This would greatly help in limiting the number of economically feasible 
alternatives.

The indicative ranges of span length within which a particular type of superstructure 
can be economical along with other considerations like type of foundation etc. are given 
below:
Type of Superstructure

However, whenever an economical span arrangement and type of structure is decided, it has 
to be ensured that the required infrastructural facilities, design and construction capabilities, 
specialised equipments, materials etc. are available.
5.7.8	
Aesthetic Considerations: For aesthetics, attention should be focussed on producing 
a clean, simple, well proportioned structural form. In most cases, achieving the desired visual 
quality may add little to the overall cost of the structure. Aesthetic considerations should play 
an important part in minor bridges also, Bridge parapets, are the most visible parts and should 
harmonise with the surroundings.
Land scaping the site to achieve visual agreement between the structure and the environment 
should be considered especially in case of urban locations and grade separation structures.

5.7.9	
Preliminary Design: Preliminary designs should be carried out for all alternatives. 
(definition of Preliminary design) 
The design should provide the following: the approach road alignment, siting, and geometric 
design: type, depth and preliminary design of foundations and substructures, type and preliminary 
design of the superstructure including bearings.
5.7.10	
General Arrangement Drawings: Based on the preliminary design, General 
Arrangement Drawings should be produced for all alternatives. These drawings should be 
detailed enough in all respects so that a considered judgement of the relative merits of the 
various alternatives can be made.
5.7.11	
Preliminary Cost Estimates: Preliminary cost estimates are prepared after the 
preliminary design for various alternatives has been completed. Such cost estimates are 
necessary for feasibility studies and project evaluation. Rates adopted for the cost estimates 
should be those as per schedule of rates based on MOST Data Book. For items not covered by 
Data Book, proper analysis of rates may be prepared.
5.7.12	
Initial Environmental Examination: Initial environmental examination and identification 
of protected forest, reserve forest, wild life sanctuary, CRZ etc. should be carried be carried out for 
all alternatives. Construction of a large bridge may have an adverse impact on the environment. 
The most likely impacts are as under:
	
a)	
Increase in floodability
	
b)	
Likelihood of river bank erosion
	
c)	
Possibility of siltation
	
d)	
Relocation and rehabilitation of people/communities
	
e)	
Traffic and transportation effects on the surrounding areas
	
f)	
Effects on historic site/monuments
	
g)	
Likelihood of the bridge structure not harmonizing with the surroundings
Flood ability can increase if the waterway is inadequate and the afflux is large, this may raise the 
level of water upsteam in the nearby settlements.
The siting of the bridge and the waterway provided may change the course of the river and erode 
the river banks, affecting the land and settlements.
The level of the river bed may rise due to siltation that may be caused due to interference 
with the natural regime of the flow. Inadequate waterway too casues flooding and consequent 
deposition of silt on the agricultural land.
For major bridges, there is a distinct possibility of relocation of people communities. Efforts 
should be made to keep the impact of the bridge in this regard to a minimum. The proposed 
bridge might also attract or generate additional traffic affecting adversely the capacity of the 
roads in the vicinity. The proposed bridge may also adversely affect the quality and nature of 
historic sites/monuments. Aspects of such environmental impacts of the proposed bridge need 
to be studied in detail.

In addition, approaches to a major bridge may transverse through forest land, unstable hill faces, 
natural lakes, historical landmarks or architectural/archaeological relics. The Archaeological 
Survey of India and the State Archaeological Departments should be consulted. The department 
of culture will be able throw light on the historical resources.
When bridges and their approaches are to be constructed adjacent to inhabited area, the 
vibration, noise and dust caused by construction activity will adversely affect the environment. 
Necessary migratory measures will need to be undertaken to safeguard the interests of the 
surrounding environment.
5.8	
Economic Evaluation
5.8.1 
General Principals: Though the construction of a bridge brings about a variety of 
benefits enjoyed by practically all sectors of the economy, the prevailing conditions of resource 
scarcity necessitates an economic evaluation of projects so that only worthwhile projects are 
taken up for implementation. IRC Special Publication No. 30 (Manual on Economic Evaluation 
of Highway Projects) contains detailed procedure for economic evaluation and may be referred 
to for guidance.
5.8.2	
While for very large bridge project a separate economic evaluation is necessary, 
smaller projects are usually included as part of the overall highway projects for economic 
analysis. Economic evaluation exercise for large bridge projects should include approaches as a 
part of the project. The cost and benefits of both bridge and its approaches are to be considered 
together.
5.8.3	
To check the viability of PPP project, financial analysis is necessary to work out equity 
IRR and Project IRR as per prevailing standard procedures to the satisfaction of the client/
highway authority.
5.8.4 
Period of analysis: A bridge has a long design life of 100 years. But it is not necessary 
to carry out economic and financial evaluation for such a long period because of difficulties in 
prediction of various parameters with required level of accuracy and because of insignificant 
contribution of discounted future benefits. It is customary to cover a period of 15-30 years or 
concession period, whichever is more.
5.8.5 
Traffic Projection: Three types of traffic are to be considered:
	
1)	
Normal Traffic, which includes the present traffic growing at a projected rate.
	
2)	
Diverted traffic i.e. the traffic which would get diverted to the new facility after its 
construction.
	
3)	
Generated traffic, the traffic that gets generated or induced because of the new 
improved facility.
The rate of growth of traffic is estimated on the basis of (i) past trends with suitable modifications 
to account for the future, and (ii) economic models which establish the elasticity of traffic with 
respect to economic indicators such as GNP, growth in population, agricultural and industrial 
outputs.

IRC:SP:54-2018
20
5.8.6 
Project cost and scheduling: Cost of the project is split into yearly cost inputs over 
the expected period of completion. The cost of maintaining the structure over the period of 
analysis is also considered. Since economic costs, exclusive of taxes and subsidies are to be 
considered, they should be worked out after studying the tax element in the various items of 
work. As an approximation, the economic cost can be taken to be 80-85 percent cost of the 
financial cost.
5.8.7 
Project benefits: The benefits from the construction of a bridge fall under the following 
heads:
	
a)	
Savings in vehicle operating costs due to reduced travel distance and/or superior 
road condition;
	
b)	
Savings due to value of reduction in time of travel of passengers and commodities 
in transit;
	
c)	
Savings due to reduction in accident costs;
	
d)	
Expected increase in agricultural, industrial or mining output.
Travel time savings of passengers are not generally considered in highway project evaluation 
in India. However, if the project results in very substantial travel time savings, e.g. in the case of 
an urban route.
The VOC elements may be taken from the IRC Special Publication No. 30.
5.8.8 
Sensitivity analysis : The estimation of project costs and benefits is dependent on 
various factors which may vary from the assumptions made at the time of project formulation. 
In order to asses how sensitive the economic and financial evaluation is to uncertainties, a 
sensitivity analysis is carried out. Normally, three cases are considered :
	
i)	
Base benefits reduced by 15 per cent
	
ii)	
Base cost increased by 15 per cent
	
iii)	
Base (i) and. (ii) above together
5.8.9 
Economically/Financially low return projects : In some projects, particularly 
for subways, underpasses, flyover etc. adequate economic/financial return may not be 
associated. These are needed from the considerations of special benefits under compelling 
circumstances.
5.9

Conclusion and Recommendation
5.10 
Acceptance of Feasibility Study Report
The feasibility study report is generally required to be presented in draft form called draft Feasibility 
Study Report to the employer for their comments. After receipt of comments of the employer, 
the feasibility study report is finalised duly incorporating the comments of the employer. After 
submission of final feasibility study report, the employer is required to take decision about final 
bridge site, approach alignment, bridge width, span arrangement, type of superstructure system, 
type of substructure/foundation, type of material, construction methodology and sequences, 
construction period. The employer also knows about the preliminary cost of the project and its 
components.
6 PREPARATION OF DETAILED PROJECT REPORT
6.1	
Detailed Investigation
Upon finalization of alignment and bridge site, detailed investigations are carried out with respect 
to topographic survey, subsoil investigations and environmental/social impact assessment. 
Model study (if required as per IRC:78) has to be carried out immediately after acceptance of 
approach alignment and bridge site.
6.1.1	
Final location survey : The purpose of final location survey is to lay out final 
centre line of the road in field based on the alignment selected in the design office and 
to collect necessary data for preparation of working drawings. The completeness and 
accuracy of the project drawings and estimate of quantities depends a great deal on the 
precision with which this survey is carried out. As far as possible, for survey of major 
bridges, modem survey equipment such as total station should be used. On finalization 
of bridge alignment, the same is to be set-out on site on the basis of actual geometry. 
The initial topographical survey is required to be updated on the basis of actual setting 
out at site. Such a detailed survey is more important where there is a substantial time 
gap between execution of topographical survey at preliminary investigation stage and 
settlement of the alignment.
6.1.2	
Sub-soil investigation : On finalization of layout, it is necessary to carry out a detailed 
sub-soil investigation based on the actual layout. It is at this stage that the requirement of various 
tests to be conducted as well as their location at site becomes evident. At least one bore hole on 
each abutment foundation location and one each at alternate peir foundation location for span 
upto 60 m and at each foundation location for span more than 60 m should be made in case of 
major bridges. When founding strata is rock, the number of bore holes may be suitably increased 
depending upon the dip of rocky strata. The number of bore holes in case of minor bridges shall 
be tow one in the river bed and one in approach. The tests should provide adequate information 



======================================================================
PAGE 31 of 44
======================================================================
23
IRC:SP:54-2018
required to carry out engineering design. Sub-soil investigation should be carried out as per 
IRC:78 and relevant IS Codes or as decided by the concerned departments. Before the final 
investigation is taken up, it is necessary to review the extent of usefulness and reliability of the 
data obtained from preliminary investigations. No further investigations are required in case 
preliminary investigations provide adequate information/data to carry out detailed engineering 
design.
6.1.3	
Environmental impact assessment: Environmental Impact Assessment and 
identification of reserve forest, protected forest, wild life sanctuary, CRZ etc. on the selected 
alignment should be carried out as per the guidelines of Ministry of Environment & Forests. The 
mitigation measures of adverse impact should be outlined by an Environmental Management 
Plan.
6.1.4	
Social Impact Assessment, Land Acquisition and Resettlement Action Plan: Corridor 
of Impact for assessing the extent of social impact is identified and determined. Census about 
the affected persons/families/SC-ST populations, loss of income and livelihood, type/use/
ownership details/quantum of affected land and properties/structures will be carried to work out 
the Resettlement Action Plan, land acquisition cost, replacement cost for structures/properties, 
and Resettlement & rehabilitation cost. 
6.2	
Detailed Design
After detailed investigations have been completed, detailed design is taken up and has to be 
carried out for various components of the Crossing as per the design philosophy developed 
and finalised at feasibility stage. Based on detailed design, working drawings are required to be 
prepared. Constructability of structure has to be considered in the design stage. Special care 
may be taken to examine easy concreting of structure by avoiding congestion of reinforcement 
and proper dimensioning.
6.2.1	
Superstructure: The detailed design of superstructure is to be carried out using the 
most appropriate analytical methods and limit state design philosophy as per IRC:112. Computer 
aided methods of analysis such as matrix methods (force method or flexibility method), finite 
element method, finite strip method, finite difference method etc. may be used but adequate 
care need to be taken in the structural modeling of the structure and applied loadings as well as 
proper interpretation of the results. Results so obtained should preferably be checked by other 
simpler or manual (hands-on) methods wherever relevant.
For cable supported structures such as extradosed cable-stayed or suspension bridges etc., 
dynamic and aerodynamic analysis is also required. 
6.2.2	
Bearings, expansion joints, railing, wearing coat and appurtenances: The type of 
bearings is dependent on the structural system for the superstructure, support conditions, 
desired design/functional requirements and choice of designer. The detailed design of 
bearing is carried out depending upon the type of superstructure, support condition and 
bearing type. Details of expansion joints, railing, wearing coat and other appurtenances 
should also be given.

PAGE 32 of 44
======================================================================
IRC:SP:54-2018
24
6.2.3	
Substructure: The detailed design of substructure will be carried out in accordance 
with the hydraulic and structural and aesthetical requirements. In addition, as the substructure is 
one of the two visible parts of the crossing its aesthetics require special consideration.
6.2.4	
Foundations: The type and size of foundations depends on the soil conditions, scour, 
and river flow pattern as determined from the investigations as well as importance of bridge. The 
detailed design should be carried out as per IRC:78.
6.2.5	
Approaches, river protection, river training works, etc.:
Detailed drawings of approaches, river protection and training works (where provided) should 
also be given.
6.2.6	
Software application: For speedy and accurate analysis/design, ‘computer aided 
design’ methods are often resorted to. Where standard proven softwares are used, with approval 
of the client, the design may be carried out straight away giving a brief of the software adopted, 
along with input data and output. If designers’ own programmes are used, their validity should 
be proved to the satisfaction of the client giving the logic adopted and comparing the results 
obtained with long hand method for few typical cases.
6.3	
Detailed Cost Estimates
6.3.1	
Cost estimates and its content: The detailed cost estimate of the project should give 
a clear picture of the financial commitments involved and should be complete in all respects. It 
should give a realistic idea of the cost involved. This is possible only if all the items of work are 
carefully listed, the quantities are determined to a reasonable degree of accuracy and the rates 
are provided on a realistic basis.
The estimate should have the following components presented in a logical sequence: 
	
1)	
General Abstract of Cost under Major Heads
	
2)	
Details of Cost for Each Major Head
	
3)	
Details of Quantities
	
4)	
Justification for Rates
	
5)	
Quarry/Material Source Charts
	
6)	
Foreign Exchange Component
	
7)	
Tools and Plants
6.3.2	
General abstract of cost : The General Abstract of cost should be one-page summary 
of estimated cost under each major head. Considering that a bridge project invariably involves 
its approaches, the following major heads are suggested:
	
1)	
Site clearance
	
2)	
Earthwork
	
3)	
Shoulder, sub-base and base course
	
4)	
Bituminous/cement concrete courses
	
5)	
a) Bridges

Provision should be made for contingencies, work-charged establishment costs, and quality 
control and supervision charges. 
Contingencies are intended to cover minor variations in quantities and rates and should be 
provided as 2.8% or as per norms of the Authority. 
Work-charged establishment costs are intended to cover the wages of casual staff employed in 
connection with execution of the work. The normal practice is to provide 1.5-2 per cent.
Quantity of following items should be given in the report for working out factors for escalation 
formula :
	
i)	
Cement
	
ii)	
Reinforced steel
	
iii)	
Prestressing steel (high tensile steel)

Quality control should cover the cost of field and central laboratory and the testing charges. In 
modem contracts, it is usual to specify that all quality control tests are made by the contractor 
at his cost, and the rates are expected to reflect this. In that case, it may be more appropriate to 
include this item in the Analysis of Rate of individual item of work.
Project Management charges are intended to cover the cost of office establishment and 
that of the supervisory staff. For National Highway works which are executed by the State 
Public Works Department/NHAI/NHIDCL/BRO/Central and States Govt. Undertaking/PPP 
Concessionaire, Agency Charges as per the prevailing norms should be considered in the 
estimate. 
The addition of centage charges should follow a logical pattern. The format given in clause 6.3.3 
is recommended.

Details of cost of each major head : Items that are involved under each of the major 
heads of work are to be listed, the quantities and rates entered against each and the cost derived 
and entered.
In order to ensure that no items are missed, it is desirable that each department prepares its 
own standard list of items based on MoRTH Data Book and Specifications. This standard list can 
be used for all estimates, marking ‘nil’ entries against those that are not needed for a particular 
project.

Details of quantities : The quantities entered in the cost estimate are to be well 
supported by detailed calculations. It should be possible for anybody to check the calculations 
independently.
6.3.5	
Justification of rates : The rates adopted must be realistic and should reflect truly the 
cost likely to be incurred in carrying out the work as per the specifications stipulated.
Most of the State Public Works Departments have Basic Schedule of Rates for different Districts/
Zones in the state and they are regularly updated. If the Basic Schedule of Rates is valid for 
the year in which the estimate is prepared, and it reflects the Specifications truly, the rates can 



======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 44

27
IRC:SP:54-2018
be adopted. Otherwise, the rates have to be analysed. The Report should contain the analysis 
which should account for all items of cost, over heads and profit on realistic basis.
The quarry and material source charts should accompany the analysis of rates.
6.3.6	
Foreign exchange component : Where a work involves the use of foreign exchange, 
the estimates should give details of this component. It should comprise material and equipment 
costs and personnel costs.
6.4 
Specifications
The Detailed Project Report should clearly make a reference to the Specifications which is 
intended to govern the work. These could be the State Public Works Department Specifications 
or the Ministry of Surface Transport Specifications.
6.5 
Special Specifications
If the Standard Specifications does not fully cover the scope of certain items of work in the 
project, it is necessary to mention broadly the additions and alterations that would be made to 
the Specifications. Any special item not covered by the clauses in the Specifications may have 
to be governed by special clauses issued by the Ministry of Surface Transport or the State Public 
Works Departments. If the Specifications are to be borrowed from A.S.T.M. or other foreign 
bodies or Bureau of Indian Standards or the Indian Roads Congress, mention should be made 
accordingly.
6.6 
Preparation of Detailed Drawings
6.6.1	
General: The drawings for a bridge project should depict the proposed works in relation 
to the existing features, besides other information necessary for accurate transformation of the 
proposals in the field. For easy understanding and interpretation, it is desirable that the drawings 
should follow a uniform practice with regard to size, scales and details to be incorporated.
6.6.2	
Drawings sizes: Drawings should be of adequate size to accommodate a reasonable 
length of the approach road, the bridge site, or a structural unit in full detail. At the same time, 
these should not be inconveniently large necessitating several folds. It is recommended that the 
size may be 594 x 420 mm, corresponding to the size A2 of IS : 696- 1960. A margin of 40 mm 
may be kept on the left hand side of the drawing for stitching into a folio. For making drawing 
folder A-3 size after reducing the original tracing in A-2 size may be used for convenience of 
handling.
6.6.3	
Component parts of bridge project drawings : The drawing required for a bridge project 
include the following:
i)	
Index Map
The index map should show the exact location of the bridge on the roads on which it falls, and 
should show details of the immediate neighbourhood covering important physical features like 
rivers, lakes, railway lines, other roads etc. and should show about 20-25 km of the road on 
which the bridge falls with the kilometerage marked.
