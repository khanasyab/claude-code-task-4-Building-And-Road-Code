GUIDELINES FOR ACCESS, LOCATION AND
LAYOUT OF ROADSIDE FUEL STATIONS
AND SERVICE
STATIONS
(THIRD REVISION)
1 INTRODUCTION
1
. 1
The Recommended Practices for Motor-Fuel Filling Stations and Motor Fuel Filling-Cum-
Service Stations were initially published as separate documents in the year 1954 and 1962 respectively.
These were later converted into metric units in 1967. These two separate documents were revised
and merged in a single document namely "Recommended Practice for Location and Layout of Roadside
Motor Fuel Filling and Motor Fuel Filling-cum-Service Stations" and was published as a single document
as IRC: 12 in the year 1983.
1
. 2
The Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways (MOSRT&H) revised substantially
the norms for location, layout and access to fuel stations along the National Highways keeping in
view the increased speed of vehicles and greater need for road safety due to development of National
Highways network under various phases of National Highway Development Project (NHDP) and
other development works on National Highways. These norms were circulated in October, 2003.
These norms were finalized in consultation with the Ministry of Petroleum and the oil companies.
1
. 3
The Transport Planning, Traffic Engineering and Road Safety Committee (H- 1 ) decided that
the draft for the revised standard might be updated by incorporating
the present guidelines
of
MOSRT&H by Shri S.B. Basu. The draft was modified as per the provisions of latest MOSRT&H
Guidelines and also subsequent experiences gained while processing the applications for setting up
of fuel stations by the side of National Highways. The draft was considered and approved by the
Transport Planning, Traffic Engineering and Road Safety Committee (H-l) in its meeting held on 4
th
November, 2008 subject to some modifications. The draft was modified and finalized by S/Shri S.B.
Basu, Chief Engineer (Retd.) and Sudip Chaudhury, Superintending Engineer, Deptt. ofRoad Transport
& Highways. The Highways Specifications and Standards (HSS) Committee approved this document
in the fifth meeting held on 23
rd November, 2008. The Executive Committee in its meeting held on
30
th November, 2008 approved this document. Finally the Council approved this document in their
meeting held on 13
th December, 2008 at Kolkata. The names of the personnel of Transport Planning,

BASIC PRINCIPLES
The governing consideration for setting up fuel stations is to ensure free flow of traffic on the road
along the fuel stations, minimum interference by the vehicles using the facilities and to ensure safety of
the vehicles on the road.
3 SCOPE
3
. 1
Petrol/Diesel/Gas fuel stations and service stations with or without Rest Area Amenities etc.
are hereinafter referred to as Fuel Stations.
3
. 2
These norms are applicable to all Fuel Stations with or without other user facilities of rest
areas, along un-divided carriageway and divided carriageway sections of all categories of roads i.e.
2



======================================================================
PAGE 11 of 30
======================================================================
IRC: 12-2009
National Highways, State highways, Major District Roads and Rural roads in plain, rolling and hilly
terrain, and passing through rural and urban stretches including towns and cities. For this purpose
hilly or mountainous terrain would be, when the cross slope of the country is more than 25%. The
urban stretches, only for the purpose of this guidelines, would be, where a highway passes through
towns or cities which have been notified as Municipalities or Municipal Corporations.
4 GENERAL CONDITIONS OF SITING
4. 1
The fuel stations shall generally be a part of the rest area complex along the highways. Rest
areas should have various amenities for users, e.g. places for parking, toilets, restaurants, rest rooms,
kiosks for selling sundry items, bathing facilities, repair facilities, creche etc. These aspects should be
incorporated while planning for improvement and upgradaton of highway/road sections and/or planning
for new fuel stations along the highways/roads. The rest area complex can be planned subject to their
commercial viability.
4.2
It should be ensured that the location of the proposed fuel station does not interfere with
future improvements of the highway/road and the nearby intersections/junctions.
4
. 3
The fuel stations would be located where the highway alignment and profile are favourable
i.e. where the ground as practically level, there are no sharp curves or steep grades (more than 5%)
and where the sight distances would be adequate for safe traffic operation. The proposed location
should not interfere with placement and proper functioning of highway signs, signals, lighting or other
devices that affect traffic operation.
4.4
While considering the proposal for new fuel stations, it would be ensured that the fuel stations
on a corridor are well distributed on both sides of the highways so that vehicles normally do not have
to cut across the traffic to reach them. The fuel stations would be serving only the traffic moving on
the adjacent lane. For the vehicles traveling in the lanes in opposite direction, separate fuel stations
need to be planned for which permission would be considered keeping also in view of its location and
distance norms.
4.5
In order to provide safe length for weaving of traffic, fuel stations along highways/roads shall
be located at the minimum distance from an intersection (gap in the central median be treated as
intersection), as given below. For single carriageway section, these minimum distances would be
applicable for both sides. All the distances shall be measured between the tangent points of the
curves of the side roads at intersections/the median openings and the access/egress roads of the fuel
stations, as is applicable, in a direction parallel to the centre line of the nearest carriageway of the
highway.
The above mentioned distances are applicable for setting up of fuel stations along National Highways,
State Highways and Major District Roads. In case of fuel stations along the Rural Roads in plain and
3

IRC: 12-2009
rolling terrain, the distance from the intersection with NHs/SHs/MDRs can be reduced to 300 m in
place of 1000 m depending on the level of traffic.

4.5.3
There shall not be any median gap on a divided carriageway within a distance of
300 m on each side of the fuel station.This minimum distance i.e. 300 m shall be measured between
the start of the median gap and the nearest tangent point of the access/egress road of the fuel station,
as is applicable, in a direction parallel to the centre line of the nearest carriageway of the highway.
This stipulation shall be applicable for such median gaps, which are located neither in front of nor in
proximity of any intersection or intersecting roads. For intersecting road median gaps or median gaps
in proximity of intersections, the provisions stipulated under para 4.5. 1 and para 4.5.2 shall apply.



======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 30
======================================================================
IRC: 12-2009
4 . 6
The minimum distance between two fuel stations would be as given below
:
4.6.1
Plain and rolling terrain in non-urban (rural) areas
(i)
Undivided carriageway (for both sides of
300 m
carriageway)
(including deceleration
and acceleration lanes).
(ii)
Divided carriageway (with no gap in median
1 000 m
at this location and stretch)
(including deceleration
and acceleration lanes).
4.6.2
Hilly/mountainous terrain and urban stretches
(i)
Undivided carriageway (for both sides of
300 m
carriageway)
(clear)
(ii)
Divided carriageway (with no gap in median
300 m
at this location and stretch)
(clear)
Note:
(i) The minimum distance of 300 m between two fuel stations on both sides of the road is
applicable for undivided carriageway only. In case of divided carriageway, with no gap
in medians, the distance restriction is not applicable on the opposite side of the fuel
station and the minimum distance between two fuel stations on the same side shall be
1000 m.
(ii) The distance between the fuel stations shall be measured between the tangent points of
the access/egress roads of the fuel stations, as is applicable, in a direction parallel to the
centre line of the nearest carriageway of the highway.
4.6.3
If two or more fuel stations are to be sited in close proximity for some reasons, these would
be grouped together to have a common access through a service road of 7.0 m width and connected
to the highway through acceleration, deceleration lanes. From these considerations, the permission
for the new fuel stations would be considered only if it is either in proximity to the existing one so that
the common access can be provided or the new one located at distance of more than 1000 m. Any
objection from the existing fuel station owner against granting of access permission from the highway
for the proposed new fuel station are to be overruled and access to all fuel stations in case of clustering,
shall invariably be from the service road only.
4.6.4
For installation of new fuel station within the 1000 m or 300 m distance of existing fuel
station as the case may be, new entrant would be responsible for construction and maintenance of the
common service road, deceleration and acceleration lanes, drainage and traffic control devices.
Wherever, available ROW
is inadequate to accommodate such service roads, deceleration/
5



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 30
======================================================================
IRC: 12-2009
acceleration lanes, etc. the additional land by the side ofROW to accommodate such service roads
shall also be acquired by the new entrant Oil Company. In case of hilly/mountainous terrain, common
service roads at all such locations may not be possible as per the site conditions and, therefore,
common access through service roads would not be a pre-condition.
4.7
The fuel station shall not be located within a distance of 1000 m from any barrier including
that of toll plaza, and railway level crossing. No check barrier /toll plaza should be erected within
1000 m of a fuel station. However, if such barriers are located on service roads only and are separated
from the main carriageway, then this requirement shall not apply. Fuel Stations should be located at a
minimum distance of 200 m and 500 m from the start of an approach road of a Road Over Bridge
(ROB) and the start of a grade separator or a ramp respectively.
5 PLOT SIZE FOR FUEL STATION
5
. 1
The minimum size and shape of the plot for the fuel station would need to be such that it
suitably accommodates fuel pumps, offices, stores, compressor room, air pump and kiosks without
causing any hindrance to the movement of vehicles of expected maximum dimensions, within fuel
stations and in the access area. Sufficient space would need to be available to accommodate the
number of fuel pumps to cater to the expected number of vehicles in peak time at this location so that
the vehicles do not spill on to the access area. The air pump and kiosks for pollution control
measurements be installed at some distance from the fuel pumps so that the vehicles requiring these
services do not cause hindrance to the free movement 3f vehicles entering or exiting for refueling.
5.2
From these considerations, the minimum size of the plot for fuel station along highways/
roads
shall be as follows:
(i)
On undivided carriageway in plain and rolling terrain
35 m (frontage) x 35 m (depth)
(ii)
On divided carriageway in plain/rolling terrain
35 m (frontage) x 45 m (depth)
(iii)
In hilly and mountainous terrain
20 m (frontage) x 20 m (depth)
(iv)
In urban stretches
20 m (frontage) x 20 m (depth)
Note:
The proposed plot of new fuel stations should be such that the minimum plot size stipulated
as above can be accommodated.
5.3
For fuel station being part of the rest area complex, the area required for other facilities, such
as parking, restaurant, rest rooms, toilets, kiosks for selling sundry items, bathing facilities, repair
facilities etc. would be extra but such integrated facilities shall have a single common access/egress.

ACCESS LAYOUT
6. 1
Access for New Fuel Stations along Un-divided and Divided Carriageway Sections
6.1.1
The access to the fuel stations along the highway/road shall be through deceleration and
acceleration lanes. The deceleration and acceleration lanes may be dispensed with for the fuel stations
located along urban roads, rural roads and roads in hilly and mountainous terrain. The access to the
fuel stations located on highways with service road shall be only through that service road.
6. 1 .2
The deceleration lane would take off from the edge of the shoulder taken up to the edge of
the Right ofWay (ROW) of the highway/road, beyond which, the boundary of fuel station shall start.
Its minimum length would be 70 m measured along the traveled direction of highway.
Its width would
be minimum 5.5 m.
The shoulder of 2.25 m would be provided towards the outer side of the
access /egress (i.e. on the side farthest from the carriageway) for this deceleration lane.
6.1.3
The acceleration lane would take off from the edge of the fuel station on exit side having
minimum length of 100 m with parallel type layout.
Its starting stretch of 70 m length would be with
a curvature of minimum radius of 650 m and the remaining 30 m length would be tapered so as to
facilitate vehicles coming out of fuel station, merging with fast moving through traffic on main
carriageway, in a safe and efficient manner. Wherever, available ROW is inadequate to accommodate
the service roads and/or deceleration/acceleration lanes in plain and rolling terrain of non-urban
stretches, the additional marginal land by the side of ROW to accommodate the deceleration/
acceleration lanes shall be acquired by the owner of the fuel station. In case of widening to 4/6 lanes
in near future, the matter shall be dealt on case to case basis.
6. 1 .4
A separator island would be provided in front of the fuel station so that no right turning takes
place. The length of this separator island would be determined on the basis of the intersecting points
of the edge line of the separator island with the line drawn along the edge of chevron markings as
indicated in Figs.
1 to 4 of these norms.
Its shape for isolated fuel station would be as shown in
Figs.
1 and 3, and that for the cluster of fuel stations with common service roads, as shown in Figs. 2
and 4. It would have minimum width of 3 m. The width of approaches connecting deceleration and
acceleration lanes, along the separator island should be 5.5 m.
6. 1 .5
There would be buffer strip from the edge of the ROW and wouldextend minimum 3 m
inside the fuel station plot.
Its minimum length would be 12 m. In urban/hilly or mountainous areas,
minimum length of buffer strip may be reduced to 5 m keeping minimum width of opening at entry and
exit to 7.5 m. No structure or hoarding except the approved standard identification sign on pole
would be permitted, which may be provided outside the ROW. The buffer strip as well as the separator
island would be provided with kerb of minimum 273 mm height to prevent vehicles from crossing it or
using it for parking purposes.
7



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 30
======================================================================
IRC: 12-2009
The buffer strip in the approach zone should be suitably shaped to cover extra area in the approach
zone after provision of acceleration, deceleration lane and connecting approaches and should be
properly turfed for aesthetic landscaping.
6. 1 .6
The radius for turning curve would be 13 m and that for non-turning curve be from 1 .5 to
3 m so as to check over speeding while entering or exiting the fuel station. Wherever, available ROW
is inadequate, the additional marginal land by the side ofROW shall be acquired by the owner of the
fuel station to provide prescribed turning radius.
6. 1 .7
The pavement of the access roads including deceleration, acceleration lanes and connecting
approaches would have sufficient strength for the expected traffic for the design period. It would
have minimum pavement composition of 150 mm thick Granular Sub Base (GSB) overlaid by three
layers of Water Bound Macadam (WBM) (other than WBM-Grading No.l),Wet Mix Macadam
(WMM) each of 75 mm thickness topped by 50 mm thick Bituminous Macadam (BM) and 25 mm
thick Semi Dense Bituminous Carpet (SDBC).
6. 1 .8
A typical access layout for the new fuel station with relevant details for deceleration and
acceleration lanes, connecting approaches, separator island, buffer strip, drainage, signs and markings
on un-divided carriageway section of highway would be as shown in Figs. 1 and 3 of these norms.
6.1.9
The typical access layout for cluster of fuel stations, with details for deceleration lane, service
road and acceleration lane etc. would be as shown in Figs. 2 and 4 of these norms.
6
. 2
The typical layout for fuel station and signs and marking along highways in hilly/mountains
terrain and in urban stretches is given in Fig. 5.
7
DRAINAGE
There shall be adequate drainage system on the access to the fuel station and inside its area so as to
ensure that surface water does not flow over the highway or any water logging takes place. For this
purpose, the fuel station and access area would be at least 300 mm below the level at the edge of the
shoulder on the highway. The surface water from fuel station and access road would need to be
collected in a suitable underground drainage system and led away to a natural course through culvert.
Only slab culvert with iron grating of adequate strength shall be constructed in the approaches so that
surface water is drained through the openings of in the grating. Construction of pipe culverts shall not
be permissible for this purpose. The drainage arrangement would be either by the method mentioned
above or as per the satisfaction of the Highway/Road Authorities. The applicant has to prepare
separate detailed drawings indicating the drainage arrangements and to be submitted along with the
application for permission.

ENFORCEMENT OF RIGHT OF WAY
AND BUILDING LINES
While planning the layout for various facilities inside the fuel stations, it has to be ensured that fuel
pumps are located beyond the Building Lines, as prescribed in IRC:73 "Geometric Design Standards
for Rural (Non-Urban) Highways" and Fuel Station office building etc. at a safe distance as prescribed
by Fire Department or other authorities. The buffer strip would extend minimum 3 m inside the Fuel
Station plot, beyond the available ROW. The future widening of the highway/road shall also be kept
in view while setting up and preparing the layout plan of the proposed fuel station. The proposed fuel
station shall be located beyond the Right of Way as prescribed in IRC:73 for the respective category
of the road on which it is located if there is such a proposal of widening the highway/road. The owner
of the fuel station shall acquire additional land, if required, to accommodate access/egress roads for
fuel stations, service roads, acceleration/deceleration lanes, etc.
9 SYSTEM FOR SIGNS AND MARKINGS
9.1
An adequate system for signs and markings would be provided at the locations of fuel stations
for the guidance of the highway users. The pavement markings would be in the form of chevron at
entry and exit locations, give way for the exit from the Fuel Station. Informatory sign for fuel station
would be provided at are lkm ahead, 500 m ahead and at the entry point.
9.2
On undivided carriageway, additional signs for the regulation of entry and exit of the vehicular
traffic should be provided on the separator island. Also, an informatory sign should be installed
showing the distance of the nearest Fuel Station located in the direction of travel in order to avoid any
need for right turnings for accessing the Fuel Station located on the opposite side. This sign should be
installed at the location of about 200 m ahead of the opposite side Fuel Station.
9 . 3
The pavement markings would conform to IRC : 35 "Code of Practice for Road Markings",
and Road Signs to IRC:67 "Code of Practice for Road Signs" and IRC:SP:55 "Guidelines on Safety
in Road Construction Zones".
9.4
The system for signs and markings with their type and locations would be as shown in
Figs.
1 to 4 for the chosen access layout.
10 IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURE
10.1
Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas/Oil Companies while entertaining any application for
the installation of Fuel Station, would supply a copy of these norms to the applicant so that he may
assess his position to fulfill the requirements of these norms. Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas/Oil
Companies would ensure that the plot identified by the applicant conforms to the requirement of
/

IRC: 12-2009
these norms in terms of its location, access layout and signs and markings.
It shall also be the
responsibility of the applicant/owner of Fuel Station to provide the prescribed layout for access as
given in Figs.
1 to 5, as the case may be, while preparing the layout. The applicant has to submit a
clearly drawn layout for the proposed fuel station as per the guidelines/standard as indicated above.
10.2
The Highway Agency may prescribe for a license deed to be signed between the oil company
who wants to set up a new fuel station and the highway agency and also a suitable amount as license
fee in consideration of the agreement.
10.3
Non-conformity or any default in respect of the norms as mentioned above and non-
maintenance of deceleration lane, acceleration lane, service road, drainage system, channelizers,
markings, signs and other traffic control devices in good operating conditions would make the fuel
station liable to be de-energized. In cases of clustered fuel stations responsibility for default or non-
conformity will attract such penalty and would be determined through a joint inspection of the highway
authority and the oil companies concerned.
