1.2.
At its first meeting on 29* April, 2003, the
Committee felt that in the light of the massive
construction programme
that was under
execution in the highway sector, it was necessary
to bring out guidelines on certain topics which
were not adequately covered in the existing IRC
Codes and Standards. The guideline for the use
of High Performance Concrete was one of the
two topics selected.
It was decided that the
guidlines would be generally in line with IRC: 1
8
and IRC:21 with additional inputs from BS:5400,
EURO
and AASHTO
codes,
wherever
necessary.
1.3.
The
initial draft of the guidelines was
prepared by Dr. A.K. Mullick. The draft was
discussed by the B-6 Committee
at several
meetings and finalized in its meeting held on 3"^
September, 2004. The draft document was
approved by Bridges Specifications and Standards
Committee in its meeting held on 2"'' December,
2004 and by the Executive Committee on 18*
December, 2004. The document was considered
by IRC Council in its
173^'' meeting held on 8*
January, 2005 in Bangalore and approved with
certain modifications. The required modifications
were accordingly carried out by the Convenor B-
6 Committee before sending the document for
publication.
2.
SCOPE
High Performance Concrete (HPC) can be
used both in super and substructure of bridges.
The guidelines provide broad aspects
for
production of HPC including mix design. The
guidelines on HPC should be read in conjunction
with relevant IS and IRC Specifications and Codes
of practice,
besides
International Codes/
Guidelines on the same topic, to gain confidence
on its usage.

TERMINOLOGY
3.1.
High Performance Concrete
Concrete, whose ingredients, proportions
and production methods are specifically chosen
to meet special performance and uniformity
requirements that cannot be always achieved
routinely by using only conventional materials,
like, cement, aggregates, water and chemical
admixtures, and adopting normal mixing, placing
and curing
practices. These performance
requirements can be high strength, high early
strength, high workability, low permeability and
high durability for severe service environments,
etc. or combinations thereof. Production and use
of such concrete in the field necessitates high
degree of uniformity between batches and very
stringent quality control.
4.
MATERIALS
4.1.
Cement
may be used as part replacement of Ordinary
Portland Cement with the approval of the
competent authority. Uniform blending with
cement
should
be
ensured
by
having
dedicated facility and complete mechanised
process control at the site to achieve specified
quality.
4.2.1.
Fly ash: Conforming to Grade I of IS:
3812-3. The proportion should not be less than
20 per cent, nor should exceed 35 per cent by mass
of cement.
4.2.2.
Granulated Slag: Ground granulated
slag obtained by grinding granulated slag
conforming to IS: 12089. The proportion should
not be less than 50 per cent, nor should exceed 70
per cent by mass of cement.
4.2.3.
Silica Fume:
Silica fume
is very fine,
non-crystalline SiO^, obtained as a by-product of
Silicon or Ferro-Silicon alloy industries. It should
conform to IS: 15388.
Any of the types of cement as per Table
1
may be used with the approval of the competent
authority.
4,2.
Mineral Admixtures
Any of the following mineral admixtures
Table 1. Types of Cement
4.3.
Admixtures
Chemical admixtures and superplasticisers
conforming
to
IS:9103
may
be
used.

Notes
:
(i)
Use of Portland Pozzolana Cement may be peiinitted only in plain concrete members.
(ii)
Under severe condition of Sulphate Content in subsoil water, special literature on precautions to be
taken with regard to the use of special types of cement with low C^A content may be referred to.
Durability criteria, like, minimum cement content and maximum water cement ratio, etc. should
also be given due consideration.

IRC:SP:70-2005
should be ensured by trials, so that the following
problems are avoided.
•
Large dosage of superplasticiser required
to achieve the desired workability,
•
Excessive retardation of setting,
•
Excessive entrainment of large air bubbles,
•
Unusually rapid stiffening of concrete,
•
Rapid slump loss, and
•
Excessive segregation and bleeding.
4.4.

shall consist of clean, hard, strong, dense, non-
porous, equi-dimensional (i.e., not much flaky or
elongated) and durable pieces of crushed stone,
crushed gravel, natural gravel or a suitable
combination thereof.
The maximum size of the coarse aggregate
should not be greater than;
•
one quarter of the minimum thickness of
the member,
•

Suitable combinations of natural sand and crushed
stone or crushed gravel can be permitted. They
shall not contain dust, lumps,
soft or flaky
particles, mica or any other deleterious materials
in such quantities as would reduce the strength or
durability of concrete. Fine aggregate of Zone 11
or III of IS: 3 83 are preferable.
4.5.

less than 380 kg/ml
4.6.3.
The Cement content excluding any
mineral admixtures shall not exceed 450 kg/m^.
4.6.4.
The water/(cement+all cementitious
materials) ratio should generally not exceed 0.33,
but in no case more than 0.40.
4.6.5.
Workability:
The
concrete
mix
proportions chosen should be such that the
concrete
is of adequate workability for placing
conditions and congestion of reinforcement, to
ensure proper placement without segregation or
honey combing, and thorough compaction.
Suggested ranges of workability of concrete
measured in accordance with IS: 1199 are given
below:

Note* :In the 'Very High' category of workability,
measurement of workability by determination
of flov/ as per IS:9103 will be appropriate.
4.7
Durability
4„7.1.
Concrete should be durable to provide
satisfactory performance in the anticipated
exposure conditions during service. The materials
and mix proportions specified and used, and the
workmanship employed should be such as to
maintain
its integrity and to protect embedded
metal from corrosion.
4.7.2.
One
of
the
main
characteristics
influencing the durability of concrete
is
its
impermeability to the ingress of water, oxygen,
carbon dioxide, chloride, sulphate and other
potentially
deleterious
substances.
Impermeability
is governed by the constituents
and workmanship employed in making the
concrete. A suitably low permeability is achieved
by
having
an
adequate
cement
content,
sufficiently low water-cement ratio, dense
packing of fine particles, by ensuring thorough
compaction of the concrete, and by timely and
adequate curing.
4.7.3.
Total water-soluble sulphate (SO3)
content of the concrete mix, expressed as (SO3)
shall not exceed 4 per cent by mass of cement
used in the mix.
4.7.4.
Total chloride content
in concrete,
expressed as chloride-ion, shall not exceed the
following values by mass of cement used:
Type
Amount (per cent)
Prestressed concrete
0.10
Reinforced concrete
(i)
in severe condition
0.20
of exposure
(ii) in moderate condition
0.30
of exposure
4.8.
Concrete Mix Design
4.8.1.
General: Choice of materials, concrete
mix design and field practices are quite critical,
so that optimum performance can be extracted of
each of the ingredients. The procedure of mix
proportioning of nonnal grades of concrete may
not be adequate. Relationships between the
compressive strength of concrete and water-
cement ratio (or water-cement+cementious
materials
ratio, when part of the cement
is
replaced by mineral admixtures) and between
water content and workability will have to be
established by laboratory trials for the grade of
concrete, the materials to be used, and the water-
reducing efficiency of the supeiplasticiser.
4.8.2.
Target mean strength: The target mean
strength of the mix should be equal
to be
characteristic strength for the grade plus the
current margin.
4.8.2.1. The current margin for a concrete mix
shall be taken as
1 .64 times the standard deviation
of sample
test results taken from
at least 40
separate batches of concrete of nominally similar
proportions produced at
site by the same plant
under similar supervision, over a period exceeding
5 days, but not exceeding 6 months.
4.8.2.2. Where there are insufficient data to
satisfy the above, the target mean strength for the
initial mix design shall be taken as given in Table
3. As soon as the results of samples are available,
actual calculated standard deviation may be used
and the mix designed accordingly.

IRC:SP:70-2005
4.8.3.
Field Trial Mixes: Mix proportions
arrived at by laboratory trials shall, in addition,
be verified
to be
satisfactory under
field
conditions and necessary adjustments made. Field
trial mixes shall be prepared for
all grades of
concrete, using samples of approved materials.
Sampling and testing procedures shall be in
accordance with para 4.1 1.
4.8.3.1. The concreting plant and means of
transportation employed to make trial mixes and
to transport them to representative distances shall
be similar to the corresponding plant and transport
to be used in the works. The optimum sequence
of mixing of ingredients shall be established by
trials. Mixing time may be longer than in normal
grade concrete mixes.
4.8.3.2. The temperature of concrete at the time
of placement
shall not exceed 25°C. The
temperature of concrete at the mixing stage should
be lower, to allow for rise in temperature during
transport. When considerable distance of transport
is involved, particular attention should be paid to
ensure retention of slump
as targeted for
placement.
4.8.4.
Prototype testing: Further mock-up
trails or prototype testing may be carried out to
ensure that the concrete can be satisfactorily
placed and compacted, taking into account the
location
of placement
and
provision
of
reinforcement, and adjustments made in concrete
mix design and/or detailing of reinforcement
accordingly.
4.9.
Production of Concrete
4.9.1.
Batching an mixing: Provisions of
Clause 302.9.1
of IRC:21
shall apply. Fully
automatic, computer controlled batching and
mixing plant shall be used.
4.9.2.
Curing: High Performance Concrete
containing
silica fume
is more cohesive than
normal mixes hence, there is little or no bleeding
and no bleed water to rise to the surface to offset
water lost due to evaporation. Plastic shrinkage
cracking is possible, if curing is not proper. Initial
curing should commences soon after initial setting
of concrete. Concrete should be covered with
moist covers, opaque colour plastic sheets or
suitable curing compound. Final moist curing
should commence after final setting of concrete
and continue for at least 14 days.
4.10. Quality Assurance
In order that the performance of the
completed structure be consistent with the
requirements and assumptions made during the
planning and design, stringent quality assurance
measures shall be taken. The construction should
result in satisfactory strength, serviceability and
long-term durability. In particular,
it should be
aimed to ensure uniformity and to lower the
variability between batches of production, as
evidenced by the standard deviation in test results.
The methods and procedures of Quality
System shall be followed as per the guidelines
contained in IRC:SP-47. Q-4 class of Quality
Assurance shall be adopted for the 'Materials' and
'Workmamship' items.
4.11. Sampling and Testing
Provisions of Clause 302.10 of IRC:21 shall
apply.
4.12. Acceptance Criteria
Provisions of Clause 302. 11 of IRC:21 shall
apply.
4.12.1. Acceptance testing on site shall not be
resticted to tests for compressive strength of
concrete alone. Where durability of concrete is
the main reason for adopting High Performance
Concrete, Rapid Chloride Ion Permeability test
as per ASTM C-1202 or AASHTO T-277 shall
be carried
out. The permissible value of
chloride- ion permeability shall be less than 800
coulombs.
4.12.2.
Additional durability tests, such as. Water
Permeabihty test as per DIN: 1048 Part 5-1991 or
Initial Surface Absorption test as per BS: 1881 Part 5
5



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 18
======================================================================
IRC:SP:70-2005
can also be specified. The permissible values in
such tests shall be decided taking into account
the severity of the exposure conditions.
5.
BASIC PERMISSIBLE STRESSES
IN CONCRETE
The properties and basic permissible stresses
for concrete of grades upto M 60 shall be as given
in Table 9 of IRC:21. For concrete of grades
higher than M 60, properties of concrete,
permissible stresses and design parameters given
in IRC: 18 and IRC:21
will not be applicable.
Appropriate values may be obtained from
specialized literature and/or International Codes
of Practice.
