Introduction
CHAPTER 1 
General Overview on IRC:22-2015
C.1.0	
General Overview
C.1.1	
Introduction
The existing IRC:22, which was published in 1986 by the Indian Roads Congress, 
is the document which gives the standard specifications and code of practices for 
design of road bridges so far as composite construction is concerned. The design 
methodology as have been in practice when this code was last published up to 
recently, mainly suggested the use of Working Stress or Allowable Stress Method 
of design as far as steel construction is concerned.
It is a well-known fact that, design of concrete structures in India had started to use 
the state-of-the-art Limit States Method since 1978. The usefulness of Limit states 
method as far as rationality of design as well as overall economy is concerned, 
has not been taken advantage of, in design of steel structure both in general steel 
construction as well as bridge construction, till recently. It is worthwhile to mention, 
that as far as international scenario is concerned, the Limit States Method have 
been in use for steel design in most of the developed and developing countries of 
the world since the 1970’s. The basic code of design of steel structure for general 
construction in India, which is published by the Bureau of Indian Standards (i.e., 
IS 800) had been using the Allowable Stress Design (ASD) method till the year 
2008, until it was modified to the Limit States Method (LSM) of design and was 
subsequently published in that year. Likewise most of the codes pertaining to 
bridge designs were practicing the Allowable Stress Design method in line with the 
earlier version of IS 800, which was published in 1984.
While IS:800 (whose previous edition was published in 1984 in ASD) was being 
modified to the recently published version (i.e. IS:800 – 2007) of LSM design, parallel 
efforts were being taken up under the purview of the Indian Roads Congress, to 
modify various codes like IRC:22, IRC:24, etc. to this latest design technology. 
IRC:24 deals with design of steel bridges, while IRC:22 provides specification of 
design of composite construction. Finally IRC:22 and IRC:24 have been modified 
by incorporating Limit States Method and have been published by the Indian Roads 
Congress recently. Also various other codes are being modified simultaneously to 
cater to the changes that have taken place over the years to make the design of 
bridges in India at par with the state-of-the-art designs practiced internationally.
This explanatory handbook mainly provides explanations of various provisions as 
laid down in the revised IRC:22-2015 for easy understanding of the practicing design 
engineers and also provides design example to help the engineer in designing 
steel-concrete composite road bridges based on the revised LSM draft of IRC:22.

The loadings, load combinations and various safety factors have been based on 
IRC:6. The nature of load for which the bridge is designed has been considered as 
per recommendations of MoRTH (Ministry of Road transport & Highways).
C.1.2	
Steel in Bridges – General Overview
History of mankind suggests that human communities have always felt the necessity 
of development of infrastructure since long time back in order to aid itself, in its 
endeavour to move for its own development. The primary and most important part 
of infrastructure has been roadways, and one of the most important component 
of roadways are ‘bridges’, which provides link across hindrances like rivers, small 
water bodies, cross roads etc.
General affinity of Bridge engineers in India has long been to go for steel bridges. The 
Howrah Bridge (Rabindra Setu) over river Hooghly is testament to the capabilities of 
Indian engineers. Other bridges, which tell the story of the competence level of Indian 
engineers, include Road cum Rail Bridge over river Ganga near Mokameh in Bihar, 
road-cum-rail Bridge across river Brahmaputra in Guwahati and numerous others.
C.1.3	
Advantage of Steel as Construction Material
While studying the advantages of steel bridges over other materials of constructions 
like mainly the concrete ones (both RCC and PSC), the two main aspects to be 
kept in mind as usual are strength and economy. The lesser depth of steel girder 
in bridge means lower finished height of the working level. This will lead to lesser 
length and height of the approach way, leading to significant savings in overall cost 
of the entire system. Moreover steel usually has a higher strength-to-weight ratio 
leading to lesser dead to live load ratio especially important in longer span lengths. 
A list of advantages of steel intensive bridges has been given below:
	
1)	
As discussed above steel intensive bridges have lesser dead load 
compared to concrete bridges, thus requiring smaller foundations 
(fewer piles) and having lesser seismic demand leading to faster 
construction and enhanced performance during earthquakes, 
especially longer spans.
	
2)	
Steel bridges are constructed with extensive prefabrication leading 
to higher quality control and hence better long-term performance.
	
3)	
Steel intensive construction in general reduces site operations that 
lead to better and integrated planning between factory and site 
operations and reduced space requirements at site causing faster 
construction and lesser imposition on the site environment.
	
4)	
Use of high strength steel in bridges further reduces dead load, 
depth of structure and eases transportation and erection causing 
lesser overall cost of facilities
	
5)	
Structural systems for continuous steel structures like continuous 
girders are easier to accomplish. This will reduce the number of 
bearings and increase durability.

6)	
With the advent of modern durable corrosion resisting paints, the 
painting cycle is fixed or predictable which helps in better planning 
and resource allocation.
	
7)	
Finally and not the least important is that, elements of a steel 
intensive system are re-usable and can be easily dismantled and 
steel re-use leading to lesser wastage.
C.1.4	
Steel – Concrete Composite Construction
The global resurgence of steel in construction both in bridges and in other structures 
has in no way lessened the importance of concrete as a construction material. It 
has been widely acknowledged by civil engineering experts across the world that 
appropriate combinations of the steel and concrete, utilizing the distinctly different 
merits of the two materials, is the best possible solution for a structural problem. As 
a result bridge engineering mostly in road bridges and flyovers, is moving towards 
more extensive use of steel-concrete composite structural systems utilizing the 
strength of the two materials synergistically, especially in urban areas, as for 
grade separators in roads. Although the concept, which utilizes the high tensile 
strength to weight of steel and compressive strength and cost of concrete has been 
extensively used in many parts of the world, it is being used only recently in India, 
especially in the urban roadway bridges. 
In conventional construction, concrete slabs rest over steel beams and are 
supported by them. Under load these two components act independently and a 
relative slip occurs at the interface if there is no connection between them. With the 
help of a deliberate and appropriate connection provided between the beam and 
the concrete slab, the slip between them can be eliminated. In this case the steel 
beam and the slab act as a “composite beam” and their action is similar to that 
of a monolithic Tee beam. Though steel and concrete are the most commonly used 
materials for composite beams, other materials such as pre-stressed concrete and 
timber can also be used. 
Various sectional configurations including I-sections and box sections have been 
found to be suitable for various types of Bridge spans. In urban areas, for flyovers 
acting as grade separators, under various considerations it is found that box girders 
are more appropriate vis-à-vis I-girders for the obligatory span(s) and the reverse is 
true for the shorter approach spans. Live examples for this are flyovers at Mayapuri 
and Andrewsganj intersections along the Ring Road in Delhi, Bridges on Metro Rail 
line at Delhi and flyovers in Kolkata under the Kolkata Urban Development Projects.
C.1.5	
Advantage of Steel-Concrete Composite Construction
There are many advantages associated with steel concrete composite construction. 
Some of these are listed below:
	
1)	
The most synergetic utilisation of steel and concrete is achieved.
	
2)	
Keeping the span and loading unaltered; a more economical steel 
section (in terms of depth and weight) is adequate in composite

construction 
compared 
with 
conventional 
non-composite 
construction.
	
3)	
As the depth of beam reduces, the construction depth reduces, 
resulting in enhanced headroom, reduced approach span lengths.
	
4)	
Because of its larger stiffness, composite beams have less 
deflection than steel beams acting alone.
	
5)	
Composite construction provides efficient arrangement to cover 
large column free space.
	
6)	
Composite construction is amenable to “fast-track” construction 
because of using rolled steel and pre-fabricated components, 
rather than cast-in-situ concrete.
	
7)	
Steel beam sections encased in concrete have improved fire 
resistance and corrosion a lot and are very important in Bridges.
C.1.6	
Design Approach for Steel – Concrete Composite Girders
Steel-concrete composite girders has been widely adopted for moderately longer 
spans in urban flyovers, such as the mandatory or obligatory spans in the form of 
box girders and other approach spans in the form of plated I–girders, as discussed 
earlier. Though there is no dedicated code of practice for design of steel-concrete 
composite box girder in India, it is possible to design the same using the provisions 
of the Indian composite codes and theory of the behaviour of box girders. It is 
relevant to note here that appropriate codes/design guidelines for steel-concrete 
composite box girders are under preparation by the Indian Roads Congress.
The central spans of these flyovers or bridges may be designed as simply supported, 
continuous or continuous under live load. Component lengths for shop fabrication 
should be the maximum possible, consistent with the delivery and site restrictions 
to reduce the amount of on-site assembly. The available length of the plates/rolled 
sections normally defines the maximum length for road delivery without restrictions, 
although longer lengths can be transported by special arrangements.
A minimum number of shop butt welds should be used consistent with plate sizes 
available. The decision whether to introduce thickness changes within a fabricated 
length should take into account the cost of butt welds compared with the potential 
for cost of material saving. Design procedure should ensure maximum shop welding 
and minimum site welding.
Curved bridges in plan may readily be formed using straight fabricated girders, with 
direction changes introduced at each site splice. If required however, steel girders 
can also be curved in plan. For smaller radii, curved girders are necessary to avoid 
the effects of long cantilevers. Skew and plan tapered bridges may also be built 
in steel-concrete composite. Ideally, plan layout should be as simple as possible.
For road bridges and flyovers, various options of Plated I-girders or box girders can 
be adopted depending on the length or span, the nature of the span i.e. whether 
spans are continuous or simply supported the number of lanes, and the loading.

These options further vary, in terms of transverse spacing of girders or complete 
separation of two adjacent lanes by means of expansion joints and providing two 
different sets of transverse beams for the two adjacent lanes of roads.
C.1.6.1	
Design methodology
The design loading of Steel-Concrete Composite Girders follows the sequence 
of construction. The girders are designed for both construction stage loading 
considering wet concrete at which stage only steel section carries the load and 
final composite stage loading with hardened concrete. Since hardened concrete 
increases the bending and torsional stiffness of the girder, the sequence of 
construction becomes vital. As mentioned earlier, till date only IRC:22 is available 
in India to design standard I-girders with concrete deck as composite bridge 
and there is no specific guideline or code for design for box girders in India. As 
mentioned earlier one such guideline is now under preparation by the Indian Road 
Congress or IRC. For the time being the Euro Codes and British Codes of Practice 
are generally followed for the design of these types of box girders.
The current Indian code IRC:22 uses Limit States Method (LSM) of design. As per 
this method, the Ultimate Limit State (ULS) and the Serviceability Limit State (SLS) 
must be satisfied by the design. In practice ULS generally governs the design, 
exception being the checking at SLS for slip of HSFG bolted splices, deflection 
check, design of shear connectors and design for fatigue. 
IRC:22 encourages the use of steel limit states design because:
1.	
It is more rational than the existing working stress method which can be 
explained by the following few examples:
	
a)	
Unlike WSM, LSM allows different buckling curves for direct 
compression in a section (i.e. curve a, b, c, d) for different 
classification of sections, such as Plastic, Compact, Semi-compact 
and Slender sections.
	
b)	
For sections under bending, the reduction in permissible bending 
moment due to lateral torsional buckling is different for rolled and 
welded section, unlike the existing working stress method.
	
c)	
Usually plated girders are used for Bridges, which can be so 
selected, that the girder is either “Plastic” or “Compact” and 
consequently, limit states design results in the use of lighter 
members both for plated as well as rolled sections, since plastic 
moment capacity is usually the governing design capacity, for the 
ULS check, unlike the working stress method.
	
d)	
Limit states method allows different partial loads factor individually 
for different types of dead loads, live loads, etc., under different 
load combinations which result in the most probable load action on 
the section under consideration.
	
e)	
In LSM, for different materials of construction, i.e. structural steel, 
reinforced concrete, reinforcements, etc., different partial safety

IRC:SP:120-2018
8
factors against each material are attributed to calculate the design 
strength of a member in terms of axial force, bending moment, 
shear force, etc. thus rendering it more correct and rational.
	
f)	
For serviceability design consideration, separate design checks 
against stress, deflection, etc. under different types of load 
combinations are specified in LSM.
2)	
Workmanship requirements, including tolerances, are rationalized.
To determine the design forces and stresses, elastic analysis is generally done using 
the gross section (i.e. not considering the effect of shear lag or effective width). The 
stresses generated in the concrete deck are in proportion to the modulus of elasticity 
of concrete to steel (i.e. modular ratio). For sustained loading like imposed loads due 
to finishes/bridge furnishings, the effects of creep is generally taken into account in 
calculation of stresses. This is generally taken care of by increasing the modular 
ratio by creep factor. Since, it is quite evident that the steel section alone (before 
hardening of the concrete) is much weaker compared to the composite section 
(after hardening of concrete), it needs to be checked for stresses due to erection 
and construction loadings. Therefore, as stated earlier, construction sequence plays 
an important role in the design process of the steel-concrete composite girder, since 
the contribution of concrete slab is available only after hardening. There are two 
types of construction of steel-concrete composite girders:
	
•	
Propped Construction: - The steel girder is propped at regular 
intervals along their lengths from below during casting of concrete 
deck slab. This propping is not removed till the hardening of the 
concrete. All the load coming on the bridge super-structure, which 
includes self-weight of the steel sections are resisted by the 
composite section.
	
•	
Un-propped Construction: - In this type of construction the steel 
structure after erection is not propped from below during the casting 
of the concrete deck slab. Usually, the deck shuttering is supported 
from the erected steel structure itself. Hence, the steel structure 
alone has to take all the dead load, including its self-weight, weight 
of wet concrete, services loads and erection loads. To reduce the 
effective length of the top flanges of the girders against lateral 
torsional buckling, lateral bracing systems are provided at the top 
flange level. These bracings also help in transferring all horizontal 
loads on the top flange during RCC casting to the end support of 
the steel girders. Composite action is available after hardening of 
the concrete (to resist the live loads and other imposed loads). 
However, at the Limit States, due to redistribution on the inelastic 
range of stresses, the total dead and live loads are taken to be 
resisted by composite sections.
Continuous Composite Girders are widely used for girders across the globe. 
Two-span continuous units are not the most efficient system because of very 
high negative moments. Three-span and four-span units are more preferable, but 



======================================================================

IRC:SP:120-2018
9
not always possible. Units over four-spans are not recommended. A good span 
arrangement for three-span or four-span units is to have the interior spans 40 to 60 
per cent longer than the end spans. If the end spans become too short compared 
to the interior spans, uplift can be a problem at the girder ends. On the other hand, 
if the end spans are too long in relation to the interior spans a disproportionate 
amount of steel will be required for the end spans.
C.1.6.2	
Code provisions
There are various code provisions including loading and design procedures, which 
provides the basic guidelines for the design of a bridge girder for all bridges made 
of concrete, steel or composite. As indicated earlier, IRC:6 (Standard Specifications 
and Code of Practice for Road Bridges, Section: II – Loads and Load Combinations 
deals with highway loading.
Other than IRC:6, Indian Roads Congress or IRC has different other codes on 
highway bridges such as IRC:24, providing stipulations for steel bridges IRC:112 
for concrete bridges and IRC:22 as being discussed in this book, for composite 
bridges.
C.1.6.3	
Transportation and erection of composite box girders
A very interesting aspect of composite girder design is the fact that sometimes 
some of its design parameters are determined or considered based on its actual 
handling requirements or facilities available in the fabrication shop and erection 
site. This comes out of the fact that the steel girder needs to be transported from 
the fabrication facility and erected to final position. Many a times, proportioning 
of the girders is governed by erection methodologies and stresses arising out of 
them. Some usual practices are worth discussing in this context.
	
•	
Splicing Length: - The splicing length of a steel girder for large 
spans are dependent on factors like the length of plates commonly 
available with the manufacturers and suppliers, on the transportable 
length of the girder through the route from the fabrication yard to 
the erection site and the capacity of available cranes for lifting 
at site. Usually in Indian conditions maximum available length of 
plates and transportable length of the girders match each other 
quite closely (about 13 m). The capacity of cranes available for 
handling at sites plays an important role and can become a limiting 
factor.
	
•	
Permanent Shuttering: - Casting of the deck slab is an important 
stage in the construction of the composite girder, and for casting 
of these slabs for bridges over rivers, or even over road crossings, 
proper formwork is absolutely necessary. To provide separate 
staging to support the formwork over flowing water bodies or 
rivers is a very difficult and costly proposition. Similarly for bridges 
over road crossings staging from bottom will lead to obstruction to 
traffic flow below. For these cases precast concrete planks, steel

IRC:SP:120-2018
10
deck plates, etc. may be resorted to as a left-in-place shuttering. 
Precast planks tend to increase the total thickness of the deck 
with considerable thickness of non-participating concrete deck. 
For road bridges the most suitable formwork is in the form of 
removable stiffened steel plate supported between the webs of 
two parallel longitudinal girders.
C.1.6.4	
Durability consideration
Natural weathering or corrosion of steel is the most common phenomenon 
observed, which leads ultimately to reduction in the thickness of the steel elements. 
Painting the steel with corrosion resistant paints can protect against corrosion most 
effectively.
Zinc based primers are known to provide good corrosion resistance and these 
primers are necessarily provided after shop fabrication. During transportation and 
erection, proper care needs to be taken so that this coat of primers does not get 
damaged. If high strength friction grip bolts are used for site splicing, the location of 
the same needs to be left un-painted for development of adequate friction between 
the overlapping plates.
If there are minor scratches, which are visible only after erection, they may be 
corrected by touch-up with the same primer. Micacious Iron Oxide based paints are 
now available in India and it is said that these paints are the most effective solution 
for corrosion protection under humid and acidic conditions. This type of paint may 
be used as an intermediate coat to the structure at site. As the final coat, polymer 
based acrylic paint or high build chlorinated rubber paint of required shade are 
generally prescribed which help to increase the weathering resistance.
Composition of the painting also includes deciding upon the Dry Film Thickness 
(DFT) of individual coats as well as the total paint coat. This depends on the exact 
condition of the environment the structure will be exposed to as well as desired 
duration of protection. Usually the primers are 20µm to 25µm thick while the 
intermediate coats are 75µm to 85µm thick. The final coat should be around 75µm.
C.1.6.5	
Vibration
The effect of excessive vibration of a bridge superstructure due to imposed 
loading is a serviceability limit states. Composite decks are usually too stiff to be 
susceptible to wind-excited oscillations, which are not considered in the design of 
steel-concrete composite design.
The dynamic effects of highway loading are assumed to be adequately covered 
by the impact factors that are included in the normal loads specified in IRC:6. 
This is consistent with the conclusion reached from a study of steel bridges in the 
United States which states that “there is no evidence of bridge motions producing 
discomfort of occupants of moving vehicles, so there appears to be no need for 
limits on deflections or accelerations of bridges which do not carry pedestrian traffic 
under normal conditions.

Definitions Pertaining to Steel-Concrete Composite Bridge  
Girders and Limit States Design Methodology

General 	
Cl. 600.0
C.2.1	
Scope of IRC:22 	
Cl. 600.1 & 	
	
	
Cl. 600.2
This code applies to all constructions in bridges which are mainly steel-concrete 
composite in nature as have been emphasized in the first two clauses of the code, 
i.e. clause 600.1 and 600.2. These clauses clearly defines the scope of the code 
along with the definition of the scope as mentioned in the above two clauses.
This code is not applicable to box girder bridges. It is pertinent to mention that a 
separate design guideline for box girder is under formulation, which will totally cater 
to the design of steel-concrete composite box girder bridges. The present revision 
of IRC:22 include simply supported and continuous bridges and is based on the 
limit states method of design. Clause 600.2 gives a definition of the type of bridge 
under consideration, which can be classified as steel-concrete composite girders. 
It clearly states that a steel-concrete composite construction is one in which steel 
girders are used as the primary members and cast-in-situ reinforced concrete and/
or pre-cast concrete slab with necessary grouting as the deck.
C.2.2	
Terminology & Definitions and Symbols 	
Cl. 600.3 & 
	
	
Cl. 600.4
The clause relevant for definitions of terminologies which are associated with design 
of steel-concrete composite girders as well as Limit States Method of Design have 
been represented in Clause 600.3 for easy understanding of the designer. 
All the symbols used in the code other than those used for load categorization as 
per clause 601.3 has been illustrated in Clause 600.4.
C.2.3	
Limit States Method – Definitions & Applicability 	
Cl. 601
According to this method a structure or part of it is considered unfit for use when 
it exceeds the limit states, beyond which it infringes one of the criteria governing 
its performance or use. Thus it may be stated that, the probability of operating 
conditions not reaching failure conditions forms the basis of “Limit States Design”.
A Civil Engineering Design must ensure that the structures and facilities which 
have been designed are (i) fit for their purpose (ii) safe and (iii) economical and 
durable. Thus, safety is one of the paramount factors governing a design. However, 
it is difficult to assess at the design stage how safe a proposed design will actually 
be consistent with economy. There is, in fact, a great deal of uncertainty about 
the many factors, which influence both safety and economy. Firstly, there is a 
natural variability in the material strengths and secondly, it is impossible to predict 



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:120-2018
12
the maximum loading, which a bridge may be subjected to during its life. Thus 
uncertainties affecting the safety of a structure are due to
	
•	
Uncertainty about loading.
	
•	
Uncertainty about member strength variability of material strength 
and member dimension.
	
•	
Uncertainty of behaviour and design equations.
These uncertainties together make it impossible for a designer to guarantee that a 
structure will be absolutely safe. All that the designer could ensure is that the risk 
of failure is extremely small, despite the uncertainties.
An illustration of the statistical meaning of safety is given in Fig. 2.1. Let us consider 
a structural component (say, a beam) designed to carry a given nominal load. The 
actual resistance (R.M.) itself is not a fixed quantity, due to variations in material 
strengths and member dimensions that might occur between nominally same 
elements. The actual resistance of these elements can be expected to vary as a 
consequence. The statistical distribution of these member strengths (or resistances) 
can be as sketched in curve (a). The design strength is often designated as the 
strength at the lower tail with 5% exclusion limit. The characteristic design strength 
is taken as the highest load in the upper tail with 5% exclusion limit.
Fig. 2.1 Statistical Meaning of Safety
Similarly, the variation in the maximum loads and therefore load effects (such as 
bending moment) which different structural elements (all nominally the same) might 
encounter in their service life can have a distribution shown in (b). The uncertainty 
here is both due to variability of the loads applied to the structure, and also due to 
the variability of the load distribution through the structure.
Clearly the abscissa values over which the line curves overlap are possible cases 
of failure. In order to ensure reliability and safety, the design strength is kept larger 
than the design load by increasing the loads with load factor to obtain design load 
and decreasing the resistance using strength factor to obtain design strength and 
ensuring that the design strength is greater than the design load.

C.2.3.1	
General methodology of analysis 	
Cl. 601.1
As clearly stated normal elastic method is valid for analysis of the structure after 
considering load history, sequence of concrete casting and development of 
composite strength. In case of either propped or un-propped construction, the load 
sharing takes place as described in section C.1.6.1.
C.2.3.2	
Limit states	
Cl. 601.2
Limit States are the various conditions in which a structure would be considered 
to have failed to fulfil the purpose for which it is built. In general two cases of limit 
states are considered at the design stage and these are listed in Table 2.1.
Table 2.1 Types of Limit States
Ultimate Limit State
Serviceability Limit State
•	 Strength (yield, buckling)
•	 Stress in Steel and Concrete and Steel 
•	 Stability against overturning 
and sway
•	 Deflection 
•	 Fracture due to fatigue
•	 Concrete crack width 
•	 Brittle Fracture
•	 Vibration
•	 Slip at the interface between steel and concrete
•	 Fatigue checks (including reparable damage 
due to fatigue
•	 Corrosion
“Ultimate Limit States” (ULS) are those catastrophic failure states, which require 
a larger reliability in order to reduce the probability of its occurrence to a very low 
level.
“Serviceability Limit State” (SLS) refers to the limits on acceptable performance 
of the structure. Not all these limits can be covered by structural calculations. For 
example, corrosion is covered by specifying forms of protection (like painting) and 
brittle fracture is covered by material specifications, which ensure that steel is 
sufficiently ductile. Serviceability Limit States are the states at which, either the 
stress in structural steel, or the deflection of the structure, or concrete crack width 
reaches the prescribed limit. SLS also refers to the states when the slip at the 
interface between steel and concrete becomes excessive or even when vibration 
becomes excessive specially at overhanging foot or cycle paths.
“Fatigue Limit States” is the state at which stress range due to application of fatigue 
vehicle load, reaches prescribed limit corresponding to the number of design load 
cycles and configuration of fabrication detail.
C.2.3.3	
Design loads (design actions and their combinations)	
Cl. 601.3
For load factors and load combinations references have to be made to IRC:6.

C.2.3.4	
Material strength & partial safety factor for material	
Cl. 601.4
In Limit States Method of Design, the factored loads, in different combinations, are 
applied to the structure to determine the load effects. The latter are then compared 
with the design strength of the elements. This is expressed mathematically as:
The effects of

Where,
γL =	
partial factor for loads that takes account of inaccuracies in assessment 
of loads, stress distribution and construction corresponding to the limit 
states (Refer. Tables of IRC:6 as indicated above)
γm =	
factors that take into account, uncertainty in material strength and 
quality, and manufacturing tolerances.
Qk =	
specified nominal load or load effects.
Rm =	
member/material strength.
The partial load factor γL for a particular load varies depending upon the load 
combination. These factors have been indicated in IRC:6. The design strength of 
an element is reduced by the factor γm. Yield strength fy of steel and characteristic 
strength fck of concrete with appropriate partial safety factors as mentioned below 
in Table – 2.2 (Table – 1 of IRC:22) are to be used for assessment of strength:

CHAPTER 3 
Major Design Provisions with Explanations
C.3.0	
Design for Ultimate Limit States	
Cl.603
A typical composite girder section is as given in Fig. 1 of the code. The location of 
the neutral axis and the permissible moment corresponding to various locations of 
NA has been discussed in Annexure - I of the code.
C.3.1	
General Conditions of Design for Ultimate Limit States	
Cl. 603.1
As clearly explained in the stipulation itself, elastic theory assuming concrete to be 
un-cracked and un-reinforced shall be used for analysis of the bridge.
	
a)	
Negative Moments:
	
	
Negative moments over internal supports should be checked 
against section strength assuming steel girder acting integrally 
with concrete (considering uncracked and un-reinforced).
	
	
For calculating stresses, when concrete in tension has cracked due to 
negative moment, mainly at the internal supports of continuous girders, 
the composite sections for both long-term and short-term composite 
moments shall consist of the steel section and the longitudinal 
reinforcement within an effective width as discussed in the code  
(Cl. 603.2) of the slab.
	
b)	
Positive Moments:
	
	
For continuous girders, provided adjacent spans do not differ 
appreciably, positive maximum moments in the adjacent spans 
should be increased by 40 fct / fck per cent for checking of strength 
without decreasing support moment. This provision gives partial 
recognition to the philosophy of plastic design.
	
	
For calculating stresses due to positive bending moments, 
the composite section shall consist of the steel section and the 
transformed area of the effective width of the concrete slab. The 
modular ratio to be considered for conversion from effective 
concrete area to equivalent steel area is to be taken different for 
long-term and short-term forces and is discussed later.
C.3.1.1	
Section classifications	
Cl. 603.1.1
The plate elements of a cross section may buckle locally due to compressive 
stresses. The local buckling can be avoided before the limit state is achieved by 
limiting the width to thickness ratio of each element of a cross-section, subjected to 
compression due to axial force, moment or shear.
When elastic analysis is used along with elastic design, the member shall be 
capable of developing the yield stress under compression without local buckling. 
When section is designed to resist moments due to elastic analysis by reaching 



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:120-2018
16
plastic moment then the compressive yield stress shall be maintained until the 
full section plasticise. On the above basis, four classes of sections are defined as 
follows:
Class 1: Plastic – Plastic cross-sections are those which can develop their full-
plastic moment Mp and allow sufficient rotation at or above this moment so that 
redistribution of bending moments can take place in the structure until complete 
failure mechanism is formed. The width to thickness ratio of plate elements shall 
be less than that specified under class 1 (Plastic), in Fig. 5 & Table 2 of IRC:22.
Class 2: Compact – Cross sections, which can develop plastic moment of 
resistance, before local buckling under compression initiates are compact sections. 
The width to thickness ratio of plate elements shall be less than that specified 
under class 2 (Compact), in Fig. 5 & Table 2 of IRC:22.
Class 3: Semi-Compact – Cross sections, in which the extreme fibre in compression 
can reach yield stress, but cannot, develop the plastic moment of resistance, due 
to local buckling. The width to thickness ratio of plate elements shall be less than 
that specified under class 3 (Semi-Compact), but greater than that specified under 
class 2 (Compact), in Fig. 5 & Table 2 of IRC:22.
Class 4: Slender – Cross sections in which the elements buckle locally even 
before reaching yield stress. The width to thickness ratio of plate elements shall be 
greater than that specified under class 3 (Semi - Compact), in Fig. 5 & Table 2 of 
IRC:22. In such cases, the effective sections for design shall be calculated either 
by following the provisions of IS:801 to account for the post-local-buckling strength 
or by deducting width of the compression plate element in excess of the semi-
compact section limit.
Section classifications can be best illustrated by the Moment-Rotation curve as 
given below:
Fig. 3.1 Section Classification based on Moment-Rotation Characteristics

C.3.1.2	
General rules of composite sections classifications	
Cl. 603.1.2
	
1)	
A composite section should be classified according to the least 
favourable class of steel elements in compression.
	
	
-----This takes into account the first possible mode of buckling due 
to compressive forces in any internal element of the section.
	
2)	
A steel compression element restrained by its connection to a reinforced 
concrete element may be placed in a more favourable class.
	
	
-----With provision of proper shear connector between the steel 
element and the concrete, buckling of the steel compression flange 
element may be avoided by the restraint given by the more solid 
concrete connection.
	
3)	
Plastic stress distribution should be used for section classification 
except at the boundary between class 2 and 3 where the elastic 
stress distribution should be used taking into account sequence of 
construction and the effects of creep and shrinkage.
	
	
-----Since the boundary condition of these two classes suggest 
that after attaining the elastic stress the member would start to 
buckle internally.
	
4)	
For classification, design values of strength of materials should 
be taken. Concrete in tension should be neglected. The stress 
distribution should be established for the gross cross-section of 
the steel web and the effective flanges.
	
	
-----This is self-explanatory, since the stress distribution diagram 
of the gross section considering equivalent area of the concrete 
flange will give the actual idea as to the location of the Neutral Axis 
and the total moment carrying capacity of the cross section.
	
5)	
Welded mesh under tension should not be included in the effective 
section unless it has sufficient ductility to withstand fracture when 
embedded in concrete.
	
	
-----This provision caters to the requirement of negative bending 
moment of a composite section mostly at the internal support of a 
continuous girder.
	
6)	
In global analysis for stages of construction, account should be 
taken of the class of steel section at the particular stage considered.
	
	
-----For example, the top flange of a composite girder acts as 
compression element with no restraint during construction stage 
but acts as a compressive element with full restraint from concrete 
cover slab after composite action has set in.
C.3.1.3	
Classification of composite section without concrete encasement	
Cl. 603.1.3
	
1)	
A steel compression flange, which is restrained against buckling 
by effective attachment to a concrete slab by shear connectors, 
may be assumed to be in class 1 if the spacing of the connector is 
in accordance with 606.9.



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:120-2018
18
	
	
-----Provisions for maximum spacing of shear connectors are 
maintained to ensure shear connection between steel and concrete 
and thus proper composite action of the cross section.
	
2)	
Other steel flanges and webs in compression in composite girders 
should be classified on the basis of width to thickness ratios (width 
and thickness of individual elements shown in Fig. 5 of IRC:22) and 
proneness to local buckling. Accordingly sections are categorized 
in three groups as indicated in Table 2 of IRC:22.
	
3)	
Cross-sections with webs in Class 3 and flanges in Class 1 or 2 
may be treated as an effective cross-section in Class 2 with an 
effective web in accordance with Fig. 4a of IRC:22.
	
4)	
For Slender Webs Fig. 4b of IRC:22 gives the effective section.
C.3.1.4	
Types of elements	
Cl. 603.1.4
The elements of a section have been classified into three type’s namely internal 
elements, outstand elements and tapered elements. These have been defined 
individually and explained based on the local buckling criteria of each element. 
The definitions along with the examples given in the code are self-explanatory with 
respect to the limiting width to thickness ratio of each element as given in Fig. 5 
and Table 2 of IRC:22.
C.3.2	
Effective Width of Concrete Slab	
Cl. 603.2
A composite beam acts with the concrete slab as its flange. The bending stress in 
the concrete flange is found to vary along the breadth of the flange as in Fig. 3.2, 
due to the shear lag effect. This phenomenon is taken into account by replacing the 
actual breadth of flange (B) with an effective breadth (beff), such that the area FGHIJ 
nearly equals the area ACDE. Research based on elastic theory has shown that 
the ratio of the effective breadth of slab to actual breadth (beff/B) is a function of the 
type of loading, support condition, and the section under consideration. For design 
purpose a portion of the beam span (as given in Clause 603.2.1 and 603.2.2) is 
taken as the effective breadth of the slab in the composite beam.

C.3.2.2	
Effective width of continuous girder	
Cl. 603.2.2
Effective width for continuous girders is same as that for simply supported girders. 
The only difference is that the effective length required for width calculation varies 
between end span and interior span and also for continuous supports. Effective 
length required for width calculation varies between end span and interior span

distribution. The effective length to be considered is as given in Fig. 3.4 given 
below.

C.3.2.3	
Effective cross section for strength calculation	
Cl. 603.2.3
Since concrete is strong in compression and steel in tension, for positive moment 
under simply supported condition, full compression in concrete flange at top and 
full tension in bottom steel flange is considered. The contribution of longitudinal 
reinforcement in slab is neglected since concrete itself contributes enormously to 
compression.
Similarly, in continuous girders at supports, the concrete at slab top is neglected 
since it is weak and cracks in tension. Contribution of longitudinal reinforcement 
within the effective width in concrete slab along with the structural steel section 
may be considered in determining the design moment capacity of the section at 
the support.

Analysis of Structures

C.3.3.1	
Elastic analysis	
Cl. 603.3.1
Individual members shall be assumed to remain elastic under the action of the 
factored design loads for all limit states. The effect of haunch or any variation of 
the cross-section along the axis of a member shall be considered, and where 
significant, shall be taken into account in the determination of the member 
stiffness.
In the first-order elastic analysis, the equilibrium of the frame in the un-deformed 
geometry is considered, the changes in the geometry of the frame due to the 
loading are not accounted for, and changes in the effective stiffness of the members 
due to axial force are neglected. The effects of these on the first-order bending 
moments shall be considered for design using methods of moment amplification 
using appropriate amplification factor. However, for stability of a bridge as a whole, 
ultimate limit states as per provision or IRC:6 need to be followed.
As indicated in the clause the design strength of a section under factored load may 
be determined as per the stipulation given in Annexure I or II of IRC:22.

C.3.3.2	
Plastic analysis	
Cl. 603.3.2
	
The clause itself is self-explanatory.
C.3.3.3	
Design of structure 	
Cl. 603.3.3
The sections of a girder as discussed earlier (section, C.3.1.1) need to be classified 
as plastic, compact, or semi-compact based on the local buckling criteria. This 
depends on the b/t or d/t ratio of the individual elements of the section.
	
•	
The development of the composite action depends on the load 
history of the structure, which is also a function of the nature of all 
the types of load that may occur on the structure during its design 
period. Thus, an appropriate value of Modular Ratio, m, needs to be 
considered at each stage of loading and stresses and deflections 
are to be taken as the summation of values of successive stage.
	
•	
The effective width for each stage needs to be calculated based 
on the appropriate modular ratio as applicable for that stage of 
loading as per section C.4.3 (Clause 604.3 of IRC:22).	
C.3.3.3.1	 Design of structure [effect of lateral buckling on moment]	
Cl. 603.3.3.1
	
1)	
At construction stage, the top flange may buckle laterally closer to 
mid span in both simply supported and continuous girders. This 
is due to the fact that top flange is not laterally supported during 
construction stage before hardening of concrete, unless separate 
lateral bracings are provided. After the concrete hardens, the top 
flange becomes laterally supported by the hardened concrete.
	
2)	
At construction and composite stage, in the bottom flange closer to 
support in continuous girders has the same issue as mid span as 
discussed above.
At the construction stage the effect of lateral buckling on the bottom flange in a 
continuous girder shall be taken care of by considering the girder as a cantilever 
up to the point of inflection from the support. 
C.3.3.3.2	 Design against vertical shear	
Cl. 603.3.3.2
Design against vertical shear should ensure basically that the factored design 
shear force, V should be less than the design shear strength of the girder, which 
has been given by the equation,
V ≤	
Vd, where Vd = Design shear strength = Vn/γmo
Vn =	
Nominal shear strength which can be governed by plastic shear 
resistance or resistance to shear buckling

Av is the shear area, which is discussed in detail in this clause and needs no further 
elaboration, and fyw is the yield strength of weld.
Shear Buckling Resistance
There are two methods for determination of shear buckling resistance.
	
1)	
Simple post critical method: This method can be used for I-sections 
with or without transverse stiffeners but having transverse stiffeners 
of the web at the supports
	
	
Vn = Nominal shear strength = Vcr = shear force corresponding top 
web buckling
	
	
Where, Vcr = Av.τb
	
	
The shear stress corresponding to web buckling, τb is determined 
as discussed elaborately in this particular clause of the code.
	
2)	
Tension field method: This method may be used for webs with 
intermediate transverse stiffeners in addition to transverse 
stiffeners at the supports, provided that adjacent panels or end 
posts provide anchorage for the tension fields. However it should 
be used only when c/d ≥ 1.0,
	
	
Where, c is the clear spacing between transverse stiffeners and d 
is the depth of the web.
	
	
However, when the transverse stiffeners are widely spaced, the 
tension field method becomes over-conservative. Therefore, it is 
not recommended for use where, c/d > 3.0.
	
	
Vn = Nominal shear strength = Vtf
	
	
Where, Vtf = [Av.τb + 0.9wtf.tw.fy.sinø] ≤ Vp
	
	
The steps for determining the value of Vtf, has been discussed in 
detail in the code and it needs no further elaboration.
C.3.3.3.3	 Reduction of bending stress under high shear force	
Cl. 603.3.3.3
The external shear ‘V’ varies along the longitudinal axis ‘x’ of the beam with bending 
moment as V = dM/dX. While the beam is in the elastic stage, the internal shear 
stresses τ, which resist the external shear V, can be written as,
It
VQ


 
Where, V is the shear force at the section, I is the moment of inertia of the entire 
cross section about the neutral axis, Q is the moment about neutral axis of the area 
that is beyond the fibre at which τ is calculated and ‘t’ is the thickness of the portion 
at which τ is calculated.

Design for Serviceability Limit States 	
Cl.604
C.4.1	
General Conditions for Serviceability Check	
Cl.604.1
As discussed earlier, deflection, vibration, and stress check, etc. are the major 
serviceability checks. Normal elastic analysis to be adopted for finding out design 
moments and stresses under various load combinations and load factors as 
indicated through Clause 601.3. Concrete is to be assumed as unreinforced and 
un-cracked, when under compression. Concrete under tension at supports of 
continuous beams have to be investigated for state of stress to decide whether 
cracked or uncracked conditions need to be assumed
C.4.1.1

Cl.604.1.1
Method of construction controls the stress and strain in the constituents of composite 
construction.

Propped construction
Though the difference in the above two methods of construction does not, affect 
the ultimate limit load, but the intermediate stresses in individual constituents of 
the composite construction varies for different loading conditions which have been 
elaborated in the above clause.
C.4.2	
Negative Moments	
Cl.604.2
Check for negative moment needs to be done as mentioned in section C.3.1, where 
it has been discussed in detail.
C.4.3	
Stresses and Deflections	
Cl.604.3
For composite girders, to check for serviceability against stresses and deflection 
the width of concrete effective as compression flange is a function of the modular 
ratio, m, which is different for short term loading effect (live and impact load) and 
permanent loading (dead Load and super imposed dead load). The value of m, for 
short term and long term effect has been elaborated in the clause.
The long-term values include the effect of creep, shrinkage for which no separate 
calculation may be needed. Final stresses and deflection is to be worked out 
separately at each stage of load history with relevant modular ratios and section 
modulus and then added together.
C.4.3.1	
Limiting stresses for serviceability check

C.4.3.2	
Limit of deflection and camber	
604.3.2
Limiting deflection under the effect of short-term loading like live and impact load 
only is 1/800 of the span. In case of all loads taken together including dead load, 
super-imposed dead load, live load and Impact load, the total deflection of the 
girder shall not exceed 1/600 of span. Provision of suitable camber to offset the 
deflection against permanent loadings is always admissible as mentioned in the 
above clause. If camber is suitably provided then deflection should be limited 
considering the live and impact load only.
C.4.4	
Control of Cracking in Concrete	
604.4
As required in the clause, the measures for control of cracking of concrete slab in 
the negative moment region should be suitably adopted. Minimum reinforcement 
for concrete in tension for crack control shall be adopted as per clause 12.3.3 of 
IRC:112. Crack width calculation as well as limiting crack width shall be as per 
clause 12.3.4 and 12.3.2 of IRC:112.

CHAPTER 5 
Design for Fatigue Limit States
C.5.0	
Design for Fatigue Limit	
605.0
The concept of stress range has been introduced for the first time in this code 
in tune with whatever has been introduced in code of practice or general steel 
construction (i.e. IS:800). The existing practice of adopting stress ratio concept as 
per IS:1024 thus become null and void as per this concept.
C.5.1	
General	
605.1
The term FATIGUE is inherently associated with structures, which experience 
variation in stresses in their cross section due to loads, which occur intermittently 
like in bridge girders. These loads may occur on a regular or fixed pattern like 
vibratory loads or irregular pattern like moving vehicular loads on roads and rail 
bridges. The static loads induce a constant stress in the structure. The variable 
loads on the other hand induce stresses which occur with the application of the 
loads and which go away with the removal of the loads. This additional stress due 
to the variable loads like the live load and the associated impact load is called 
Fatigue Stress.
The process of checking the safety of a structure at locations critical for fatigue 
failure under a given loading for a fixed number of loading cycles during its design 
life has been discussed in detail in the clause 605.0. The various definitions given 
in this clause have already been discussed in Section C.2.2.
C.5.2	
Fatigue Design	
605.2
Curve, defining the relationship between the numbers of stress cycles to failure 
(Nsc) at a constant stress range (Sc), during fatigue loading on a specific detail 
category of a structure is the standard S-N Curve. The conditions for carrying out 
fatigue design are as presented in the clause itself. Only due consideration should 
be given to welded joints involving plates greater than 25 mm to provide additional 
factor of safety against welding. Thus, the values obtained from the standard S-N 
curve shall be modified by a capacity reduction factor μr, when plates greater than 
25 mm in thickness are joined together by transverse fillet or butt-welding, which 
is given by:
μr = (25/tp)0.25 ≤ 1.0
Where, tp = actual thickness in mm of the thicker plate being joined.
No thickness correction is necessary when full penetration butt weld reinforcements 
are machined flush and proved free of defect through non-destructive testing.
Determination of stress
Elastic analysis shall be done to determine stress resultants. Any secondary stress 
concentration due to geometric detail is not considered since this is taken care

of by the Detail Category be considered. The stress concentration, however, not 
characteristic of the detail shall be accounted for in the stress calculation.
Low Fatigue
A structure is considered to be under low fatigue when the fatigue stress range or 
the number of design load cycles is very low and the two conditions are given as,

Stress Limitations
The two sets of limitations in the stress as put down in the code takes care of 
the possibility of ultimate failure against Limit States of Collapse due to Fatigue. 
Hence, it is mandatory that,
	
1)	
The absolute maximum normal and sear stress shall not exceed 
the elastic limit (fy, τy) for the material under cyclic loading.
	
2)	
The maximum stress range shall not exceed 1.5 fy for normal stress 
range and

/
5.1

 for shear stress under any circumstances.
Constant Stress Range
Constant stress range signifies the condition where the member or the detail under 
consideration is subjected to same stress range throughout its design life. In short 
it refers to member or details where the intermittent design load causing fatigue is 
constant. A very common example is the crane gantry girder in workshops. Fatigue 
assessment for constant stress range has been described thus far as mentioned 
above.
Variable Stress Range
Variable stress range signifies the condition where the member or the detail under 
consideration is subjected to variable stress range during its design life. In short it 
refers to member or details where the intermittent load causing fatigue is not the 
same in each cycle of loading. Though all Railway and Road bridges are designed 
for a constant stress range, they are good examples of structures where the 
members or details under considerations are subjected to variable stress range. 
Fatigue assessment for variable stress range has been discussed in detail in clause 
605.4 of IRC:22.

Shear Connectors
C.6.0	
Shear Conector	
606.0
C.6.1	
Provisions and Design of Shear Connectors	
606.1
Shear connectors are required at the interface of steel and concrete for all types of 
Composite members, including slab to steel beam connection between structural 
steel and concrete in composite columns. The requirement varies depending upon 
the nature of the force to be transferred at the interface. The shear connector should 
be capable of transmitting the design stress or loads at the interface. The clause 
lays down basic guidelines for choosing and designing the shear connectors. 
Shear connector can be of both mild steel or high tensile steel and shall be designed 
to transfer the full longitudinal shear. Shear connector strength and spacing are 
to be checked separately for all the limit states using appropriate factored load 
combinations and factored strength. All shear connectors should be capable 
of resisting uplift. Channel and stud shear connectors provide adequate safety 
against uplift. 
Flexible shear connectors are preferred because of their better performance. 
Channel, Angle and Tee shear connectors may be of mild steel, whereas, the shear 
studs may be made of high tensile steel also.
C.6.2	
Longitudinal Shear 	
606.2
Fatigue assessment is a limit state of serviceability; hence stresses should be 
calculated on the basis of elastic theory using appropriate sectional properties based 
on effective widths and modular ratios as per the load history and development of 
composite action.
C.6.3	
Design Strength of Shear Connectors	
606.3
Shear connectors are to be checked for ultimate limit states and fatigue limit states. 
Strength of flexible shear connectors for ultimate limit state and fatigue limit states 
have been given in Table 7 and 8 of IRC:22. Strength of other types of shear 
connectors is to be determined by standard tests.
C.6.3.1	
Ultimate strength of shear connectors	
606.3.1
The ultimate strength of shear connectors, both static load and for fatigue has been 
discussed in this clause.
Ultimate strength of shear connectors
Design ultimate strengths of flexible shear connectors mainly stud connectors 
and channel connectors can be determined by equation 6.1 and 6.2 of IRC:22 
respectively.

The recommendation in terms of height, width, length etc., for use of channel 
connectors is mainly due to the structural shape of the connectors and to ensure 
proper bondage with the concrete.
C.6.3.2	
Fatigue strength of shear connectors	
606.3.2
As discussed earlier the fatigue strength of shear connectors need to be determined 
from Fig. 7b of the code using the relevant S-N curve. The strength shall be 
determined from the formula as given below.

number of shear studs at one section.

Force in the shear connectors also arise at the interface shear between steel and 
concrete due to bending. The maximum longitudinal shear force at steel concrete 
interface due to bending moment is to be calculated over the shear span L, from 
zero moment to maximum moment section and is given by Eqn. 6.5 and 6.6 of 
IRC:22
The maximum compressive force in concrete in the composite beam will be 
governed by H, which is the smaller of H1 and H2. This compressive force from 
concrete has to be transferred through shear connectors to equilibrate the tensile 
force in steel caused by flexure. This should be accomplished over the shear span 
length, L. Sufficient connectors should be provided to resist the longitudinal shear 
force H.

Partial Shear Connection	
606.5
Sometimes due to problem of accommodating shear connectors uniformly or to 
achieve economy, partial shear connections are provided between steel beam and 
concrete slab. Then the shear force that can be resisted by the connectors is taken 
as their total capacity (Fc < Fcf ) between points of zero and maximum moment. Here 
Fcf refers to the total force under full composite action. Partial Shear Connection 
can be used for plastic and compact sections. If nf and np are the number of shear 
connectors required for full interaction and the number of actual shear connectors 
for partial interaction respectively, then the degree of shear connection is defined 
as, np/nf. Therefore,

The dimensional detail of shear connectors that may be used for ensuring composite 
action has been shown in detail in Fig. 8 of IRC:22 and has been explained below:

minimum of 40 mm into the compression zone of concrete flange. 
	
8)	
Where a concrete haunch is used, between the steel flange and 
the soffit of the slab, top flange of the stud or channel shear 
connectors shall extend up to at least 40 mm above the transverse 
reinforcements in the haunches, provided the reinforcements are 
sufficient to transfer longitudinal shear.
	
9)	
Where shear connectors are placed adjacent to the longitudinal 
edge of the slab, transverse reinforcement provided in accordance 
with Clause 606.11 of IRC:22 shall be fully anchored in the concrete 
between the edge of the slab and the adjacent row of connectors.

an integral part of the connector, shall be at least 100 mm with a 
minimum clear cover of 25 mm.

The dimensions of reinforced concrete haunches that may be provided between 
top of steel girder and soffit of concrete slab shall be as given in Fig. 9 of IRC:22.
C.6.8	
Cover to Shear Connectors	
606.8
The detail of the clear cover that shall be provided for shear connectors within 
concrete slab has been presented in Fig. 10 of IRC:22.
C.6.9	
Limiting Criteria for Spacing of Shear Connectors	
606.9
In a composite beam since the concrete slab is in contact with the steel member 
below, the compression flange of semi-compact section (class 3) used as the steel 
member may be considered to be in class 1 or class 2 because of the restraint 
provided by the shear connectors.
The following criteria pertaining to the spacing of shear connectors need to be 
followed to ensure proper load transfer as required for composite action:
	
1)	
Where the slab is in contact over the full length (e.g. solid slab), 
maximum spacing is governed by eqn. 6.11 of IRC:22 as given 
below.
	
	
SL ≤ 21 x tf√

2)	
Where the slab is not in contact over the full length (e.g. slab with 
ribs transverse to the beam), maximum is governed by eqn. 6.12 
of IRC:22 as given below.
	
	
SL ≤ 14 x tf√

The other criteria are for spacing has been elaborated further in the code.
C.6.10	
Transverse Shear Check	
606.10
Transverse shear strength of concrete slab along with the transverse reinforcement 
in slab ensures load transfer between concrete slab and steel beam through the 
shear connectors. The minimum transverse reinforcement required to ensure the 
above load transfer mechanism has been given in detail in clause 606.10 and

longitudinal shear between slab and steel girder, are of four main types, as shown 
in Fig.12 of IRC:22. To ensure the load transfer mechanism between steel and 
concrete following provisions shall be satisfied:
	
1)	
If the concrete by itself is insufficient to take the longitudinal shear, 
sufficient transverse reinforcements shall be provided to transfer 
longitudinal shear force from the girder to the effective width of the 
slab.
	
2)	
The area of transverse reinforcement per unit length of beam will

shear plane and are fully anchored on both the sides of the shear 
plane considered.

CHAPTER 7 
Composite Columns
C.7.0	
Composite Columns	
607.0
C.7.1	
General Overview	
607.1
A steel-concrete composite column is a compression member, comprising of 
either a concrete encased hot-rolled steel section or a concrete filled tubular 
section of hot-rolled steel and is generally used as a load-bearing member in a 
composite framed structure. Typical cross-sections of composite columns with 
fully and partially concrete encased steel sections are in Fig. 14(a) of IRC:22. 
Meanwhile, Fig. 14(b) shows three typical cross-sections of concrete filled tubular 
sections. Note that there is no requirement to provide additional reinforcing steel 
for composite concrete filled tubular sections, except for meeting the requirements 
of fire resistance where appropriate.
In composite construction, the bare steel sections support the initial construction 
loads, including the weight of structure during construction. Concrete is later cast 
around the steel section, or filled inside the tubular sections. The concrete and 
steel are combined in such a fashion that the advantages of both the materials 
are utilized effectively. The lighter weight and higher strength of steel permit the 
use of smaller and lighter foundations. The subsequent concrete addition enables 
the building frame to easily limit the sway and lateral deflections. While adopting 
composite columns the following points need to be considered: 
	
1)	
The material grade for adopting composite columns or compression 
members have been limited to IS:2062 for steel and normal weight 
concrete of strength M25 to M90.
	
2)	
Isolated columns and compression members in framed structures 
where the other structural members are either composite or steel 
members can be adopted as composite members.
	
3)	
The effects of local buckling may be neglected for a steel section 
fully encased wherein reinforcements and stirrups are provided 
such that they effectively hold the concrete, and for other types of 
cross-section where the maximum width to thickness ratio given in 
section 607.4 are not exceeded. 
	
4)	
The influence of local buckling of the steel section on the resistance 
of the composite section as a whole shall be considered for design.
	
5)	
The steel contribution ratio, δ (i.e. the ratio of the load taken up by 
the steel member alone to the total load on the composite section) 
should fulfil the criteria: 0.2 ≤ δ ≤ 0.9.
C.7.2	
Construction Particular	
607.2
In fully encased steel sections, the steel section shall be unpainted. It ensures 
adequate friction between concrete and steel section to generate composite action 



======================================================================

through bond between steel and concrete. Calculated shear stress at interface shall 
be kept limited in accordance with Table 13 of IRC:22, beyond which mechanical 
shear connectors are to be provided
Concrete shall have an all-round cover of at least 40 mm or one-sixth of the breadth b 
of the flange, at abutting surface to ensure protection against corrosion and spalling 
of concrete. The cover to reinforcement should be in accordance with IRC:112.
C.7.3	
Members Under Axial Compression	
607.3
Typical cross section of Composite columns is as already indicated in Fig. 14a 
and 14b above. The design methodology is different for column types shown in 
Fig. 14a from that shown in Fig. 14b.
C.7.3.1	
General design philosophy	
607.3.1
This clause has been explained in detail in the code itself.
C.7.3.2	
Design guidelines	
607.3.2
	
1)	
The maximum cover to longitudinal reinforcements has been 
stipulated as indicated in the clause above to ensure proper 
composite behaviour.
	
2)	
The maximum reinforcement has also been restricted to allow for 
proper concreting and avoid formation of voids and honeycombs.
C.7.4	
Local Buckling of Steel Sections	
607.4
The equations for determining the plastic resistance of an encased steel section 
or concrete filled rectangular/square or circular tubular section Pp is valid provided 
that local buckling in the steel sections does not occur before, during or immediately 
after pouring of concrete.
Since slender elements of steel sections buckle locally more easily with the 
application of loads, stability of such elements against buckling need to be ensured 
by stipulating an appropriate upper limit on width to thickness ratio. To prevent 
premature local buckling before failure governs by yielding, this clause gives the 
permissible width to thickness ratio of the steel sections in compression.
C.7.5	
Short Compression Members	
607.5
Short compression members are those whose slenderness ratios are lesser than 
the prescribed limit (i.e. 
0.2

 within which no lateral buckling will take place 
with the application of axial force. A short compression member is liable to fail by 
squashing due to axial load.
The non-dimensional slenderness ratio,  of a short member is given as,

The plastic resistance of the cross section to compression for a short member is 
given as,
Ppu = As.fy + αc.Ac. [0.80fck] + A st .f st ,
For circular column, the ratio of the volume of helical reinforcement to the volume 
of the core concrete shall not be less than 0.36 (Ag / Aco–1) fck / fst.

The design plastic res istance of steel encased concrete column and concrete filled 
rectangular and circular column are given in clause 607.5.1 and 607.5.2.
C.7.6	
Effective Flexural Stiffness	
607.6
The effective flexural stiffness for slender columns, which fail due to lateral 
buckling, varies with the nature of the load. For short term loading, the effect of load 
eccentricity is insignificant since the load acts for a short period of time, whereas 
for long term or permanent loading the eccentricity of the load causes increase in 
the actual design bending moment due to the continuous action of the eccentric 
load and the consequent increasing lateral deformation with time at constant load.
The effective flexural stiffness for short term loading is given by adding the individual 
stiffness of each element of a cross section.
(EI)e = Es Is + 0.6 Ecm Ic + Est.Ist
Where,
Es and Est	are the modulus of elasticity of the steel section and the reinforcement 
respectively
Ecm 	
is the secant modulus of the concrete
For slender columns under long-term loading, the creep and shrinkage of concrete 
will cause a reduction in the effective elastic flexural stiffness of the composite 
column, thereby reducing the buckling resistance. However, this effect is significant 
only for slender columns. As a simple rule, the effect of long term loading should be 
considered if >0.2.
For long term loading the amount of eccentricity plays an important role. If the 
eccentricity of loading is more than twice the cross-section dimension, the effect 
on the additional bending moment (second order effect) caused by axial force 
action on the increased deflections due to creep and shrinkage of concrete will be 
very small compared to externally applied normal forces from the linear analysis. 
Consequently, it may be neglected and no special provision for long-term loading 
is necessary. Moreover, no provision is also necessary if the non-dimensional 
slenderness,  of the composite column is less than the limiting values given in 
Table 10 of IRC:22, since in that case also the second order bending moments are 
small.



======================================================================
PAGE 47 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:120-2018
37
However, when  the limit exceeds prescribed above and the e/D < 2, the effect 
of creep and shrinkage of concrete should be accounted for by adopting the long-
term loading modulus of elasticity of concrete Ecs instead of Ecm where Ecs which 
have been is defined in the clause.
C.7.7	
Resistance of Member Subjected to Axial Compression	
607.7
The limiting conditions for which the non-sway columns need not be checked for 
lateral buckling are as follows:
1.	
The axial force in the column is less than 0.1 Pcr where Pcr is the elastic 
buckling strength of the column.
2.	
The non-dimensional slenderness  is less than 0.2.
To check the safety of a compression member, check for buckling about each 
principal axis of the composite section need to be done as laid down in detail in this 
clause. The buckling curve to be adopted has been given in Table 11 depending on 
the type of column.
C.7.8	
Combined Compression and Bending	
607.8
The interaction curve for uni-axial bending moment and axial force is as given in 
Fig. 7.1 (Fig. 15 of IRC:22).

a)	
Corresponding to point A in the above curve for M = 0, the maximum 
axial force is as discussed in clause 607.5 & 607.7.
	
b)	
For P = 0, (Point B), the plastic moment of resistance of the 
composite cross section is as given below.
Mp = (Zps – Zpsn) fy /γm + (Zpr – Zprn) fst /γst + αc.0.8.(Zpc – Zpcn) fck /γc
Zps, Zpr, and Zpc
plastic section moduli of the steel section, reinforcement 
and concrete about their own centroids respectively

and concrete about neutral axis of gross cross section 
respectively.

Since the effect of transverse shear force on the section plays an important role 
in determining the plastic resistance of a section a reduction in the steel strength 
i.e. (1 - β) fy /γm is considered. It is considered only the actual factored shear force 
in the section is greater than or equal to 0.5 times the design shear strength of the 
section.

The basic criteria for design under combined axial force and uni-axial bending 
moments are given below which need to be satisfied for safe design. The criteria 
take into account the buckling of the column under axial load and also on the 
interaction effect between axial force and bending moment as indicated in Fig. 7.2.

biaxial bending moment
For the design of a composite column under combined compression and bi-axial 
bending, the axial resistance of the column in the presence of bending moment for 
each axis has to be evaluated separately. Thereafter the moment of resistance of 
the composite column is checked in the presence of applied moment about each 
axis, with the relevant non-dimensional slenderness of the composite column. 
Imperfections have to be considered only for that axis along which the failure is 
more likely. If it is not evident which plane is more critical, checks should be made 
for failure due to flexure about both the axes. 
The design conditions to be satisfied have been elaborated in this clause vide eqn.

C.7.9	
Mechanical Shear Connection and Load Introduction	
607.9
The four important criteria governing the provision of mechanical shear connector 
in a compression member are:
	
a)	
Proper sharing of loads between steel section and concrete should 
be ensured at points of introduction of actual load and moments 
coming from members connected to the column anywhere over its 
length, considering the shear resistance at the interface between 
steel and concrete.
	
b)	
Proper transfer and sharing of loads between steel section and 
concrete due to any transverse shear force in the compression 
member.
	
c)	
To allow for load sharing due to longitudinal shear stress between 
the steel and concrete at the interface due to the effect of moment 
gradient in the columns.
	
d)	
For axially loaded columns and compression members, longitudinal 
shear outside the local areas of load introduction need not be 
considered.
C.7.9.1	
Load introduction	
607.9.1
	
1)	
Shear connectors should be provided at regions of load introduction 
and at regions with change in cross section, if the designs shear 
strength, τ, given in the Table 13 of IRC:22 is exceeded at the 
interface between steel and concrete.
	
2)	
The shear forces should be determined from the change of 
sectional forces within the introduction length.
	
3)	
If the loads are introduced into the concrete cross section only, an 
elastic analysis considering creep and shrinkage should be used. 
Otherwise, the forces at the interface should be determined by 
elastic theory or plastic theory, to determine the more severe case.
	
4)	
For all practical purposes, the introduction length should not 
exceed 2d or L/3, where d is the minimum transverse dimension of 
the column and L is the column length.
No shear connection is required for composite columns to accommodate creep or 
shrinkage, if the load application is by endplates, since the full interface between 
steel and concrete is permanently under compression. Otherwise the load 
application/introduction should be verified as explained for partial loading condition 
in the above clause.
Shear connection through mechanical shear connectors have been discussed in 
detail in clause 607.9.1.1.



======================================================================
PAGE 51 of 108
======================================================================
IRC:SP:120-2018
41
C.7.9.2	
Longitudinal shear outside the area of load introduction	
607.9.2
	
a)	
Outside the area of load introduction, longitudinal shear at 
the interface between concrete and steel should be verified for 
transverse loads and/or end moments. Shear connectors should 
be provided based on the distribution of the design value of 
longitudinal shear, where this exceeds the design shear strength τ.
	
b)	
In the absence of a more accurate method, elastic analysis, 
considering long term effects and cracking of concrete, may be 
used to determine the longitudinal shear at the interface.
	
c)	
Provided that the surface of the steel section in contact with the 
concrete is unpainted and free from oil, grease and loose scale or 
rust, the values given in Table 13 (IRC:22) may be assumed for τ. 
The values given in Table 13 applies to sections with a minimum 
concrete cover of 40 mm. For greater concrete cover and adequate 
reinforcement, higher values of τ may be used.
	
d)	
Unless otherwise verified, shear connectors should always be 
provided for partially encased I-sections with transverse shear as 
discussed in the above clause.
C.7.10	
Shear Check	
607.10
Reference in the above clause has been given to IRC:112 (Code of Practice for 
Concrete Road Bridges) for calculation of shear resistance given by the concrete 
section along with steel reinforcements. The total shear resistance of a composite 
section is the sum of the shear resistance given by concrete section along with 
steel reinforcements and the shear resistance given by the steel section as per 
clause section 3.3.3.2. The shear force shall be distributed in the steel section and 
the concrete section in accordance with Clause 607.9.

CHAPTER 8 
Filler Beam Decks for Bridges
C.8.0	
Filler Beam Decks for Bridges	
608.0
Filler beam decks have been introduced in Indian bridge codes for the first time. 
Though these types of girders are very rare in Indian sub-continent, these have 
been included in this code for future construction practices as and when undertaken 
by any bridge authority. Filler beam decks shall be used with its own restrictions as 
far as geometrical dimensions, spacing of steel girder, section classifications and 
detailing.
C.8.1	
Specific Requirements	
608.1
The basic requirements of filler beam decks in terms of structural configuration, 
geometry, boundary dimensions and material specifications have been indicated 
extensively. The explanations to important specifications may be as indicated 
below:
	
1)	
The girders are capable of taking tensile bending stresses both 
at top and bottom due to provision of steel flanges of filler beams. 
Hence, these girders can be both simply supported as well as 
continuous.
	
2)	
The clause states that both rolled and welded beams may be used 
as filler beams. The straightness and the restrictions in skew angle 
up to 30° ensure the uniform stress distribution along the width of 
the girder.
	
3)	
The depth limitations between 250 mm to 1100 mm have been 
specified from considering deflection as well as dead load 
restriction. The web to web distance between the steel beams has 
been restricted to ensure uniform and equal distribution of applied 
loads along the width of the girder system. The minimum concrete 
cover has been specified from corrosion and abrasion point-of-
view.
	
4)	
The clear distance between edges of steel flanges have been 
restricted to 150 mm to ensure proper pouring of concrete.
	
5)	
The steel beam surface need to be de-scaled to ensure proper 
bonding between steel and concrete as no additional shear 
connectors are provided in filler beam decks.

Global analysis	
608.2
The conditions and criteria for carrying out global analysis of these decks have 
been specified. In case of non-uniform application of load in the transverse 
direction of the filler beam deck, after concrete hardening; the analysis shall 
take into account the difference between the deflections between adjacent filler

beams. However, if it is verified that sufficient accuracy is obtained by a simplified 
analysis considering one rigid cross section, the same can be done based on the 
designer’s discretion.
The influence of shrinkage in concrete, effect of slip between steel and concrete 
may be ignored since the entire system consisting of the concrete and the series 
of steel beams are together taken as one unit for design. 
In transverse bending, the presence of steel beams shall be ignored as it does not 
contribute additionally to the resistance against transverse bending or shear.
C.8.3	
Section Classification	
608.3
This section indicates the method of classification of steel outstand flange of a 
composite section. Table – 14 of IRC:22 gives section classification for steel flange 
of filler beams. 
An effective web of the same cross-section in Class 2 may represent a web in 
Class 3, which is encased in concrete. The entire web is considered to be active 
as class 2 since the encasing concrete is assumed to prevent local buckling of the 
web.

Precast Slab on Steel beams
C.9.0	
Precast Slab on Steel Beams	
609.0
The use of pre-cast slab shall be made in lieu of cast-in-situ slab as and where 
required with same design philosophy.
C.9.1	
Full Depth Precast Slab	
609.1
The minimum requirements for use of full-depth pre-cast slab shall be maintained 
to ensure efficient function of the slab.
	
1)	
The minimum depth criteria of 200 mm need to be maintained 
from handling point of view, mainly transportation and lifting-cum-
placement at location.
	
2)	
To ensure composite action the panels need to be connected to 
the steel girder through shear studs connected to the girders. Slab 
panels with rectangular pockets shall be placed on girders at stud 
locations which would be later filled with grouts.
	
3)	
Provision of wearing course similar to for cast-in-situ slab as 
mentioned in the clause is required to ensure proper grip for 
running vehicles as well as for smooth surface finish.
C.9.2	
Partial Depth Pre-cast Slab	
609.2
A simple concept, wherein the slab consist of thin precast slab over which cast-in-
situ RCC is placed to form a the total slab which acts as the concrete portion for the 
composite girders as well as the base slab. The precast slab acts as a permanent 
formwork for the cast-in-situ slab and no additional shuttering is required.
The minimum depth criteria of 75 mm need to be maintained not only from handling 
point of view, like transportation and lifting-cum-placement at location but also as 
structural component to act as shuttering for the cast-in-situ RCC slab above it. The 
length and width of these slabs are also maintained based on the handling process 
available for the site. Proper bonding between the cast-in-situ concrete and precast 
slab along with the steel beams has to be ensured for proper composite actions.
C.9.3	
General Design Principles	
609.3
General design principles for both full-depth and partial depth precast slab including 
calculation of effective width, bending moment, shear forces, deflection, design 
and requirement of shear stud are similar to that of cast-in-situ RCC slab.
The precast slab together with any in-situ concrete (for partial depth slab) should 
be designed as continuous in both the longitudinal and the transverse direction. 
The joints between slabs should be designed to transmit membrane forces as well 
as bending moment and shear forces.

609.4
	
1)	
Vertical tolerances need to be maintained for slab directly resting 
on steel girders to ensure proper surface levelling and slope (as 
and where required).
	
2)	
The shear transfer mechanism shall be as per clause 606. The 
following precautions need to be maintained to ensure proper 
transfer of forces through the shear studs.
	
a)	
The concrete which fills the pockets in the precast slab through 
which shear studs are placed shall be properly designed and 
detailed such that it can be properly cast.
	
b)	
The minimum infill of 25 mm all around the stud is required 
for easy placement of slab at the location on steel beam so 
that they can pass through the pockets kept in the slab.
	
c)	
For shear studs arranged in group, proper and sufficient 
reinforcements at the location of the group of shear studs 
need to be placed to ensure group action without premature 
local failure either in precast or cast-in-situ slab.
	
d)	
Protection against corrosion of shear studs and steel girder 
under the slab without bedding shall be ensured as explained 
in the clause itself.
C.9.5	
Joints between Precast Members	
609.5
The clause explains the requirement for proper transfer of forces when there is a 
joint between two consecutive precast slabs. This clause of have been discussed 
in detail in the code itself and requires no further explanations.
C.9.6

The additional assumptions made in this code are given below:

The maximum strain in concrete at outermost compression fibre is 
taken as 0.0035 in bending.

C.I.1.2	
Bending Moment with Partial Shear Connection	
I.1.2
Sometimes due to the problem of accommodating shear connectors uniformly or 
to achieve economy, partial shear connections are provided between steel beam 
and concrete slab. The force resisted by the connectors is taken as their total shear 
capacity between points of zero and maximum moment which is less than the actual 
shear force (Fcp < Fcf). Thus, design moment of resistance reduces due to partial 
shear connection. The relation between M/Mp with degree of shear connection  
Fcp /Fcf is shown in Fig. I.4 below. The curve ABC is not valid for very low value of 
shear connection (hence shown in dotted line for lower values). It can be seen from 
the curve that at Fcp / Fcf = 0.7, the bending resistance is only slightly below Mp. 
Using this a considerable saving in the cost of shear connectors can be achieved

Moment of Resistance of Composite Section with Semi-Compact

and Slender Structural Steel Section (Positive moments)
Since the compression flange of non-compact steel sections buckle locally under 
compression before reaching yield stress fy, the resistance of the composite 
section consisting of non-compact sections is guided by that of compact sections 
as above, wherein the effective width of the compression flange is restricted to that 
of the compact section limiting value.

C.I.3.2	
Moment of Resistance for Non-compact Section	
I.3.2
For non-compact section, the stresses in the steel section shall remain within the 
elastic limit. Here, at the section considered, the loading causes hogging bending

C.I.4	
Flange Stress Reduction Factor	
I.3.4
In sections, where the grade of steel in flange is higher than that in web (hybrid 
steel girders), and where the section is non-compact and thus plastic moment 
capacity cannot be generated, the maximum limit of stress in both compression 
steel and tensile steel is limited by the reduction factor, to attain acceptable linear 
stress distribution from flange to web. The maximum stress in flange is given as,
fn = Rh . fy /γm, where Rh is the stress reduction factor for flange.
Obviously, for homogeneous sections, Rh shall be 1.0. As also, the reduction factor 
should not be applied to compact or plastic sections because the effect of lower 
strength material in the web is accounted for in calculating the plastic moment as 
specified in section C.I.1.1 above.

During construction stage, before casting of concrete, the steel girder erected

Description of the Bridge
The proposed bridge is having a span length of 32.0 m (c/c of expansion joint) 
with effective span of 30.0 m (c/c of bearings). The bridge carries a 2-lane single 
carriageway road over a stream near Delhi. The overall width of the deck is 12 m 
comprising of 7.5 m carriageway with 1.5 m wide footway on either side of the 
carriageway. The carriageway and footway is separated by 0.45 m concrete crash 
barriers. Structural scheme proposed for the superstructure comprise of steel 
concrete composite plate girders, four numbers spaced @ 3 m c/c, with 200 mm

thick in-situ RCC deck slab on top. The deck cantilevers 1.5 m outside the web 
of the outer girders. Sketch below shows the proposed structural scheme for 
Superstructure. Corrugated Profiled Sheet is proposed to be used for the casting 
of deck slab.

Scope
A steel concrete composite plate girder superstructure is analyzed and designed in 
this worked example. The scope of work is kept limited to the design of structural 
steel components only. The design is presented for a typical girder (outer girder 
G1) to highlight the steps involved in designing a plate girder.

2 DESIGN BASIS
The bridge is to be designed in accordance with the provisions of relevant IRC 
Codes. The basis of design set out in IRC:22-2015 is verification by limit state 
method of design. Actions, Action combinations and partial load factors are 
considered as per IRC:6-2017.
STRUCTURAL MATERIAL PROPERTIES
Following structural material grade will be used:
Structural steel :
Grade E350 BR
: conforming to IS 2062-2011
For structural steel, the value of ƒy depends on the product standard.
(Use 320 N/mm2 for t > 40mm, 330 N/mm2 for 20mm < t ≤ 40mm and 350 N/mm2 
for t < 20 mm)
Concrete :
ƒck = 40 MPa
M40
: conforming to IRC:112-2011
Reinforcement :
ƒyk = 500 N/mm2
Fe 500 D
: conforming to IS:1786-2008
The modulus of elasticity of both structural steel and reinforcement steel is taken 
as 200 GPa (as permitted by IRC:112 for reinforcement and IRC:24 for steel).
For concrete, it is assumed that the average age at first loading is the same and 
thus the values of the modulus of elasticity of the concrete and modular ratio are:
Component
Short term  
(Transient Loading)
Long term  
(Permanent Loading)
Mean Ecm  
Modular ratio, m
33 GPa  
m = 7.5
16.5 GPa  
m = 15.0
In this example, the shrinkage effects will be considered at their long-term values 
where they are unfavourable. 
3 ACTIONS ON THE BRIDGE
A)	
Self Weight of Structural Elements
The ‘density’ of steel is taken as 7.85 t/m3 and the density of reinforced concrete is 
taken as 2.5 t/m3. The self-weights are based on nominal dimensions. Additionally, 
to account for concrete in profile sheet, an average thickness of 40 mm concrete 
is assumed.
B)	
Weight of Crash Barrier & Railing
The weight of normal containment crash barrier is assumed as 0.75 t/m & that of 
railing is taken as 0.5 t/m.
Reference 
Codes:
•	 IRC:6-2017
•	 IRC:22-2015
•	 IRC:24-2010

C)	
Self Weight of Surfacing
The total nominal thickness of the surfacing is 65 mm. Assume that the ‘density’ is 
2.2 t/m3 for the surfacing. The self-weight generally produces adverse effects and 
for that case the self-weight is based on nominal thickness of 90 mm, to account 
for future overlay. Thus:

= 0.090 x 2.2 = 0.2 t/m2
D)	
Construction Loads
For global analysis, a uniform construction load of Qca = 150 kg/m2 is assumed 
during casting. This is over and above the weight of profile sheet.
E)	
Traffic Loads
	
a)	
Road Traffic
	
	
Normal traffic is represented by loads as given in IRC:6-2017. 
The bridge is designed for Class A (1 Lane/2 Lane) or Class 70R 
(Wheeled) loadings. Since, the bridge is not located in areas close 
to any ports, heavy industries and mines, congestion factor as per 
Clause 204.4 of IRC:6 is not considered applicable for this bridge. 
Also SV loading as per clause 204.5 is not considered applicable 
for this bridge.
	
b)	
Pedestrian Traffic
	
	
Pedestrian traffic is represented by the Basic load intensity of 400 
kg/m2 over the footway area, reduced for global analysis to 240 kg/
m2 as per clause 206.3 of IRC:6-2017.
F)	
Thermal Actions
	
a)	
Range of Effective Bridge Temperature: 
(Uniform Temperature Variation)
	
	
Maximum and minimum shade temperatures, based on a 50-year 
return period are defined in IRC:6-2017 (Clause 215.2). For this 
bridge location, the values are:
	
•	
Maximum 48.4°C
	
•	
Minimum -2.2°C
	
•	
Mean Temperature (Average) = 1/2x(48.4 – (-2.2)) = 25.30°C 
Say 26°C
	
•	
Bridge temperature to be assumed when the structure is 
effectively restrained = 26 ± 10 = 36°C and 16°C
	
•	
Design Temperature Variation to be considered = 26 + 10 = 
36°C.
	
This does not have any impact on the design of superstructure.

b)	
Temperature Difference Loading :  
(Vertical Temperature Gradient)
	
	
Clause 215.3 of IRC:6-2017 has been considered for Thermal 
Gradient Loading. For change of length in composite sections, the 
coefficient of linear thermal expansion is 12 x 10-6 per °C.
Temperature Differences Across Steel and Composite Section
G)	
Wind Loads
For wind load assessment, Wind Load as given in Clause 209 of IRC:6-2017 is 
used. The basic wind speed for Delhi is 47 m/s with average height of exposed 
surface as 10 m (assumed). For this, wind load at two instances is considered as 
follows:
	
a)	
Wind with LL: As per clause 209.3.7, the wind load at deck level 
(Vz) when live load is considered should be taken as 36 m/s with 
pressure intensity as 779 N/m2.
	
Hence, Fv = Pz x A3 x G X CL = 0.078 x A3 x 2 x 0.75 = 0.117 t/m2
	
b)	
Wind without LL: As per basic wind speed map as shown in Fig. 
10 of IRC:6-2017 with pressure intensity as 940 N/m2.
	
Hence, Fv = Pz x A3 x G X CL = 0.094 x A3 x 2 x 0.75 = 0.141 t/m2
H)	
Fatigue Loads
For fatigue assessment, Fatigue Load as given in Clause 204.6 of IRC:6-2017 is 
used.

4 GIRDER CROSS SECTIONS
4.1	
Section Properties – Main Girders (Outer Girder)
For determination of stress in the cross section and resistances of the cross section, 
the effective width of the slab, allowing for shear lag is needed. The following 
calculations summarize the effective section properties for the sections considered.
The equivalent spans for effective width, Lo = 30 m
B1 = 3.0 m
Bo = 1.50 m
X = Lo/8= ≤ Bo = 1.50 m
beff = Lo/8 + X ≤ (B1/2 + X) = 3.0 m
Classification of cross sections is determined separately for bending in accordance 
with Clause 603.1.4 of IRC:22 of the code.

accordance with clause 603.1.3 (1) of IRC:22-2015.
2)	
The width of web more than the semi compact limit is deducted as per clause 
603.1.3 of IRC:22-2015. Hence, the slender section is now converted to a semi-

5 PRIMARY EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE & SHRINKAGE
A)	
Temperature Difference
For calculation of primary effects, use the short-term modulus for concrete:
Ecs = 33 GPa (For steel, E = 200 GPa),
Coefficient of thermal expansion = .000012
Note:	 For each element of section, calculate stress as strain x modulus of elasticity, then 
determine force and centre of force for that area.
	
Note that the full width of slab from the centre line to the edge of the cantilever is 
used to determine the full effects of restraint. The stress and force are illustrated 
diagrammatically below:

Shrinkage
Shrinkage effects should be calculated at two instances (1) at the time of opening 
to traffic and (2) at the end of the service life and the more onerous values used. 
Shrinkage stresses are considered only for SLS checks. The characteristic value 
of shrinkage strain is calculated as per IRC:112 and presented below:
S. 
No.
Component
At the time of opening 
of traffic (t = 90 days)
At the end of service life 
(t = ∞)

2
Drying shrinkage

0.287
6
Creep factor x 
Total shrinkage
80.08 x 10-6
124.76 x 10-6
Hence, it can be seen that the shrinkage effects are more critical at the end of 
service life.
Note :
(1)	
The composite action is considered after the concrete has attained at least 75% of 
its strength. (t = 3 days).
(2)	
The Autogenous shrinkage strains are considered from the moment the concrete 
is poured (t = 3 days).
(3)	
The Drying shrinkage strains are considered from the end of curing of concrete  
(t = 14 days).
(4)	
The effect of creep is considered from the time concrete is hardened (t = 3 days).
(5)	
Relative humidity is considered as 50%.

6 GLOBAL ANALYSIS
6.1	
Construction Stage Analysis
A construction stage is checked to establish whether the sections are feasible 
during erection of girders. For this it is assumed that two girders braced together 
will be lifted and placed on temporary/permanent girders. It is important to check 
this stage as the girder may fail (locally buckle under its own weight) just after it is 
placed.

Grillage Analysis
A 2D Grillage model of the structure was created, as shown below. The model is 
prepared considering the deck slab as either a wet concrete or hardened concrete 
depending on age of loading. This has led to two different types of model and three 
different types of properties:
Model 1	 Non-composite steel T girder properties (Bare Steel): 
	
for self-weight of steel sections & deck slab loading
Analysis model, showing Grillage model with Bare Steel properties



======================================================================

Model 2 	 Composite steel T girder properties:
	
(a)	
for permanent imposed loading (with Long term properties)
	
(b)	
for live load & wind load (with Short term properties)
Analysis model, showing Grillage model with Composite properties
The global analysis, done on two separate models with appropriate properties 
effectively gives a comprehensive pattern of forces in all elements in the model. 
The extracted effects on outer girder section (as defined above) were combinations 
of moment and shear force.

CHECK FOR LOW FATIGUE
Fatigue assessment is not required if following condition is satisfied (IRC:22-2015, 
Cl 05.2)
	
i)	
f < 
  
      
 
 or
	
ii)	
NSC < 5x106[
      
⁄
       ]
 
 
Where,
f	
= actual fatigue stress range for the detail
NSC 	
= Actual number of stress cycles = 2x106
γfft	
= Partial safety factor for loads in the evaluation of stress range in fatigue 
design shall be taken as 1.0
γmft	
= 1.25 from Table 3 of IRC:22 for Non-Fail-Safe with periodic inspection 
& maintenance, accessibility to detail is good
Moment at Midspan = 1458x106 N-mm
Section modulus @ bottom of girder = 4.55x107 mm3
Actual stress range, 
f = 
        
         = 32.04 N/mm2 
	
i)	
f > 
  
     = 21.6 
	
ii)	
NSC = 5x106 [
      
⁄
           ]
 
 > 1.53x106 
Hence, either condition i) or ii) not satisfied, detailed fatigue assessment is required.

= 1.25 Vp (      
  )
   
 
where,
Vp	
= d.t.fy /√3
	
= 1700 x 12 x 350/√3/104	 = 412.2 t
Therefore, Longitudinal shear
Hq	
= 1.25 x 412.2 (        
     )
   
 
	
= 352.2 t
Rtf	
= Hq /2	
= 261.1/2	
= 176.1 t
Vn

= 
                      
 √         
 
	= 374.7 t 
Hence, Vn > Rtf and the end panel is safe to carry shear due to anchoring forces.
Check for Moment Capacity of End Panel :
In this example, it is assumed that end post consists of a single stiffener.
Mtf

Hence, Mq > 2/3 Mtf and the end panel is safe to carry bending moment due to 
anchoring forces.
Now,
Force Fm due to Mtf = Mtf/c

Check Stiffener as Load Bearing Stiffener
The bearing stiffener is designed for the force in excess of the local capacity of the 
web, Local capacity of web,     (     )  
   
   
 
where,
b1

CALCULATION OF EFFECTIVE WIDTH OF WEB
Calculation of beff for midspan section with gross cross section properties:

The effective width as per semi-compact limit is less than the values as calculated 
from the detailed stress based calculation. Hence, for the sake of simplicity the 
semi-compact limit is taken as the limiting width of the web.
Distribution of effective width:
The distribution of the effective width is done as per Fig. 4b of the code. The 
effective width is divided in two parts i.e., a) 0.4 dc from the top of the web & b) 0.6 
dc from the elastic neutral axis.
Ineffective excess width of web	
= 1700 – 1316 = 384 mm
Effective width of web in compression zone	
= dc = yt - Ineffective excess width 
of web – thk. of top flange
	
	
= 1030.3 – 384 – 20 = 626.3 mm
Start of ineffective web from top of web	
= 0.4 dc = 0.4 x 626.3 = 250.5 mm
End of ineffective web from top of web	
= 250.5 + 384 = 634.5 mm
