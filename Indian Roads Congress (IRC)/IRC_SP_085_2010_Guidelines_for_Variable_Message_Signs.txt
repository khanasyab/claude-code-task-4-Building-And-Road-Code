GUIDELINES FOR
VARIABLE MESSAGE SIGNS
1.
INTRODUCTION
The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure that Variable Message Signs (VMS) messages
are used to inform and direct motorists of variable situations
in a consistent and orderly
manner. The messages are for the purpose of traffic control, management and timely traveler
information.
It also has some basic requirements for design.
As with other traffic control devices, legibility, credibility and reliability of the message are
critical. Without these basic requirements, even the best message will go unheeded. Care
must be taken not to display a message that the motorists will not understand, disregard or
will discover to be incorrect. Signs are the primary channels of communication to the motorists.
VMS
is a valuable and effective traffic control device used to provide motorists en-route
traveler information. The information is most often displayed in real-time and can be controlled
either from a remote centralized location or locally at the site. VMS are designed to modify
motorist behaviour to improve traffic flow and operations. Traveler information displayed on
VMS may be generated as a result of a planned or unplanned event, which is programmed
or scheduled by operations personnel. They are commonly installed on full-span overhead
sign bridges, post-mounted on roadway shoulders, overhead cantilever structures and portable
types mounted on trailers/ prime-mover.
Examples of traveler information provided through VMS include:
•
Travel time between known destinations
•
Congestion conditions along a high-speed corridor
•
Construction site warning/information notices
•
Special event notice and motorist instructions
•
Maintenance operations schedule
•
Severe weather announcement
•
Incident or accident notification
The objective of providing the information is to give travel directions and to enable the motorist
adequate time to avoid an incident or prepare for unavoidable conditions. For all information
displayed, the goal is to have a positive impact on the motorist's travel time.
VMS comprise of continuous and discontinuous signs.
•
Continuous signs are similar to fixed signs, the only difference being that
they can show various messages by some electromechanical means e.g.
rotating prism signs, roller blinds, etc.



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 44
======================================================================
IRC:SP:85-2009
Discontinuous signs create messages using individual elements that can
be in one of two states (or more) and can thereby create various messages
on the same sign face. e.g. flip-disk signs, fiber optic signs, LED signs, etc.
Most VMS used for dynamic traffic management are of the discontinuous type, and make
use of light emitting techniques (fibre optic or LED signs).
Generally, Variable Message Sign (VMS) systems form
part of the Advanced
Traffic
Management System (ATMS), one of the major components of Intelligent Transport System
(ITS). The Integrated ATMS software receives online data from Automatic Traffic Counter &
Classifier (ATCC), Meteorological Sensors, Traffic Control System, CCTV, Video Incident
Detection System (VIDS), Emergency Call Boxes (ECB), etc. After processing and analyzing
the data, information can be automatically shared with the road users through VMS, Internet,
SMS, FM, radio etc.
However, Variable Message Sign systems can also be used independently for providing
information to the road users effectively.
In this case, the inputs to the VMS systems are
using manual entry or pre-programmed messages through computers.
This document was approved by the Transport Planning, Traffic Engineering and Road Safety
Committee (H1
) and Highways Specifications and Standards (HSS) Committee in their first
meetings held on
1 3 April, 2009 and 06 June, 2009 respectively and then
it was sent to IRC
Council
in
its 188th Mid Term Council Meeting held at Kodaikanal.
IRC Council referred
back the document to H-1 Committee for some modifications. Modified document duly
incorporating the comments offered by the Council Members was approved by the H-1
Committee in
its third meeting held on 18 September, 2009. The modified draft document
thereafter, placed before the HSS Committee during its second meeting held on 20 October,
2009 and HSS Committee approved the same.

2. SCOPE
This document covers guidelines for design of Variable Message Sign for highways and
urban roads. The intent of this document is to implement Intelligent Transport System in highway
operation through deployment of VMS Signs. The document covers purpose of using VMS,
warrants for VMS, message content of VMS, VMS for urban areas, portable VMS and design
ofVMS.
The Guidelines are broadly categorized into (i) Operational and
(ii) Technical.
PART-A
OPERATIONAL
3.
PRINCIPLES
The guidelines set forth the basic principles governing the use and design of VMS signs,
and the messages should meet the following requirements:
a)
Fulfill a need
b)
Command attention
c)
Convey a clear and simple meaning
d)
Command respect of road users
3



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 44
======================================================================
IRC:SP:85-2009
e)
Give adequate time for proper response
f)
Reliable and credible
Each VMS message shall be displayed for a specific purpose, such as, those provided in
these guidelines. VMS shall not be used for advertising or public service announcement,
VMS messages posted for roadway conditions or restrictions should be removed immediately
when those conditions cease to exist or the restrictions are withdrawn. Identical conditions
should always be given the same VMS message irrespective of where the conditions occur.
Some examples of VMS are given in Annex-A.
The success of VMS depends upon the mechanism for collection and transmission of data
on real time basis. Travel time between two destinations through a particular highway varies
during different hours of the day. For display of this travel time, vehicle speed sensors need
to be installed on the corridor. Also, there shall be a Control Centre where the data get
assimilated, analyzed and distributed to the stake holders. Normally, input information to
VMS are received in the Control Center from Emergency Call Boxes, Telephone/Mobile from
road users/general
public.
Police, sensors
like ATCC (Automatic Traffic Counter cum
Classifiers), Meteorological System etc.
4.
PURPOSE OF VMS
Variable Message Signs are used for the following purposes:
4.1
Control
VMS can be used for lane and/or speed control purposes, and
in most cases positioned
over the
traffic lanes
e.g.
lane change/closure/lane merge; speed
funneling: speed
harmonization, etc., by using speed indications.
4.2
Danger Warning Messages
VMS can be used for following warning messages.
•
Road works ahead
•
Flooding/fog/rain/wind
4.3
Informative Messages
Informative signs should use large text panels with two or three lines of text, sometimes
accompanied by a pictogram. The picture/symbol will be more useful. For example Incident/
accident, Congestion/queue, Road closers, useful traffic information, and also Link messages
(in future) may be displayed for information to motorists.

IRC:SP:85-2010
5. WHEN TO USE A VMS
The various situations when VMS will be appropriate are detailed below:
5.1
Incidents
5.1.1
Accidents
An incident with a minimum of blockage and with short time duration is not appropriate for a
VMS warning. The situation will probably be cleared before the message is placed on the
VMS.
Incidents that block lanes for substantial periods of time are ideal for providing information
to the traveling public. Messages near the incident can inform motorists of the problem and
move cars into side lanes. Signs location further away from the incident can suggest alternate
routes.
5.1.2
Traffic diversion
Traffic
is commonly diverted, such as when a road or pass
is closed due
to weather
conditions, flooding, roadwork, major accident, and movement of oversized vehicles or
movement of very important persons.
5.1.3
Incident management
Regional, corridor-wise as well as project-wise incident management plans is to be developed
to facilitate response to incidents and help mitigate traffic congestion. As directed by the
Traffic and Safety Engineer/Project Manager, implementation of various levels of traffic
management plans for incident management (i.e. use of pre-identified traffic detour routes)
incorporate strategic use of VMS signs.
5.1 .4
Notice of roadwork and work zones
This warns motorists of on going or upcoming construction activities that will impact traffic
flow. This may include lane closures, lane
shifts, two-way
traffic, shoulder work, and
construction, traffic entering the highway, detours, etc. This will supplement normal signs
required for roadworks and as provided in IRC SP: 55.
5.1.5
Adverse weather and roadway conditions
Messages will be used to display adverse weather or roadway conditions that may impact
the drivers' visibility or safety. These conditions may include rains, flooding/water-logging,
dust storms, snow, fog, falling rocks, mudslides, high winds, etc.
5



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 44
======================================================================
IRC:SP:85-2009
5.1 .6
Operation with lane control signals
Typically used in the tunnels and on toll plazas, these signs have a red 'X' in the closed lane
and a green arrow in the open lane.
5.2
Traveler Information
Probable time to reach the destination, Climatic conditions, Emergency number, General
cautionary information like flood. Strike, Curfew, etc, in the areas nearby.
5.3
Test Messages
During initial VMS burn-in or during maintenance, test messages are a necessary function.
These messages are for limited duration. But they are real messages with general purpose.
5.4
Special Events that Affect Traffic Flow
These messages display information about future events that affect traffic flow and safety.
The messages should be displayed within a week of the event. In urban areas these messages
shall be used only on through routes and high-speed corridors. There may be times where
static signs would be more appropriate to use.
5.5
Public Service Announcements
In general. Public Service Announcements (PSA) may be displayed on a limited and short-
term basis. The VMS should be used sparingly for the PSA so that the primary purpose and
long-term efficacy of these signs will not be degraded. The PSA shall not be displayed in
urban areas during the peak travel periods. Special event signing,
notification of future
roadway construction, are all forms of public service announcements while they are more for
managing traffic, and have been addressed in previous sections.
However, there are additional categories of PSA messages appropriate for VMS use. Most
PSA messages will fall into one of these categories, though there may be others, such as,
non-typical truck load
restrictions,
natural disaster notification, and evacuation
route
information that would be appropriate as a PSA. Under no circumstances shall the VMS be
used for advertising of any kind. The PSA shall not be displayed prior to the approval of the
concerned authorities.
Messages related to driver safety campaigns will be allowed
if other media is used, such as
radio, TV, newspapers,
billboards,
etc. This
is necessary since the message could be
confusing to drivers
if they have not been exposed to the information. In such cases the VMS
should be used randomly, and sparingly. The total duration of display in these cases should
not exceed two hours per day on any one-message board. The display times will be staggered,
6



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 44
======================================================================
IRC:SP:85-2010
so the message will not appear at the same time each day, and care must be taken so the
staggered times do not fall consecutively.
AVMS will be in a blank mode during the peak and off-peak periods when traffic, roadway,
environmental, or pavement conditions, or public service announcements do not warrant the
display of a message, or messages.
6.
MESSAGE CONTENT
Variable Message Signs do provide a versatile means of communication for attending to a
variable situation. The message, however, must be concise and clear for the drivers to interpret
at high speeds while they can have any number of distractions. This section will illustrate how
to write and display the message to give brief, clear and accurate information to the motorists.
Each VMS board must be capable of displaying alphanumeric characters in English, Hindi
and local language. Pictorial signs already available for regular traffic signs can be useful as
variable message sign.
6.1
Timing
The reading time is the time
it actually takes a driver to read a sign message. The exposure
time is the length of time a driver is within the legible distance of the message. So the exposure
time must always be equal to or greater than the reading time. Depending upon the speed of
the drivers, the message length must be adjusted to ensure the reading time can fit into the
exposure time.
The aim should be to have minimum legibility of portable variable message signs at 300 m
for expressway and 200 m for other roads. Table
1 gives the time in seconds,
it takes to
travel 300 m at various speeds.

It is, however, recommended that the size and distance for clear legibility should be designed
for at least
1 5 seconds for NH and 20 seconds for access controlled expressways. Further
more, the messages need to be displayed alternately in HINDI (or Local Language) and
'ENGLISH'
if not possible pictorially as well. The board having the facility to display minimum

IRC:SP:85-2009
of 2 lines of 12 or 15 English characters, can have English display in 1st line and other
language in 2nd line, at the same time as well.
When the VMS displays a series of message, 2-4 seconds per message is recommended.
The blinking feature may be used on one or more of the messages.
It should, however, not be
used for more than one line of each message.
Table 2 shows the maximum number of message panels that can be displayed for each
speed limit, provided there is at least 300 m of sight distance.

If only one message is used, the sign may be at steady burn and the blinking feature may
also be used for a single message. For example, the single message may also be ON for 2
seconds and OFF for
1 second.
6.2
Height of Lettering
For 1 20 km/h according to the various standards the letter size should be minimum 400 mm
for English Alphabet and 380 mm for any other local script excluding the vowel connotations
(manufacturer at his choice may use full matrix instead of line matrix to fulfill vowel display
requirement).
6.3
Limit Panels
The limitations to the number of message panels to use are two fold:
a)
Motorists should be able to read the message twice while travelling at the
posted speed.
b)
When more than two screens (panels) are used, the message and its order
become confusing to the motorist. The message shall be kept to two panels,
except as described below:
1)
The chain law, as three panels must be used to get all the pertinent
information to the drivers as approved by the Traffic Engineer for safety
or emergency reasons.
8



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 44
======================================================================
IRC:SP:85-2010
2)
Again, the average motorist at a high rate of speed can comprehend
two message panels.
If three panels are necessary, keep the confusion
minimized. Each panel should be a complete phrase and each phrase
should be independent of the other.
If the motorist begins reading the
message at the 2nd or 3rd panel, the total message should make
sense.
6.4
Message Unit
A sample list of VMS messages are given in Annex-B.
In each message there are units of information. A unit is one separate piece of data that the
driver can recall and use to make a decision. A unit normally is one or two words but can be
up to four words long. For example, the following message has four units of information.
What happened?
ROAD CLOSED
Where?
AT EXIT XX TO DELHI
Who is affected?
ALL TRAFFIC
What must they do?
MUST USE ALTERNATE ROUTE
Another example could be as follows:
ACCIDENT 2 KM AHEAD
2 km
DRIVE CAREFULLY
GO SLOW
6.5
Message Length
The message-load for the above is 4 units, that is reaching the limit for an average person to
understand while traveling at a high speed. The message length is the number of words or
characters in the message. The average motorist traveling at a high rate of speed can handle
8 word messages of 4 to 8 characters per word, (excluding prepositions). The number of
panels or frames is another important variable in the construction of a clear message.

Message Familiarity
Message familiarity is another aide for motorist's ability to understand a message. When
information displayed
to motorists
is unusual, longer comprehension time
is required.
Common language is necessary.
For message comprehension, the following are suggestions taken from research conducted
by the developed countries concerning messages, drivers can comprehend the quickest:
i)
Drivers have difficulty corresponding calendar days to days of the week.
ii)
For example, "TUES - FRI" is preferred over "OCT
1
- OCT 4".
iii)
Drivers find the phrase "FOR
1 WEEK" ambiguous.
It is preferable to use
"WED-TUES". Most drivers felt the term "WEEKEND" meant the work would
begin Saturday morning and be complete by Sunday evening.
It
is
recommended that times and days be used
if the work begins on Friday and
extends to Monday.
iv)
The highway or route numbers should display destination. The number alone
can be confusing to both local and drivers from other areas.
v)
A unit of information may be displayed on more than one line on the VMS.
6.7
Message Sets
Experience has shown there are three types of elements to use when messages fall under
the categories of incidents and traveler information, as follows:
6.7.1
Advisory signs
The advisory signs,
display real-time information about highway status and advises
concerning the best course of action. These will mostly be used for incidents. The advisory
sign message should consist of the following:
A problem statement (accident, road closure, construction, adverse weather, etc.)
A location statement (details of location)
An attention statement (addressing a certain group of audience)
An action statement (what to do)
The minimum information is the problem and action statements. The location of the problem
is also sometimes useful in a diversion decision.

6.7.2
Guide signs
Guide signs are necessary
if the traffic must be diverted due to an incident or construction.
The guide signs must provide destination information and route affirmation and direction.
6.7.3
Advance signs
There are times to inform drivers of incidents that are further ahead of the current location.
This up-to-date information has the following basic elements that can be communicated:
Information alert
Nature of information (best route, traffic conditions, etc)
Destination for which information applies
Location of the information (AHEAD or specific distance)
If there is a diversion situation with known alternative routes available:
Route markers of the major alternative routes.
7.
DISPLAY
7.1
Location of Equipment
The location of the equipment shall be strategically placed to:
a)
Ensure maximum visibility for the road user from all the traffic lanes of the
carriageway,

and react.
7.2
Display Requirements
The display background shall be non-reflective. There are 3 types of displays:
a)
Text only display, and these shall be displayed in two contrasting colours
b)
Graphics only display, this display must be able to produce colours and
shapes according to the standard road traffic requirements

VARIABLE MESSAGE SIGNS FOR URBAN AREAS
8.1
VMS are to provide the following information in urban areas:
a)
recurring congestion,
b)
non-recurrent congestion.
c)
weather-related problems,
d)
congestion due to special events,
e)
routes,
f)
speed restrictions
g)

h)
Other changing conditions or requirements
8.2
Equipment shall be placed off-shoulder (pole mounted) and clear of the traffic and
any emergency lane and position shall be determined so that extraneous effects, such as,
direct sunlight are negated. Lateral placement of VMS shall be guided by the provisions for
fixed signs.
9.
PORTABLE VMS
The above guidelines apply to
all types of VMS, but because of its nature, the following
additional guidelines are applicable to the portable VMS.
9.1
Location of Equipment
The location of the equipment shall be strategically placed to:
a)
Ensure maximum visibility for the road user from all the traffic lanes of the
carriageway.
b)
Allow the road user sufficient time to read and comprehend the message
and react.
12



======================================================================
PAGE 23 of 44
======================================================================
1RC:SP:85-2010
Equipment shall be portable and will be installed on the vehicle (Crane/Trolley mount).
9.2
Display Requirements
Text displays shall be capable of displaying 2 lines of text characters. There shall be a
minimum of 1 0 characters per line. Minimum default character height shall be 300 mm. For
variable font height, FONT generator module is to be provided wherein user can create bmp
files and later convert to image file to preview and display on required VMS. The sign panel
display shall be legible from a distance of at least 200 m.
Each LED to be separately encapsulated in a round lens.
9.3
Placement
The proper placement of a portable VMS
is
critical to
its effectiveness. The placement
requirement must give the motorist adequate time to react to the message. The VMS must
be located prior to major decision points, such as intersections or interchanges, where the
driver may change their travel plans. On National Highways, or other access-controlled
freeways, placement 2 km prior to the interchange /exit
is recommended, and must be
repeated at every 500 m and also
it must be placed 50 m prior to the point of decision.
Placement requirements include:
To provide 200 m of sight distance.
•
Signs, poles, or other objects should not obstruct the VMS.
®
On a level surface.
•
Not within an intersection or interchange.
•
Should not interfere with other traffic control devices.
•
Should not affect traffic flow in any way. (Means vehicle hosting VMS should
be beyond safety distance limit from main carriageway.)
If more than 2 VMS are to be used in sequence, they should be separated by at least 300 m.
The sign should be placed off the shoulder of the roadway, behind the crash barrier,
if possible,
and where
it will be accessible to maintenance vehicles even
if the traffic queue develops or
grows.
To be comfortable to read, the VMS panel should be turned slightly towards the driver's view,
at approximately 5 to
1 0 degrees from perpendicular of the road's centerline. Reading the
VMS becomes more difficult as the angle is increased from the normal field of vision.
It is
recommended to test check the VMS after installation by driving along the road to be sure
that the message on the sign can be read from the road.
13



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 44
======================================================================
IRC:SP:85-2009
If the portable VMS
is set up along the roadway and a message will not be needed for a
period of next 4 hours or more, the sign panel should be turned away from traffic, parallel to
the road's centerline. No blank signs should be facing the drivers for extended periods.

Placement requirements include:
•
To provide 200 m of sight distance.
•
Where signs, poles, or other objects will not obstruct the VMS.
•
On a level surface.
•
Not within an intersection or interchange.
•
Should not interfere with other traffic control devices.
•
Should not affect traffic flow in any way. (means vehicle hosting VMS should
be beyond safety distance limit from main carriageway).

IRC:SP:85-2010
If more than 2 VMS are to be used in sequence, they should be separated by at least 300 m.
The sign should be placed off the shoulder of the roadway, behind the crash barrier,
if possible,
and where
it will be accessible to maintenance vehicles even
if the traffic queue develops or
grows.
To be comfortable to read, the VMS panel should be turned slightly towards the driver's view,
at approximately 5 to
1 0 degrees from perpendicular of the road's centerline. Reading the
VMS becomes more difficult as the angle is increased from the normal field of vision.
It is
recommended to test check the VMS after installation by driving along the road
to be sure
that the message on the sign can be read from the road.
If the portable VMS
is set up along the roadway and a message will not be needed for a
period of next 4 hours or more, the sign panel should be turned away from traffic, parallel to
the road's centerline. No blank signs should be facing the drivers for extended periods.
Line
matrix signs should be capable
of displaying two
lines
of text with
either
450 mm or 400 mm characters per line depending on whether they are deployed
in an
Expressway or National Highway. The overall luminous intensity is 9000 cd/ m^.
22. DESIGN OF VMS
The design of the system will be modular except for the housing
22.1
VMS Matrix Displays
Messages are limited by the type of VMS used and its display space, configuration or matrix.
There are three typical types of matrix displays: character, line, and full. In a character matrix
a separate display space
is made available for each
letter of the text message and not
recommended. A character matrix of 8 horizontal by 3 vertical has only 24 display spaces
available. In a line matrix there is no physical separation between the characters in a single
line of text. However, in a line matrix there still remains a separation between different lines
of text. In a full matrix no physical separations exist between individual characters or lines in
the message. A message can be shown at any size and location as long as
it is within the
display space. The exhibit below demonstrates the differences between the matrix types.
Line and full matrix are recommended

IRC:SP:85-2009
Messages displayed on a VMS are done by using single or multiple-phases. A phase
is
defined as the limits of the display area available for text, bitmaps, or animation. Messages
that require more information than can be shown on a single VMS display space may require
the use of multiple phases. Multiple phases allow more than one message to be displayed at
a location.
22.2
VMS Design Process
The design process presented here demonstrates the steps needed
for proper VMS
deployment.
It does not, however, take every possible variable
into consideration. The
designer must use proper judgment within each step for a successful deployment. Along
urban streets VMS could be installed only on streets segments offering clear sight distance
of at least 150 m in plain and rolling terrain. In hilly terrain, the distance for glance legibility
shall be decided on the basis of design speed. Under no circumstances shall the front panel
of such signs be used for any kind of advertising purpose.
a)
Collect preliminary data required for the proposed variable message sign
deployment
•
Intended purpose of the VMS
•
Type of information to be displayed on VMS
•
Alternative route diversion points
b)

•
Intended purpose of the VMS
•
Type of information to be displayed on VMS
•

c)
Determine corridor placement for VMS implementation
•
Alternative Route Diversion
Points
- The minimum distance an
expressway VMS should be placed prior to an access point is
1 .5 km.
For NH
it should be
1 km.
•
Existing Horizontal Alignment Data-To ensure proper viewing of the
VMS, message sites must be located on tangent roadway sections.
•
Existing Vertical Alignment Data - Ideal site locations along roadway
segments within
1 percent grade or less are desirable. VMS should
not be placed along grades exceeding 4 percent.
•
Existing Sign and Traffic Control Inventory - Existing signs may need to
be moved
to accommodate proper VMS placement. On the

should be at least 250 m, and for NH
1 50 m.
•
