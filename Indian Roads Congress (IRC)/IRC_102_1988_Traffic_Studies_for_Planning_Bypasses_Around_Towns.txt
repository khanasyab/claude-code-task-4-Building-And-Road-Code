Specifications and Standards Committee in their meeting held at
New Delhi on 9th November, 1987.
The Committee
considered
the
draft
in
the light of the comments of members and decided,
that
further
revision
to
it
might
be
carried
out
jointly by*
S/Shri
D.
Sanyal,
J. B.
Mathur
and
K.
Arunachalam.
The
Committee also authorised the Group to finalise the draft.
1.3.
The draft as revised by the Group
was
approved
by
the Executive Committee in their meeting held on the 26th April,
1988.^
Later on the document was placed before the Council
in
their 123rd meeting held at Guwahati on the 7th May, 1988.
The
Council approved the document for publication. ^
1.4.
Traffic plying on rural highways many a
time has
to
pass through the urban areas of various sizes with or without the
purpose of halting within the urban areas. The non-halting traffic
is known as through traffic with its origin and destination
lying
outside the limits of the urban area.
The proportion of through
traffic to total traffic in the case of medium
sized
towns
(with
population 1,00,000 to
5,00,000) and
small
sized
towns
(with
population
20,000
to
1,00,000)
will
be
larger than that of big
cities.
The frequent interaction of through traffic with the local
traffic
of the
urban
area
besides
bringing down
the level of
operation
of both
types
of
traffic
would also erode the traffic
environment of the township.
In all such
cases,
proper
plan-
ning
of bypasses
assumes
great
importance
for
providing
unhindered movement to the through
traffic
and
decongest
the
townships.
1.5.
In many instances a
bypass, after
being
constructed,
soon
becomes
engulfed
with
the
local
activities resulting in a
total loss of its desired functional
character.
Chances
of such
eventualities
taking
place
must
be
obviated through planning
the bypass alignment in relation to the master plan of
the town
in such a manner that the bypass remains unaffected by the local
urban
activities
till
the end of the design year.
Tendencies of
ribbon development along the bypass must also be totally curbed
through proper legislation on land control
and
effective
imple-
mentation.
Various types of facilities along the bypass must
be
planned
in
the
beginning
itself and
such
facilities
must
be
developed in an integrated manner.
2.
SCOPE
2.1.
Particulars such as volume,
origin,
destination,
and
delays,
pertaining
to
through
and local traffic are required for
justifying the provision of a bypass.
Depending upon
its
origin
2



======================================================================
PAGE 7 of 50
======================================================================
IRC
: 102-1988
and
destination,
the traffic going through a town can be classi-
fied as
:
(i) External to external
:
Traffic whose orgin
and
destination
both
lie outside the town.'
(ii) External to internal
:
Origin
of
traffic outside
and
destination
inside the town.
(iii) Internal to
external
:
Origin of traffic inside and destination
out-
side the town; and
(iv) Internal
:
Traffic whose origin and
destination
both
lie within the town.
2.2.
External to external traffic
is
usually
totally
bypas-
sable whereas other traffic is not. A portion of bypassable traffic
may have to enter the town
for
purposes
of refreshments,
fuel
filling, minor repairs, etc.
By providing such facilities along the
proposed bypass, the demands of this traffic
can
be
easily
met
and the traffic successfully diverted.
Such details must form an
integral part of any proposed bypass.
2.3.
In
addition
to
above
information,
frequency
and
route description of the bypassable
traffic
is
also
required
for
planning
the
bypass.
This
information
is
collected
through
comprehensive surveys at suitably selected
outer
cordon
points
around the town.
2.4.
This
document
provides
guidelines
on
conducting
studies on traffic required for planning bypasses as also
analysis
of the
data.
Suitable
proformae
for
recording
the
data
and
their analysis are provided. An worked out example to illustrate
the methodology
is included.
3. ..ORIGIN AND DESTINATION SURVEY
3.1.
Selection of Survey Points
Judicious location of survey points is necessary to get
right
data for the study.
Survey stations should be located wficre
the
approach roads intersect the cordon
line drawn
to
enclose
the
town
under
study.
Fig.
1
indicates
cordon line for a sample
case.
The following points should be kept in
view
while
loca-
ting the cordon
:
(i) the cordon line should be well away from
the
town
for
effectively
identifying the bypassable traffic; and
(ii) the cordon line should encompass all existing
bypasses
catering
to
regional traffic moving around the town.

3.2.
Frequency and Duration of O-D Surveys
The surveys should be carried out simultaneously at all the
selected locations,
during
the
peak
and
the
normal
periods.
The period in which these are conducted should be so selected as
to trap representative characteristics of the traffic.
The
surveys
should
normally
be
conducted
for seven consecutive days but
in any case
for not less than
three
days and
must
encompass
the weekly market day and one working day.
3.3.
Sample Size
3.3.1.
As far as possible the survey should cover maximum
percentage
of
traffic,
and
it
is
preferable
to cover the entire
traffic
giving
one
hundred
per cent sample size.
When this is
not possible the survey should cover a
minimum
percentage
of
traffic as given below
:
During peak periods
:
25 per cent of volume of traffic.
During normal periods
:
50 per cent of volume of traffic.
3.3.2.
In
addition
to
this
sample
survey,
traffic
count
should be conducted simultaneously
during
the
survey
period.
This is mainly required to expand the sample to the total popula-
tion.
Traffic count data by vehicle type should also be collected
for every 15 minute interval by using Form
1.
Deployment
of
manpower for this purpose should be adequate.
3.4.
Methodology
3.4.1. Depending upon the size of the town, accuracy requir-
ed
etc.,
the
survey
can
be carried out by any of the following
methods
:
(i) Registration plate method
;
(ii) Tag and disc method
; or
(iii) Roadside interview method.
3.4.2. Registration
plate
method
:
Registration number
of
vehicles and time of entry and exit of the inbound and
outbound
vehicles are noted down
by
observers posted separately
at each
survey point.
When survey is
conducted
on sampling
basis for
recording vehicles at entry and exit points, vehicles with registra-
tion numbers
ending
with
pre-determined
digits (say 0,5,7 and
excluding the letters) only are recorded.
This
method
does not
cause any inconvenience to traffic and
is suitable for very small
towns.
It is not possible to collect data regarding the purpose of
trip, details of stopping through traffic, etc., by this method.

======================================================================
PAGE 10 of 50
======================================================================
IRC* 102-1988
3.4.3. Tag and disc method
: The
vehicles
entering the town
are stopped
at
survey
points and
tags with
entries such as the
time of entry, place of entry and
type
of vehicle
are tied to the
front of the vehicles by the observers posted to cover the inbound
traffic.
Sometimes instead of
tags,
discs
are
distributed to the
drivers.
When the vehicles leave the town
at the cordons, these
tags of discs are collected by the surveyors posted
at
the survey
points.
Different coloured tags
and
discs can be
distributed to
identify the distributing station and type of vehicle with
registra-
tion numbers ending with pre-determined
digits
(letters may be
excluded) for easy identification.
3.4.4. Roadside interview method
3.4.4.1. Inbound
vehicles
are
stopped at
the survey points
and information on time of interview, type
of
vehicle,
registra-
tion number of vehicle etc., are noted down by the observer. Then
the observer puts questions
in
a
polite
manner
to the driver or
occupant to get
information
on
origin,
destination, purpose of
trip, number and purpose of halts within the town, route follow-
ed inside the town, etc. Form 2 may
be
used for
collecting this
information.
3.4.4.2. Random
sampling may
be
adopted
to avoid any
bias.
It
is enough to conduct
the
survey
on
vehicles from one
direction only, preferably inbound vehicles, due to the
following
reasons
:
(i) the
through
traffic
will
be
covered
at
the survey
station
at
the
approach to the town
;
(ii) this will avoid possibility of
interviewing
the
through
traffic
twice,
once at entry point and the second time at the exite point
; and
(iii) the local traffic will be partly eliminated.
3.4.5. Requirements of survey stations : Adequate care should
be taken to locate the survey station well away from the carriage-
way to cause little interference to the passing traffic. If necessary,
police help may be taken for conducting
the
survey.
Adequate
provision at survey point may
be
made to provide information
to the
road
users
regarding
the
purpose of
the survey through
installation of banners, etc.
4.
TRAVEL TIME AND DELAY STUDIES
4.1. This study can be conducted by
the moving
car tech-
nique.
By this technique, a test vehicle is run
at the
perceptible
average speed of the traffic stream.
The observers inside the
test
6



======================================================================
PAGE 11 of 50
======================================================================
IRC
: 102-1988
vehicle note down the journey
and
delay timings and causes of
delays.
Depending upon the
method
of
regulating the speed uf
the
test
car,
the
survey
can
be
conducted
by
any one
• the
following methods
:
(i) Floating car method
(ii) Average car method
(iii) Restricted car method
4.2.
In
the floating
car method, the driver h
to
;rtake
an equal number of vehicles which overtake the
test
car.
How-
ever,
it
is
rather
difficult
to
apply
this
method in our towns
because of mixed traffic conditions.
4.3.
In
the
average
car
method,
the
driver
runs the test
vehicle at the speed which
he
considers
as
the average speed of
the
traffic
stream.
This
method
is
restricted to
conditions of
continuous flow
of
traffic
only
and
cannot be applied
for free
flow conditions.
4.4. The restricted car method
is
the
same
as average car
method.
But
it overcomes the disadvantage existing in the latter
by restricting the speed of test vehicle under free flow
conditions
to predetermined speed limits.
4.5. The following preliminary work
must
be carried
out
prior to conducting the survey
:
(i) the entire route must be
divided
into
sections,
each section having
fairly homogeneous road and
traffic
characteristics
along the entire
length.
(ii) the restricted speed of test vehicle under free flow conditions is deter-
mined by considering the existing speed limits
; and
(iii)
if existing speed limits are not satisfactory, spot
speed
study
should
be conducted and restricted speed limits determined.
4.6. The test vehicle is run in both directions of test Sections
in order to cover all conditions
of
traffic.
The cause,
duration
and location of stops and other delays are recorded. For record-
ing the readings,
a
tape
recorder
can
be advantageously used.
Form 3 may be used for
carrying
out
this survey.
In
order to
ensure accuracy of data, atleast six, and preferably
a multiple of
six runs per direction, must be made.
5.
ANALYSIS
This part deals
with
processing
and
presenting
the
data
collected
from
the
surveys
dealt
with
earlier,
to evaluate the
7



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 50
======================================================================
IRC
: 102-1988
necessity
for
bypass, and to select a suitable location therefore,
if justified.
5. 1 .
Analysis of Traffic Count
Hourly volumes of traffic
passing
through
various
survey
points
are
obtained
by
tabulating
the traffic volume counts in
Form 4.
5.2.
Analysis of Delays
From
the
survey
the
average
delays
(which
covers
all
delays
including
waiting
time
at
level
crossing) involved for
each route are compiled by summing up the
delays
involved
in
each run and then working out the average delay, Form 5.
5.3.
Speed-flow Characteristics
From the data already collected, speed-flow
characteristics
of the existing facility must be ascertained.
This would help
in
defining the level of service as obtaining at persent.
5.4.
Analysis of Origin and Destination Data
The
data
obtained
from
origin
and
destination
survey
should be tabulated in Form 6
and
the
proportion
of through
traffic
to
total
traffic obtained.
The average delays during the
24 hour period
as
noted
in Form
5
should
be
grouped
for
different sections of the entire route in Form 7.
5.5.
Analysis of Speed and Delay Characteristics
5.5.1.
The travel speeds and
traffic
volumes
as
obtained
from Forms 3 and 4 respectively are used to develop a
relation-
ship between speed and volume for the route under
study
which
may be of the following kind
:
Ve,t
= Vf-kQ
where
Ve $t
= estimated speed, km/h
Vf
= average free speed, km/h
k
= a coefficient
Q
= average hourly traffic volume,
vehicles per hour
5.5.2.
The travel speeds of local traffic
in
the
absence
of
through
traffic
and
of through
traffic
in
the absence of local
traffic should be estimated from speed-volume relationship.
The
average travel time on different route sections
should
be
found
8



======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 50
======================================================================
IRC
: 102-1988
out
based
on
observed
and
estimated
speeds.
The
average
delays
should
be
taken
as
the
difference
between the average
travel time with the observed or estimated travel speed
and
the
travel time with the average observed free
speed.
These
values
should be tabulated using Form 8 for the following cases
:
(i) local traffic with through traffic;
(ii) local traffic without through traffic;
(iii) through traffic with local traffic; and
(iv) through traffic without local traffic.
5.5.3.
The vehicle-wise break up of through
traffic
should
be tabulated in Form 9.
5.5.4.
The total loss in manhours and the total
extra
fuel
consumed
per
day
should
be
tabulated
in
the Form
10, for
local traffic and through traffic separately for both
the
cases
of
their
travelling
together
and
separated from each other.
The
extra manhours and the extra fuel lost per day should be
calcul-
ated as follows
:
(i) extra manhours or extra
= manhours or fuel lost per day while
fuel lost per day for
travelling
alongwith
through traffic
local traffic
(observed) minus manhours
or
fuel
lost
per day
while travelling with-
out through traffic (estimated).
manhours or fuel lost per day while
travelling
alongwith
local
traffic
(observed) minus manhours or
fuel
lost per day
while
travelling
with-
out local traffic (estimated).
5.5.5.
The direct economic losses in the
base
year
which
include the extra manhours and extra fuel should
be
quantified
by adopting suitable monentary
values
for
local
and
through
traffic in Form
11.
5.6.
Projection
5.6.1.
The necessity of a bypass can be
better
emphasized
by working out the details for a future date since present demand
may vastly increase due to
:
(i) growth of the region; and
(ii) attraction of more traffic by new facility due
to
improved
level
of
service offered.
5.6.2.
A twenty year period
is
normally
assumed
to
be
the
design
period
for
a
road
project.
However, this can be
suitably altered to suit the local conditions.
(ii) extra manhours or extra
fuel lost per day for
through traffic

The traffic

to
the
town
during
previous
years,
it'
available,
can
he
used
for
projecting the
growth of traffic to the design year.
11 no such data
is available,
.
the traffic can be
projected
by
the
growth
factor
method,
on
considerations
of
the
growth of region with respect to popula-
tion,
fuel
consumption,
number
of
registered
motor
vehicles
etc.
Changes in level of service for each year will then
have
to
be
determined
keeping
in
view
the projected yearly growth in
traffic.
5.6.4.
From the projected
traffic,
the
vehicle-hours
lost,
manhours
lost etc.,
and
the
anticipated economic loss for the
design year could be obtained using Form
12.
5.6.5.
The design speed, which depends on
the
character-
istics
of
traffic
in
the region, can be obtained after comparing
the speeds of traffic
on
similar
bypasses
in
the
region.
With
this
data,
the geometric details of the bypass and the cost of the
projects to meet the needs of the projected traffic can be
worked
out.
5.7.
Economic Analysis.
The economic savings due to the provision of the facility
is
compared
with
the
anticipated
economic
loss had the existing
facility been continued upto the design year
for
the
purpose
of
justifying
the
construction
of
the
bypass.
While carrying out
this economic analysis, savings due to likely
reduction
in num-
ber and severity of accidents brought about by the provision of a
bypass and improvement in level of service offered by
the
exist-
ing
facility
due
to
a reduction in traffic volume levels (through
traffic
having
been
assigned
to
the
bypass)
should
also
be
considered.
6.
PRESENTATION
The through traffic analysed according to origin and
desti-
nation
in
terms
of passenger car units (Rural) and projected to
design year
is
represented
by
means
of
desire
line
diagram,
treating
the
survey
points
as origins and destinations.
Such
a
diagram will clearly indicate the
control
points
and
the
most
suitable alignment for the bypass.

EXAMPLE-CASE STUDY
7.1.
This
part
deals
with
an
hypothetical
case study in
which the justification for planning a bypass for
an
urban
area
is explained.
7.2.
Fig. 2
shows
the urban
area through which a major
inter-urban arterial such
as
National
Highway
passes.
Traffic
studies
for
evaluating
the
drop
in the level of service of traffic
plying on the
arterial
and
for
planning
a
suitable
bypass
to
decongest
the
urban
township
were
conducted
at
carefully
selected survey stations.-

Form
1 and 2, origin and destination
matrix
for
the
vehicular
traffic on the major urban arterial has been prepared and
shown
in
Table E-l.
Computation
on
sectionwise
vehicular traffic
is
done in Table E-2.
Mode-wise traffic on these route sections are
given in Table E-3.
The detailed methodology for carrying
out
the
traffic volume
counts,
origin
and
destination
survey and
travel time and delay studies have already been explained in
the
earlier
sections.
The
necessary
data and analysis are given in
the Tables listed below.
Table E- 4
:
shows the hourly summary sheet of
traffic count
on route section A-l.
Table E-
5
:
shows
the
duration
of delays (in minutes) in the
route section A-l during 24 hour period.
Table E- 6
:
shows the percentage
of through
or
bypassable
traffic to the total traffic plying on the
arterial.
Table E- 7
:
shows the summary of analysis of
delays on
the
entire arterial.
Table E-
8
:
shows the travel time and delay
characteristics
of
local traffic and through traffic.
Table E- 9
:
shows
the mode-wise through
traffic during the
24 hour period.
Table E-10
:
shows
the
analysis
of
losses
in man hours and
fuel to local and through traffic.
Table E-l 1
:
shows the direct economic losses in the base
year
for local and through traffic.
Table E-l 2
:
shows the projected economic losses
for
through
and local traffic for a design period of 20 years.
