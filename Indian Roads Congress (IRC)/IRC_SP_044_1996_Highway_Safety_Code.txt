HIGHWAY SAFETY CODE
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1. This Code
is not
a manual of
traffic
law, although some
of the measures dealt within
it are prescribed by law. Others are
dictated by good sense and courtesy. However, each category is as
important as the other.
1.1.1. Based on the recommendations of the First Highway Safety
Workshop held at Chandigarh in January, 1972 the Traffic Engineering
Committee of the Indian Roads Congress decided
to take up the
preparation of Highway Safety Code. Since then this Code has been
extensively discussed and modified several times by the Traffic Engg.
Committee. The final draft of the Highway Safety Code was discussed
in the meeting of this Committee held on 2.12.1991 (personnel given
below):

1.1.2. Thereafter it was approved by the Highways Specifications
& Standards Committee in its meeting held on 1.9.1992, subject to
some minor modifications to be carried out by a group consisting
of S/Shri M.K. Bhalla & J.B. Mathur.
1.1.3. The modified draft was subsequently approved by the
Executive Commitee on 11.11.1992 and by the Council in their meeting
held on 28.11.92 subject to modifications based on comments of
members of the Council.
The
draft was
finally modified by
S/Sh.
Nirmal
Jit Singh &
A.P.Bahadur in consultation with the Convenor, Highways Specifica-
tions & Standards Committee as authorised by the Council for printing
as one of the IRC Publication. The finalised draft was received from
Convenor, Highways Specifications & Standards Committee on 2.4.93
for printing as one of IRC publications.
1.2. Purpose of the Code
The Highway Safety Code is designed to help road users to traverse
the roads safely. It is intended to induce good traffic sense, discipline
and courtesy in road users while familiarising them with the rules
and laws governing the use of roads. It also gives tips on safe driving
and explains meanings of road signs, pavement markings and signals
met on the roads.
Driving on the highways
is more demanding than ever before.
It requires skill, concentration and caution to steer oneself safely on
the road.
It is important that every road user knows and understands the
2



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 116
======================================================================
rules of the road. Safe driving is a continuous learning process. Careful
reading and compliance of the safety instructions contained in this
code by
all road users will go a long way imbibing safety culture,
thus saving precious human lives, disabilities and injuries and mit-
igating socio-economic losses.
1.3. Organisation of the Code
The Highway Code consists of a number of chapters covering
various types of road users. Road users explicitly covered are Pedes-
trians, Animal Drawn Vehicles,
Cyclists, Motor-Cyclists and other
Motorised Vehicles. The gist of the whole document
is given in the
end in the form of Do's and Don'ts for various road users. These
summarise the behavioural and other attributes that the road user
is expected or required to follow so that those who do not want
to go through the whole document can derive the benefit by studying
that part only. A brief driving and road craft manual has also been
added. Some figures giving the various traffic signs and signals and
some diagrams depicting various traffic situations are also included,
so as to make the document more illustrative and easily understood.
2. GENERAL SAFETY RULES FOR ALL ROAD USERS
2.1.
Traffic Rules have been established as a systematic framework
to serve as a guide and commitment common to
all. Obeyance of
traffic rules is a fundamental responsibility of all citizens. Everyone
must follow the basic road rules and drive with common sense and
with consideration for safety of all the road users.
2.2. Basic Road Rules
\
It is everyone's social responsibility to understand and follow the
road rules, road signs and markings. Some of the general rules that
should be remembered are:
0)
It is an offence for any person to disregard a traffic law or fail to follow
the instructions stipulated therein.
(ii)
All
traffic must keep to the
left.
(iii)
No person should drive a motorised vehicle without a driving license
valid for the class of vehicle being driven.
(iv)
Driver must produce his/her driving licence
if he/she
is driving a motor
vehicle
in any public place, on demand
for examination by a Police
3



======================================================================
PAGE 18 of 116
======================================================================
Officer
in uniform.
(v)
Before driving, a driver must ensure that vehicle
is properly licenced,
registered and insured and that there are no restrictions in the relevant
insurance policy (for example as to who can drive the vehicle) which
would make the insurance invalid.
(vi)
Every driver of a motor vehicle shall cause the vehicle to stop and remain
stationary so long as may be reasonably necessary, when required to do
so by a Police Officer in uniform or when the vehicle
is involved in an
accident, irrespective of whether he/she
is or
is not responsible for the
accident. He/she shall give his name and address of the owner of the
vehicle to any other person affected by such accident and who demands
it, provided that such person also furnishes his/her name and address.
(vii)
When someone else appears
to behave recklessly or rudely, control
yourself and never stop to retaliate,
it
is both degrading and dangerous.
(viii)
Vehicles displaying "L" plates are
in the charge of learners and inex-
perienced drivers; be wary of them and give them clear passage and
chance.
(ix)
Be particularly patient with old people, the blind and the infirm and
assist them wherever possible, for they have special problem in nego-
tiating traffic.
(x)
If a
fire service vehicle or an ambulance or police car with siren are
approaching allow them free passage by driving to the side of the road.
(xi)
Do not go on to the road,
if you are in a temper, excited or upset; try
to calm yourself before entering the road.
(xii)
Do not flash a light onto the road so as to dazzle and blind the eyes
of an approaching driver.
(xiii)
Refrain from throwing things
like
cigarette
butts, empty
juice
tins,
packings etc. out of your vehicle window onto the roads. These can be
dangerous and troublesome for other road users. Do not project part
of your body or objects from inside the vehicle.
(xiv)
Do not use horn unless absolutely necessary. Do not make unnecessary
noise or do anything else which may
irritate others.
(xv)
If you notice any person(s) who have had either an accident or break-
down, inform the police and ambulance services and give the injured
a helping hand
in any way you can.
(xvi)
While on
the
road,
be prepared
for
the worst and keep
sufficient
emergency and first-aid equipment in the vehicle.
(xvii)
No person driving vehicle should allow any person to stand or
sit or
place anything in such a manner or position as to hamper the driver
or his control of the vehicle.
(xviii)
When a police officer in uniform
is on the spot directing traffic, obey
his hand signal, even
if the hand motion contradicts the traffic light, sign
4

or pavement marking on traffic lanes, but do so with the greatest caution.
(See
Fig.
1
for typical hand signals by
traffic police)
ix)
At non-signalised zebra pedestrian crossings, vehicles should give way
to pedestrians. At signalised crossings, when red light
is on vehicles
should not cross strip
line or block zebra crossing.

2.3. Road
Signs,
Traffic Lights and Pavement Markings
2.3.1. Everyone must obey
all
traffic
signs,
traffic
lights and
pavement markings.
It is the duty of every person, not only vehicle
drivers but also pedestrians and bicycle riders to become acquainted
with traffic signs,
lights and pavement markings.
2.3.2. Road signs
:
There
are
specific
standards
for
signs
regarding their colour, shape and size.
It is everyone's duty to know
them and follow the message conveyed meticulously. Road signs
transmit consistent and uniform messages about
the
travel
route
anywhere in the country.
In India, traffic signs are grouped under the following categories:
(i)
Mandatory/Regulatory Signs: These
signs convey messages about
traffic laws and regulations
i.e. do's and don'ts. They give orders which
must be followed. These signs are mostly circular in shape. Those with
red
circles
are mostly prohibitive and
those
in blue give mandatory
directions. Violation of such signs
is an offence punishable under M.V.
Act and the State Police Acts. The various signs and messages are given
in
Fig.
2(i).
*(ii)
Cautionary/Warning Signs: These signs
tell you what to expect ahead.
These are posted before the hazard on or near the road to forewarn the
road user. Warning signs are usually triangular with red border and black
symbol or message on white background. The various signs and their
messages are given
in Fig.
2(ii).
(iii)
Informatory Signs: These signs guide as to where you are going and
how to go there. These are mostly rectangular and provide information
on intersecting roads, and guide you to the correct route or to points
of intersect along the highway. They also help you find hospitals, service
stations, restaurants, etc. The variou* signs and their messages are given
in
Fig.
2(iii).
(iv)
Work Zone Signs: These signs are provided to guide
traffic through
highway construction or maintenance zones. When approaching a work
zone, pay particular attention to flaggers who may stop you or ask you
to slow down. The various signs and their messages are given
in Fig.
2(ii).
2.3.3. Traffic lights/signals:
Traffic signals
are generally
in-
stalled at intersections to control the movement of vehicles. All traffic
must move in conformity with the traffic lights or signals. Only heed
the traffic light directly facing the direction in which you are moving.
Even when the signal for the
traffic on the side road has become
red,
it does not necessarily mean that your signal
is green and that

======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 116
======================================================================
(a) Steady Red:
(1)
Steady red light requires you to stop and wait behind the
stop line or cross-walk on the carriageway.
If there are
no lines, stop before the intersection. Wait until
a green
signal appears before proceeding.
(2)
You may turn left while the signal
is red provided
it
is
not prohibited by a sign. But you must first stop and yield
to pedestrians and other
traffic.
(b) Flashing Red: Alternating flashing red light means you must
come to full stop and proceed cautiously after making a safety check
on all approaching traffic. This is generally provided at level crossings,
bridges, airfield, fire stations,
etc.
(c) Steady Yellow: A steady yellow light requires you
to stop
before the stop
line.
It indicates that signal
is changing. You may
go through if the green light has changed to yellow light soon after
you have crossed the stop line or are so close
to
it that to pull up
might cause an accident. Then continue through carefully.
(d) Flashing Yellow: A flashing yellow
signal warns you
of
hazard ahead. Slow down and proceed with caution giving due
attention to other traffic pedestrians and vehicles.
(e) Green: A green signal means you may proceed through the
intersection
if the way
is clear. You can also make
a right or
left
turn
if not prohibited by signs but take special care and give way
to pedestrians who may be crossing.
(f) Green Arrow: A green arrow means you may turn
in the
direction indicated by the arrow provided the way is clear. You may
do this irrespective of whatever the other lights may be showing.
Cg) Pedestrian
Signals:
(i)
Pedestrians facing a steady green with human figure in
readiness to move or illuminated words "WALK" may cross the street
in the direction of the signal indicated (see Fig.
4). At flashing signal,
pedestrians should quickly proceed to the nearest refuge island or
footpath and
those on
refuge
or footpath should not
enter
the
carriageway.

(h) Lane Use Signals: In multi-lane high-
ways/toll areas, special signals may be placed
directly over traffic lanes to control traffic (see
Fig. 5). These signs indicate how specific lanes
can be used:
(i)
Steady Green Arrow: This means the lane over
which the arrow points can be used by traffic.
(ii)
Steady Yellow 'X':
This indicates that a lane
control change
is ahead, so prepare to safely
vacate this lane.
(iii)
Steady Red 'X': This indicates that this lane
is
closed and you are not permitted to use this
lane.
(iv)
Flashing Yellow
4X': This indicates that you
may
use
this
lane
to make
a
left
turn
with
caution.
2.3.4. Pavement markings: Most roads
have pavement markings to delineate the centre
of road, identify travel lane, define road edge.
Pavement markings also provide information
about special lane use. Markings can also be
in
the
form
of
patterns,
arrows,
or
other
devices set into or attached to the carriageway
or kerbs or to objects within or adjacent to
the carriageway, for control, warning, guid-
ance or information of road users.

Generally, white/yellow lines separate traffic moving in opposite
directions. White
lines divide lanes of
traffic moving
in the same
direction. As a general rule broken traffic lines can be crossed while
solid lines cannot be crossed.

(a)
Give way lines [see Figs. 6(a), (b) and (c)]: These are double
broken white lines painted across the pavement after a "GIVE
WAY" sign. These lines are used on a minor road at the entrance
to an intersection where
it
is necessary to assign the right of
way to the major road but stopping
is not warranted
at
all
times. This indicates that vehicles must approach with caution
and proceed beyond these lines only
if there
is a gap in the
traffic on the main road. These lines may be accompanied by

in advance of the
lines.
(b)
Stop lines at "STOP" sign Isee
Fig.
6(d)]: These
are
solid
double white lines painted across a pavement at or near but
after a "STOP" sign. These lines indicate the vehicles must come
to a halt before these lines. These are used on a minor road
at
its
intersection with
a major road where conditions are
considered to be unduly dangerous due to restricted visibility,
bad alignment, high accident record etc. making
it imperative
for main road traffic to stop on every occasion. These
lines
may be accompanied by "STOP" written in advance of the line.
(c)
Stop lines [see
Fig.

painted across a carriageway and indicate where the vehicle
should stop when directed by a stop light or a police officer
(d)
Pedestrian crossings [see Fig.
7]: These are white stripes
2
to 4 m in length and 50 cm wide painted parallel to the road
equally spaced. Where these lines are provided, pedestrians must
cross at this point. All vehicles should give way to pedestrians
at such crossings.

3. SAFETY OF PEDESTRIANS
3.1. Pedestrians form a major part of road users in India. They
are also the most vulnerable group in terms of their involvement in
fatal accidents and serious injuries. This Code has been framed with
the basic objective of providing guidelines for safe travel on roads
and is based on research done throughout the world on safety for
pedestrians. Meticulous compliance of these guidelines can go a long
way in promoting pedestrian safety.
3.2. Walking Along the Road
3.2.1. Where there
is a designated Kerb footpath or shoulder of
sufficient width, pedestrians are required to walk on these.
3.2.2.
If there
is no Kerb footpath, or designated shoulder, the
pedestrians must walk close to the right side of the road such that
they are facing the oncoming
traffic and can see
it (see
Fig.
10).
Pedestrians must keep as close to the side of the road and not walk
more than two side by side. They must keep one behind the other
if possible, particularly in heavy traffic or in poor light and at corners.
3.2.3. Children, upto the age of seven at least, should not be
allowed alone on the road. Elders must accompany them and they
must keep themselves between the traffic and the children. They must
always keep
tight hold of their hands and must not
let them run
into the road.
3.2.4.
Pedestrians must always wear
or carry white
or
light
coloured clothes or vests with reflective tapes in the dark or in poor
light. Reflective materials can be seen in headlights at upto three times
the distance compared to ordinary clothes, but fluorescent materials
are of
little use
in the
dark.
3.2.5. Blind persons walking along a road
at night must carry
one cane/stick painted with reflective paint or fixed with reflective
tapes of sufficient width and preferably wear vests with reflective
tapes fixed on
it. Wearing of bright clothes
is
a must.
3.2.6. A group of people marching on the road (e.g. returning
from work at night) should keep to the left. There should be lookouts
in front and
the backs wearing
reflective
clothings
at night and
fluorescent clothings by day. At night the lookout in front should

carry a white light and the one at the back a bright red light visible
from the rear. Additional lights should be carried by people outside
of the long column.
3.2.7. Pedestrians are prohibited from entering or crossing on the
Expressways and their slip roads.
3.3. Crossing the Road
3.3.1. Where to cross: The pedestrian must cross the road on
an intersection with traffic
light nearby. All efforts should also be
made to use pedestrian foot bridge or underground pedestrian subway
if they are within reasonable distance. Otherwise cross under a street
19



======================================================================

======================================================================
lamp where you can be seen (see Fig. 11).
It is extremely dangerous
to jump guard rails and cross the road at such places (see Fig.
12).



======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 116
======================================================================
3.3.2. Kerb Drill (see Fig.
13):
If there
is no designated crossing
place nearby, choose
a place where you can see clearly along the
road in all directions. Do not try to cross between parked vehicles.
Move to a clear space and always give drivers a chance to see you
clearly and well
in time. Then follow the following "Kerb
Drill":
3.
IF THERE
IS GAP IN TRAFFIC
COMING FROM RIGHT SIDE.
THEN LOOK FOR
TRAFFIC FROM
LEFT SIDE
4. LOOK AGAIN FOR TRAFFIC COMING
FROM RIGHT AND CROSS
Fig.
13. Kerb Drill
(i)
"Stand back at the edge of the road where you can see and hear tramc
coming. Look right, look left and look right again and listen. When the
road
is clear and you do not hear any traffic coming, cross at right angle
as quickly as you can, without running but keeping a look out for traffic.
Keep in mind that stopped vehicles will sometime block vision creating
a blind spot".
(ii)
Parked Vehicles: Try not to cross the road between or in front of parked
vehicles (see Fig. 14). When inevitable be doubly careful as you will be
visible to the traffic on the road. Stop at the edge of the parked vehicle
and do your kerb
drill.
(iii)
One-Way Streets: On a one-way street, there will be more than one stream
of traffic, more
likely more than two, the nearest one being of slow
vehicles and the farther ones of fast moving vehicles. While crossing such
a street, make sure that a sufficient gap
in the traffic streams
in
all the
lanes
is available to enable you to cross over safely.
(iv)
Divided Roads: For a divided road with a central verge or median,
first
cross over to the central verge after performing your kerb drill. At the
central verge, go over again with your kerb drill and cross over when
it
is safe
to do so.

======================================================================
PAGE 36 of 116
======================================================================
Pig. 14. Do not Cross Between Parked Vehicles
3.3.3. Crossing at traffic signal
(a)
If there
is
a separate pedestrian signal (see
Fig.
4) do not
cross when
the
pedestrian
signal shows
either
a "DON'T
WALK" or Palm of hand or red man. Cross only when "WALK"
or "Green Man" or "Green Signal" comes on. You must cross
with
care.
If the green
signal
starts
flashing, do
not
start
crossing. If you are already midway, quickly finish the crossing.
At crossings where
there
is
a push button
traffic
light
for
pedestrians, push the button and wait for your light to turn
green and then move on but do not depend on light alone
and look both ways and cross cautiously.
(b)
If there is no specific pedestrian signal, only cross when the
signal in your direction of travel has turned green and lane
which you intend to cross has red signal. Even after the signal
has turned green for you, be sure and visually confirm that
all vehicles have stopped before you cross. Remember to look
for turning traffic and remember also that some traffic lights
22



======================================================================
PAGE 37 of 116
======================================================================
allow traffic to proceed in some lanes while other lanes are
stopped.
3.3 .4. Guard rails: If guard rails are provided, do not jump over
them to cross the road but use only the gaps provided. Do not walk
on the roadside of the guard
rails (see
Fig.
12).
3.3.5. Zebra crossings: (see
Fig.
7) The convention for zebra
crossing
is that once a pedestrian has entered a zebra crossing, he
gets priority over other traffic. This convention also implies that, before
stepping on the zebra crossing, the pedestrian should see that there
is no vehicle approaching the zebra crossing immediately and to allow
sufficient distance and time to any approaching traffic to stop before
reaching the zebra crossing. However, in our country, this convention
is not enforced and many vehicle drivers are not educated about this.
As such, even while attempting to cross the road on a zebra crossing,
it is imperative for pedestrians to see that the carriageway is clear,
for a sufficiently long distance of vehicular
traffic to enable them
to cross over safely. Even
if this convention comes to be accepted
widely by the motorists, the advisability of the pedestrians keeping
proper watch and care for their own safety cannot be over stressed.
If there
is
a refuge island in the middle of the zebra crossing
or at uncontrolled intersections, road-way on either side of the island
should be treated separately and kerb drill followed for crossing the
road.
3.3.6. Crossings controlled by police or
traffic wardens:
Do not cross the road if the police or any other officer, e.g.,
traffic
warden or member of the school traffic control squad, controlling
the traffic,
is allowing traffic to move and has signalled you to stop.
3.4.
Getting on or off a Bus
3.4.1. Do not alight or board a moving bus or even a stationary
bus unless
it
is standing on a recognised bus stop.
If you want to
get in a bus
at a "By request" bus stop, give a clear signal for the
bus to stop and do not
try to get in unless the bus has stopped.
3.4.2. When you get off a bus and want to cross the road, wait
until the bus has moved off and you have a clear view of the road.
In case the bus seems to be taking a long time in moving
off, do
not cross the road in front of the bus but come to its back, perform
23



======================================================================
PAGE 38 of 116
======================================================================
3.4.3. Do not board
a bus which
is so
full that some portion
of your body remains outside
its frame work (see
Fig.
16^
Fig.
16. Do not Board an Over-Crowded Bus

======================================================================
PAGE 39 of 116
======================================================================
3.5.
Special Situations
3.5.1.
Extra instructions
for
rural areas
(1)
On
rural roads, walk always facing the oncoming
traffic and
not on
the carriageway but on the shoulders.
(2)
Do not use the carriageway in rural areas for general purposes as drying
clothes, covers, vegetables etc.
3.5.2. Emergency vehicles: Pedestrians should clear off the road
and stand on the side on seeing or hearing an ambulance,
a
fire
engine or police or other emergency vehicle approaching with its lamp
flashing or hear
a two tone horn or siren sounding.
3.5.3. Walking at night: At night, the vehicle drivers are prone
to get momentarily and
partially blinded by the headlights of an
approaching vehicle. As a result, while the pedestrian can see the
headlights of a vehicle, the driver cannot see the pedestrian.
It
is,
therefore, extremely dangerous to stand in the middle of the road
between traffic lanes for crossing at night. You must, therefore, first
start crossing only if you can cross all the lanes in one go. Secondly,
you must cross
at
a place where the area
is well
lit so that your
presence is conspicuous to the approaching traffic. Thirdly, you must
wear light coloured clothings and attach reflectors to your clothing,
attache case, cane or shoes.
3.5.4. Walking in rain: Visibility from vehicles
is reduced due
to rain in a similar way as at night. Road surface becomes slippery
and
walking
and
stopping
distance
of
cars
and
other
vehicles
increases. When raining, pedestrians also run the risk of slipping and
falling. Pedestrians must not, therefore, block their vision by umbrella
and leave plenty of time for crossing. Avoid sprint across the road.
3.5.5. Railway crossings: Many pedestrians fatalities occur at
railway crossings. Do not cross when the crossing gate has begun
to fall. Do not try to squeeze under the gate
to cross. Stop on the
side
if you hear or see the train approaching. Do not take any risk
as the crossing area may be rough and you may
fall on the track
3.5.6. Prohibition: Pedestrians are prohibited from standing on
a highway to solicit employment, business or contribution from the
occupant of any vehicle. Pedestrians are not allowed to stand on or
next to a highway to solicit the watching or guarding of any vehicle
25



======================================================================
PAGE 40 of 116
======================================================================
while parked or about to be parked.
3.5.7. Pedestrians should not cut corners and try to save time
by crossing the road diagonally.
4. ANIMALS & ANIMAL DRAWN AND MANUALLY DRAWN
VEHICLES ON THE ROADS
4.1. Animals individually or in herds should not be
left on the
road or roadland.
It is not permissible to use roadside land for grazing
or exercising animals.
4.2.
If you are herding animals along a road, keep the animals
to the
left side of the road and leave sufficient passage for plying
of vehicles.
If the herd is large, more people must accompany
it and
it should be spaced out longitudinally so as not to block the road,
the herd should be guided along so as to prevent animals straying
into vehicle path.
4.3. Before riding a horse, elephant or a camel on the road, make
sure you can control
it
in
traffic and
that
it does not get out of
control due to blowing of horn or traffic noise. When riding an animal,
keep to the
left and when leading
it keep
it on your left. On one-
way streets, proceed only in the direction of traffic and keep to the
left. Follow the road rules and signals.
4.4. Do not
let any animal loose on the road whether
it
is
a
dog, cow, buffallo, horse, elephant or a camel. Animals must be kept
on leash and should not be allowed to wander about on the road
or allowed
to graze along
it.
4.5. Slow moving and animal drawn vehicles should move on the
extreme left of the road and must give proper and timely signal when
changing lane.
It
is the duty of the driver to look behind and see
before turning. Turn only
if the lane
is clear or there
is sufficient
gap
in
the
traffic.
4.6. Goods loaded on slow moving vehicles should not protrude
on the side, back or front.
If long articles, such as girders or poles
are being carried, a red flag at the end should be displayed. At night
a red lamp of a reflector should be displayed
at the rear end (see
Fig.
17).

should be fixed on the rear portion of such vehicles and remaining
portion painted white.
5. CYCLING ON ROADS
5.1. Inspecting your bicycle
Before getting on your bicycle (see
Fig.
19) be sure
to check
out the following and do not get on the road
if any one of these
checks
is not satisfying:
Fig.
19. The Typical Bicycle
(1)
Check to see
if the seat
is tight and stable and
its height
is such that
the toes of both feet can easily touch the ground.
(2)
See that the handle bars are firm and perpendicular to the front wheel.
(3)
When you mount the seat and grasp the handle bars, your upper body
should be inclined slightly forward and you should be able to see the
signals and traffic clearly in this position. If not adjust the seat and handle
bars. Note that racing cycles with low handles are not safe for normal
riding on
the road.
(4)
Be sure that there
is no tendency for the feet to slip off the pedal, due
to the pedal being worn out or
in any other way damaged.
(5)
Check out the brakes on both the front and the rear wheels. At a speed
of ten kilometres per hour, you should be able to come to full stop in
less than three metres.
(6)
Ensure that a warning device (bell) has been fixed and can be operated
without removing your hand from the handle.
28



======================================================================
PAGE 43 of 116
======================================================================
(7)
Ensure that you have front and rear lamps and these are working. Ensure
that your rear mudguard
is painted white and
it has an
effective red
reflector.
(8)
Make sure that your tyres are in good condition and are properly inflated.
5.2. Your cycle should be visible
at night and be conspicuous
during the day. For this purpose the front and rear guards should
be painted yellow and orange or provided with reflectors. Pedal edges
and rear should be provided with reflectors. You should also wear
fluorescent yellow/orange vest with reflectorised tapes stitched in a
suitable pattern.
5.3. Before starting to ride, find a place
in the road that offers
good
vision and enter
the
traffic from
the
left
side
after having
carefully looked both ways.
5.4. Before turning right or left or moving out to pass or pulling
up, always glance back or look through rear view mirror behind and
make sure
it is safe. Give a clear arm signal to show what you intend
to do
(see
Fig.
20).
Fig. 20. Arm Signals
5.5.
If you want to turn to the right, move
to the extreme right
of the road and wait for a safe gap in the
traffic in both directions
29



======================================================================
PAGE 44 of 116
======================================================================
before you
start to cross.
5.6. On busy roads and
at night,
if you want
to turn right
it
is safer to stop on the
left hand side of the
road, wait for a safe
gap
in the
traffic and then
start
to
turn.
5.7. Do not ride more than two side by side. Ride in single file
in busy or narrow roads. Do not ride on
a footpath.
5.8. At
a road intersection with
traffic
lights when the
signal
is against you, do not zig-zag your way to the front of the waiting
queue of the vehicles.
5.9. While riding, observe the following:
(a)
Always hold the handle-bar with both hands and keep your feet on the
pedals. Except when you are giving signal,
it
is against the law to ride
with one hand.
Fig. 21. Do not hold to a Faster Vehicle
(b)
Do not hold on to another vehicle (specially a fast moving one) or another
cyclist (see Fig.
21).
(c)
Do not carry any passenger on your cycle, unless your cycle has been
altered to carry one.
(d)
Do not ride too close behind another vehicle or in between the vehicles.
30



======================================================================
PAGE 45 of 116
======================================================================
(e)
Do not carry anything which
is likely to affect your balance or be nuisance
to other vehicles, e.g. heavy weight or long bars or which
is likely to
get entangled with the wheels or. chain (see Fig.
22).
Fig. 22. Do not Overload Your Cycle
(f)
Do not lead an animal while riding cycle.
5.10.
If a separate cycle track is provided, do use
it instead of
using the main carriageway.
5.11. Do not enter into speed competition with any other cyclist
or vehicle on the road.
5.12. Be on the defensive rather than dashing. Do not indulge
in any form of trick cycling on the road, which
is not the correct
place for
it.
-
v
5.13. Gain familiarity with the rules of the road, road signs and
markings. These are applicable to you also.
5.14.
It
is dangerous to have two people on
a bike
in heavy
traffic. Even where there
is
little
traffic, two on
a bike should be
avoided. Where there
is a holding seat,
it is permissible for a child
to be carried.
31



======================================================================
PAGE 46 of 116
======================================================================
5.15. Do not attempt to ride with loose fitting shoes or clothings
which will hinder or clog the pedals, wheels or the chain.
5.16. Do not ride holding an open umbrella.
It is dangerous to
ride with a dog or other animal running along on a rope or chain.
Things should not be carried by the hand and hung down from the
handle bars.
5.17. Remember that you should be seen as easily as
a larger
vehicle and that you should always give clear arm signal to let drivers
behind you know what you intend to do especially at roundabouts
and intersections. Always look behind before making any change in
direction and do so only
if
it
is
safe.
5.18. At night and also inside tunnels and on foggy days, keep
the light turned on. Should you be momentarily blinded by lights
of approaching vehicles, pull over and stop
at the far
left side of
the road and wait for a few seconds until the car has passed and
vision has recovered.
5.19. Should your vehicle brakes
or lights go out of order, walk along
side the bike pushing
it with your
hands. Do the same
if road surface
is extremely slippery and there is a
lot of wind,
dust or
rain.
5.20. There
are many bicycle
accidents in which a bicycle moving
along the far
left of the road gets
hit by
a car or truck
as
it makes
a
left
turn
(see
Fig.
23). When
intending
to
continue
straight
at
such intersections take special care
to look out
for
the
position and
speed of vehicles turning to the left.
5.21.

green.
(2)
When making a turn to the
left, check for safety behind you and give
the proper turning hand signal well
in advance. You should stay as far
to the left as possible and slow down to a safe speed.
It
is the cyclist's
responsibility to turn so as not to interfere with the progress of pedestrians
already in the pedestrian crossing.
(3)
For
a right turn check the
traffic behind you with a glance over the
shoulder and give a hand signal. The hand signal consists of extending
your right arm out straight, horizontally with the palm facing down. Stay
over as far to the left of the road as possible, going straight across to
the far side of the intersection and then make a smooth sweeping turn.
Keep your speed down so that you can make a safe turn.
(4)
At roundabouts, stay in the left hand lane and look out particularly for
vehicle crossing your path
to leave the roundabout.
6. ALL MOTORISED VEHICLES
6.1. Motorised vehicles are the most letha! of those using the
roads and the responsibility rests on its drivers to protect the other
users especially the pedestrians,
cyclists and two-wheeler drivers.
Meticulous compliance of the rules given here would reduce the risk
of your getting involved in accidents.
6.2. Pre-Drive Checks
(i)
Before getting into the vehicle check whether you have the valid licence,
registration certificate, inspection certificate and insurance policy. 'Learn-
er Licence' holders should also check
if the
'L' plate
is affixed to the
vehicle and driver supervisor
is present.
(ii)
Check the vehicle and
its fixtures every day, which should include check
of the cooling water
in the radiator, engine
oil,
air pressure
in tyres,
conditions of tyres, headlights, brake lights, direction indicator, steering
and the brakes. Clean the wind screen, windows and wiper. After getting
in, adjust the seat, rear view and side mirrors, fasten seat belts
if any,
and wear your glasses,
if you need them to see clearly.
6.3. Plan the Day's Driving
(i)
An important aspect of driving
is trip planning. This applies not only
to long distance driving but also to shorter trips. Your driving plan should
match your driving skills, endurance and one's performance. Adequate
trip planning can help minimise the need to slow down, stop suddenly
or make sudden turns. Trips will be safer and more enjoyable.
(ii)
It
is best to use a road map and plan
in advance as to where you will
drive, how you will get there, the number of hours
it should take, and
the rest and parking spots.
33



======================================================================
PAGE 48 of 116
======================================================================
(iii)
A break from driving should be taken every two hours when driving
over long distances. If you become drowsy, pull over immediately to the
road side, and take nap or get your blood circulating before you continue
your journey.
6.4 When Not to Drive
Do not drive when you are tired, worried or
if you have taken
medicines for allergy, cold, headache etc., that induce drowsiness.
In such conditions your power of concentration and ability
to act
decisively gets impaired rapidly and chances
of
traffic accidents
increase.
It is against the law to drive under the influence of alcohol,
drugs, stimulators,
etc.
6.5.
Starting Off
(i)
Never set your vehicle in motion until you have looked around and under
it for children and animals. Look into the rear view mirror as well as
on both sides and behind the vehicle to see that there
is nothing around
to interfere with your movement. Give proper signal before moving out.
(ii)
Don't move your vehicle until the road
is clear and you are certain that
gap available will allow you to safely enter the
traffic stream without
causing damage to yourself and others. Once on the road, keep to the
left and never drive on the crown of the road irrespective of discomfort
involved.
6.6. Lane Driving
(i)
Driving along: On a six-lane (or wider) road with a dividing median,
keep to the middle lane as far as possible, leaving the extreme
left lane
for slow moving vehicles and the lane on your right for vehicles which
want to overtake you or go at a faster pace. Do not weave from lane
to lane; stick to your own lane. In case of a four lane divided road, move
on the right lane leaving the left lane for slow moving vehicles. Always
allow others to overtake you,
if they want to. For a two lane road, keep
to the
left, except when you intend to overtake or turn right or when
you have to pass stationary vehicles or pedestrians on the road. On such
occasions observe all safety precautions.
(ii)
Stick to your lane of travel and do not unnecessarily wander from one
lane to another.
If you need to move into another lane,
first look into
your mirror for the
traffic following you and
if
it
is safe, give signal
and then move over. Be sure that
in doing so, you are not compelling
another driver
to change his lane or speed of travel.
(iii)
In a traffic held-up, do not try to reach as far ahead as possible by jumping
the queue by cutting into another lane.
(iv)
On
a
three
lane
single
carriageway,
use
the
middle
lane
only
for
overtaking and turning right. Remember that this
is a lane common for
34



======================================================================
PAGE 49 of 116
======================================================================
you as well as
for on-coming
traffic and no one has exclusive right of
its use.
(v)
On
a three lane dual carriageway, you may move
in the middle lane,
leaving the extreme
left lane for cycles and slow moving vehicles and
the lane on your right for vehicles overtaking you or going faster than
you. You may use that lane only for overtaking or for turning right and
that too after taking
all
the precautions.
(vi)
In one way streets, choose the correct lane for your exit as soon as you
can. Never change lanes suddenly. Unless road markings indicate oth-
erwise, choose the
left hand lane when going to the
left and the right
hand lane when going to the right, choose any lane when going straight
on. Always remember that other vehicles will be passing you on both
sides.
(vii)
On single lane roads which are plentiful
in the country, when you see
a vehicle coming towards you or the driver behind you wants to overtake,
you should partly go over the shoulders and allow the other to pass you.
(viii)
On
hilly roads, the vehicles going uphill have the prior
right of way
and the vehicles going downhill should give way so that they do not
have to stop.
(ix)
When approaching junctions, be guided by any lane indication arrows
markedon the road and take the lane appropriate to your further direction
of travel (see
Fig.
24).
Fig. 24. Choose Lane According to Marking
00
If, on any road, a specific lane is earmarked for buses only and
is indicated
as such by proper signs and markings,
it should not be used by other
vehicles. In your travel, choose the proper lane for your route and stay
in
it until
for good reason you must move
to another. Do not cut
in
35



======================================================================
PAGE 50 of 116
======================================================================
from one lane
to another, even
if the
traffic
in your lane has slowed
down.
6.7. Keeping Space Cushion
6.7.1.
If another driver makes a mistake, you need time to react.
The only way you can be
sure, you
will have enough time,
is to
leave plenty of space between you and the vehicles around you. Try
to drive
in the middle of a lane and keep
a cushion of space on
all sides (see
Fig.
25).
Fig. 25
Vehicle Space Cushion
6.7.2. Front Cushion
(1) Do not follow the vehicle ahead too closely;
if the vehicle
ahead stops or slows down suddenly, you will not be able to stop
in time. Before
a car stops,
it covers a reaction distance from the
time when the driver first senses danger, applies the brakes to when
the braking action
first comes to take
place.
In addition, there
is
the braking distance covered in the time from when the braking action
first begins to take place
to when the vehicle actually comes to a
halt. These together make stopping distance and is given as a function
of the driving speed in Table-1.

It
is desirable to keep the required stopping distances in mind
and to drive
at speed
at which you can stop safely even when a
dangerous situation suddenly arises.
(2) In situations where
it
is not possible to keep the aforesaid
safe stopping distance between the adjacent vehicles, e.g. in urban/
semi-urban areas under high traffic conditions, as a thumb rule for
safety,
a headway of atleast one car length for every 15 km/hour
speed (as illustrated
in Fig.
26) must be ensured.
45km/h
"'tJ^&d^X^^^^
60 km/h

NOTE
: INCREASE THESE GAPS IN BAD LIGHT AND ON WET OR DUSTY ROADS.

======================================================================
PAGE 52 of 116
======================================================================
(3) In some situations you need extra cushion. Allow a longer
following distance when:
(i)
Travelling on slippery road or when tyre treads are worn out;
(ii)
Following motorcycles.
If the motorcycle
falls, you would need extra
distance to avoid the rider. The chances of a fall are greater on wet roads,
road bumps, rough roads or metal grating;
(iii)
When driver behind you passes, increase distance to allow room for the
passing vehicle;
(iv)
When following drivers whose rear view is blocked. The drivers of trucks,
buses or vans pulling trailers cannot see you very well and could slow
down;
(v)
While carrying heavy load. The extra weight increases
the braking
distance;
(vi)
Driving of high speeds;
(vii)
Following large vehicles that block your view of road ahead;
(viii)
On
a upgrade or a
hill;
(ix)
Approaching slow moving vehicle.
6.7.3. Side cushion: You also heed a space cushion in the lateral
side, so that you have room to react when other cars make sudden
move towards your lane. To help avoid accidents remember the
following points:
(i)
Avoid driving alongside other vehicles on multi-lane roads. If possible,
move ahead of the other cars or drop back.
(ii)
Keep as much lateral space as possible between you and oncoming cars.
(iii)
Make room for cars entering from side. If there
is no one next to you,
signal check traffic and move over a lane.
(iv)
Keep a space between you and parked cars. Someone may open a car
door or step out between parked cars or a car may start
to pull out
suddenly.
(v)
If there
is a child or a bike on your left, give a wide berth as he
is most
likely to make a sudden move.
(vi)
If there are animals moving along the road, do not blow horn to startle
them and keep a good margin to take care of sudden change in direction
towards you.
6.7.4. Cushion behind: Watch the road behind you by frequendy
glancing in your rear-view mirror. If the following vehicle is too close
to you, give him opportunity to overtake you by moving carefully
to the left. Maintain a steady speed and signal in advance when you
38



======================================================================
PAGE 53 of 116
======================================================================
have to slow down or change lane. Never accelerate while you are
being overtaken. Look over your shoulder for vehicle overtaking in
blind spot area (see
Fig.
27).
6.8. Overtaking
6.8.1. Steps in overtaking: Following order of operations will
ensure safe overtaking of other vehicles:
(1)
Make sure that overtaking
is not prohibited on
that stretch of road.
(2)
Before you start overtaking, make sure that road
is clear on your right
side for sufficient distance to complete overtaking safely. Then look into
your rear view mirror to see
if there
is a vehicle following closely and
check to be sure that there
is no vehicle on your right and right rear
end. Look over your shoulder
in the "blind area" or
in side mirror,
if
there
is one, to ensure that there
is no vehicle on right rear end (see
Fig.
27).

======================================================================
PAGE 54 of 116
======================================================================
(3)
Thereafter, give a right turn signal to let your intention be known well
in time
(see
Fig.
28).
Fig. 28. Arm Signals
(4)
Then accelerate gradually and smoothly cross-over into the right side
lane and pass by the vehicle making sure to keep a safe lateral distance
from the right side of the car you are passing.
(5)
Give a left turn signal, stay in the overtaking lane until you can see the
vehicle you passed in the rear-view mirror and are sure
it
is behind you.
40



======================================================================
PAGE 55 of 116
======================================================================
At that point you may slowly and smoothly move back into the lane you
left behind (see
Fig.
28).
(6)
Turn off your signal.
(7)
DO NOT suddenly cut in front of the overtaken vehicle or unreasonably
squeeze in front of other cars or draw up too close to vehicles running
parallel to your car.
6.8.2. Overtake only on the right, except:
(a)
When the driver
in front has signalled his intention of turning to the
right and you can overtake him on the left without getting in the way
of others.
(b)
When you want to turn to the
left at a junction.
(c)
When traffic
is moving slowly in queues and vehicles in the lane on your
right are moving at a pace slower than
in your lane.
6.8.3. When you are being overtaken, slow down a little so that
the other vehicle may overtake without increasing its speed too much.
In any case do not accelerate.
6.8.4. On an ordinary two-lane road, allow the on-coming vehicle
to pass you before you overtake parked vehicles, slow vehicles or
Other obstructions on your left side.
6.8.5. You must not overtake,
if you
have to cross or straddle
double white lines or double white lines, with an unbroken line nearer
to you or after "No Overtaking Sign" and
till the end of restoration
sign or in zig-zag area before zebra crossings.
6.8.6. Do not overtake
at or when approaching
(a)
a pedestrian crossing;
(b)
a road junction or within 30 m of an intersection;
(c)
a corner or bend;
(d)
a crest of a vertical curve;
(e)
a level crossing.
6.8.7. Do not overtake
(i)
When the vehicle you are overtaking is itself overtaking another vehicle
and also when you are being overtaken by other vehicle.
(ii)
When to do so would force, another vehicle(s) to slow down or swerve,
(iii)
WHEN IN DOUBT—DO NOT OVERTAKE
(iv) Where road narrows down
41



======================================================================
PAGE 56 of 116
======================================================================
(v)
Where
it would involve driving over an area marked with diagonal strips
or cheverons.
6.9. Getting Through Intersections
6.9.1. Maximum number of Occidents occur at intersections. Be
very alert and cautious when approaching and negotiating an inter-
section. Consider your road
position and your speed.
Enter the
intersection area when you are sure
it is safe to do so and that you
will not block
it.
6.9.2. At an unsignalised intersection with double broken white
lines across the road and/or with a "GIVE WAY" sign, you must let
the
traffic on the cross-road go by
first and enter only
if a gap
is
available. At an unsignalised junction with a "STOP" sign and a double
solid white line across your approach, you must first stop at the line,
wait for safe gap in the traffic and move only if a safe gap is available.
6.9.3. When there are road signs or pavement markings giving
instructions on from which lane one should turn or what type of
vehicle may turn etc., these instructions must be complied with. When
making a left turn, take the left lane in advance. When taking a right
turn go over in advance or close to the centre line of the road as
possible. When you are intending to turn right at an intersection,
if any other vehicle coming from opposite direction is in the process
of going straight or turning
left, even if you have arrived first, you
must not obstruct the passage of that vehicle. At places showing like
blue coloured compulsory turn signs, vehicle must turn compulsorily
in the designated
direction, even
if you
desire
to go
in another
direction.
6.9.4. On roads where there
are designated
traffic lanes with
arrows or other signs and pavement markings stipulating from which
lane one is permitted to turn and in which direction, all turning and
driving must be done
in conformity with these stipulations.
If the
vehicle in front of you should give a signal to turn right or
left or
to change lanes
in order to travel or
a
traffic lane designated by
road sign or pavement markings, you must not hinder that vehicle's
effort to change lanes.
6.9.5. Box-markings [see
Fig.
9(d)] Box junctions have
criss-
cross yellow lines painted on the road. You must not enter the box
if your exit road or lane from
it
is not clear. But you may enter
42



======================================================================
PAGE 57 of 116
======================================================================
the box when you want to turn right and are prevented merely by
on coming
traffic or vehicles wanting to make
a
right
turn.
6.9.6.
If you
are going on a minor road and approaching an
intersection with a major road, stop at the intersection, look around
and wait for a safe gap in the
traffic to negotiate the intersection.
Traffic on
the major road has
a
prior
right of way but
it has
a*
corresponding duty to be careful about traffic from minor road. At
intersections where the width of road seems to be uniform and there
is no stop or give way sign, you must give way to vehicle coming
from your right.
6.9.7. When there is a hold up in the traffic due to adverse signal,
wait at your position in the queue and do not try to zig-zag your
way to any position in the
front.
6.9.8. Signalised intersection:
If the signal shows green light,
you have
the
right
of way,
but do
not
try
to
rush through
the
intersection
for
fear of change
in
the
signal.
Drive through
the
intersection cautiously, without undue hurry, and when you are sure
it is absolutely safe. Never go forward beyond the "STOP LINE"
if
the signal shows an amber light or an amber and red light together.
Where
traffic lights have
a "LEFT TURN" green arrow filter signal,
do not get into the lane where filtering
is allowed unless you want
to go in the direction shown by the arrow. Then also proceed carefully
and give way to pedestrians.
6.10. Turning
6.10.1. When turning, slow down to a speed that enables you
to keep control
in case of emergencies and react
to unexpected
situations.
It
is important to be
alert when turning. Watch out for
pedestrians and other traffic. To complete a turn safely, three things
are important: Signalling (see Fig. 28) positioning in proper turning
lane and completing the turn in proper lane.
6.10.2. Mistakes rectification: Sudden turns or lane changes
cause accidents, so if you start through an intersection, keep going.
If you start to make a turn, follow through.
If you make
a mistake,
go on to the next intersection. You can work your way back to where
you want
to go.
6.10.3. On two lane two way road, make right turn from as close
43



======================================================================
PAGE 58 of 116
======================================================================
to the centre line as possible (see Fig. 29). Left turn should be made
from or close
to
the
left edge of the road
as possible. On
multi-
lane roads
start from the lane closest
to where you want
to go.
6.10.4.
Completing
the
turn in proper lane:
If you
are turning on to a road which
has more than one lane in the
direction you wish
to
travel,
turn into the closest lane going
in that direction. For example,
turn into the right lane when
making
a
right
turn.
If you
want to change to another lane,
move only after you have ne-
gotiated your turn and
traffic
is clear.
6.10.5.
Turning
right:
Well
before you
turn
to
the
right, use your mirror to ascer-
Fig. 29. Completing Turn in Proper Lane
tain the position and movement
of the traffic behind you. Give
a right turn signal and when it
is safe, enter the lane just left of the middle of the road or in the
space marked for right turning traffic, the traffic behind you will now
be passing on your
left (see
Fig.
30). Now wait for a safe gap in
the oncoming traffic and when you find
it, make the turn without
cutting the corner. Remember again "MIRROR-SIGNAL-MANOEUVRE".
When turning right on a dual carriageway or when turning in from
a side road and then turning right, wait in the opening in the central
verge
until you find
a safe gap in the
traffic
in the
second half
of the road then cross over. When turning right at a junction where
there
is an opposing vehicle also turning right, drive your vehicle
so that you keep
it to your right and pass behind
it (offside to offside).
Check for other traffic on the carriageway intending to cross before
completing the turn.
6.10.6. Turning left: Well before you turn
left, look into your
mirror and give a left turn signal. You should be particularly careful
44



======================================================================
PAGE 59 of 116
======================================================================
Fig. 30. Turning Right
about cyclists and other slow
moving vehicles which are al-
ways confined to the left-most
part of the road (see Fig. 3D.
If absolutely safe, move over to
the
left lane and take
a
turn
smoothly without swerving to
the
right before
or
after
the
turn.
6.10.7. U-turn: Make a U-
turn
if you can do so without
endangering
other
traffic.
If
choosing a place to make a U-
turn, make
sure
that
drivers
approaching from all directions
can see
you. Remember
that
crest of hill or a curve on the
road can block another driver's
view of your vehicle. Do not
make
a
U-turn
where
it
is
prohibited.

======================================================================
PAGE 60 of 116
======================================================================
6.10.8. Roundabouts: At a roundabout,
the traffic coming from
the right i.e. which is already in the roundabout has the prior right
of way. Give way to
traffic coming from your right (Fig. 32a) but
keep moving
if your way is clear. Unless the approach road on the
roundabout
itself are
clear or local conditions,
or road markings
indicate otherwise, you should:
(i)
When turning left approach the roundabout in the
left lane and leave
by that very lane
(Fig. 32b).
(ii)
When going forward, approach
in the middle lane and keep to
it. As
you enter the roundabout, use right turn indicator to make
it known
to the traffic following you that you are not turning to the
left. Switch
on
to
left
turn
indicator
before
the
exit
to
be
taken
(Fig.
32c).
(iii)
When turning fight, approach the intersection
in the right hand lane;
use the right turn indicator before entering the roundabout and continue
showing
it while keeping to the right hand lane in the roundabout; switch
on to the
left hand indicator before the exit to be taken {Fig. 32d).
(iv)
When giving right, leave the roundabout in the middle or
left lane
(if
it
is free of slow moving traffic) of the exit road unless traffic conditions
dictate use of right hand
lane.
(v)
When
in a roundabout, be careful about the vehicles crossing in front
of you and leaving by the next exit.
6.11. Reversing
(a)
Before you reverse, make sure there are no pedestrians specially children,
or any other impediments on the road behind you. Be specially careful
of the blind area behind you
i.e. area which
is obscured from the driver
seat because of the design of vehicle body.
(b)
It is always better to get down from the vehicle and see for yourself that
there are no obstructions at the back. Otherwise,
if you can get the help
of some one who can guide you
in reversing, seek
it.
(c)
Never reverse from a side road to a main road.
If there
is no other way,
seek some one's help for
it.
6.12. Right of Way
6.12.1. Moving with and through traffic demands skill that can
be obtained only by extensive practice. The actual physical skills are
relatively easy but the crucial judgement skills associated with the
different vehicular movements require practice. But more important
is understanding of the concept of right-of-way. The general rule is
that you must give way
to
traffic coming from your
right
(see
Fig. 33). The law does not give you an absolute right,
it only requires
46



======================================================================
PAGE 62 of 116
======================================================================
you to yield to other traffic. Sometimes a driver going through an
intersection must stop for a car coming from
left,
if necessary
to
prevent an accident. Do not insist on your right-of-way,
if, by doing
so, you will be involved in an accident. However,
if an accident does
occur,
the other party would be declared
as
at
fault.
Fig. 33. Give Way Marking
6.12.2. When there are no signs, signals or markings to tell you
what to do,
the following rules should be followed:
(1)
Drivers turning right must 'give way' to oncoming cars going straight
ahead.
(2)
Drivers entering a rotary/traffic circle must yield right of way to drivers
already
in the circle or attempting to leave
it.
(3)
A vehicle entering a main road from a driveway or an alley must come
to a complete stop and wait until the main road
is clear.
(4)
Drivers must yield/give way to pedestrians under the following condi-
tions:
48



======================================================================
PAGE 63 of 116
======================================================================
(a)
When a blind pedestrian carrying a cane or accompanied by a guide
dog
is crossing anywhere.
(b)
When pedestrians are crossing on a painted pedestrian crossing.
(c)
When pedestrians are crossing the roadway at an intersection and
there
is no
traffic light or marked crossing.
(d)
When pedestrians are crossing across a private driveway or alley.
(e)
When the car
is turning a corner and pedestrians are crossing with
the
light.
(5)
When two vehicles approach to enter an intersection from different roads
at approximately the same time, driver coming from the right must yield
to vehicles coming from the
left.
(6)
At a four way stop the driver reaching the intersection first should proceed
first (of course
all cars must
first stop).
6.13. Stopping and Parking
6.13.1. Do not park where parking is prohibited and do not even
stop where parking and stopping
is prohibited. At many locations,
parking
is
prohibited,
and
others both parking and
stopping
is
prohibited. Difference is in the intention and period of stop. Parking
is a state of continued stopping exceeding 3 minutes in which driver
may leave the vehicle such that the vehicle cannot be driven right
away. When one stops
to
let people
in and out of a car
if bags
and goods are unloaded,
it is a stop and not a parking e.g. at airport
entrance.
6.13.2. Before you park or stop, ensure
that
it
is
legal
to do
so in that zone.
If there
is
a "No Parking" or "No Parking and No
Stopping" sign posted nearby and/or there is a yellow line (continuous
or otherwise) painted on the curb or
at the edge of pavement,
it
is illegal
to park in the length defined by the yellow
line or the
definition plate of the no parking sign. There may be time limits and
days of week defined for no parking. Illegal parking or stopping not
only creates traffic congestions and other problems in the area, but
because
it cuts down on
visibility,
it causes accidents.
6.13.3. Never park your vehicle
in the following places:
(1)
On the side walk or pedestrian crossing
(2)
Within an intersection or 10m from edge of intersection or signal
(3)
Along or opposite any street excavation or obstruction or parked vehicles
49



======================================================================
PAGE 64 of 116
======================================================================
(4)
At any place which will obstruct
traffic
(5)
On any bridge structure,
in a tunnel or underpass or on a expressway
(6)
On a railway crossing
(7)
In front of public or private driveway
(8)
Near a traffic sign or sign also as not to obstruct
its
visibility
(9)
Within 5m of fire hydrant and 10m of driveway to entrance of a fire station
or a police station or a hospital and an ambulance entrance or a pedestrian
crossing.
(10)
At a bus stop or 5m from
it.
6.13.4. How to park
(1)
If there
is
a kerb, park on
left side
as close
to
it as you
can (but not more than 0.3m away).
If there
is no kerb pull off on
the shoulders as far as you can safely do so but leave 0.75 m width
for pedestrians to move on. When you must park on the road allow
atleast 3m for passing vehicles. Make sure that your car
is visible
for atleast 150 m in both directions. If these conditions are not met,
find another parking place and walk back.
(2) Always park in the direction of traffic movement. Make sure
that your car cannot move. Engage your parking brake and shift the
gear to engage the engine.
If you are parked on a sloping road, or
a
hill, then your wheels are as follows:
(i)
On down slope
if there
is a kerb on the
left, steering wheel should be
turned
left towards the kerb. Put the gear
in reverse.
(ii)
On up-slope,
if there
is a kerb on the left, steering wheel should be turned
right so that
if the vehicle slides back the wheel will be supported by
the kerb. Put the gear
in
first.
(iii)
If there
is no kerb, turn the wheel towards right so that vehicle always
slips towards the shoulder and put a brick or block in front of the tyres
if facing down or back
if facing up
hill.
(3)
If there is a designated parking bay in the area park the vehicle
in the bays marked.
6.13.5. Before opening any door of a vehicle, look round to ensure
there
is no one on the road or footpath close enough to be hit by
the door. Get out of the vehicle on the side nearer the kerb and
insist on others (specially children) doing the same even if they are
sitting on the other side of the vehicle.
50



======================================================================
PAGE 65 of 116
======================================================================
6.13.6. Before getting off, see that the doors have been properly
closed and locked. Similarly when coming to stop, get as close to
the kerb as possible. Before leaving the vehicle, make sure your
handbrake is on firmly and the engine and headlamps are switched
off. Always lock your vehicle and do not let the ignition key remain
in the vehicle.
6.13.7. Do not park your vehicle on the road
if there
is
fog.
If
it cannot be helped, do not leave your vehicle without
lights.
6.13.8. If vehicles have to be parked for the night without lights,
they should be parked as near the
street light as possible.
6.14. Driving in Hazardous Conditions
6.14.1. Night driving: Keep in mind that night driving means
poor visibility, expect a reduction in your ability to distinguish cars,
pedestrians or people or cycles as quickly as in the day time. Ability
to judge speed diminishes and to make matters worse, you can expect
a good number of drunks on the street and a lot of tired pedestrians
and cyclists. You must, therefore, drive slower and keep a constant
eye out for any roadside pedestrian, cyclist or car that is illuminated
by passing headlights even briefly.
If you see
a flashing of brake
light or see
a weave or even
a single stagger slow down.
6.14.2. Reduce the night accident danger in following ways:-
(a)
You must drive with head,
tail and side lights on.
(b)
The windscreen must be as clean as possible at all times, because a vehicle
travelling along a road acquires fine particles of dust which adhere to
the windscreen and this dust catches the rays from headlights of oncoming
vehicles and diffuse them across the glass thereby causing glare.
(c)
Drive at night when rested. Fatigue impaires night vision and other factors
of driving.
(d)
Know the range of your headlights and know how well you can see at
various distances. That
is, be able to stop within the visibility range of
your headlights. Never overdrive your headlights.
(e)
Avoid using dark or coloured glasses
at night.
(0
Keep headlights properly adjusted. Ensure that the depressed beams are
not so as to give the oncoming driver's a glare.
(g)
Avoid smoking
(h)
Keep your vehicle's battery, lights and electrical system in good con-
dition.
51



======================================================================
PAGE 66 of 116
======================================================================
(i)
Avoid
lighting matches or using bright lights
in your vehicle. Keep
interior lights off. You should keep your eyes adapted to darkness.
(j)
When facing glare from approaching headlights, reduce speed and avoid
looking directly at the lights, to avoid blinding by the direct exposure.
(k)
Keep speed reduced or stop,
if need be, until your eyes recover from
the effects of the
lights.
(1)
Always dip your headlights when meeting other vehicles. A driver blinded
by your high beam headlights may sidewipe your car.
(m)
Depress your headlights when following another vehicle. The glare
caused by your lights shining in his rear view mirror can reduce his vision
and cause an accident.
(n)
When overtaking, keep your lights on low beam. If on-coming vehicles
are
still on high beam, blink your lights up and down as a signal.
If
he does not lower his
lights
in time, do not retaliate.
(0)
In wet weather, use the screen wipers because
particles of dirt and
mist on the screen obstruct the view. This
is made much worse by
the lights of approaching vehicles. Any reflection on the inside of the
screen caused by light from behind will have a bad effect on driver's
vision.
(p)
A professional driver should get his eye sight periodically tested. Keep
away from the wheel
if you feel that your eye sight has been seriously
impaired for night driving.
6.15. Bad Weather Driving
6.15.1. Driving in dust storm: Dust storm reduce the forward
and lateral vision and dust also blinds pedestrians, cyclists or motor
cyclists who may wander across your path. In addition, weak tree
branches, power cables or hoardings may break and fall across the
road. In such conditions keep your lights on and drive very slowly
watching for pedestrians, cyclists, etc. Use the centre line marking,
guard rails or tail lights of vehicles in front to guide you along the
road but do not drive too close
to the vehicle
in
front. Use your
horn freely to avoid danger especially at blind curves or turns. Do
not park under trees, hoardings or power lines.
6.15.2. Driving in rain
(1)
When
it rains, visibility
is cut down, windscreen gets fogged over, road
surface becomes
slippery and pedestrians
in
their anxiety
to avoid
getting soaked
run
across
the
roads.
Therefore,
drive
slowly and
keep longer distance between
the vehicle
in
front and
give way
to
pedestrians.
(2)
Drive carefully and avoid sudden starting, overtaking and turning. Such
52



======================================================================
PAGE 67 of 116
======================================================================
manoeuvres can cause skids and overtaking under wet conditions.
(3)
Rain softens the ground and can cause landslides. Don't get too close
to the outside edge of winding
hill
roads.
(4)
Because of the oil and mud which gradually coat the surface of paved
roads, they are most slippery when
it first begins to rain and before oil
and mud gets washed away. Drive very carefully at such times.
(5)
Drivers must slow down around pedestrians so as not to splash them
with mud and dirty water.
(6)
When you pass through a deep puddle of water there is danger that water
leaks into the brake drums causing the brakes to malfunction. As such
avoid going through deep water and after passing through, test the brakes
and squeeze the water out by repeated application of brakes
till the brakes
take hold. Slow down under such conditions.
(7)
Be sure that your wind screen wipers are in good working order. Keep
the windscreen clean of dust, oil etc. When your inside glass fogs up,
clean
it with dry cloth and open the side window. Put on the heater
if installed
in the vehicle.
6.15.3. Driving in fog: Put on your light in fog and drive slowly,
using road markings, guide
rails and
tail lights of the car in front
as
a guide.
If you have yellow fog
lights use them. Use them
at
blind corners.
6.15.4. Driving in snow
(1)
As roads become extremely slippery often
it has snowed or iced, drive
with chains, snow tires and reduce your speed.
(2)
Avoid sudden steering and braking as
it can cause skids. Drive in lower
gear.
7. MOTOR-CYCLING ON ROADS
(INCLUDING SCOOTERS)
7.1. Preparing to Ride
For a motorcyclist/scooterist, completion of the journey safely,
without any mishap depends on proper protective gear and check
of vehicle before
start. The following are essential:
7.1.1. Protective gear: Most injuries to motorcyclist or scooterist
are on the head or on the
legs. Most problems arise due to dust/
insects getting in the eyes. Three most important things, therefore,
53



======================================================================
PAGE 68 of 116
======================================================================
are leg-guards, helmet and eye protection (see
Fig.
34).
LEG GUARD
Fig. 34. Protective Gear
'A' Helmet: No rider should enter a road without a helmet. Pillion
rider should also wear a helmet. Even a poor helmet is a
little better
than no helmet. When you put on the helmet, make sure
it is securely
fastened. Studies of cases of accidents show that a loose helmet is
only slightly better than not wearing a helmet at all. A helmet should:
(a)
Meet the ISI requirements.
\ b)
Fit snugly
all the way around.
(c)
Have a strong helmet strap. Snap fasteners can unsnap
in an impact.
(d)
Be of light colour having reflective tapes on the back and sides.
(e)
Be free of defects such as cracks, loose padding, frayed strips or exposed
metal.
54



======================================================================
PAGE 69 of 116
======================================================================
'B' Eye protection: Your eyes need protection from wind, dust,
dirt, rain, insects and the small pebble thrown up from vehicles ahead.
A plastic face/shield
is best but a
set of goggles can also suffice.
To be effective eye protection must:
(a)
Give a clear view on either side.
(b)
Be made of materia] that does not shatter.
(c)
Fasten securely so that
it cannot be blown
off.
(d) Allow
air to pass through so
it won't fog.
(e)
Allow enough room for eye glasses or rim glasses
if needed.
Tinted eye protection should not be worn at night.
7.1.2. Vehicle check: Make sure that you are familiar with the
motorcycle before you ride
it on the road. Check the tyres for proper
air pressure, worn or uneven tread and or damage or cracks. A blow
out on a motorcycle can be extremely dangerous.
Check brakes by trying front and rear separately and ensure that
each one holds the vehicle when
it
is fully applied. Check your
headlights, turn lights, brake lights and tail lights. Check horns. Make
sure that the drive chain is properly adjusted and lubricated. Adjust
mirrors before you start so that you can see on both sides of your
body.
7,2. Visibility of Motorcycle/Scooter
7.2.1. Drivers of cars involved in collision with motorcycles often
say that they never saw the motorcycle. The motorcycle rider must,
therefore,
for his own safety make
efforts to make himself more
noticeable. The best thing to do is to keep the headlights on at all
times. This makes the vehicles one and a half times more visible.
Wear bright coloured reflective helmets and clothing. Yellow, orange
and red colours are most easily seen. Reflective tape clothing also
helps, carry a reflective vest to wear at night.
7.2.2. Make extensive use of horn to draw attention to yourself.
Blow a horn while overtaking, when you see
a parked car about
to start or while passing cyclists or
if you have doubts about what
others might do.
7.2.3. Keep your motorcycle where
it can be seen. Know the
"blind spots" for vehicle of cars and trucks and do not ride in the
55



======================================================================
PAGE 70 of 116
======================================================================
blind spot areas (see
Fig.
35).
Either drop behind or quickly pass
the blind area. Try to ride where you can see the rear view mirrors
of the vehicle ahead and keep your headlights on. Drive in the centre
of lane so that you are clearly seen and not struck on the side. Use
longer vehicles as a shield while turning without getting into its blind
spots.
Fig. 35. Blind Spots for Motor Cycle Driver
7.2.4. Use your turning signal flashes to make yourself visible.
However,
it is dangerous to leave a turn signal blinking after having
negotiated a
turn.
7.2.5. Tap your brake pedal to flash your brake lights before you
slow down.
7.2.6. For stopping and parking please
refer to para 6.13-
7.3.
Safe Driving
A safe driver must depend on his own observation;* to stay out
of trouble. Following rules should be followed
:
(1)
Avoid power stops or sudden swerving, keep checking the road surface
ahead for slippery spots, road bumps, broken pavements, loose gravel,
wet leaves or objects lying on the road. Look
in front for cars stopping
or turning ahead.
(2)
Before
turning,
check
rear
view
mirror
for
following
vehicles and
56



======================================================================

(7)
estimate
its distance from you. Account for convexity of mirror while
doing so: Before changing lane and making a turn make
a
final head
check by turning your head and seeing over the shoulder for traffic behind
you. Turn only
if
it
is safe to turn and indicate appropriate arm signal
(see
Fig.
28). Also refer to Para 6.10.
At intersections follow the road
rule as indicated
in para 6.9.
Keep distance between yourself
and other vehicles. Under ordi-
nary conditions, keep at least two
seconds distance between your-
self and
the
car ahead. While
overtaking
(Fig.
36) keep well
away from the vehicle to avoid
a side swipe, leaving large lateral
gap to a large truck. These ve-
hicles can create gusts that can
affect your controls. You have
more room
for error
if you are
in the middle of your lane. Do
not overtake from the wrong side
or from where you are not ex-
pected. Also refer para 7.8.
Do not share a lane with another
car. Do not ride between cars.
Discourage others from shar-
ing
the
lane
with
you
by
keeping in the centre of the
lane.

Watch
out
for
slippery &
uneven surfaces, grooves and
grating, and reduce speeds at
turns
For stopping always use both
the brakes. Apply front brake
steadily without locking the
wheel,
it provides
3/4th of
your braking power. Use rear
brake simultaneously without
locking
the wheel. Do not
use front brake alone or you
may overturn. Make a quick
turn to avoid hitting the ob-
stacle
in front.

======================================================================
a safe distance from others and drive
in staggered formation with
2
seconds distance between riders. While overtaking do
it one at a time.
(See Fig.
37).
(9)
Do not drive when you are fatigued, smoking or under the influence
of alcohol or drugs. Riding a motor-cycle
is
far more demanding than
driving a car. Stop, wait and rest
till you are normal.
8. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR
TRUCK AND BUS DRIVERS
8.1. Truck and Bus Drivers require special knowledge and skills
and
since
they share
the road with many
smaller
vehicles and
vulnerable road users, they have an additional responsibility for taking
all possible safety precautions.
8.2.
Pre-Drive Checks
8.2.1. Take a walk around the vehicle before starting, checking
each relevant component. Look for broken disconnected wires, loose
bolts, cracks in metal, lights that do not work, flat tyres or any other
damage which could effect the safety of the vehicle. Make a special
check of the following:
(1)
Check both sides of the vehicle position fixing off rear view mirror for
proper rear view,
tyres
for
inflation, treads,
cuts, volve cap and rim
slippage. Check wheels for security of nuts, axle studs and excessive
grease leakage. Check suspension, and steering mechanism as
is visible
for general condition and leaks, check springs, shackles and "U" bolts
for general conditions.
(2)
Check windscreen for cleanliness, condition of wiper blades and tension
of wiper arm against windshield.
(3)
In case of trailers, check trailer air and electrical connections for security
and condition of the hoses and insulation. Bleed all air tanks of visible
moisture and sludge check conditions of light and reflectors on the end
of trailer. Check fifth wheel assembly for loose mounts, damage and being
locked around the trailer king pin. Check for any damage to the bottom
of trailer as visible from this point. Check trailer support (i.e. landing
gear). Support should be up, handle pushed in for low gear and stowed.
(4)
Check the rear of vehicle and
trailer for working of clearance lights,
identification
lights,
reflectors, registration plate
lights,
flashing turn
signals and brake lights.
8.2.2. Upon completion of predrive circle check, make a brake
test with foot pedal within the
first 15m of movement of truck.
8.2.3. Every truck, trailer and truck tractor must be equipped with
58



======================================================================
PAGE 73 of 116
======================================================================
rear wheel shield/guards to prevent spraying of water, dirt or gravel
from ground surface from the rear wheels to vehicle behind.
8.2.4. The load in the vehicle must be secured to prevent
its
dropping, sighting, leaking or otherwise escaping.
8.2.5. When towing vehicles the connections must be
strong
enough to pull all the weight towed and the impact of sudden pull
and the distance between the two vehicles should not exceed 4.5m.
The towed vehicle must have a red flag displayed on the connection
between the vehicles.
8.3.
Special Tips for Bus Drivers
The bus driver's most important concern is the safety of passen-
gers. The following points should be taken care of while driving bus:
(1)
Bus driver should make a smooth
start and pick up speed gradually.
He should avoid sudden braking, maintain steady speed and avoid jerking
turns.
(2)
Before starting, the driver should make sure that all the doors are closed
and that there are no vehicle, cyclist or pedestrian in the intended vehicle
path. When moving ahead the driver should move parallel
to the curb
and
in the centre of lane selected.
(3)
When pulling into a bus stop he should reduce speed gradually to enable
a slow smooth stop. He must apply brakes smoothly and steadily to avoid
jerks. He must drive as closely as possible to the kerb when preparing
to load or discharge passengers and must not stop partially or wholly
blocking the through lane.
(4)
When making left turn the driver must check traffic to the rear, alongside
and straight ahead. He should signal
his intention atleast 30m before
turning and keep as close to the
left as possible. He should turn the
steering evenly and check on vehicles or other objects on the sight. He
should gradually straighten out the bus.
(5)
When turning right the driver should place his bus as soon as possible
in the right lane so that wheels are just
left of the centre of the road
and give proper signal
in advance of his intention to turn. The driver
should begin the turning movement when the front of the bus
is even
with the centre of the cross street. He should turn the steering evenly
and smoothly and drive slowly and continuously constantly checking for
clearances.
(6)
The driver should constantly check the mirror, anticipate any unusual
vehicle or pedestrian movement which might call for a sudden stop and
take preventive measures.
59

PAGE 74 of 116
======================================================================
8.4. Overtaking
8.4.1. Truck and Bus drivers must pass other vehicles only when
they are certain that there is adequate clear space ahead for completing
the pass without racing and without risk to themselves and others.
He must not try to pass unless there
is enough difference between
his speed and that of the vehicle ahead so that he can pass safely
and without undue delay. He must not pass more than one vehicle
at a time.
If he stresses to pass a line of traffic he may find himself
in a position where he cannot return to the left lane should the need
arise. On multi-lane highways, he should not pass
if he
is likely to
block faster traffic overtaking from the
rear.
8.4.2. When overtaking, signal must be given to indicate change
of lane both when pulling out to pass and when returning to the
left hand lane. The signal is only an indication of driver's intention,
but
it does not give him the right of way or guarantee that he can
change lane safely. He must always check traffic carefully and pass
only when he can do so safely and without interference.
8.4.3. When being passed by another vehicle, he should keep
well
to the
left side and
if necessary reduce speed to allow safe
passing. He should never speed up to prevent another driver from
passing and should be
alert to the driver who tries to pass in an
unsafe place. He should not try to block him and be ready to do
anything that may be necessary to avoid being involved in an accident.
8.4.4. At night he must dim the light after being passed to avoid
creating glare in other driver's mirror.
8.5. Speed Control
8.5.1.
Drivers
of large
vehicles must
adjust
their speeds
as
necessary and prudent for safe driving. Driver must take into con-
sideration the weather, the condition of the road, traffic density, the
type of load carried, the condition of tyres and brakes and his own
physical and mental condition.
8.5.2. Generally the heavy vehicles must adjust their speed to
match the traffic flow. Driving faster than the flow of traffic would
involve continuously changing lanes thereby increasing risks of being
involved in an accident. This would involve constantly reducing gap
60



======================================================================
PAGE 75 of 116
======================================================================
between his vehicle and the traffic ahead giving little space to stop
in an emergency.
It creates more driving problems, and increases
chances of a driver making
a wrong decision. On the other hand
driving slower than the flow of traffic can also be dangerous as being
a source of hinderance
to other cars or trucks.
8.5.3. Obstructing traffic going up a hill or gradient is a common
complaint against trucks or buses. He should not overload the vehicle
thereby causing an appreciable drop in speed on gradients. Delays
should be reduced on gradients by keeping to the left and allowing
faster
traffic
to
pass. On narrow winding
hilly roads
it may be
necessary to pull over and stop where convenient to allow congested
traffic behind to pass.
8.6. Turning
8.6.1. Left turning: While making left turn driver should try to
stay within proper lane but this may not be possible in a combination
vehicle. He should know the amount of "off-tracking" in his vehicle
for various curve radii. He should remember that cutting too short
to left into a street will cause rear wheel to run over the curb or
shoulder. He thus runs the risk of damaging tyres, endanger pedestrian,
or hit fixed objects such as telephone or power poles or sign posts.
If the
streets are narrow, he
will have
to proceed well
into the
intersection
i.e. into the second traffic lane before having his turn
(see Fig. 38).
If he has to swing wide, he should be very sure that
this can be so done safely.
If he has to block off the other traffic
lane he should ensure that smaller vehicles are not trying to go around
on his
left.
If they are, stop and wait for them to clear.
If he has
to swing wide,
it should be made into the street he is entering (and
not into the street he is entering) and not into the street he is turning
from, so that the
traffic
in front
is clearly visible.
8.6.2. Right turning: When making a right turn, he must check
traffic conditions in all directions before turning and continue to check
traffic while making the turn. Entering the intersection keeping just
to the left of centre and making sure that the vehicle's rear wheels
are not cutting so short that they might strike other vehicles at the
curb.

8.7. Driving on Curves
8.7.1.
It is important that he enters the curve
at a proper speed
so as not to expect to slow down
after entering the curve.
If he
enters the curve too fast the vehicle will skid and
roll over.
If he
applies brakes on a curve, the vehicle may skid or jack-knife. He
should begin to accelerate only after having passed the mid-point
of the curve.
8.7.2. The most important thing to understand while driving long
heavy vehicles is that while going on curves the rear of the vehicle
follows a different path than the front and the difference
in track
is called the
"off-tracking". The greater the distance between the
front wheels and the rear wheels and the sharper the turn, the greater
is the amount of off-track. Every driver must know the magnitude
of off-tracking on narrow curves. On right curves, he should keep
the front of the vehicle towards the outside
of the curve so
that
the
rear will not cut short into the opposing
traffic
lane. On the
left curve, he should keep the vehicle front towards the centre of
the road so that the rear does not run
off the road (see
Fig.
39)

======================================================================
8.8. Reversing
8.8.1. He must not reverse the vehicle unless he can do so without
interfering with other traffic. The vehicle should be parked safely and
cleaner/conductor asked to get down and stand on left side and guide
while reversing. Even with a guide, driver is the one responsible for
reversing.
8.8.2. The control of single unit truck while reversing is the same
as
that for
a
car. The
steering
is turned
in
the
direction of the
movement of back end. But while turning a combination vehicle driver
must move the steering in the direction opposite to that in which
the rear of semi-trailer is to be moved. The trucks-tractor follow an
S-shaped curve. Familiarity with turning is a must and reversing should
be done carefully.
8.9. Parking
8.9.1. The driver should not park in middle of the road or leave
the disabled vehicle on the carriageway. The shoulder should be used
to park the vehicle. In cities he should pull as far as possible
to
the left and park on untravelled portion of road. Vehicle should never
be parked where
it obscures another driver's vision or obstructs a
turning movement.
8.9.2. When
parking,
set
the
parking
brake
and
place
the
transmission in the lowest forward gear or reverse. If there is a kerb,
turn the front wheel towards the curb on downgrade or level surface
and away from the curb when parking on an upgrade.
If the grade
is steep use check blocks under the wheel. Never park on a steep
grade unless absolutely necessary.
8.9.3. When vehicle
is disabled, or stopped for more than ten
minutes on a roadway, use four way flashing signal to warn traffic.
8.10. Length of Load
If the load on any vehicle extends more than
1 m beyond the
rear of vehicle, a red flag must be displayed at the end of load during
day and red
light
at night.
8.11. Emergency Stop and Traffic Guidance
8.11.1. If the vehicle is disabled,
it is important to give warning
64



======================================================================
PAGE 79 of 116
======================================================================
to other road users by use of red flags: reflective triangles and red
lanterns. Place one warning flag or triangle at least 30 m behind the
vehicle and one at each edge of vehicle. At night arrange for a lantern
to be placed
at the same distance and on outer edge of vehicle to
delineate
it clearly. Do not put stones or obstructions on the road
which are not clearly visible. On removal of vehicle remove
all the
obstructions placed on the road.
9. HIGHWAY EMERGENCIES FOR FOUR WHEELED
VEHICLES
9.1. Even if you obey all traffic laws and drive safely, things may
happen which you do not expect.
If you are like most drivers, you
won't have the opportunity to practice your response to an emergency
before it happens. Knowing how to handle driving emergencies will
help you
to avoid
a serious
accident. When confronted with an
unexpected situation, you will have to use skills of steering, accel-
eration and braking, used individually and in combination to face
the emerging situation successfully. Given hereunder are some stan-
dard useful, procedures:
9.2.
Steering
9.2.1. Good steering skills are essential to maintain control of
your vehicle. Often in an emergency you must react quickly and
correctly to avoid an accident. To steer quickly, you must hold the
steering wheel correctly.
9.2.2. To turn quickly to the left follow the steps shown in Fig.
40.
9.23. To turn to the right, follow these same steps but turn the
steering wheel in the opposite direction.
9.2.4. To turn quickly, your hands must be on opposite sides
of the steering wheel (the nine and three o' clock hand positions),
get used
to holding the steering wheel
this way
all the
time.
9.3. Accelerating
At times you have to accelerate to avoid an accident. For example,
if another car is about to hit you from the side or from behind, you
must speed up
to avoid a collision.

9.4. Braking
While braking is often an essential response to driving emergen-
cies, using your brakes improperly can actually cause an accident.
In emergencies many drivers simply slam on their brakes. This locks
the brakes, puts the car into a skid and makes
it impossible to steer.
Pumping the brakes is generally the best way to stop. The car stops
quicker and you maintain your steering control. This improves your
chances of avoiding a collision.
66



======================================================================
PAGE 81 of 116
======================================================================
9.5.
Skidding
9.5.1. Skidding often results from such conditions
as
ice, wet
roads or fast speeds.
If your car begins to skid, follow these steps:-
*
Turn the steering wheel in the direction your vehicle
is skidding.
If the
rear of your car
is skidding
to the
left, steer
to the
left.
If the rear of
your car
is skidding to the
right, steer to the right. When you steer to
correct a skid, another skid may result
in the opposite direction. But
the second skid will not be as severe as the
first. Be prepared to stop
the second skid by steering in the opposite direction.
It may take several
steering movements to regain control of your car.
*
When skidding, do not use your brakes.
If you hit the brakes the skid
will be worse. By braking you also risk locking your wheels and loosing
control of steering altogether.
9.5.2. Handling slippery surfaces: Skid happens most often
on slippery surfaces. A road that is safe under most conditions can
be dangerous when slippery. Ice and packed snow, especially when
you are driving at high speeds or going downhill, can cause the car
to skid.
If you are about to drive over a slippery surface or
if your car
is hydroplanning these
tips may help you avoid a skid:
*
Take your foot gradually off the accelerator pedal.
Turn slowly, only as much as necessary to keep your car on the road.
*
If you have to use your brakes, pump them gently.
*
Do not try to stop rapidly and turn quickly
9.6. Handling Car Emergencies
No matter how well you take care of your car, there
is
still
a
chance of car failure. Some of the more common car failures and
what
to do about them are
as follows:
9.7. Brake
Failure
If your brakes suddenly give out
...
Pump the brake pedal rapidly several times. This will often build up
enough brake pressure to stop the car.
*
Use the parking brakes. Hold the brake release so you can
let off on
the brake
if the rear wheels lock and you begin to skid.
If that does
not work
...
67



======================================================================
PAGE 82 of 116
======================================================================
*
Shift to low gear and look for
a- place
to slow to
a stop.
*
Make sure the car
is off the roadway.
*
After the car has stopped, call for help. Do not try to drive the car to
a garage.
9.8. Blow Out
Although tyre blowouts are sometimes preceded by thumping
sound, you do not usually have advance warning. As a result,
it
is
important to protect against blowouts by keeping your tyres in good
condition and properly inflated.
If you have
a sudden tyre blow out:
*
Hold the steering wheel
tightly.
*
Take your foot gradually off the gas pedal.
*
If you have to use your brakes, pump them gently.
*
Let the car slow to a stop. Make sure
it
is off the road before changing
the tyre.
9.9. Power Steering
Failure
If the engine
stalls:
*
Hold the steering wheel
tightly, you will have difficulty
in steering.
*
Brake gently to stop the car (If your car has power brakes you may have
to pump hard).
*
Restart the engine.
9.10. Headlight Failure
If your headlights suddenly go out
...
*
Try the dimmer switch.
It may turn the headlights on again.
*
Try the headlight switch a few times.
*
If these efforts
fail, try the parking lights, emergency flashers or turn
signals.
*
Slow down, pull off the road and leave the emergency flashers on
if they
work.
9.11. Accelerator Sticks
^
The car just keeps on going faster and faster
...
*
Keep your eyes on the road.
*
Shift to neutral immediately.
68



======================================================================
PAGE 83 of 116
======================================================================
*
Pull off the road when you have slowed down.
*
When stopped turn off the engine and turn on your emergency flashers.
9.12.
Drifting off the Pavement
If your wheels drift on to the road shoulder, slow down gradually
until you can pull back on to the road safely. When the shoulder
is below the edge of the road, avoid rubbing your tyres against the
pavement edge.
If there
is obstruction on the road shoulder which prevents you
from slowing down, centre your car over the road edge. Steer quickly
to the left. When the front wheels of your car re-enter the pavement,
steer
to the
right.
9.13. Protecting yourself in Collisions
You may not always be able
to avoid
a
collision. To protect
yourself, wear your seat belt and shoulder harness and adjust your
head rest.
Other ways
to cut down
the severity of injury in an accident
are:
If you
are about
to be
hit from the
rear:
*
Steer the vehicle away from opposing traffic.
"
Brace yourself between the steering wheel and seat back.
"
If your car has headrests, press the back of your head firmly against the
headrest.
*
If possible, be prepared to apply your brakes so you won't be pushed
into another
car.
If you
are about
to be
hit from the
side
*
Brace yourself with the steering wheel to keep from being thrown against
the side of the car.
*
If possible, get ready to steer so you can try to control the car.
If you
are about to be
hit from the
front
*
Use your arms and hands
to protect your face
if you
are* wearing
a
shoulder harness, throw yourself across the seat so you don't hit the
steering column or the windshield.
9.14. Emergencies and
Seatbelts
You are
better prepared
to handle any emergency
if you are
69



======================================================================
PAGE 84 of 116
======================================================================
wearing your seat belt and shoulder harness. Seat belts increase your
chances of surviving a collision. These chances are even better when
you wear both a seat belt and a shoulder harness.
Some of the advantages of wearing safety belts are:
"
They keep you from being thrown from the car. In a collision you have
better protection
if you stay inside the car.
•
They slow your body down with your car. If you are not wearing a seat
belt and shoulder harness
in a collision, your car stops
at impact but
you keep going. Most likely you will be stopped by the dash board or
windshield. At only 40 km/h this
is like hitting the ground from the top
of a three-storey building.
"
They keep you from moving around on the seat at sudden stops and
turns. You cannot control your car
if you slide from behind the wheel.
Seat belts and shoulder harness can only do
all these things
if
they are buckled. You won't have time to buckle your seat belt in
an emergency, so you have to do
it before you
start to drive.
Use
seat
belts
properly. Keep
the
lap
belt
fairly
tight,
but
comfortable, across your lap and hips. Make sure
it is below your
stomach and rests on your hip bones. Adjust the shoulder harness
so
it's loose enough to
let your fist go between the belt and your
chest.
If you wear your seat belts like this, they will be comfortable
and give you ample protection.
9.15. Accidents
If you are involved in an accident:
•
Stop your car at or near the accident scene. If you can, move your car
off the road so you don't block
traffic.
•
Notify the police
if the accident involves death or injury. Also call police
if any vehicle is damaged to the extent that the vehicle requires towing.
If the drivers of the cars are hurt and cannot notify the police, then others
involved
in the accident must call for help.
•
Get the names and addresses of all people involved in the accident and
any witnesses. Make sure you also get the names and addresses of any
injured persons.
•
If the accident involves a parked car, try to find the owner. If you cannot,
leave a note in a place where
it can be seen and notify the police. The
note should contain:
Your name and address
70

10. TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS AND FIRST AID
10.1. Whenever there is a traffic accident, the driver on the scene
should help the victims. Necessary arrangements to assist the injured
persons by arranging him to be carried immediately to the nearest
hospital should be made.
Notify the nearest Police Station by Telephone or otherwise, as
quickly
as
possible,
if your
vehicle
is involved
in an
accident.
Irrespective of whether you are at fault or not, you are required to
stop and remain stationary as long as reasonably necessary.
10.2. Most of the fatalities in road accidents occur due to heavy
bleeding and lack of immediate medical attention.
If there are injured
people, apply whatever
First Aid you can until the victim can be
transferred to
a hospital This might include
trying to stop heavy
bleeding with bandage, handkerchief and clean clothing,
if necessary.
Be
careful about moving
the
injured
especially those with head
injuries. If there is an immitent danger that later harm could be done
to the injured or that non-removal from the road could
result in
another accident, do your best to get the injured to safety as quickly
as possible.
10.3. No matter how minor the accident,
it should be reported
to the Police. Even if you have no external injuries, but have received
severe thumping on the head you must go in for a medical check
up.
If not done, the injury may show up
later and you may have
complications.
10.4. Following
First Aid Treatment
is Advisable
10.4.1. When injuries have resulted from a
traffic accident, do
the following as quickly as possible:
Look over the injured. In order to get the needed emergency
care, call ambulance and police services. First of all make the following
quick assessment of injuries:
A.
Is the victim conscious
?
If you ask the injured a question or two,
you will
find out
if he
is
in
his senses or not.
71



======================================================================
PAGE 86 of 116
======================================================================
B.
Is he breathing ?
....
Is the chest moving ? You can usually tell by placing
your ear near the mouth or nose of the injured person.
C.
Is there much loss of blood
?
... Where
is the bleeding and what
is the
extent of bleeding
?
D.
Is there vomitting
?
... Do you see vomit like substances
in or around
the mouth?
E.
Are there any other abnormalities or trouble
?
...
Does any portion of
the bone structure or body seem to be dislocated or distorted in shape?
Find out
if any one
is feeling particularly acute pain
in any part of the
body.
10.4.2. First aid treatment: After you have a good idea of the
extent and priority of injury, administer first aid as below:
A.
The
first step will be to stop rapid loss of blood.
If blood
is pouring
out profusely, a tourniquet type approach
is necessary following the basic
principle
that,
e.g. on any limb,
a bandage should be
tightly bound
between the cut and the heart so as to arrest the blood flow out of the
wound. Remember, however, that a tight constriction application of this
sort,
if continued too long can result in the loss of the limb. As bleeding
slows, these triangular bandages handkerchives or towels etc., should
be gradually loosened. When bleeding
is not so severe,
it
is sufficient
to apply hard and direct pressure on the wound with a clean handkerchief
or cloth.
B.
Get the injured to relax., rest or sleep
in a comfortable position. When
the injured
is unconscious,
it
is possible to suffocate and die by having
breathing blocked by vomitting etc. As a precaution against this, have
people recline
in
a position
like that one shown
in Fig.
41.

======================================================================
If the victim has a head or neck injury,
it is risky to move him
around. Better leave him as he
is, until the ambulance and doctor
arrive.
10.5. Be Prepared
When driving it is not enough to merely know what to do, should
there be an accident. Be ready for the worst and have the necessary
bandages and gauge with you
in your car.

13. DRIVING AND ROAD CRAFT MANUAL
13.1. The Physical and Mental requirements of a Motor
Vehicle Driver
The most important factor in driving is the driver himself. All other
considerations, such as road worthiness of the vehicle, speed of travel
and so on, are his responsibilities and within his control.
The make up of a good driver is determined by permanent physical
and psychological character and certain temporary influences which
limit his ability to drive safely. All other driving hazards become many
times worse
if he
is not
at his physical and mental
best.
Driving involves the same attitudes which are desirable in all walks
of life—courtesy, responsibility, maturity, unselfishness, tolerance and
dependability. One can be an excellent driver mechanically but
it is
the mental attitude to driving which really counts. Driving a motor
vehicle is a full-time occupation both mentally and physically. Care-
lessness and a selfish attitude towards other road users account for
most of the accidents. Good vision, good hearing and a good standard
of health all have an essential bearing on the power of concentration
and perception so necessary in present-day driving.
Moreover the vehicle driver must be able to formulate a safe driving
plan for every circumstance on the road, and then carry that plan
into effect with deliberation. To do this his muscular system must
79



======================================================================
PAGE 94 of 116
======================================================================
be in good condition, when driving. The movements of the limbs
exercising control of the vehicle must be sure and accurate.
13.2. Learning to Drive
(i)
Any person learning to drive a motor vehicle
is required to obtain a
learner-driver's licence
(ii)
A learner licence holder must display on the front and the rear of his
vehicle
"L" plates as prescribed
in the law.
(iii)
A learner licence holder must carry his learner licence at the time of
driving. A learner licence has no grace period.
(iv)
A learner licence
is valid only
in the State where
it
is issued.
(v)
A learner licence holder
is required to carry by his side a person duly
licenced to drive a vehicle who should sit
in such a position as to be
able to readily stop the vehicle. (In some states this does not apply to
learner scooter/motorcycle driver)
(vi)
The minimum age
for applying for a learner-licence
is 18 years.
13.3. Driver's Licence
(i)
Your driver's licence
is a privilege not a right. It is upto you to see that
this privilege
is not abused.
(ii)
The right attitude to driving is a sign of maturity. One can be an excellent
driver mechanically, but it is the mental attitude to driving which really
counts.
(iii)
A permanent licence
is valid only for the type of vehicle for which
it
is issued.
(iv)
After
its date of expiry, you have 3i) days grace period within which to
get the licence renewed.
(v)
The minimum age for applying for a permanent driving licence
is 18
years. For a paid driver
it
is 20 years. A paid driver must carry his driving
licence while driving.
(vi)
A permanent licence
is valid throughout India.
13.4. Before Moving Off
Before moving off, you should know your capabilities as well as
the vehicle you are going to drive. You should not drive fast unless
you are familiar with its behaviour and never demand more of it than
you know you can
get.
Make sure
that:
(i)
Your vehicle
is registered.
80



======================================================================
PAGE 95 of 116
======================================================================
(ii)
Registration number
is displayed prominantly on front and rear in the
prescribed manner.
(iii)
It
is insured.
(iv)
Your vehicle
is
in roadworthy condition.
(v)
You have a valid driving licence for the type of vehicle you intend to
drive.
(vi)
You are physically and mentally
fit to drive.
(vii)
You are not under the influence of drinks/drugs to an extent that you
are unable to control the vehicle properly.
13.5. Things Necessary in Different Vehicles and Useful
Accessories
13.5.1. General
(i)

======================================================================
PAGE 96 of 116
======================================================================
13.5.4. Car/bus/truck
In addition to what is mentioned at para 13 5.1
, a car/bus/truck

Be equipped with electrical or mechanical device,
if
it is a left hand drive.
13.5.5. Other useful accessories for scooterist/
motor-cyclist
In addition
to what
is stated above,
it
is always useful
for
a
scooterist/motor-cyclist:
(i)
To wear a helmet. This will protect him from head injuries in the event
of an accident.
(ii)
To have a windscreen as a shield against dust particles or any other flying
objects which may hit his body/eyes while he
is driving.
(iii)
To wear a pair of sun glasses so that blowing wind does not irritate his
eyes or affect his vision.
13.6. Road Worthiness of a Vehicle
There is no vehicle so far manufactured which will go on running
month after month without due attention. From the day a vehicle
leaves the manufacturing plant,
it starts to wear and
this process
involves the gradual deterioration of vital working parts.
Besides replenishing petrol, and paying for insurance tax token
and servicing, the following vehicle parts should be checked:-
(a)
Tyres: Besides being properly inflated, they should have ample thread
and be free of bulges, cuts, embedded stone and uneven wear. Look for
signs of uneven wear which calls for alignment of the front and balancing
of the wheels. Don't forget to check your spares like spare wheel, fan
belts, etc.
(b)
Brakes: The handbrake should hold
the
vehicle on any grade. The
footbrake should hold evenly while the pedal
is
still
2-3 cm or more
from the floor.
(c)
lights: Headlights should operate and be correctly adjusted. Rear lights,
82



======================================================================
PAGE 97 of 116
======================================================================
stop lights and turn signals should all be checked for proper operation.
(d)
Steering: Front wheels should be properly aligned. The steering wheel
should be free of excessive play.
(e)
Rearview mirror: Adjust rear-view mirror for a clear view of the road
behind.
(0
Horn: Should operate with a bold clear sound.
(g)
Exhaust system: Make sure
it
is
tight, quiet and
free from leaks
(h)
Glasses: All glasses should be clean, free from cracks, discolouration,
unauthorised stickers. Especially before night driving, clean your wind-
shields and eye glasses inside and outside to reduce reflection.
(i)
Windscreen wiper: Should work properly and wipe clearly, worn blades
should be replaced with new ones.
(j)
Radiator hoses: Any that are cracked or feel soggy when squeezed need
renewing.
(k)
Fluid levels: Keep yourself informed about fluid levels by frequent checks.
Be sure that all drain plugs are securely closed to prevent cracks.
(1)
Fan belt:
It should be checked every 1500 to 2000 kms.
It should have
about
2-3 cm of up and down movement between pulleys and should
not show cracks, ply separation or other signs of deep wear.
13.7. Driver Reaction Time
Driver reaction time is the time that passes between the moment
a driver observes the need for action and the moment he takes that
action.
It
is of major importance when applied to braking. On an
average a smart driver takes 3/4th of a second to react and to reach
for the brakes, during which time
if he
is driving at a speed of 50
km/hour, he will have covered 13m without losing any appreciable
speed. This is called the thinking distance.
It varies with
the speed
of the vehicle, with the physical and mental condition of the driver
and with the degree of concentration the driver is giving to his driving.
The ability to react quickly can deteriorate in several ways. Undue
worry, fatigue, illness and the effects of alcohol are well known causes
of lack of mental and physical well being.
13.8. Defensive Driving
It is not enough
if you are a law-abiding driver. Your chances
of being involved in an accident will be further lane ended,
if you
practice the system of defensive driving.
83



======================================================================
PAGE 98 of 116
======================================================================
In judging safety performance, we are not concerned whether you
had the
legal
right of way or whether the other driver disobeyed
traffic regulations. We are also not concerned with conditions of the
road or weather. When you have failed to make an allowance and
an accident results, you have failed to prevent the accident. The plain
fact is that if you have failed to do everything you reasonably could
have done to prevent the accident, you are not a defensive driver.
Defensive driving includes pride in never taking to other road
users by
surprise,
and
in not being taken by
surprise,
pride
in
concentrating on your responsibilities rather than on your rights, pride
in showing care, courtesy, and consideration to other road users.
The acts of a courteous driver can set an example for other road
users and
this can help reduce
accidents. On the other hand,
a
discourteous act can set up a chain reaction for more discourtesy,
often with tragic
results.
Each driver should condition himself, so that he will react safely
to situations in which danger is an element, so that safety becomes
a habit.
