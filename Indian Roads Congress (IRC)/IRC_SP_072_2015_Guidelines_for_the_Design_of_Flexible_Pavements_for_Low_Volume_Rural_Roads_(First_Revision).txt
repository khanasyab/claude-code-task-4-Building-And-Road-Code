GUIDELINES FOR THE DESIGN OF FLEXIBLE PAVEMENTS
FOR LOW VOLUME RURAL ROADS
1  INTRODUCTION
1.1	
This document is revision of the IRC:SP:72-2007 “Guidelines for the Design of 
Flexible Pavements for Low Volume Roads”. The need for the revision arose to include 
design charts using stabilized base and sub – base courses as also to enable design of rural 
roads for traffic volume upto 2 MSA. Accordingly, a sub group consisting of Dr. I.K. Pateriya, 
Dr. Sudhakar Reddy, Dr. UC Sahoo and Shri S.C. Sharma was constituted to consider the 
proposed revision.  This sub-group had several meetings and finalized the draft.  The draft 
revised guidelines were deliberated before the Rural Roads Committee (H-5) in its meeting 
held on 16th December, 2014 and the modified draft was approved.  Thereafter, the modified 
draft was placed before the Highways Specifications & Standard Committee (HSS) in its 
meeting held on 16th January, 2015.  The HSS Committee approved the modified draft of 
revised guidelines which was then put up before the IRC Council in its meeting held on 
20th January, 2015 at Bhubaneswar. Council authorized the convener of H-5 Committee for 
incorporating suggestions before publication of the revised guidelines as suggested by the 
Council.

1.2	
Pre-requisites for suitable and Economical Designs
There are a number of important points to be considered while evolving suitable and 
economical designs for the low-volume rural roads in India. First and foremost is the aspect 
of practical implementability of the recommended designs within the available resources 
and level of expertise in rural areas, availability of  equipment/plant for construction and 
maintenance as well as the level of quality control that can be effectively exercised in rural 
areas. To the extent possible, the use of locally available materials as such or after suitable 
processing has to be maximized in the larger interest of economy. The design life to be 
taken for purposes of pavement design should neither be too short to require expensive 
upgradation/rehabilitation at close intervals nor should it be so long as to require prohibitively 
high cost of initial construction. Ideally, maintenance considerations should be built into the 
design e.g. provision of adequate drainage, resistance to soil erosion along side slopes, 
adequate lateral support from shoulders etc. as would minimize subsequent maintenance 
requirements. Lastly, the designs should aim at providing the level of serviceability which 
should not fall below the minimum acceptable level during the design life, essentially 
amounting to evolving performance-based designs. All these important considerations and 
international experiences have to be kept in view while working out suitable and economical 
pavement designs for rural roads. 
1.3	
Earlier Design Approach (IRC:SP: 20-2002)
1.3.1	
In the first edition of IRC:SP:20-2002, Rural Roads Manual (Ref. 1), the traffic 
parameter for pavement design is evaluated in terms of commercial vehicles per day, grouping 
together the heavy commercial vehicles like trucks, full-sized buses etc. with the much lighter 
commercial vehicles like tractors/tractor-trailers, pick-up vans, mini buses, tempos etc. The 
percentage of laden, unladen and overloaded commercial vehicles has not been considered 
in the traffic parameter. 
1.3.2	
The subgrade strength parameter is evaluated in terms of 4-day soaked CBR 
values except in areas with annual rainfall less than 500 mm and where the water table is 
'too deep'. 



======================================================================

IRC:SP-72-2015

1.3.3	
A set of pavement design curves A, B, C and D for traffic categories 0-15, 15-45, 
45-150 and 150-450 CVPD have been provided as also design catalogues with minimum 
base course thickness of 150 mm for Curves A and B and a minimum base course thickness 
of 225 mm for curves C and D. The sub-base course thicknesses have been arrived at 
by subtracting the minimum base course thickness from the total pavement thickness 
requirement, obtained from the pavement design curves. 
1.3.4	
In regard to the type of surfacing, all rural roads, except those (i) in an arid 
region with annual rainfall less than 500 mm and traffic upto 150 motorized vehicles per day 
(except two- wheelers) and (ii) in a region with annual rainfall less than 1000 mm and traffic 
upto 50 motorized vehicles per day (except two-wheelers) only, need to be provided with 
a bituminous surface treatment. The design of Unsealed Gravel Roads does not receive a 
separate treatment in IRC:SP:20-2002 (Ref 1). As a result, practically all rural roads being 
constructed in the country are black-topped. 
1.4	
Existing Design Approach (IRC:SP:72- 2007)
1.4.1	
For purposes of pavement structural design in this Design Manual, the low volume 
rural roads are divided into the following categories: 
	
Gravel/Aggregate-surfaced roads (Unpaved Roads); 
	
Flexible Pavements (Paved Roads); and 
	
Rigid Pavements 
1.4.2	
The international experiences, for the past several decades, with Gravel Roads 
notably in the USA (Ref 2) show that the 'maximum traffic level upto 100,000 Equivalent 
Standard Axle Load (ESAL) applications can be considered for Gravel Roads, while the 
practical minimum level (during a single performance period) is 10,000'. Below ESAL 
applications of 10,000, even Earth Roads are suitable. 
Gravel is defined as a mix of stone, sand and fine-sized particles used as a sub-base, base 
or surfacing on a road, the material specifications for use in these layers being available 
in Clauses 401 and 402 of the MORD Specifications for Rural Roads. When the required 
gradation of gravel is not available in a natural form, the blending of naturally occurring 
materials in the required proportions may be resorted to. 
1.4.3	
For low volume rural roads, still carrying a sizable volume of truck and bus traffic, 
the maximum number of ESAL applications considered for flexible or rigid pavement is upto 
1 million ESAL applications (Ref 2). The practical minimum traffic level for a flexible or rigid 
pavement is about 50,000 ESAL applications during a single performance period (Ref 2). 
1.4.4	
The pavement designs presented in the Manual for both, Gravel and Flexible 
Pavements (the rigid pavement designs are dealt with separately) are performance-based, 
drawing on the extensive experiences in the USA on Low Volume Road Design, as brought 
out in the AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures (Ref 2). The Serviceability 
rating system from 5 to 1 as per the PMGSY Operations Manual 2005 (in terms of Present 
Serviceability/Condition Index) (Ref. 3) has been adopted. For the low volume rural roads 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP-72-2015
4
in India, a 'Terminal Serviceability Index' (i.e, the lowest index that will be tolerated before 
rehabilitation /strengthening or reconstruction becomes necessary) of 2.0 is considered 
suitable. 
The thickness of gravel/aggregate-surface roads (unpaved roads) has been based on the 
following criteria: 
(i)	
the serviceability loss over the design life is limited to 2.0, taking the initial 
serviceability index to be 4.0 just before opening the road to traffic, and the terminal 
serviceability of 2.0 when rehabilitation will be due, with or without provision of an 
overlay. 
(ii)	
the allowable depth of rutting under 3 m straight edge does not generally exceed 
50 mm. 
The thickness of flexible pavements (paved roads) has been based on the Structural Number 
(SN) recommended by AASHTO for low volume roads for those of the US climatic zones 
which represent the climatic conditions of our country, for a 50% reliability level. 
1.4.5	
The design traffic parameter has been expressed in terms of the cumulative 
80 kN (8.16 tonnes) ESAL applications during the design life. Seasonal variations by way of 
enhanced traffic during the harvesting seasons have also been considered. 
1.4.6	
For the evaluation of subgrade strength for new roads, the selection of moisture 
content has been dealt with scientifically instead of always insisting on 4-day soaked CBR 
values. For the rehabilitation or upgradation of existing rural roads, the use of Dynamic Cone 
Penetrometer (DCP) (mm/blow) has also been recommended for insitu subgrade strength 
evaluation. 
1.5	
Salient Features of Existing Designs 
Some of the more important features of the existing designs are as under: 
 
• 
Pavement designs for new roads as well as for the upgradation/rehabilitation 
of existing roads have been included. 
 
• 
The recommended designs aim at maximizing the use of locally available 
materials including industrial waste (where possible)
 
• 
A simple procedure has been detailed for carrying out traffic counts, computing 
the ADT and the number of ESAL applications during the design life, selected 
as 10 years. 
 
• 
Categorizing the subgrade strength in 5 classes and classifying the traffic 
into 7 ranges has simplified the presentation of design catalogues for both 
gravel roads and flexible pavements. 
 
• 
The warrants for providing a bituminous surface treatment have been spelt 
out. 
 
• 
The importance of monitoring the long-term performance of rural roads 
constructed with the recommended designs, by way of periodically carrying 
out condition, surveys cannot be overemphasized. Systematic condition

surveys should be carried out at regular intervals and data recorded on 
specified format. 
1.6	
Additions in Revised Guidelines (IRC:SP:72-2015)
1.6.1  
Considering the growth of traffic on selected rural through routes and the 
modifications in IRC:37-2012 (with minimum traffic of 2 MSA for design), it has become 
necessary to include design charts for traffic more than 1 MSA and upto 2 MSA. Accordingly, 
two more traffic categories T8 and T9 have been included in the design catalogue. 
1.6.2	
The existing IRC:SP:72-2007 recommended a minimum thickness of 150 mm soil 
cement base and 100 mm soil cement sub-base for all rural roads. However, the design 
chart considering the strength of sub-grade and the design traffic was not available in these 
guidelines. The revised guidelines provide a design catalogue for cement stabilized base and 
sub-base courses on the basis of traffic and sub-grade strength. 
1.6.3 	
It has been clearly brought out that all rural roads should be designed for a minimum 
sub-grade CBR of 5% (atleast fair). 
1.6.4	
Wherever stabilized base and sub-base courses are proposed to be used, the 
pavements shall be provided with a bituminous surface treatment. 
1.7	
Prerequisites for Successful Performance of Gravel Roads
All over the World, properly designed Gravel Roads have performed well, if due attention 
has been paid to the needed processing of gravels before use adequate drainage has 
been provided and timely maintenance measures have been taken. In several countries the 
unpaved road length is more than the paved road length. In India, however the unpaved road 
length constitutes less than half the total road length. While in most countries abroad, among 
the unpaved roads, it is the gravel roads, which are most popular, the unpaved roads in India 
are generally Water Bound Macadam Surfaced. Of late, with the World Bank assistance 
in some rural areas of India, Gravel Roads showing good performance even after about 5 
years of service have developed the confidence of rural road engineers in the  country. Indian 
Roads Congress has also brought out “Manual  for Design, Construction and Maintenance 
of Gravel Roads”, IRC:SP:77-2008. Where conditions for Gravel Roads are however, not 
appropriate, other suitable pavement, composition can be adopted. 
2  THE DESIGN PROCESS 
For working out, suitable and economical pavement, designs for the low volume, rural roads, 
design procedures have been set forth for (a) new roads and for (b) upgradation/rehabilitation 
of existing roads. These procedures are outlined below:
2.1	
New Roads 
2.1.1	
Estimation of traffic:
Where no road is existing at present, the estimation of the amount of traffic over the design 
life cannot be made directly on the basis of traffic counts. In such cases, it would be most 



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 48
======================================================================
IRC:SP-72-2015
6
expedient to carry out traffic counts on an existing road, preferably in the vicinity with similar 
conditions. Based on such traffic counts on an existing road catering to a known population 
and known amount of agricultural/industrial produce, the amount of traffic expected to ply on 
the new proposed road can be suitably worked out. 
The detailed procedure for estimating design traffic is described in Para 3. 
2.1.2	
Assessment of subgrade strength: 
It is necessary to scientifically carry out a soil survey and test the representative samples for 
standard IS classification tests, compaction tests and CBR. The depth of Ground Water Table 
(GWT) and its fluctuations, annual rainfall, and other environmental conditions that influence 
the subgrade strength must be investigated. During the soil survey, it must be ensured that 
even if the same soil type continues, atleast 3 samples must be collected per kilometre 
length, for simple soil classification tests based on particle size distribution and Atterberg 
limits. The entire length must be divided into uniform sections based on soil classification 
and Ground Water conditions. On each soil type, compaction and CBR tests shall be carried 
out to determine the strength of subgrade soil for design purposes. Normally, for each one 
kilometre length, atleast one CBR test value based on an average of 3 tests  is required for 
each soil type.
A simple procedure for estimating CBR value of subgrade soil on the basis of soil properties 
is also suggested. The detailed procedure for assessing the CBR value for subgrade soil is 
described in Para 4. 
2.1.3	
Determination of pavement thickness and composition:
It is necessary to carry out a comprehensive field materials survey and the needed laboratory 
tests on representative samples to maximize the use of locally available materials (including 
industrial waste) for use in sub-base, base and surface courses as such or after suitable 
blending. Using the design traffic parameter and the subgrade strength parameter, the 
pavement thickness and composition can be determined from the Design Catalogue given 
in Para 8. The total thickness requirement and also the thickness of various layers have 
been arrived at, keeping in view the main objective of maximising the use of locally available 
materials. The soil can be improved by mechanical stabilization or by modification with a 
suitable additive like lime, lime-flyash/cement etc.
2.2	
Upgradation/Rehabilitation of Existing Roads
2.2.1	
Traffic parameter: 
The amount of traffic expected to ply over the future design life of the existing road, can 
directly be based on actual traffic counts on the existing road. These traffic counts shall be 
carried out both during the lean non-harvesting season as also during the peak harvesting 
seasons. The cumulative traffic repetitions over the design life can be calculated considering 
the growth rate as per the potential in the area for generating traffic. The detailed procedure 
for estimating the design traffic is described in Para 3.

IRC:SP-72-2015

2.2.2	
Subgrade strength: 
For the upgradation/rehabilitation of an existing road, the subgrade strength will be determined 
by carrying out CBR test on a representative sample of sub grade soil remoulded to the field 
density and at the field moisture content, determined after the recession of monsoon. If, 
however, it is not found possible to determine the field moisture content immediately after 
the recession of monsoon, the subgrade strength shall be determined by the 4 days' soaked 
CBR test on a representative soil sample, compacted to field density in order to simulate the 
worst moisture condition. 
Alternatively, the subgrade strength can be determined by carrying out DCP tests every 
250 m in the subgrade at a distance of about 0.6 m to 1.0 m from the edge of the carriageway 
at the subgrade level in a staggered manner on each side of the carriageway. The salient 
details of a DCP test and a correlation with the CBR are given at Appendix C. In case the 
subgrade soil contains gravel or stone particles of size exceeding 20 mm, or if repeated 
DCP tests carried out in a stretch of one km give results varying by more than one-third of 
the average value, it is desirable to carry out soaked CBR test on remoulded soil specimens 
compacted at field dry density as per IRC guidelines. 
2.2.3	
Overlay thickness requirement:
The causes of poor condition of the pavement should first be determined from the data collected 
on the existing road. Many times, the poor performance is due to lack of proper drainage or lack 
of lateral support from the shoulders etc. In such cases, these deficiencies must be made up 
without resorting to any strengthening measures. If, however, from the design catalogues, it is 
found that the total pavement thickness requirement, determined from the existing subgrade 
strength and for the future growth of traffic during the design life, is more than the existing 
pavement thickness, then an overlay is to be provided. Considering design CBR of the sub grade 
soil and projected traffic at the end of design life, total thickness required should be calculated, 
using design catalogue given in Figs.  4 or 6 (in case of stabilized base and sub base courses).
In general the existing pavement layers are maintained unless the subgrade is made of black 
cotton soil or the existing pavement material deteriorated extensively due to excessive clay in 
the existing pavement layer. The thickness of the overlay is worked out as difference of total 
required  thickness minus existing available thickness. For upgradation and strengthening, 
decision should be based on the cost economics and expected performance during design 
life,  subjected to the following provisions:
  
(a)   for traffic up to T5 category : The additional WBM layers to be provided shall 
not exceed 150 mm comprising of two layers of WBM 
 
(b) 
for traffic more than T5 category and  up to T7 category (2 MSA) : The 
additional WBM layers to be provided shall not exceed 225 mm comprising 
of three layers of WBM. 
	
(c)	
Where the subgrade soil is black cotton and the existing pavement, layers 
have been deteriorated due to existing clay  present in the structure, the

condition of the pavement shall be examined thoroughly and where it 
has been ascertained that    the pavement shall be reconstructed as a 
new pavement efforts should be made  to utilize the dismantled material 
obtained from existing pavement, to the extent possible subject to meeting 
the specifications. In such cases the subgrade may also be strengthened 
using any of the methods of stabilization or by replacement of poor subgrade 
soil. The pavement shall be designed on the basis of improved CBR as per 
catalogue.  
 
(d) 
The specifications and properties of the material to be used in overlay should 
not be lower than that of the existing top layer. It should also be ensured that 
a soft layer is not sandwiched between two hard layers. 
3  TRAFFIC PARAMETER  
3.1. 	
Composition of Rural Traffic 
3.1.1 
It is not only the traffic volume but also its composition that plays an important 
role in determining the pavement thickness and composition (Ref. 6,11&17). There is a wide 
variety of vehicles plying on rural roads, half or even more of the total number being non-
motorized, mostly bicycles and animal drawn carts. Among the motorized vehicles, the two-
wheeled motor cycles constitute a sizable proportion followed by tractors/tractor-trailers, 
jugads, pick-up vans, jeeps and cars. Heavy Commercial Vehicles (HCV) like full-sized trucks 
and buses are relatively very few in number, their proportion out of the total may be as low as 
5%, sometimes even lower. The number of Medium-heavy Commercial Vehicles (MCV) like 
tractor-trailers and medium-sized trucks is generally much higher than the number of HCV. 
The number of animal drawn carts is on the decline. The number of tractors/tractor-trailers is 
gradually on the increase, while the number of motor cycles is increasing rapidly. 
3.1.2	
For purposes of pavement design, the large number of bicycles, motor cycles 
and pneumatic-tyred animal drawn carts are of little consequence and only the motorized 
commercial vehicles of gross laden weight of 3 tonnes and above (i.e. HCV and MCV) are to 
be considered. 
3.2	
Traffic Growth Rate 
Some of the simple methods for estimating the traffic growth rates are given below: 
3.2.1	
Trend analysis 
The past trend of growth is analysed and the rate established by fitting a relationship of the 
type Tn = T0 ( I + r)" where n is the number of years, T0 is the traffic in zero year, Tn is the 
traffic in the nth year and r is the rate of growth in decimals. The future rate of growth can be 
fixed equal to or higher than the past rate depending on socio-economic considerations and 
future growth potential of the region where the road is located. Local enquiries in this regard 
are often very useful. 



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:SP-72-2015
9
3.2.2	
Econometric Model
The traffic growth rate can also be estimated by establishing econometric models, as per the 
procedure outlined in IRC:108 "Guidelines for Traffic Prediction on Rural Highways". 
3.2.3	
Recommended Growth Rate
In the absence of any specific information available to the designer, it is recommended that 
an average annual growth rate of 6% over the design life may be adopted.
3.3	
Design Life 
While selecting the design life of a pavement it must be borne in mind that at the end of the 
design life, the pavement will not have to be reconstructed all over again. It only means that 
at the end of the design life, it will only need to be strengthened, so that it can continue to 
carry traffic satisfactorily for a further specified period. It is necessary to carry out proper 
condition surveys atleast once a year, so that the nature and rate of change of condition will 
help identify as to when the pavement will require strengthening. A design life of 10 years is 
recommended for purposes of pavement design for gravel roads (with periodic re-gravelling) 
and for flexible pavements. This design life period of 10 years has been recommended 
to ensure that neither the strengthening will need to be carried out too soon nor will the 
design for a very long design period be unduly expensive by way of high initial investment 
required. 
The aspect of stage construction is specially relevant to the very low volume roads (design 
traffic less than 0.1 MSA) which are initially designed and constructed as all-weather gravel 
roads. After monitoring their performance and the growth in volume and composition of traffic 
over 5 years or so, can be suitably strengthened and black-topped where necessary. Suitably 
postponing the metalling and black-topping of gravel roads can go a long way in connecting 
more of the unconnected habitations within the same investment. 
The aspect of possible upgradation of a rural road to a higher category road at a future date 
must be kept in view, especially ensuring proper compaction of subgrade which serves as the 
very foundation of a pavement. 
3.4	
Computation of Design Traffic 
3.4.1	
For Upgradation of Existing Road 
 
(i)  
Traffic census should be conducted over a period of atleast 3 days, both 
during the peak harvesting season and also during the lean season for 
various vehicle types, both motorised as well as non-motorised; the number 
of laden, unladen and overloaded commercial vehicles also to be recorded 
during the traffic counts. Generally, there are two or more harvesting seasons 
with intervening lean season. Traffic census will be carried out during one 



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 48
======================================================================
IRC:SP-72-2015
10
of the harvesting seasons and also during the lean season. The average 
duration of each harvesting season and likely change in the peak traffic 
during other harvesting seasons than the one during which the census has 
been taken shall be ascertained from local enquiries and suitably considered 
in estimation of traffic. In case any information regarding change in peak 
traffic during other harvesting seasons could not be ascertained through 
local enquiries, the traffic could be assumed to be the same as the traffic 
data collected during the harvesting season.
 
(ii)  Average Daily Traffic (ADT) for 24 hours should be computed for each vehicle 
type, both during the peak-harvesting season and also during the lean season. 
Knowing the duration of harvesting season, (see Fig. 1, showing seasonal 
fluctuations in ADT) the total traffic during the year can be computed and 
consequently the Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) can be computed for 
each vehicle type.
Fig. 1  Seasonal Variations in Rural Traffic
Although the number and duration of harvesting seasons can vary from one region to the 
other, typically two harvesting seasons during the course of a year are shown in Fig. 1.  If 
T is the average number of commercial vehicles of a given category, plying per day during 
the lean season, the enhanced traffic during the peak season can be denoted by nT, over 
and above the lean season traffic T, the value of n varying widely from one region to the 
other. Typically, it takes about 40% of the duration of a harvesting season (t) to build up the 
traffic from lean-season level T to the peak. The peak traffic may continue for about 20% of 
the duration of harvesting period before coming down to the lean-season traffic level over a 



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 48
======================================================================

IRC:SP-72-2015
11
period of time, again about 40% of the total duration of the harvesting season. With these 
assumptions, the total number of repetitions (N) of a given vehicle type during the course of 
a year is given by:
	
	
	
N = T x 365 + 2nT [0.6t]
Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT)
	
	
	
 
(iii) It should generally be possible to capture the peak traffic from the actual 
traffic from the actual traffic count taken during the harvesting season. Thus, 
if the duration of harvesting season, the peak traffic and the duration of peak 
traffic are known, the average additional traffic during harvesting season can 
be estimated on the basis of information collected during the traffic survey. 
Local enquiries are often useful in estimating average additional traffic during 
harvesting season.
 
(iv)  In case of all roads where the projected traffic for 10 years design life is 
likely to be 1MSA  and above, it should be mandatory to get the traffic survey 
carried out through  a third party.
3.4.2	
New road 
In case of a new road, an approximate estimate should be made of traffic that would ply on 
the road considering the number of villages and their population along the road alignment 
and other socio-economic parameters. Traffic counts can be carried out on an existing road in 
the vicinity with similar conditions and knowing the population served as well as agricultural/
industrial produce to be transported, the expected traffic on the new proposed road can be 
estimated. In general, new roads for providing connectivity to single habitations of smaller 
populations (below 500) should be designed for traffic category below T3, 
Likely traffic on the proposed road can also be estimated on the basis of O-D survey along 
the nearby existing roads which presently serve the villages proposed to be connected.
Due consideration should be given to the ‘Diverted’ and ‘Generated’ traffic anticipated as 
a consequence of the development of the proposed road, land use of the area served, the 
probable growth of traffic and the design life.
3.4.3	
Determination of ESAL applications
For purpose of Pavement Design, only commercial vehicles with a gross laden weight of 
3 tonnes or more along with their axle loading are considered. These may include inter alia 
the following: 
	
Trucks (Heavy Medium)
	
Buses
	
Tractor-Trailers

The traffic parameter is generally evaluated in terms of a Standard Axle Load of 80 kN and 
the cumulative repetitions of the Equivalent Standard Axle Load (ESAL) are calculated over 
the design life.
Rural vehicles with single axle loads different from 80 kN, and tandem axle loads different 
from 148 kN  can be converted into standard axles using the Axle Equivalency Factor.

For single-lane and intermediate-lane roads, the design shall be based on the total number 
of commercial vehicles per day in both directions. For double-lane roads, the design should 
be based on 75% of the total number of vehicles in both directions.
3.4.4	
Vehicle damage factor 
The Vehicle Damage Factor (VDF) is a multiplier for converting the number of commercial 
vehicles of different axle loads to the number of standard axle load repetitions. It is defined 
as "equivalent number of standard axles per commercial vehicle". While the VDF value is 
arrived at from axle load surveys on the existing roads, the project size and traffic volume in 
the case of rural roads may not warrant conducting an axle load survey. It may be adequate 
to adopt indicative VDF values discussed below for the purpose of pavement design.
For calculating the VDF, the following categories of vehicles may be considered: - 
	
i) 	
Laden Heavy Commercial Vehicles (HCV) 
	
	
Fully loaded HCV (comprising heavy trucks, full-sized buses) have a Rear Axle 
Load of 10.2 tonnes and a Front Axle Load, about half the Rear Axle Load i.e. 
5 tonnes. The VDF works out to 2.58 (=2.44 + 0.14). 
	
ii)	
Unladen/Partially Loaded Heavy Commercial Vehicles 
 
 
Since the extent of loading of commercial vehicles is difficult to determine, 
a Rear Axle Load of 6 tonnes and a front axle load of 3 tonnes may be 
assumed for an Unladen/Partially Loaded HCY. The VDF works out to 0.31 
(= 0.29 + 0.02) 
	
iii) 	
Overloaded Heavy Commercial Vehicles
	
	
The extent of overloading may vary widely from one situation to the other. 
However, if an overload of 20% is there, the VDF goes up to 5.35 (=5.06+0.29). 
However, if only 10% of the laden HCV are overloaded to the extent of 20% 
the VDF works out to 2.86 (= 0.9 x 2.58 + 0.1 x 5.35). 
	
iv)	
Laden Medium-heavy Commercial Vehicles (MCV)
	
	
Fully loaded MCV (mostly comprising Tractor-Trailers) have a Rear Axle 
Load of 6 tonnes and a Front Axle Load of 3 tonnes. The VDF works out to 
0.31 (= 0.29 + 0.02)
	
v)	
Unladen/Partially Loaded Medium-heavy Commercial Vehicles
 
 
Since the extent of loading of commercial vehicles is difficult to determine, 
a Rear Axle Load of 3 tonnes and a Front Axle Load of 1.5 tonnes may be 
assumed. The VDF works out to 0.019 (= 0.018 + 0.001).
	
vi)	
Overloaded Medium-heavy Commercial Vehicles 
	
	
The extent of overloading may vary widely from one situation to the other. 
However, if an overload of 20% is there, the VDF goes upto 0.65 (= 0.61 + 
0.04). If only 10% of the laden MCV are overloaded to the extent of 20%, the 
VDF = 0.344 (= 0.1 x 0.65 + 0.9 x 0.31).

Towards the computation of ESAL applications, the indicative VDF values (i.e. Standard 
Axles per Commercial Vehicle) are given below:
Vehicle Type
Laden
Unladen/Partially Laden
HCV
2.86
0.31
MCV
0.34
0.02
For pavement design, the number of:
	
(i)	
HCV : laden, unladen and overloaded
 
(ii) 
MCV : laden, unladen and overloaded must be obtained from actual traffic 
counts and, using appropriate VDF values, the number of Equivalent Standard 
Axles to be catered over the design life are worked out. If, however for some 
reason, it is not possible to carry out all the required traffic counts, recourse 
to local enquiries may be taken to estimate their proportions in as realistic a 
manner as possible
Assuming a uniform traffic growth rate r of 6% over the design life (n) of 10 years, the 
cumulative ESAL applications (N) over the design life can be computed using the following 
formula:-

and L = lane distribution factor; L = 1 (One) for single lane/intermediate lane 
	
and L = 0.75 for two-lane roads
3.4.5	
In case the proportion of HCV and MCV in the traffic stream could not be 
ascertained, particularly for new roads, a reasonable estimate of design traffic in terms of 
cumulative standard axles can be obtained from Appendix A. This is based on typical vehicle 
composition observed on low volume roads

Traffic Categories: 
For pavement design, the traffic has been categorized into nine categories (T1 to T9) as 
under:

4  SUBGRADE STRENGTH EVALUATION
4.1	
The Subgrade
4.1.1	
Definition: As per MORD Specifications for Rural Roads (Ref 14), subgrade can 
be defined as a compacted layer, generally of naturally occurring local soil, assumed to be 
300 mm in thickness (for low volume roads) just beneath the pavement crust, and is made 
up of in-situ material, select soil or stabilized soil that forms the foundation of the pavement, 
providing a suitable foundation for the pavement. The subgrade in embankment is compacted 
in two layers, usually to a higher standard than the lower part of the embankment. It should be 
well compacted to limit the scope of rutting in pavement due to additional densification during 
the service life of pavement. In cuttings, the cut formation, which serves as the subgrade, 
is treated similarly to provide a suitable foundation for the pavement. Where the naturally 
occurring local subgrade soils have poor engineering properties and low strength in terms 
of CBR, for example in Black Cotton soil areas, improved subgrades are provided by way 
of lime/cement treatment or by mechanical stabilization and other similar techniques, as 
explained in Paras 4.2.2 and 4.3.  
4.1.2	
The subgrade, whether in cutting or in embankment, should be well compacted 
to utilize its full strength and to economize on the overall pavement thickness. The current 
MORD Specifications for Rural Roads require that the subgrade should be compacted to 
100% Maximum Dry Density achieved by the Standard Proctor Test (IS 2720-Part 7). The 
material used for subgrade construction should have a dry unit weight of not less than 16.5 
kN/m3.
4.1.3	
Soil surveys
It is necessary that a soil survey along and around the road alignment is carried out following 
the laid down-procedures and that the results of all field and laboratory investigations are 
made available to the designer. During the soil surveys, the depth and fluctuations of GWT 



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 48
======================================================================
IRC:SP-72-2015
16
must be recorded. All the representative samples of subgrade soils must be subjected to 
the simple classification tests (wet sieve analysis, liquid and plastic limits) and the soil group 
shown against each representative sample, ensuring that at least 3 samples are taken per 
kilometre length even if the same soil type continues.
For each of the soil groups thus identified, atleast one CBR test should be conducted with 
the soil compacted to the Standard Proctor density and at a moisture content corresponding 
to the wettest state considered appropriate to the site conditions.
4.2	
Subgrade Strength
4.2.1	
Design for new roads 
4.2.1.1	
Subgrade CBR value
For the pavement design of new roads, the subgrade strength needs to be evaluated in terms 
of CBR value.
The CBR of the subgrade can be estimated by any of the following methods: 
 
(i)  
Based on soil classification tests and using Table 1 (Ref 4) which gives typical 
presumptive design CBR values for soil samples compacted to Proctor 
density at optimum moisture content and soaked under water for 4 days. 
  
(ii) 
Using two sets of equations, based on classification test data, one for plastic 
soils and the other for non-plastic soils (Appendix B), for estimating soaked 
CBR values on samples compacted to Proctor density (Ref 18)
	
(iii)	 By conducting actual CBR tests in the laboratory. 
The CBR tests should be conducted on representative samples of subgrade soil compacted 
by static compaction to 100% Standard Proctor dry density and tested at a moisture content 
corresponding to the wettest moisture condition likely to occur in the subgrade during its 
service life. An average of test values obtained from a set of 3 specimens should be reported. 
If high variations are observed in the test values from the set of 3 specimens, then an average 
of test values obtained from 6 specimens should be taken.
The methods (i), (ii) and (iii) above, come in handy where adequate testing facilities are 
not available or the project is of such a size as not to warrant elaborate testing procedures. 
Where actual CBR test results for a particular soil type show considerable variation, the 
methods (i), (ii) and (iii) above provide a useful guide in estimating the most appropriate 
soaked CBR value for the soil.

Subgrde Classification
Estimating Subgrade Moisture Content
I.	
Where the GWT is close enough to 
the ground surface to influence the 
subgrade moisture content. In non-
plastic soils, GWT will influence the 
subgrade moisture content, if it rises to 
within 1 m of the road surface; in clays 
of low plasticity (Pl<20), if GWT rises 
within 3 m of the road surface and in 
heavy clays (PI>40), if GWT rises within 
7 m of the road surface. This category 
also includes coastal areas and flood 
plains where the GWT is maintained by 
the sea, by a lake or by a river, besides 
areas where GWT is maintained by 
rainfall
1.	
The most direct method is to measure the moisture 
content in subgrades below existing pavements in 
similar situations at the time of the year when the GWT 
is at its highest level.
2.	
The subgrade moisture content for different soil types 
can be estimated by using the ratio
	
Subgrade Moisture Contents	
which is about the 
      Plastic Limit
	
same when GWT and climatic conditions are similar.
3.	
Where such measurements are not possible, the 
subgrade strength may be determined in terms of 4-day 
soaked CBR value
II	
Subgrades with deep GWT but where 
seasonal rainfall brings about significant 
changes in moisture conditions under 
the road	
1.	
The subgrade moisture condition will depend on the 
balance between the water entering the subgrade 
through pavement edges/shoulders during rains and 
the moisture leaving the ground during dry periods. 
The design moisture content can be taken as optimum 
moisture content obtained from Proctor Compaction Test 
IS 2720 (Part 7) corresponding to maximum dry density 
or from the nomograph given in Fig. 2, whichever is 
higher.
2.	
The possibility of local perched GWT and effects of 
seasonal flooding should, however, also be considered 
while deciding on WT depth. Where such situations are 
encountered, the. subgrade strength may be determined 
in terms or 4-day soaked CBR value.
For determining the CBR value in the laboratory, the standard test procedure laid down in 
IS 2720 (Part 16) must be adopted.
4.2.1.2	
Selection of moisture content for subgrade strength evaluation: The subgrade 
moisture conditions can be classified as under (Ref 5).

Expansive soil subgrade 
Expansive soils/ Black Cotton soils are basically montmorillonitic clays which display a 
tendency to swell or heave during the process of wetting and to shrink when dry, as evidenced 
by shrinkage cracks. When subjected to seasonal wetting and drying, a road built on an 
expansive soil subgrade will cause unevenness of the pavement surface. In order to prevent 
such an unsatisfactory performance of the road, the following precautions should be taken:-
Compact the expansive soils at relatively low dry density and at high moisture content, 
since expansive soils compacted to high density at low moisture content will undergo higher 
volumetric changes. Therefore, an expansive soil should be compacted to 95% Standard 
Proctor compaction at a moisture content 1 to 2% higher than the optimum.

It is good practice to provide the pavement crust on an improved non-expansive soil, 
adequately compacted, 0.6 m to 1.0 m in thickness and the pavement designed for the CBR 
of improved subgrade. However, where such a non-expansive buffer layer does not work out 
to be economical, a blanket course of coarse/medium sand or non-plastic moorum (PI<5) or 
lime-treated black cotton soil subbase can be provided, extending over the entire formation 
width, together with measures for efficient drainage. 
4.2.3	
Upgradation/rehabilitation of existing roads: 
The insitu subgrade strength of an existing road will be determined in terms of CBR value 
obtained on representative subgrade soil samples remoulded to the insitu density at the field 
equilibrium moisture content, observed after the recession of the rainy season (Fig. 3). If, for 
some reason, it is not found possible to determine the field moisture content immediately after 
the recession of monsoon, the 4 days' soaked CBR value of the re-moulded subgrade soil 
samples, compacted to field density, may be determined. When the alternative of carrying out 
DCP tests is adopted, salient details are provided in the modified Appendix C, which relates 
to strength of the subgrade in terms of CBR at insitu moisture and density.
Fig. 3. Subgrade Strength Determination for Upgradation/Rehabilition of an Existing Road
4.3	
Subgrade Strength Classes 
The strength of subgrade for design of new roads shall not be less than the values specified 
below. 
	
(a)	
The strength of subgrade for design shall not be less than 5% (atleast fair), 
even when the traffic volumes are low. In case the CBR of the subgrade soil 
is less than 5%, the subgrade should be stabilized to achieve a minimum 
design CBR of 5%, i.e. the quality of sub-grade for design purposes should 
be atleast fair. In order to use the Design Catalogue (Para 8), the subgrade 
strength is divided into the following classes:
Quality of

Where the CBR of subgrade soil is 2 or less, the economic feasibility of replacing 
300 mm subgrade with suitable soil needs to be explored and, if found feasible, the pavement

should then be designed based on the CBR value of the improved subgrade.  The option 
of replacement of sub-grade soil should be considered only when it is cheaper than the 
stabilization. 
5  PAVEMENT COMPOSITION AND MAXIMISING USE OF 
LOCALLY AVAILABLE MATERIALS
5.1	
Pavement Composition
5.1.1	
Sub-base course 
For granular sub-base, the materials generally used are natural sand, moorum, gravel, crushed 
stone, crushed slag, brick metal, kankar or combination thereof depending upon the grading 
required as per Clause 401 of the MORD Specifications for Rural Roads (Ref 14). For silty 
clays and clayey soils including Black-Cotton soils, a lime treated sub base may be provided 
as per Clause 403 of the MORD Specifications for Rural Roads (Ref 14), taking care that 
the lime shall have purity of not less than 70% by weight of quicklime (CaO) when tested in 
accordance with IS 1514. Where the lime of different calcium oxide content is to be used, its 
quantity should be suitably adjusted so that equivalent calcium oxide content is incorporated 
in the work. For soils which do not respond to lime treatment and where comparatively higher 
and faster development of strength and durability characteristics are needed, especially for 
water logged and high rainfall areas, cement treated subbase course can be provided, as per 
Clause 404 of the MORD Specifications for Rural Roads (Ref 14). The cement content for a 
cement treated subbase should be determined by mix design, yielding a 7-day unconfined 
compressive strength of not less than 1.7 MPa. From practical considerations, the thickness 
of subbase, where provided, shall not be less than 100 mm.
5.1.2	
Base course 
For rural roads designed for cumulative ESAL repetitions more than 1,00,000, unbound 
granular bases which comprise conventional Water Bound Macadam (WBM), Wet Mix 
Macadam (WMM) or Crusher Run Macadam Base are adopted as per Clauses 405, 406 and 
411 of the MORD Specifications for Rural Roads (Ref 14). Where hard stone metal is not 
available within economical leads, a cement stabilized base can be provided as per Clause 
404 of the MORD Specifications for Rural Roads (Ref 14).
For rural roads designed for cumulative ESAL repetitions less than 1,00,000, a Gravel base is 
recommended, except for a very poor subgrade strength (CBR=2) under the Traffic Categories 
of 30,000 to 60,000; and 60,000 to 100,000 ESAL applications and for poor subgrade strength 
(CBR=3 to 4) under the Traffic Category of 60,000 to 100,000 ESAL applications as shown in 
Fig. 4. The various grading, plasticity and other requirements for a Gravel base are detailed 
in Clause 402 of the MORD Specifications for Rural Roads (Ref 14).

5.1.3	
Surfacing
For rural roads designed for cumulative ESAL repetitions, over 100,000, a bituminous surface 
treatment of 2-coat surface dressing or 20 mm premix carpet is recommended, as per 
MORD Specifications for Rural Roads (Ref 14). However, for rural roads designed for ESAL 
applications less than 100,000, a non-bituminous gravel surfacing is recommended as per 
Clause 402 of the MORD Specifications, except for the very poor subgrade strength (CBR=2) 
under traffic categories T2 and T3 and for the poor subgrade strength (CBR= 3 to 4) under 
Traffic Category T2 only, where a bituminous surface treatment has been recommended, as 
shown in Fig. 4.
5.2	
Maximizing Use of Locally Available Materials 
5.2.1.	
A variety of locally available materials can be used which may be grouped under 
the following categories: 
	
(i)	
Selected granular soil for use in subgrade. 
 
(ii)  Mechanical stabilization, stabilization with lime, cement, lime and flyash, as 
appropriate. 
	
(iii) 	 Naturally occurring softer aggregate like moorum, kankar, gravel etc. 
	
(iv) 	 Brick and overburnt brick metal. 
	
(v) 	 Stone metal 
	
(vi) 	 Industrial Wastes
Maximizing the use of locally available materials, suitable and economical designs can be 
worked out and the most suitable and economical design adopted.
5.2.2	
Some of the important points in the use of these materials are discussed in 
subsequent paragraphs. 
5.2.2.1	
Selected Granular soil:
Well-graded soils with low plasticity have better engineering properties and should be 
reserved for use as the improved subgrade portion. Such soils can be identified by their high 
Proctor density and low PI values. The sampling and testing of borrow material shall be as 
per Clause 1803.2 of the MORD Specifications for Rural Roads, 2014.
5.2.2.2	
Stabilization of local soils 
A variety of techniques are available for stabilizing local soils for improving their engineering 
properties, but not all the techniques are applicable to all types of soils. A brief description of 
the stabilization mechanism and applicability of the individual techniques are given in Table 
2 (Clause 408, Ref 14). This may be referred to for choosing the most appropriate technique 
for stabilizing the soil at site. The mix proportions are generally worked out in the laboratory 
based on soaked CBR.

5.2.2.3	
Naturally occurring marginal aggregates
Marginal aggregates like brick ballast, laterite, kankar, moorum, dhandla, etc. where available 
within economic leads, should be made use of in pavement construction to the maximum 
extent feasible. The material may occur in graded form or as discrete blocks or admixtured 
with soil. The manner of using these is indicated in Table 3 (Clause 408, Ref 14).
5.2.2.4	
Brick soling 
In alluvial plains where hard stone aggregate are normally not available within economical 
leads, the general specification adopted for sub-base and base courses is to provide 
brick soling. Either flat bricks or bricks on edge can be used depending on the thickness 
requirements. In case of flat bricks, two layers are desirable. The bricks should be of good 
quality and well burnt. Before laying, it is generally desirable to provide a cushion of sand 
above the earth subgrade. 
5.2.2.5	
Water bound macadam
Water bound macadam (WBM) is one of the most common specification adopted for 
construction of subbase, base and surfacing courses. Broken stone, overburnt brick metal, 
laterite, or kankar can be used as the coarse aggregate for WBM. For details of the WBM 
technique, reference may be made to Clause 405 of the MORD Specifications for Rural 
Roads (Ref 14).

Mechanical 
Stabilization 
Blending missing fractions (eg. clay with 
sand and sand with clay) so as to produce 
a mass of maximum possible density with 
plasticity within limits. A smooth grading 
similar to that given by Fuller's grading rule 
** is adopted to work out the proportion of 
the missing fractions to be blended.
Sands, moorum/gravel having missing 
fractions and clayey soils can be 
stabilized by this technique. 
2.
Lime 
Stabilization 
Lime in hydrated form reacts with the clay 
minerals in the soil to cause (i) immediate 
reduction in plasticity and increase in CBR 
because of cationic exchange, flocculation 
and agglomeration which may be reversible 
under certain conditions, and (ii) long term 
chemical reaction with the clay minerals to 
produce cementitious products which bind 
the soil for increased strength and stability.
Medium and heavy clays having a PI of 
at least 10 and containing at least 15% 
of materials finer than 425 micron are 
suitable. However, some soils though 
containing clay fractions may not produce 
the long-term chemical reaction because 
of the presence of organic matter (>2%), 
or soluble sulphate/carbonate (>0.2%), 
etc. For lime stabilization to be successful, 
it will be desirable to test the soil for lime 
reactivity. A soil whose 7 -day unconfined 
compression strength increases by at 
least 3 Kg/cm2 with lime treatment can 
be considered lime reactive.

Cement 
Stabilization 
The hydrated products of cement bind 
the soil particles, the strength developed 
depending on the concentration of cement 
and the intimacy with which the soil particles 
are mixed with cement. A high cement 
content of the order of 7-10% can produce 
a hard mass having a 7-day compressive 
strength of 20 kg/cm2 or more, and this 
usually goes by the term soil-cement. 
However, a smaller proportion of 2-3% 
cement can improve the CBR value to 
more than 25, and the material goes by the 
term "cement-modified soil", which can be 
advantageously used as sub -base/base 
for rural roads.
Generally, granular soils free of high 
concentration of organic matter not 
greater than 2%, or deleterious salts 
(sulphate and carbonate not greater than 
0.2%) are suitable. A useful rule for soil 
selection is that the plasticity modulus 
(product of Pl and fraction passing 425 
micron sieve) should be less than 250 
and that the uniformity coefficient should 
be greater than 5. 
4.
Lime Flyash
Stabilization 
Lime chemically reacts with the silica and 
alumina in flyash to form cementitious 
compounds which binds the soil. 
Soils of medium plasticity (PI -5-20) and 
clayey soils not reactive to lime can be 
stabilized with lime and flyash. 
5.
Bitumen 
Stabilization 
Bitumen binds the soil particles
Clean graded sands can be stabilized by 
this technique. 
6.
Two-stage 
Stabilization 
This generally applies to heavy clays. 
The clay is treated with lime in the first 
stage to reduce plasticity and to facilitate 
pulverization. In the second stage, the 
resulting soil is stabilized with cement, 
bitumen, lime or lime -flyash. 
Heavy clays with PI > 30

6  PAVEMENT DESIGN OF GRAVEL/SOIL-AGGREGATE ROADS 
6.1	
General 
6.1.1	
Gravel/Soil-Aggregate is a mix of stone, sand and fine-sized particles used as a 
subbase, base or surfacing on a road. The gradation and plasticity requirements for use in 
subbase, base and surfacing are given in Clauses 401 and 402 of the MORD Specifications for 
Rural Roads (Ref 14). The required properties of road gravels may or may not be available in 
naturally occurring gravels. The aggregate gradation can be obtained by crushing, screening 
and blending process as may be necessary. Fine aggregate, passing IS Sieve 4.75 mm 
consists of natural or crushed sand and fine mineral particles. The physical requirements of 
aggregates are given in Clause 402 of the MORD Specifications for Rural Roads (Ref. 14). 
The Indian Roads Congress has also brought out separately manual for Design, Construction 
and Maintenance of Gravel Roads (Ref. 20)  
6.1.2	
For gravel (aggregate-surfaced) roads, when the subgrade CBR is above 2, 
the traffic level considered is upto 60,000 repetitions of 80 kN ESAL. However, where the 
subgrade CBR is above 5, a gravel/aggregate-surfaced road can take upto 1,00,000 ESAL 
applications during the design life (Ref 2).
6.1.3	
It is to be recognized that Gravel/Aggregate-surfaced roads can serve low 
volume traffic adequately for many years, provided they are well-maintained, by regularly 
replenishing lost gravel and periodic regravelling. These roads are relatively much easier to 
maintain compared to black-topped roads, involving a much lower level of resources, skills 
and equipment. Essentially, the maintenance measures are aimed at repairing or reducing 
the damage caused by the combined effects of weather and traffic and to provide the desired 
level of serviceability, by performing the following maintenance tasks:
 
(a) 
Grading to restore a good cross-profile to enable water to be drained off 
and torestore gravel from the shoulders to fill up potholes and corrugations. 
Tractor-towed grading equipment can be used or even labour-based 
reshaping can be resorted to. 
	
(b) 	 Dragging, to correct minor defects on the road surface, using a tractor-towed 
drag.
	
(c) 	 Patching of potholes can be carried out by manual methods.
	
(d) 	 Regravelling, by adding new gravel, before surface starts deteriorating 
rapidly, using only agricultural tractors and manual labour. Regravelling may 
be justified periodically say every 3 to 5 years, depending on traffic and 
climatic conditions. 
 
(e)  Dust control by using surface gravel with relatively higher percentage of fines 
as per Clause 402 of MORD Specifications. In arid and semi-arid areas, it 
may be necessary to periodically spread natural clay or to spray hygroscopic 
products like low cost chlorides of calcium, magnesium or sodium. Thin 
bituminous surface treatment as dust pallaiative may also be considered 
where dust control by the above-suggested methods IS not practicable or 
effective.

Design Chart
The gravel base thickness required for the five subgrade strength classes (S1, S2, S3, S4, 
and S5) and for the traffic categories of cumulative ESAL repetitions 10,000-30,000 (T1); 
30,000-60,000 (T2) and 60,000-100,000 (T3) are shown in Fig. 4. A chart to convert a 
portion of the Aggregate Base Layer thickness to an equivalent thickness of subbase 
(Ref 2) with an intermediate CBR value between the base and subgrade is shown in Fig. 5. and 
Table 4. It must, however, be ensured that a minimum 100 mm thickness of gravel base 
is always provided. Besides grading requirements specified for gravel base and surfacing 
(Ref 14), the minimum soaked CBR of 80 for the gravel base material is often considered an 
additional requirement. In case, gravel base material of above specifications is not available, 
one layer of WBM grade –III of 75 mm thickness may be proposed at the top and the balance 
25 mm thickness should be added in the thickness of granular sub-base.

Surface Gravel
The thicknesses provided in the Design Catalogue (Fig. 4) are the Gravel base thicknesses 
and the base gravel conforms to Clause 402, Table 400.2 of the MORD Specifications for 
Rural Roads. This material may not form a durable crust to keep the material bound together 
on a Gravel Road and is difficult to maintain. It is, therefore, recommended that the gravel 
base shall be covered with the surface gravel material conforming to Table 400.3, Clause 402 
of the MORD Specifications for Rural Roads. The thickness of the surface layer will generally 
vary from 40 to 50 mm depending on the traffic and quality of material. This thickness of the 
surface gravel is in addition to the gravel base thickness calculated from design as this is for 
protecting the gravel base and may require re-gravelling.

7  DESIGN OF FLEXIBLE PAVEMENT FOR TRAFFIC OVER 100,000 
CUMULATIVE ESAL REPETITIONS
7.1	
Subbase Materials
7.1.1.	
Granular sub-base
Granular sub-base materials conforming to Clause 401 of the MORD Specifications for Rural 
Roads (Ref 14) are recommended for use. These specifications suggest three gradings and 
specify that the materials passing 425 micron sieve should have liquid limit and plasticity 
index as indicated below

The soaked CBR value should not be less than 20. In case the subbase material of the 
requisite soaked CBR value is not available within economical leads, the subbase material 
meeting any of the prescribed gradings and other requirements with a soaked CBR value of 
not less than 15 can be permitted with the approval of the competent authority.
7.1.2	
Stabilized soil sub-base 
For silty clays and clayey soils, including Black Cotton soils, treatment with lime offers an 
appropriate and cost effective technique which may be in the form of modification by way of 
reducing the PI or in the form of a stabilization technique for attaining the needed strength 
as per Clause 403 (Ref 14). For soils which do not respond to lime treatment and where 
comparatively higher and faster development of strength and durability characteristics are 
needed, especially for water logged and high rainfall areas, soil stabilization with cement is 
most appropriate. For cement treated soil subbase courses, the relevant specifications are 
contained in Clause 404 (Ref 14). The cement content for a cement treated subbase should 
be determined by mix design, yielding a 7-day unconfined compressive strength of not less 
than 1.7 MPa. From practical considerations, the thickness of subbase, where provided, shall 
not be less than 100 mm.
7.1.3	
Use of marginal aggregates/industrial wastes
While the use of Marginal Aggregates has been covered in Para 5.2.2.3, the material 
characterization of industrial wastes must be carried out as per Clause 410 of the MORD 
Specifications for Rural Roads (Ref 14). Soils of medium plasticity (PI 5-20) and clayey soils 
not reactive to lime alone can be stabilized with lime and flyash as per Clause 409 (Ref 14).


IRC:SP-72-2015
29
Similarly slags from Iron and Steel industries meeting the requirements as per Clause 410 
(Ref 14) can also be used in subbase courses.
7.1.4	
The thickness of subbase where provided shall not be less than 100 mm.
7.2	
Base Course Materials
7.2.1	
Gravel base material
For traffic upto 1,00,000 ESAL applications, gravel/soil-aggregate meeting the requirements 
laid down in Clause 402 (Ref 14) of the MORD Specifications for Rural Roads is found to be 
both suitable and economical. 
It may be pointed out that for the successful performance of a non-bitumenised gravel road 
surface, a gravel surfacing material meeting the requirements laid down in Clause 402 
(Ref 14) for gravel surfacing materials must be provided. 
For higher traffic ranges, over 1,00,000 ESAL repetitions, higher types of base materials 
involving the use of crushed stone material or soil-cement will be needed, and the road 
surface black-topped.
7.2.2	
Macadam base course
Conventionally, the WBM base courses have been used in India even for the low volume 
rural roads. However, the cost of WBM becomes uneconomical in areas where hard stone 
has to be carted from long distances, sometimes as much as 300 km; in such cases, the 
possibility of using a soil-cement base course must be explored. WBM must be laid as per the 
specifications laid down in Clause 405 (Ref 14), taking special care to see that the screenings 
and binding material meet the required engineering properties and are used in the specified 
quantities. Improved crushed stone base courses by way of Wet Mix Macadam and Crusher 
Run Macadam can be used, following the specifications laid down in Clauses 406 and 411 
(Ref 14) respectively.
7.2.3	
Soil-cement base
Where hard stone has to be carted from long uneconomical leads, the use of soil-cement often 
offers an appropriate option. The soil-cement mix should be designed to attain a minimum 
laboratory 7-day unconfined compressive strength of 3 MPa. Special consideration must be 
given to pulverization of soil clods to the specified requirements and thorough mixing as laid 
down in Clause 404 (Ref 14). For clayey soils, pre-treatment with lime may be needed before 
stabilization with cement.
7.2.4	
The Thickness of base shall be as per pavement design catalogue for soil cement 
bases but should not be less than 100 mm.

7.3. 	
Bituminous Surfacing
7.3.1. 	
The need
Bituminous surfacing is a relatively expensive item, and its use should be made judiciously. 
Even when used, the specification will not generally be higher than one/two-coat surface 
dressing provided as per Clause 505 (Ref 14) or 20 mm thick open-graded premix carpet as 
per Clause 506 (Ref 14). A thin bituminous surfacing serves the following purposes.
 
• 
Improves the riding quality 
 
• 
Seals the surface, thus preventing the entry of water which would otherwise 
weaken the pavement structure. 
 
• 
Protects the granular base from the damaging effects of traffic 
7.3.2	
Warrants for bituminous surfacing
 Pneumatic-tyred fast moving vehicles like the commercial rural vehicles damage unprotected 
granular bases and create dust nuisance. Also, the operating costs of such vehicles is 
highly influenced by the smoothness of the road pavement. Bituminous surfacing will be 
advantageous where subgrade is poor (CBR less than 4), the design traffic exceeds 60,000 
ESAL applications, and annual rainfall generally exceeds 1000 mm. Broad guidelines for 
providing a bituminous surface treatment over a well-drained gravel road surface, considering 
the above influencing factors viz. (i) Subgrade strength, (ii) traffic volume and (iii) annual 
rainfall in the area are given in Table 5.

Recommended surfacings are shown in the Design Catalogues (Fig. 4).
As part of the stage development strategy, it is often desirable to postpone the provision 
of a bituminous surface treatment for the first few years of its service life during which the 
pavement may undergo any undulations and the entire pavement system, including the 
drainage system, gets stabilized.
7.3.3	
Type of bituminous surfacing 
For the low volume rural roads, when a bituminous surfacing needs to be provided, two 
alternatives viz, Surface Dressing and 20 mm Premix Carpet are generally available. The

recently revised and vastly improved IRC specifications for Surface Dressing adopt the concept 
of Average Least Dimension (ALD) of stone chips and take into account, the factors of traffic, 
type of existing surface, climate and type of chipping. A standardised chart (Ref 19) is used 
for the determination of design binder content and chipping application rate. The adoption 
of the revised IRC specifications make Surface Dressing both suitable and economical for 
low traffic volume conditions, as borne out by its popularity in several countries abroad. In 
all cases of traffic categories T1 to T4, surface dressing should be preferred as bituminous 
surfacing.  However, 20 mm Premix Carpet can be used as an alternative to Surface Dressing 
for traffic categories T5 to T9. Further, in all cases of stabilized base and sub-base courses it 
is recommended that bituminous surface treatment as surface dressing or premix carpet be 
provided using polymer modified bitumen or cold mix technology.
8  RECOMMENDED PAVEMENT DESIGNS
The recommended flexible pavement designs for low-volume rural roads with granular sub 
bases and bases  are given in Fig. 4. A chart to convert portion of the gravel/soil aggregate 
base layer thickness to an equivalent thickness of sub-base is given in Fig. 5 and Table 5. 
Design charts using stabilized sub bases and bases are given in Fig. 6 The salient features 
of the design catalogues are as under:
 
(i)  
There are five subgrade strength classes S1, S2, S3, S4, & S5 covering a 
range of CBR values from 2 to 15, for each of which, the pavement thickness 
and composition requirements are given under different traffic categories in 
terms of ESAL applications 
 
(ii)  The traffic parameter has been categorized into 9 categories as under: 
	
T1 	
10,000 to 30,000 ESAL applications 
	
T2 	
> 30,000 to 60,000 ESAL applications 
	
T3 	
> 60,000 to 1,00,000 ESAL applications 
	
T4	
> 1,00,000 to 2,00,000 ESAL applications 
	
T5	
> 2,00,000 to 3,00,000 ESAL applications 
	
T6 	
> 3,00,000 to 6,00,000 ESAL applications 
	
T7	
> 6,00,000 to 10,00,000 ESAL applications
	
T8	
> 10,00,000 to 15,00,000 ESAL applications (1 MSA to 1.5 MSA)
	
T9	
> 15,00,000 to 20,00,000 ESAL applications (1.5 MSA to 2 MSA)
 
(iii) Based on long-term performance of gravel roads for low-volume rural traffic in 
a large number of countries, developed and developing, gravel roads perform 
satisfactorily up to about 60,000 ESAL applications during the design life of 
10 years for any subgrade CBR above 2 (Ref. 2). If, however, the subgrade 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP-72-2015
32
CBR is above 5, Gravel roads can perform satisfactorily upto about 1,00,000 
ESAL applications, during the design life of 10 years, (Ref. 2) as shown in 
Fig. 4.
	
(iv) 	 Black-Topped Flexible pavements need to be designed for a minimum ADT 
of 200 or design traffic of 1,00,000 ESAL applications, during the design life 
of 10 years. 
 
(v)  A minimum 150 mm thick base course should be provided in the flexible 
pavement designs for ESAL applications from 1,00,000 to 10,00,000. 
	
(vi) Design catalogue for using stabilized soil sub-bases and soil cement bases is 
given in Fig. 6, indicating minimum required thicknesses.  
 
(vii) The recommended thicknesses in flexible pavement designs are generally 
multiples of 75 mm or 100 mm as required by practical considerations in the 
implementation of these designs. 
	
(viii) All the recommended designs are amenable to further strengthening at a 
future date. 
 
(ix) For flexible pavement designs with a design traffic over 20,00,000 ESAL 
applications, IRC:37-2012 may be referred to. However, thick bituminous 
layers may not be warranted and could be substituted by granular 
construction. 
 
(x) 
In areas susceptible to frost action, all black-topped flexible pavements in 
the Design Catalogue (Figs. 4 and 6), need to be provided with a minimum 
pavement thickness of 450 mm (300 mm sub-base + 150 mm base), even 
when the CBR value of the subgrade warrants a smaller thickness. 
	
(xi) 	 The Gravel base thickness requirements for Gravel Roads as given in the 
Design Catalogue (Fig. 4) need to be increased in areas susceptible to frost 
action (Ref 2), as under:

9  DRAINAGE AND SHOULDERS
9.1	
Drainage Design 
It must be recognized that a scientifically worked out drainage design is a vital part of the 
design of pavement system as a whole. The pavement design recommended in this Manual 
is based on the assumption that (i) proper cross-slopes are provided over the carriageway 
and roadside shoulders to shed off the rainwater quickly (ii) top of the subgrade/improved 
subgrade is raised sufficiently, preferably not less than 300 mm above the GL and not less 
than 600 mm above the highest GWT. (iii) adequately designed roadside ditches/drains are 
provided, and (iv) all cross-drainage structures are provided as per requirements. 
Besides the drainage requirements as above, it is also necessary to provide drainage of 
pavement layers especially where the sub grade is of relatively low permeability e.g. a clay 
subgrade. While no separate drainage layer is considered necessary for rural roads, it is 
necessary that atleast half the subbase layer thickness, subject to a minimum of 100 mm 
should be extended across the shoulders. However, this being a costly affair should be used 
selectively only in the those cases where the subgrade is clayey and the shoulders are 
also made up of earthern material with very poor drainage characteristics. In the sub-base 
material, the percent passing 75 micron sieve must not exceed 5%. Typical cross-section 
showing drainage of layers is shown in Fig. 7.
9.2	
Shoulders
For the successful performance of a rural road pavement, it is necessary that adequate 
lateral support be provided by roadside shoulders. These are all the more important when the 
pavement materials are unbound in nature. The shoulder material should be selected using 
the same principles as for gravel roads or a subbase to carry construction traffic. The shoulder 
material should normally be of subbase quality compacted to a thickness of 100 mm. Where 
the anticipated traffic on the shoulders is high e.g high percentage of animal-drawn carts, 
gravelled shoulders need to be provided over 1m width from the edge of the carriageway as 
per MORD Specifications for Rural Roads Clause 407. It is advisable if atleast the outer edge 
of shoulder is grassed with an appropriate species to prevent erosion. Where shoulders are 
not gravelled, and the traffic volume is very low, it is advantageous to grass the whole of the 
shoulder.

* Includes both motorized and non-motorized vehicles
Assumptions
1. 
A commercial vehicle (CV) is defined as a vehicle of gross laden weight of 3 tonnes 
or more.  For purposes of pavement design, the commercial vehicles comprise of 
the following categories: 
 
• 
Heavy Commercial Vehicles (HCV) comprising heavy trucks and full-sized 
buses.
 
• 
Medium-heavy Commercial Vehicles (MCV) comprising Tractor-trailers/
Jugads, Mini buses, Pick-up Vans. 
2.	
Since the extent of loading of a commercial vehicle is different to determine, the 
Single Axle Loads (Rear Axle) of laden and unlades (including partially loaded) 
vehicles in the HCV category can be assumed as 10.2 tonnes and 5 tonnes 
respectively.  For the MCV, the Single Axle Loads (Rear Axle) of a laden and 
unladen (including partially loaded) vehicles can be assumed as 6 tonnes and 
3 tonnes respectively.  The Light Vehicles (LV) even when fully laden will have a 
gross laden weight of less than 3 tonnes and hence need not be considered for 
pavement design. 
3.	
Amongst the commercial vehicles per day (CVPD), the HCV vary from 0 to 20% 
of CVPD while MCV constitute over 80% of CVPD.
4.	
Ten (10) percent of CVPD are overloaded to the extent of 20% of the maximum 
permissible load.
5. 
For traffic up to ADT = 100, it is assumed that no HCV ply on the road i.e.,HCV = 0.
6.	
Laden and Unladen Vehicles under each category are equal in number.

APPENDIX C
         A Typical Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP)
SALIENT FEATURES OF DCP TEST
The Dynamic Cone Penetrometer is a simple device developed in UK for rapid in situ strength 
evaluation of subgrade and other unbound pavement layers.  Essentially, a DCP measures 
the penetration of a standard cone when driven by a standard force, the reported DCP value 
being in terms of the penetration of the standard cone, in mm per blow of the standard 
hammer.  The figure above shows a typical DCP.  The standard steel cone with an angle of 
600 has a diameter of 20 mm.  The standard 8 kg drop hammer slides over a 16 mm dia steel 
rod with a fall height of 575 mm.
Basically, the penetration (in mm) per blow is inversely proportional to the strength of the 
material.  Thus, higher the CBR value of a material being tested, lower will be the DCP 
value in mm/blow.  Besides the measurement of subgrade strength, the DCP tests can be 
conducted to determine the boundaries between pavement layers with different strengths 
and their thicknesses. The measurements can be taken upto 1.2 m depth with an extension 
rod.  
While one person holds the DCP instrument in a vertical position, another person carefully 
drops the weight and the third takes the readings of penetration. The penetration of the cone 
can be measured on a graduated scale.  The readings are taken with each blow of the weight. 
The field data is reduced in terms of penetration versus corresponding number of blows. The 
number of blows and depth readings are recorded on the Dynamic Cone Penetrometer Test 
form.  The cone is case-hardened but requires replacing.  When used on subgrade materials 
the cone can be expected to last 30 to 40 tests before replacement. 
The DCP test is specially useful for bituminous pavement rehabilitation design and is being 
used extensively in several countries.

(Motorised and Non-motorised Vehicles per day)
There are two harvesting seasons in the area, each having a duration of about 2 ½ months, 
the harvesting season traffic remaining at its peak for 15 days.  The above traffic count data 
was collected 2 years before opening the road to traffic.
The depth of the Ground Water Table was found to be about 10 m below Ground Level.  The 
average annual rainfall in the region is of the order of 750 mm.  The soil survey results show 
the subgrade soil type to be CL with a plasticity index of 13.  The maximum dry density and 
optimum moisture content were found to be 1.68 gm/cc and 12% respectively.  The CBR 
sample prepared at OMC, and compacted to MDD, yielded a CBR of 5.  The locally available 
materials include river gravel and sand besides an overly plastic moorum with excessive 
fines. Determine the most appropriate pavement thickness and composition requirements.  
Design Calculations
1.	
Computation of Design Traffic Parameter
Since the lean-season traffic data is not available, it is assumed that the peak harvesting 
season traffic is double the traffic during the non-harvesting season.  Referring to Fig. 1, 
n = 1, t = 75 days.
Average Daily Traffic during the non-harvesting season = 761/2 = 380
	
AADT = 380 + 1 2 380 75
365
. ×
×
	
= 380 + 94 = 474 
Before opening of the road to traffic, AADT = 474 (1.06)2 = 532, assuming an intial growth 
rate of 6%.



======================================================================
PAGE 48 of 48
======================================================================
IRC:SP-72-2015
42
From the given traffic count data, the proportions of HCV and MCV out of the ADT of 532 
work out as under:
	
Heavy Commercial Vehicles (HCV) = 6
	
Medium Heavy Commercial Vehicles (MCV) = 38
The Animal-drawn carts being pneumatic tyred have not been considered for design 
purposes. 
Therefore, Commercial Vehicles Per Day (CVPD) to be considered for design purposes = 
6 +38 = 44.  Since the traffic  count data does not give the proportion of unladen and laden 
vehicles, it is assumed that these are equal in number.
Taking the VDF values from para 3.4.4, the ESAL applications per day = 16.35 Cumulative 
ESAL applications over 10 years @ 6% growth rate.
	
= 4811 X 16.35
	
= 78,660 
2.	
Evaluation of Subgrade Strength
Since the GWT is too deep to influence the subgrade moisture, the design moisture may be 
close to the optimum moisture content.  Referring to the Nomograph in Fig. 2, for insitu dry 
density of 1.68 gm/cc, GWT depth of 10 m PI of 13 and average annual rainfall of 75 cm, the 
Equilibrium Moisture Content works out to about 11%.  The optimum moisture content of 12% 
being higher, the CBR value of 5 may be taken for subgrade strength.  
3.	
Pavement Thickness and Composition
For cumulative ESAL applications of 78,660, referring to the Traffic category in the range 
60,000 to 1,00,000 and the Subgrade category of CBR 5 to 6, in Fig. 4, any one of the 
following two alternate designs may be  adopted, based on cost economics
	
(a)	
Using gravel base and sub-base : A 275 mm Gravel Base should be provided 
as per. Fig. 4. However, considering minimum gravel base thick ness of 
100 mm, balance 175 mm thickness can be converted to equivalent sub-
base thickness using fig 5 or Table 5. The specifications for a Gravel Road 
as per Clause 402 of the Specification for Rural Roads should be adopted.  
	
(b)	
Using cement treated base and sub-base : A total thickness of 200 mm as 
per fig 6 should be provided. However, cement stabilized base may be of 
thickness 100 mm and the balance 100 mm thickness may be of cement 
treated sub-base. The specifications for a cement stabilized base and sub-
base, as per Clause 404 of the Specification for Rural Roads should be 
adopted.
