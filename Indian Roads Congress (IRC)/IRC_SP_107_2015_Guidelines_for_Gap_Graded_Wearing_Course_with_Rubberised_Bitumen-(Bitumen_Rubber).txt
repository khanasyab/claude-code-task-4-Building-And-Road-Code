1.2 
Research and legislation* on using Crumb Rubber (CR) from discarded tyres 
in bituminous construction particularly in the USA has culminated into the development of 
technologies (12, 13, 14, 16, 20) and specifications (1, 2, 3, 4) thanks to the concerted efforts 
and support of highway administration, environmental agencies, research organizations, 
manufacturers and contracting agencies. The technology known as Asphalt Rubber (AR) 
technology in the USA, exploits the potential of rubber to greatly improve the properties 
of bituminous binders, hence that of the bituminous mixes, to enhance eventually the 
performance of the pavements in terms of strength, durability, serviceability, safety and traffic 
noise reduction. The driving force behind the technology is the environmental concern for 
safe disposal of huge pile of discarded tyres of automobiles, which cannot easily be recycled 
into usable rubber. Its use for industrial applications by burning emits Green House Gases 
and thereby contributes to global warming and climate change. The AR technology uses 
rubber from the discarded tyres by converting it into crumbs (of sizes less than 2 mm) to be 
mixed with bitumen to produce bitumen rubber binder replacing the bitumen only binder.
1.3	
Gap Graded mixes with a Bitumen-Rubber (BR) binder (or rubberised bitumen 
binder) is being successfully used on high volume and other roads of many states of USA to 
obtain a durable wearing course as well as other countries like Sweden (21), South Africa 
and China (19). Bitumen-Rubber binder consists of a blend of hot bitumen and crumb rubber 
(CR) made from scrap or waste tyres. High viscosity bitumen-rubber binder with a minimum 
crumb rubber contents of 20% by weight of bitumen having a minimum viscosity of 1500 CP 
at 177ºC is used to obtain the Bitumen Rubber mixes which are resistant to rutting and fatigue 
fracture along with reduced ageing due to (i) larger binder film thickness and (ii) carbon black 
in the crumb rubber which imparts resistant to ultraviolet rays trial sections of gap graded 
bitumen-rubber mixes laid on six lane heavily trafficked National Highways in West Bengal, 
Maharashtra and Tamilnadu (ref Annex I) have been performing well. Apart from a long life 
of over ten years as reported from abroad, a special feature of such a wearing course is 
noticeably reduced noise due to tyre-pavement interaction.
1.4	
In India, research has been done to validate some of the important characteristics of 
the R-B mixes such as viscosity and fatigue life in the laboratory as reported in the international 
* (ISTEA- Intermodal SurfaceTransportation Efficiency Act of 1991 passed by the US Congress)

specifications and three experimental stretches were laid 12 to 24 months ago in different 
parts of the country. These studies show great promise of this technology. Notwithstanding 
the limitation of Indian experience with the technology, these Guidelines recommend its full 
scale implementation for the following five reasons:
	
(a)	
It uses wastes and helps their safe disposal without GHG emission while 
enhancing the performance of bituminous pavements;
	
(b)	
The theoretical basis of the technology is sound and is well understood;
 
(c) 
The research and field experience elsewhere is enormous and very 
positive;
	
(d)	
Use of this useful technology would require only minor capital investment; 
and
	
(e)	
These Guidelines would create an enabling environment for these efforts.
1.5	
An overview of the Bitumen Rubber or Rubberised Bitumen (RB) technology is 
presented in Annex I.
2 Scope
These Guidelines cover construction of a single layer of gap graded wearing course of 
thickness 40 to 50 mm, using wet hot mix process for mix production and ambient grinding 
for granulating the used tyres (ref Annex I), to be laid over 
	
(i)	
a newly constructed bituminous layer, or
 
(ii) 
an old bituminous layer as a reflection-crack resistant durable overlay.
3 Materials
3.1 	
Crumb Rubber
Crumb Rubber (CR) obtained from discarded tyres1 of automobiles are commonly used for 
blending with bitumen. Wire in CR must be less than 0.01% and the fabric should be less 
than 0.95%. The gradation of crumb rubber for blending with bitumen is shown in Table 1. 
The quantity of Crumb Rubber (CR)2 required to obtain the required viscosity may vary and 
can be 20% or higher but in no case it should be less than 15%.
1 California requires rubber from tyres and that from other high natural rubber (40 to 48%) wastes in 75:25 ratio for 
production of Asphalt Rubber while other States do not specify such requirements. Insistence on natural rubber apparently 
is because car tyres may be deficient in natural rubber as the manufacturers of car tyres abroad use more synthetic rubber 
than natural rubber to economise on cost. Vulcanized natural rubber gives better elastic recovery and is good for rubberized 
Bitumen. Indian car tyres use high percentage (nearly 44%) of natural rubber in car tyres and therefore, crumb rubber 
produced from both car and truck tyres are considered suitable. The test for the quality of the rubberised binder as 
determined from viscosity and elastic recovery test, in any case would establish the suitability of CR.
2 It depends upon the fineness of the rubber particles. Finer the rubber particles, lower is the quantity of crumb rubber 
needed to obtain the required viscosity shown in Table 2. A number of gradations included in the specifications of many 
Departments of Transportation of USA are given in Annexure I.

4.  Blending of Bitumen-Rubber
Crumb Rubber shall be blended with base bitumen to produce the Rubberised Bitumen (RB) 
binder to be used in the hot mix plant instead of only base bituminous binder. This shall be 
achieved in two stages, viz. mixing stage and reaction stage in two separate chambers under 
controlled conditions when high production rate is required. The temperature of the bitumen 
shall be 190ºC at the time of addition of the ground rubber. There is a drop in temperature 
of the bitumen when crumb rubber at the ambient temperature is added to the binder. 
No agglomerations of rubber particles shall be allowed into the mixing chamber. Calcium 
carbonate powder may be added to the crumb rubber to ensure a free flow condition. The 
rubber shall be sufficiently dry to be free flowing and not produce a foaming problem when 
added to hot bitumen.
The ground rubber and bitumen shall be accurately proportioned in accordance with the 
design and thoroughly mixed prior to the beginning of the reaction for one hour duration in the 
reaction vessel. The proportions of base bitumen and the crumb rubber shall be accurately 
controlled and documented. Methods shall be devised to ensure that the rubber has been 
uniformly incorporated into the mixture and that the rubber particles have been thoroughly 
mixed and “wetted.” The occurrence of rubber floating on the surface or agglomerations of 
rubber particles shall be evidence of insufficient mixing. Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram 
of the blending process.
Fig. 1  Bitumen-Rubber Binder Production Process
Once the bitumen-rubber has been mixed, it is pumped to a reaction tank where a temperature 
of 190ºC shall be maintained with agitation for 60 minutes for a proper blending. After the 
reaction, the Bitumen-Rubber binder shall be maintained at 180ºC to 190ºC before its 
introduction to hot mix plant. Pumping is difficult at lower temperatures. However, in no case 
shall the bitumen-rubber binder be held at a temperature of 160ºC or above for more than 
10 hours. If the bitumen-rubber binder is to be stored for longer hours, it shall be allowed 
to cool down to 130ºC to 140ºC and gradually reheated to a temperature between 180ºC

and 190ºC with agitation before use. Only one cooling and one reheating shall be allowed. 
Bitumen-rubber binder shall not be held at temperatures of 130ºC to 140ºC for more than 
four days. Prior to use, the viscosity of the asphalt-rubber shall be tested by the use of a 
rotational viscometer (AASHTO T 316 and ASTM D 4402: Viscosity Determination of 
Asphalt Binder Using Rotational Viscometer). Bitumen-rubber binder shall conform to the 
Table 4. The binder temperature at the time of mixing should be 170ºC to 185ºC.
Table 4  Properties of Bitumen-Rubber Binder
Property
Requirement
Base bitumen
VG 30 for traffic > 30 msa and maximum air 
temperature ≥ 30ºC
VG 10 for pavement temperature ≤ 30ºC

(Brookfield), Centipoise
1500-4000
Softening point
≥ 60ºC
Elastic Recovery as per the test method of 
IRC:SP:53-2010
≥ 60
Storage stability
This is not necessary for site blending and immediate 
use. Otherwise storage stability criterion as per 
IRC:SP:53-2010 shall be adopted
Note :	 Crumb rubber absorbs the lighter fractions of bitumen and, therefore, if solvent method is 
used for determination of binder content in any mix post construction, the test is likely to 
underestimate the binder content. More accurate determination of binder content can be 
made only by ignition tests.
5.  Pumping of RB binder into Hot Mix Plant
Highly viscous nature of the RB binder would not permit the binder to be pumped into the hot 
mix plant if the temperature is lower than 180ºC with the help of the usual pumping system 
of the hot mix plants.
6.  Mix Design criteria
Corelok (AASHTO TP 69: Bulk Specific Gravity and Density of Compacted Asphalt 
Mixtures Using Automatic Vacuum Sealing Method) or paraffin coating method (AASHTO 
T 275) should be used for determining air voids and voids in mineral aggregates (Water 
entering into the air voids in the interior of gap or open graded compacted samples while 
weighing in water leads to serious errors in estimating the air voids and voids in Mineral 
Aggregates. Paraffin coating by dipping the Marshall specimens in molten paraffin gives 
reasonably good results).
The mix design criteria are shown in Table 5.

The optimum binder content can 
vary depending upon the surface 
texture and specific gravity of 
aggregates
Mix design for the gap graded RB mix should be carried out at binder contents of 6.5%, 7.5% 
and 8.5% and the Optimum binder content should be evaluated at 5% air void. Such mixes 
are highly rut resistant due to the stiff binder and stone to stone contact.
7.  Mixing and Laying
7.1	
IRC-MORTH Guidelines and Specifications shall be applicable to the construction 
and quality assurance of wearing course using RB binder. The temperature of mixing shall 
be between 160ºC and 170ºC. The compaction temperature of the mix shall lie between 
140ºC and 150ºC.Warm mix additives can be used to obtain lower mixing and compaction 
temperatures (8, 9, 10, 11). The B-R mix should not be laid over a cracked bituminous or 
concrete pavements(7)having cracks as wide as 12.5 mm wide. SAMI using CRMB/PMB 
meeting the MORTH specifications should always be used when laying over a cracked 
pavement.
8.  Weather limitations
Laying of RB mix should be done only when the air temperature is above 15ºC because of 
compaction problem at lower temperatures or when the wind speed exceeds 40 km per hour 
at a height of 2 m.Rainy weather should be avoided.
9. Spreading:
The RB mix shall be spread, levelled and tamped byself-propelled paving machine.
3 A minimum value of 5.4 kN (1200lb) has been adopted by designers as per published reports

10.  Rolling
	
a.	
Rolling should commence immediately after laying of the mix. pneumatic 
tyred compactor shall not be used to eliminate possible picking of the B-R 
mix. Only steel wheel roller should be used. Rolling method as prescribed in 
MORTH shall be used.
	
b.	
The maximum air void after the compaction shall be 8 percent.
	
c.	
Three steel wheel tandem rollers should be used for faster compaction due 
to rapid cooling of thin wearing course.
11.  Application of Blotter material
Bitumen-Rubber mix may be picked up the pneumatic tyres of vehicles and hence it is 
necessary to apply sand @ I kg/m2 before opening the road to traffic.
12.  Use of Gap graded B-R mix
The bitumen-rubber mix can be used wherever conventional bituminous concrete (BC) would 
be used, but it provides better resistance to reflective cracking and fatigue fracture than the 
standard dense-graded bituminous concrete. Bitumen rubber hot mixes are typically most 
effective as thin rehabilitative overlays of distressed flexible or rigid pavements. The thickness 
equivalency of dense graded BC and gap graded B-R mix for resistance against reflection 
cracking has been well-documented (5) by CALTRANS. Laboratory tests at IIT Kharagpur (6) 
on different mixes (refer Table in para 14/Annex I) clearly indicate that the gap graded mixes 
have significantly higher fatigue lives than the dense graded BC. This explains the findings of 
CALTRANS (5) also. These Guidelines, however, do not recommend any reduction in design 
thickness based on equivalency factors.

Annex - I
An Overview of Rubberised Bitumen technology
1.	
Use of rubber with bitumen to produce a different binder (wet process) or in 
replacement of certain finer fractions of mineral aggregates with unaltered bituminous binder 
(dry process) for application in bituminous construction is known by the name ‘Asphalt-
Rubber’ (AR) in the USA and by other names elsewhere in the world e.g. the Recycled Tyre 
Rubber Modified Bitumen (RTR-MB), Bitumen-Rubber-Asphalt (BRA), Rubberized Bitumen, 
etc. This document deals with wet process and name given to the rubber modified binder 
is “Rubberised Bitumen” to distinguish it from the normal bituminous binder as well as other 
“Modified Bituminous binders” such as “Crumb Rubber Modified Binder (CRMB)” or “Polymer 
Modified Binder (PMB)”. Since the technology has evolved with reference to “Asphalt Rubber” 
no attempt has been made in this Annex to change the name while presenting the technology 
overview. “Rubberised Bitumen” referred to in the main document should be considered 
synonymous with “Asphalt Rubber in wet process”.
2.  Historical perspective
2.1	
The Asphalt-Rubber technology has established itself by now even though its 
first application was recorded more than half a century ago in 1960. Charles McDonald, a 
material engineer of city of Phoenix in Arizona found that after mixing RTR with hot bitumen 
and allowing it to react for 45 minutes, the product (which McDonald patented as Asphalt 
Rubber) captured the beneficial engineering characteristics of both the base ingredients 
[Lo Prestie, 2013]. The early application of AR was in the form of prefabricated patching of the 
cracked surfaces, which was called “band aids”, followed by its application in full width in slurry 
seal application with cover chips in the seventies. The latter application was not found very 
successful because of non-uniform thickness of slurry seal because of the irregularity in the 
surface profile [RPA]. In the sixties experiments with natural rubber were also carried out and 
reported by Federal Highway Administration though with inconclusive results [RPA]. Around 
same time when McDonald developed the wet process, Swedish companies developed the 
dry process by substituting certain aggregate fractions by crumb rubber to tackle the problem 
of deterioration of pavement by studded tyres. The early development in AR was mostly 
marked by trial and error.
2.2	
The real boost to this technology came in the late eighties and early nineties 
thanks to various developments, three of which are worth noting. First, in 1988, ASTM gave a 
formal definition of Asphalt Rubber (ASTM D18) and subsequently prescribed specifications 
for it (ASTM D 6114) in 1997. Secondly, the patent of McDonald expired in 1992 and the 
product came in public domain enabling more generic use and applications. Thirdly, a US 
Federal Law passed in 1991 “Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act” (ISTEA) 
mandated widespread use of Asphalt-Rubber technology. Since then considerable interest 
was generated in research and development efforts, which were sponsored mainly by four

11
states of the USA, viz., Arizona, California, Texas and Florida as well as Federal Highway 
Administration. Reputed Universities like Arizona State University, University of California 
Berkley, big private companies and California integrated Waste management Board also 
participated, sponsored or supported the research efforts. Since late nineties till 2009 a 
number of International Conferences and Seminars were held in different parts of the World 
(USA, Portugal, Brazil, China). These research reports are synthesised in NCHRP reports 
and SHRP reports. Rubber Pavement Association also documents the research efforts in 
various forms.
2.3 
The current status of the AR technology is that there are specifications for AR 
prescribed by ASTM and these are followed by the states in USA. Apart from the four pioneer 
states, other states such as South Carolina, Nevada and New Mexico have also joined the AR 
bandwagon. AR technology is in use in South Africa, which uses both wet and dry process. 
Australia uses this technology mostly in spray application for crack sealing and chip seal. 
In Europe, the wet process is reportedly being followed since nineteen eighties in Belgium, 
France, Austria, Netherlands, Poland and Germany, and more recently in Greece and UK, 
but the countries with a higher number of applications are reportedly Portugal, Spain, Italy, 
Czech Republic and Sweden. Latest entrants to the AR user group are China, Brazil, Taiwan, 
and Sudan [Lo Prestie]. The ASTM specifications almost set the benchmark for specifications 
in other countries. For example the South African Bitumen Association (SABITA) Manual 19 
dealing with AR is based on these specifications and research is directed to revise and 
improve the manual by further research. 
3.  The driving force for AR technology
3.1	
The driving force behind the used tyre rubbers in bituminous construction are 
mainly two; one, the social responsibility of safe disposal of used tyres without creating any 
environmental problems, and second exploiting the potential of the tyre ingredients to enhance 
the performance of bituminous construction in terms of strength, durability, serviceability and 
eventually cost efficiency in terms of reduced life cycle cost.
	
i)	
Environmentally Safe disposal of used tyres: Basically three steps 
are involved in safe disposal of any waste, viz. (a) recycling the wastes 
by extracting the useful materials and re-using in further production, (b) 
extracting the energy from the wastes and using the residue for productive 
purposes (c) dumping the residues and the wastes into landfills after material 
and energy are extracted. Waste tyres contain lot of useful materials (rubber, 
steel, fabric, carbon black) each of which can be extracted, but the main 
ingredient, the tyre rubber, cannot be recycled for use in further production 
of rubber. Safe energy extraction (as opposed to open burning and release 
of Green House Gases in the atmosphere) involves sophisticated processes 
like pyrolysis which are highly expensive. That leaves only two options for 
disposal of waste tyres, viz. dumping in landfills or burning, neither of which 
is environmentally safe.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:107-2015
12
	
ii)	
Exploiting the potential of the extracted rubber in bituminous 
construction: Research has established that the extracted rubber when 
converted into crumbs, if mixed and blended with bitumen under controlled 
conditions, can drastically improve the binder properties and give the 
bituminous pavements more strength, durability, serviceability, riding comfort 
and noise reduction. The rubber should, therefore, be used with bitumen to 
enhance the performance of the bituminous pavements.
3.2 
The synergy of the two forces have resulted in extensive research in the field of 
(a) rubber bitumen interaction (both in laboratory and field), (b) development of technologies 
for recovery of useful materials from used tyres, (c) creation of manufacturing capacity for 
producing value out of wastes, and (d) emergence of niche markets for such products. There 
are numerous companies in USA and Europe which ‘manufacture’ and supply crumb rubber 
in various sizes, shapes and colours to meet the users’ demands, or provide technology 
solutions for use of such wastes.
4.  Constituents of tyres: Rubber, carbon black, steel, fibres
The components of tyre are air impervious inner liner; steel belt, nylon belt, body plies 
calendared over the outer surface of the inner liner to withstand the air pressure; patterned 
treads also a calendared rubber sheet, to provide grip; sidewalls to additionally resist 
weathering action; triangular portion with steel beading to fit into the tyre rim; some rubber, 
glue or resin fillings to cushion the plies and treads from wear and tear from abrasion from 
belts. Materials used in tyre manufacture are elastomers (natural and synthetic rubber), 
carbon black, steel and fabric each of which performs different functions. Natural rubber 
(poly-isoprene) acquires elastic properties due to the process of vulcanisation, while synthetic 
rubber (styrene-butadiene and halo-butadiene) is already hard and elastic. Carbon black 
provides reinforcement to tyres, silica adds heat resistance to tyres, some anti-oxidants give 
weather resistance to tyre walls. In addition, there are some chemicals like sulphur, activator, 
accelerators and curing compounds, which take part in vulcanising process.
5.  Scrap tyre products: Crumb rubber comprising rubber 
and carbon black
One research [Wrap] indicates that when the car tyre is ground, nearly 70% of it gets converted 
into crumb rubber and 17% of steel, 13% of fibre and scrap are isolated. The crumb rubber 
consists of both natural and synthetic rubber as well as carbon black. Another study [RPA] 
also corroborates 70% of tyre component comprising rubber (natural and synthetic) and 
carbon black. The latter study further indicates the proportion of natural rubber, synthetic 
rubber and carbon black as 15%, 27% and 28% respectively. The trend abroad in car tyre 
production is to supplement the rubber requirement by synthetic rubber for economising on 
the raw material cost, natural rubber being costlier than the synthetic rubber. Indian car tyres, 
on the other hand, have a much higher (nearly 44%) of natural rubber.

6.  Scrap car tyres may not contain sufficient natural rubber, 
may need to be supplemented
As discussed in the para above car tyres may be deficient in natural rubber content. That 
perhaps explains the provisions in the Caltarn Guidelines. The Guidelines while specifying 
various Crumb Rubber Modifiers (CRM), specifies the requirements of “High Natural Rubber 
(Hi nat)” CRM as follows: “scrap rubber product that includes 40-48 per cent natural rubber 
or isoprene and a minimum of 50 per cent of rubber hydrocarbon…..Sources of high natural 
rubber include some types of heavy truck tires, but are not limited to scrap tyres…”  and further 
provides that “CRM must include 25±2 per cent by mass of high natural rubber CRM and 
75±2 per cent scrap tyre CRM”. This requirement is not specified in any other Specifications 
of US States. South Africa also specifies 25% of the natural rubber requirement.
7.  Why insistence on natural rubber in CR
7.1	
The natural rubber is derived from rubber trees and comprises poly-isoprene 
polymer chain. The rubber is quite sticky (more plastic than elastic) at normal temperature or in 
warm conditions and becomes brittle when cold. Its long polymer chains move independently 
of each other because of which it has very little strength. However, when vulcanised, they 
acquire strength, durability, elasticity and all the desirable engineering, mechanical and 
chemical properties which, in combination with some other materials like carbon black and 
silica make them suitable for withstanding the air pressure, abrasion and heat generation. 
Natural rubber, however, is more susceptible to weathering action due to oxidation and 
ozonisation. Synthetic rubber on the other hand are derived from petroleum by products 
and have similar characteristics as natural rubber, or even better (particularly in resistance 
to oxidation and ozonisation and hence weathering). These are better materials than natural 
rubber for tyre side walls, which are exposed to weathering action. The synthetic rubber 
that goes into production of tyres are Styrene-butadiene, Poly-butadiene, Halo-butyle rubber, 
etc. 
7.2	
The real difference in the two types of rubbers arises out of the process of 
vulcanisation, which are different in the two types of rubber. Vulcanisation of natural rubber is 
done with sulphur by cooking the rubber at 170ºC under pressure for about 10 minutes. The 
sulphur molecules cross link the polymer chains of the natural rubber building bridges between 
the chains. These chains, which in un-vulcanised condition could move independently of 
each other cannot do so after bonding with sulphur on vulcanisation. Vulcanisation agents for 
synthetic rubber are not sulphur but some metal oxides (MgO, ZnO, PbO) or other chemicals. 
Sulphur bonds are much stronger than the bonds provided by the latter agents. As a result, 
vulcanisation of natural rubber is almost an irreversible process and cannot be devulcanised, 
while the bonds in the synthetic rubber can devulcanise under high temperature and lose 
their properties. That is why natural rubber in a certain proportion is insisted upon in AR 
application.

8.  Asphalt Rubber processes
There are essentially two types of processes
8.1	
Dry Process
In this process certain fractions of mineral aggregates are replaced by crumb rubber and 
the binder remains the normal bituminous binder. CR is added to the aggregate in hot mix 
process just before bitumen is fed into the hot mix plants. Dry process remains essentially 
dense graded construction with some size fraction in grading provided by CR. This process 
does not appear to be as effective as wet process. The binder coating the CR particles keeps 
on absorbing the lighter fractions of bitumen like aromatic oils and eventually the effective 
bitumen content in the mix reduces. Secondly, with some absorption of bitumen by the CR 
fraction their sizes change and the grading may be upset. 
8.2	
Wet Process
In this process the bituminous binder properties are altered by addition of crumb rubber to the 
binder and agitating it for 45 minutes to an hour at high temperature to allow the absorption 
of aromatic oils there by increasing the viscosity of the binder enabling thicker binder coating 
of the aggregates. This makes the binder resistant to weathering and oxidation and hence 
to ageing and cracking. Wet process has two applications, viz., hot mix application with gap-
graded aggregates and spray application with open-graded aggregates. In hot mix application, 
point to point contact between aggregates are ensured while forming a continuous networked 
matrix of rubber through the binder, which provides rubber-like flexibility to the mix. In open-
graded mix the aggregates stick to the binder and each other in a better manner due to 
stickier viscous binder.
9.  Asphalt Rubber binder (Rubberised Bitumen Binder) 
A formal definition of such binders is provided by ASTM as “a blend of asphalt cement, 
reclaimed tire rubber, and certain additives in which the rubber component is at least 15 
per cent by weight of the total blend and has reacted in hot asphalt cement sufficiently to 
cause swelling of the rubber particles” (ASTM D8). The Specifications for AR have also been 
provided by ASTM (ASTM D 6114). The definition underlines the ingredients of such binders 
(bitumen, tyre rubber and additives), the processes (producing crumb from reclaimed tyres, 
mixing, blending and reaction in hot condition) and the output (a blend with swollen rubber 
particles). The definition also sets a floor level for proportion of rubber (15%) in the blend. 
The additives referred to in the definition are certain ‘extender oils’, which make the rubber 
bitumen reaction easy. This definition finds almost universal acceptance.
10.  Ingredients of Asphalt binder
10.1	
Crumb Rubber (CR): 
10.1.1 
Most Specifications in the US States prescribe scrap tyres as the CR source, 
Caltran specifies 75% scrap tyres and 25% high natural rubber modifier, South Africa species

scrap tyre rubbers from cars and trucks. In these specifications scrap tyres with minimum 
50% natural rubber is proposed. 
10.1.2 
As regards gradation of crumb rubber all specifications (Arizona, Texas, Florida, 
California in the USA and South Africa) prescribe maximum particle size finer than 2.36 
mm and minimum 75 micron. Majority of them prescribe sizes finer than 1.18 mm. These 
Guidelines also provide maximum size finer than 1.18 mm and propose median size as 425 
micron.

A comparative gradation of CR in the four States of USA is presented in the Table

10.1.4 
Quantity of CR to be mixed with bitumen subject to minimum of 15% ( specified by 
ASTM) is a matter of design to achieve the target AR binder properties in terms of viscosity, 
resilience, softening point and cone penetration. Most Guidelines including these Guidelines 
suggest a trial with 20% CR.
10.2	
Bitumen
There is no ASTM recommendation with regard to Base bitumen except that it should be 
selected on the basis of climatic conditions. Arizona and Texas specify three climatic zones 
(hot, mild and cold) while Caltran and Florida recommend only one type of base bitumen. 
South Africa specifies only ‘standard penetration grade bitumen’ conforming to their national 
standards and also gives the choice to the supplier to select the base binder. In the USA 
bitumen is standardised and classified in Performance Grades. The three types of base 
bitumen recommended in these States correspond to penetration grades 60/70, 85/110 and 
120/200. In these Guidelines VG 30 is proposed in general and VG 10 in cold climate.
10.3	
Additives
ASTM permits some additives apart from CR and Bitumen to facilitate the reaction between 
CR and Bitumen. Caltran allows this additive named as Extender Oil, which are “aromatic 
oils used to promote the reaction of the asphalt cement and the crumb rubber modifier”. This 
is not permitted in the specifications of the other three States, though South Africa permits it. 
These Guidelines do not provide for any additives or extender oil.

11.  Processes for production of Asphalt Rubber binder 
(Rubberized Bitumen Binder)
11.1	
Production of Crumb Rubber
11.1.1	
There are essentially two methods of production of Crumb Rubber; viz., Ambient 
Grinding and Cryogenic Process. In Ambient Grinding the tyres are shredded, sheared, 
subjected to successive size reduction, grinding and micro grinding (or micro milling) 
all at ambient temperature. In Cryogenic process, the tyres are frozen in liquid nitrogen, 
which makes them brittle and then broken and ground into granulates. All specifications 
recommend Ambient Grinding Process, which is cheaper and gives better size and texture 
of the crumbs compared to cryogenic grinding, which is hugely expensive. These Guidelines 
also recommend Ambient Grinding Process for production of Crumb Rubber. 
11.1.2	
Ambient grinding process involves the following stages:
	
(i)	
Shredding: Whole or cut tyres are shredded in shredder (called cracker 
mill), the expected output of shredder is pieces 50 mm in size
	
(ii)	
Granulation: The shredded output is fed into Primary granulators, 
where the size reduction is to the extent of 9.5 mm.
	
(iii)	 Primary Steel and Fibre Removal: Steel and Fibre are removed at this 
stage. Steel is removed by magnetic separators and fibre by cyclonic 
separators.
	
(iv)	 Secondary Granulators: The granulated crumb is passed through 
successive secondary granulators to further reduce the size. The output 
of each secondary granulation unit is conveyed to the successive units 
pneumatically and collected in closed hoppers.
	
(v)	
Secondary Metal and Fibre Separators: Before final grinding output 
is collected the metal and fibre has to be separated.
	
(vi)	 Bag House for Dust: Every granulation stage has to be connected to 
a dust collector bag house.
11.1.3	
Usually crumb rubber is produced off site and procured from crumb rubber 
manufacturers in damp proof packaging. It is necessary to ensure that the production 
process followed in its manufacture is Ambient Grinding. The crumb rubber should be tested 
for moisture content, gradation, fibre and steel contents, and its constituents, mainly the 
proportion of natural rubber and carbon black before its acceptance and application. It may 
be necessary to add a small amount of calcium carbonate powder to absorb the moisture and 
make the crumb free flowing.
11.2	
Production of Asphalt Rubber (Rubberised Bitumen)
11.2.1	
Production of AR involves two stages, viz., (a) mixing and blending of crumb rubber 
and base bitumen, and (b) reaction of the mix to enable complete absorption till saturation of 
the lighter fractions of bitumen, i.e. Asphaltene and aromatic oils.

(a)	
Before the start of the process, the bitumen has to be heated to 190ºC. The 
metred quantity of heated bitumen and CR are fed into the mixing and blending 
chamber to ensure the right proportion. Mixing of crumb rubber at ambient 
temperature and heated bitumen would cause the temperature to drop. It 
needs to be ensured that after the temperature drop the mix remains within 
the temperature range of 170º-185ºC. Metering of bitumen has to be with an 
electromechanical meter and that of the crumb through a weigh hopper with 
load cells. Mixing and blending in the chamber will be by a mechanical mixer. 
The rate of material feed and mixing should be synchronised to produce a 
homogeneous mix.
	
(b)	
The CR-bitumen blend is sent to the Reaction chamber through a meter 
which would measure the rate of input and its quantity. The Reaction 
Chamber will have arrangement for heating and agitation. A typical heating 
arrangement could be a flue tube recirculating hot gases from a burner and 
agitation arrangement by an auger. The temperature of the blend received 
in the Reaction Chamber will be in the range of 170-180ºC. This has to be 
raised to 190ºC and maintained at that temperature and the blend agitated 
for at least one hour for binder-rubber reaction to be completed. Temperature 
control should be thermostatic and electronic.
11.2.2	
The output of the Reaction Chamber has to be tested for the target viscosity of the 
AR binder should satisfy the design requirement by a hand held viscometer for its acceptance 
within tolerances allowed for field and laboratory tests arrived at after trials at site.
11.2.3	
The conforming output can be (i) Directly pumped to the hot mix plant, or (ii) stored 
for not more than 4 hours, or (iii) allowed to cool to a temperature of 135ºC and stored for not 
more than 4 days provided it is reheated to 190ºC before actual use, only one cycle of cooling 
and reheating being permitted.
11.2.4	
The entire process can be accomplished either in batch mode or continuous 
mode. In the latter mode all inputs, processes and outputs have to be synchronised to meet 
the requirements of end use. 
11.3	
Nature of Reaction
Crumb rubber in the Asphalt Rubber binder absorbs the aromatic oils in bitumen and swells. 
This process happens even at room temperature, but at an optimum temperature (refer to sub 
para (b) of the para above), the process of swelling is fastest and maximum resulting in very 
high viscosity of the binder and consequently very thick film coating of aggregates (18 micron 
compared to 9 micron in normal bitumen). At cooler temperatures, the crumbs would tend to 
settle instead of remaining dispersed and in suspension in bitumen. At higher temperatures 
and/or higher agitation of the mix the crumbs will start depolymerising and devulcanising, as 
a result of which the beneficial effects of rubber (stiffness, elasticity, etc) would be gone.

12.  Target properties of rubberised bitumen binder 
Caltarn and other Guidelines suggest four parameters for design and specify the range 
of values for these parameters, which are: viscosity, elastic recovery, softening point and 
penetration. These Guidelines have included the first three and omitted penetration, not 
considering it of much relevance as viscosity itself is sufficient to capture the result of this 
test.
13.  Why Gap-grading
These Guidelines have recommended use of rubberised bitumen binder only with gap graded 
aggregates. This is for two reasons: (i) Dense grading does not permit enough space to 
accommodate highly viscous thick binder in the voids. During compaction of the mix the rubber 
would compress but would immediately decompress after the roller moves out, thus density in 
compaction cannot be achieved, (ii) In gap grading, there is a point to point contact between 
aggregate particles and large voids in-between, which are filled with rubberised bitumen. 
After curing, the rubber under traffic would behave like tyre under pressure, strengthened 
by the presence of carbon black in the crumb, whose role in the tyre was to reinforce the 
latter. Caltarn, accordingly proposes higher equivalencies to such mixes compared to the 
conventional dense graded mixes. The Table below presents the thickness equivalencies:

14.  Indian studies on gap-graded rubberised bitumen binder
India so far is nowhere in the World map of Asphalt Rubber User countries. Very limited 
studies have been reported either from field or laboratories. Interest has generated on the 
subject only very recently. An IIT, Kharagpur laboratory study reported in 2014 corroborates 
that Viscosity of the Asphalt rubber binder is possible to be attained in the range of 1500-
4000 cP and that, compared to dense graded bituminous mixes using modified binders, can 
have more than 3 to 5 times fatigue life even at a very high, 400 micro strain, compared to 
dense graded mixes (See Table below).

is already known and applied in AR technology user countries (e.g. thickness equivalency 
factors of Caltarn referred to above). As for field application, three trial stretches, one each 
on NH 3 (Nashik-Gonde) in Maharashtra, on NH 46 (Krishnagiri-Walajahpet) in Tamil Nadu 
and on NH 6 (near Uluberia) in West Bengal were laid less than 2 years ago and are not 
showing any signs of rutting so far even though these are arterial national routes and carry

15.  Advantages of Bitumen rubber technology
Bituminous Rubber and bitumen-Rubber mix have the following advantages
1. 
Increased viscosity of the B-R binder allows higher film thickness with little drain 
down
2.	
Reduced temperature susceptibility
3.	
Improved resistance to rutting due to higher binder viscosity and stone to stone 
contact of coarser aggregates
4.	
Good durability due to better resistance to cracking and ageing
5.	
Reduced noise due to vehicle –tyre interaction
6.	
Environmentally friendly since it makes use of waste material
7. 
Can be laid over cracked bituminous layer because of better resistance to reflection 
cracking. It is suitable for concrete pavements also with added advantage of noise 
reduction and improved riding quality 
8.	
Cost effective since a lower thickness of Bitumen-Rubber mix is needed than 
a conventional bituminous concrete for the same performance from crack 
propagation. For equal thickness, life cycle cost is likely to be much lower than the 
conventional dense graded Bituminous Concrete.

16.  Some inconvenient questions with regard 
to use of the technology
16.1	
Recyclability of the Mix
A 1992 study (18) raises questions about recyclability of the mix, which might have to be 
dumped as waste creating more environmental problem than it would solve. The Caltarn 
Usage Guide of 2006 (12) discounts this fear, though admits that air quality during recycling 
might be of some concern.
16.2	
Higher Initial Costs
The initial cost of this construction would be higher than the conventional mixes because of 
capital investment on AR plants. This is indisputable. However, in terms of higher life cycle 
cost due to longer life of the mixes, the cost differential might not be very big. Besides, with 
proliferation of technology, economies of scale and competition the cost would come down.
16.3	
Quality Issues
It is feared that uniform quality of AR binder cannot be produced because of variability in 
properties of crumb rubber. Therefore, uniformity of quality over a project stretch and across 
many projects, cannot be ensured. This is a genuine apprehension. However, the variability 
in quality can be solved by quality assurance procedures and controlling design based on the 
type of input materials.
16.4	
Suitability in all Climatic Regions
General belief is that the requirement of high viscosity and high softening point binder (which 
the AR is capable of delivering) is relevant only for hot climate and not for colder regions 
where stiffer binders become brittle and crack prone. This is only partially true. Stiff and 
resilient binders are required everywhere to resist cracking and rutting. The elasticity in the 
binder provided by the rubber would make it useful in all conditions. The evidence of this is in 
the interest shown by colder regions of the World like Europe and other states in USA apart 
from the four pioneering states.
17	
Notwithstanding the limitations of domestic research and doubts and 
apprehensions expressed, its advantages far outweigh these limitations and underline the 
need to exploit the potential of this technology in providing rut and crack resistant, durable, 
high performing quieter pavements and helping the environment by recycling the wastes, 
which is already established in numerous countries. Data generated from field can further 
fine-tune the technology.
