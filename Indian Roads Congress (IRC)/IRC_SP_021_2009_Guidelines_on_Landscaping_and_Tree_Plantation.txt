GUIDELINES ON LANDSCAPING
AND
TREE PLANTATION
INTRODUCTION
The Manual on Landscaping of Roads was published by the Indian Road Congress as an
IRC Special
Publication:
21,
in December 1979. The Manual provides comprehensive
guidelines on
both
the hard and
soft landscaping
of roads with
respect
to the
physiographical, environmental, climatic and operational factors. However, with the changing
scenario of rapid development and diversification of road
infrastructure
in the country,
especially the highways, a need was felt to revise the Manual
in
line with the changing
specifications for roads.
The draft for the revised manual was prepared by S/Shri V.K. Sharma, Member Secretary
and S.R Sharma, Member of the Environment Committee
(G-3). The revised Manual
essentially retains the structure of the present Manual with desired modifications
in the
specifications. Major modifications have been done in the Appendix on roadside arboriculture;
since this portion of the Manual was actually required to be changed with the changing
specifications for highway construction and improvement. After the draft was prepared, the
Committee met on 6*^ September 2008 and discussed the draft and approved
it with some
suggested modifications. Modifications were incorporated in the draft guidelines.

SCOPE
-
.
1.1
India
is witnessing a major change
in
infrastructure development vis-a-vis the
transportation network of the country;
viz., the National Highways and State Highways.
Various highway improvement
projects are being undertaken
by
different State
Governments and Government of India. Implementation of National Highway Development
Project (NHDP)
is the major step in this direction.
1.2
There is always a conflict between development and environment and, therefore,
a trade off is necessary to balance the two, so that, development is sustainable. The first
adverse consequence of widening, from environmental point of view, is the inevitable felling
of trees growing along the highways. On the
hill sides and other fragile environmental
settings, much more adverse impacts are expected on the surroundings.
1.3
It
is the responsibility of the road agencies to offset the loss of trees and other
changes resulted into the surroundings. There is a need to follow the approach of "Corridor
Development & Management", rather than "Highway Development". Apart from mitigating
the environmental
losses, road agencies must plan
to enhance the aesthetics of the
highway corridor from all possible angles. Highways should not be looked upon merely as
a means of transportation, but as a part and parcel of the environmental and socio-economic
nnilieu.
1.4
The land needed for the avenue plantation and landscape improvement has to be
considered during the project formulation stage itself. As a result, after construction, when
the plantation is actually to start, the land is available for planting. The width of the remaining
ROW
is, many times, not sufficient enough to accommodate even a single row of plants;
2



======================================================================
PAGE 11 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:SP:21-2009
whereas
at some places, three to four rows can be planted. To ensure
availability of
sufficient width for avenue plantation, the requirement of land for tree plantation should be
assessed and included in the land acquisition plans prepared for a highway widening project.
1 .5
Landscape treatment of roads embraces the following measures at different stages
of development:
•
Designing of horizontal alignment, vertical profile, structures like bridges and
retaining walls and road furniture, such as, signs, signals, lighting system etc.,
so that these components are not out of scale with the surroundings.
•
Stabilising the embankment and cutting areas to smoothen the earth
profile
and unifying the landscape.
•
Grass turfing and planting of trees and shrubs.
•
Enhancement of surroundings and creation of necessary service facilities for
rest, recreation, etc., for the road travellers.
1.6
It
is not possible to lay down
rigid and uniform standards for landscaping. The
treatments to be adopted vary from place to place depending on the topography, climate
and other environmental features. Accordingly, this Manual lays down only broad guidelines,
subject to such modifications as may be governed by local site conditions.
1.7
Highway design and landscaping should be regarded as complementary and
tackled as a single planning task. The detailed project reports prepared for the road projects
must include landscaping and tree planting as an integral part of the design. The landscape
features must be studied during the design process and specific drawing, designs, and
specifications must be prepared.
There should be no compromise on the cost.
1.8
The Manual
is divided into 11 Sections to focus attention on different aspects of
landscaping and broad guidelines on landscaping and plantation, types of species, etc. In
brief. Sections 2 and 3 deal with general considerations relating to landscaping, Sections
4 and 5 with specific aspects relevant to rural and urban highways. Section 6 with points
deserving consideration with respect to the highway structures, Section 7 with road-safety
and roadside amenities. Section 8 with the desired treatment
in special areas such as
waterlogged or sandy tracts. Section 9 with the landscaping problem of existing roads,
Section 10 deals with maintenance of the landscaping facilities and Section 11 deals with
broad guidelines on landscaping and plantation along highway.
2
MAIN FACTORS AFFECTING LANDSCAPING
2.1
Several factors, topography, environment, climate and operational considerations
govern the landscaping of roads and need to be kept in view in each case. More important
3



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:SP:21-2009
among these are highlighted below;
2.1.1
Terrain
Terrain has an overriding
effect on geometric design features of a
road;
for instance,
gradients, radii of curves, sight distance, central reserve, the extent to which the road is in
embankment or cutting,
etc. On one hand, these components would determine the
appearance of the road and on the other the measures that could be adopted to beautify
the road landscape. The objective should be to design the road
in such a way that
it fits
into the existing terrain and harmonises with the general landscape.
2.1.2
Surroundings
2.1.2.1
The surroundings of the road, whether rural or urban, are an important factor
affecting landscape design.
2.1.2.2
For roads in rural areas, land width for roadside plantation and other landscape
measures
is generally not a problem. Also, advantage of existing scenic spots etc., can
be easily taken to make these a part of the highway landscape.
2.1.2.3
Important
rural highways carrying
long distance
traffic also have
their own
requirements. There is need for roadside rest areas and other facilities at periodic intervals
for rest and relaxation of the travelling public.
2.1 .2.4
Urban roads, on the other hand, show up a somewhat different picture. Generally,
the right-of way is limited and surrounding area is characterized by buildings, paved verges,
frequent road intersections, utility services, etc. Also, unlike rural areas; pedestrians, cyclists
and other slow-moving vehicles form an important part of the road user. The need to screen
off unsightly dumping yards, slum areas, etc. adds to the problem.
2.1.3
Highway speed
2.1.3
Highways are
classified under different categories,
e.g.. Expressways and
Highways and each category is designed for a specific speed. Speed of travel is a factor in
landscape design.
On fast speed highways, overall composition of the landscape as
it
unfolds while driving
is of greater significance. On the other hand, on slow speed roads,
the driver will have an eye even for minor wayside details. Safety
is also a concern with
respect to the highway speed. On fast speed highways, the landscape improvement and
tree plantation needs to be planned while ensuring safety of the travellers.
2.1.4
Climatic factors
2.1.4.1
Climatic factors like rainfall, humidity and temperature influence road landscape
design in a number of ways. For one thing, climate controls the type and extent of vegetation
which forms the most important component of road landscape. Nature has devised
vegetation
in a manner that only specific varieties thrive in particular climates. Plantation
of vegetation as a part of landscaping should, therefore, be restricted as far as possible to
local species already thriving in the area.
4



======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:SP:21-2009
2.1.4.2
Similarly, climate affects drainage characteristics
in a marked way especially in
high rainfall areas. In such cases, particular attention has to be paid to the design of drainage
system so that
it does not disturb the natural environment adversely.
2.1.4.3
There are also other factors like erosion, wind blows, and snow drifts etc., which
may affect landscape design.
2.1.5
Public opinion
Views of local inhabitants who are directly affected should also as far as possible, be
taken into consideration while formulating landscape designs.
3 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS NEEDING ATTENTION
DURING LANDSCAPING
3.1
Conservation of Existing Features
3.1.1
Existing features along a road alignment, whether natural or man-made, can
contribute significantly to general road landscape and every effort should be made to
preserve, incorporate and integrate these into the landscape. A reconnaissance survey
should be made to identify
all valuable natural features such as natural wooded areas,
streams, ponds, rock outcrops, scenic vistas etc.,
in addition to man-made features like
historical buildings, monuments, gardens, etc. During design, and later during construction,
every care should be taken to avoid damage to them. Natural beauty of the landscape can
be considerably enhanced by blending the existing features into the road system.
3.1.2
While planning the highways,
it may be desirable to design the median with a
varying width so as to conserve natural features along the alignment, hence making the
highway safer and more interesting to drive, (Fig.
1 ). However, since this involves acquisition
of additional land, this option should be used in exceptional cases, where the features to
be preserved can not be relocated. The best option is to realign the road rather than splitting
the highway.
3.1.3
Similarly, wherever feasible,
religious structures, old monuments, gardens etc.
having a special architectural character should not only be saved when building a road but
suitably incorporated in the general highway landscape even
if this means making special
efforts (Figs. 2 and 3).
3.1.4
Conservation of existing grass and plant growth needs no emphasis.
In
all road
cuttings, top soil should be preserved and re-applied after completion of grading operations,
on slopes, medians etc., to help growth of vegetation.
3.1 .5
While constructing roads in forest areas, felling of trees should be kept to minimum.
Fire should never be used in cleaning operations as this will destroy natural regeneration
of young trees and drive out wildlife The effect of felling on undergrowth and wildlife also
needs to be kept in view.

3.2
Conservation of Land Values
3.2.1
The effect of road construction on the adjoining land is two-fold:
(i) acceleration of industrial, commercial, agricultural and other activities; and
(ii) undesirable impact on environment due to increase
in noise, dust and fumes
from traffic.
3.2.2
An important objective of any road construction programme should be to minimize
the adverse effects mentioned at (ii) above.
In this respect, proper landscaping measures
can play a vital role.
3.2.3
Acquisition of adequate Right-of-Way, and proper design of the road cross-section
with provision for green buffer strips between the shoulders and land boundary, can help a
lot to improve the landscape along the road.
In urban areas with appropriate screen planting,
the nuisance of noise, dust and fumes on account of traffic can be vastly reduced. Attractive
landscape treatment will help in preservation of the residential land values.
3.3
Fitting tlie Road into Landscape
3.3.1
While deciding the alignment of the road, the aesthetic factors must also be
considered along with usual economic, engineering and administrative considerations.
3.4
Road to Follow Natural Terrain
3.4.1
The road should follow the natural terrain as closely as possible. While ascending
hills,
it is advisable to align the roadway at an oblique angle to the contours. Deep cuts for
7



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:SP:21-2009
the sake of straight alignment should be avoided.
In some cases,
it may be advantageous
to locate the road along rivers, sea shore or water courses to facilitate full enjoyment of
the landscape potential.
3.5
Geometry of Road with respect to Landscape
3.5.1
Alignment of the road can be made more pleasing by providing larger radii and
spiral transitions or gentle coordinated curves, both
in the horizontal and vertical plane.
This should be accompanied by appropriate contouring and planting on both sides of the
road to yield an overall pleasing effect.
3.6
Spacing of Carriageways
3.6.1
While building divided highways, the two carriageways need not always be sited
adjacent to each other or at the same level
if the fall of the ground
is across the general
direction of the road.
Not only will this improve landscape design but will also lead to
economy.
The
fall between the two roads can be effectively
utilized as central green
space (Figs. 4 and 5).
3.6.2
Similarly, spacing between carriageways can be varied
to preserve special
environmental and
cultural features by adjusting these between the two carriageways
instead of cutting across (Figs. 3 and 4). This should, however, be opted only in exceptional
cases.

3.7
Tree Planting or Arboriculture
3.7.1
Tree planting or arboriculture
is the most important component of landscaping.
Planting may be functional, or for aesthetic effects, but in either case the objective should
be to help restore the unity of the landscape.
Functional planting applies to such problems
as protection of slopes against erosion, screening of unsightly views, reducing headlight
glare, providing shade in summer and so on.
In most cases, such planting also improves
the appearance of the road and enhances the natural landscape, planting for aesthetic
effects
is also by and large functional but goes beyond that to blend the road
into the
surrounding countryside and enhance the overall beauty (Figs. 6 and 7).

3.7.2
Roadside planting
of trees may be
in the form of avenues, groups or groves.
Where conditions are favourable,
for example
in groves,
fruit bearing trees may be
preferred.
3.7.3
The amount of planting to be provided at different situations needs careful attention.
While roads in landscapes devoid of trees or woodlands may require
little or no planting,
extensive planting
is necessitated
in
settled
rural landscapes where a new road may
introduce more new elements than the countryside can absorb.
3.7.4
!n the design and development of arboriculture, certain restrictions imposed by
engineering, traffic and safety requirements should be kept in view. Some of these are:
•
Position of trees on either side should be fixed taking into account the ultimate
development of the roadway with regard to future widening.
;
•
Trees should be offset upto and beyond
1 m back from the ultimate edge of the
roadway so that they are not a safety hazard or affect the required
sight
distances (Fig. 8).
•
Considerations of sight distance and safety being of primary importance, these
should
in no case be subordinated to aesthetics.
•
Shrubs and trees should be planted clear of roadside drains and other drainage
structures so that their root system do not interfere with efficient working of the
drainage facilities.
3.7.5
To facilitate systematic execution of operations involved in roadside arboriculture,
it will be advisable to prepare a detailed work plan including necessary drawings for field
use.
These should cover the scope and extent of the proposed activities, pattern, type
and location of plantings, plant species to be used etc. and should be simple enough to be
easily followed by field crews.
3.7.6

3.8
TraospSantation of Large Tree
Occasion may arise wlien a grown-up tree has to be cut for mal<ing room for constructing
a road, a building or other structure.
It would be desirable to save this plant by transplanting
it at a suitable site. To do this successfully some time
is necessary.
In winter when the
tree is dormant or less active,
it should be pruned heavily leaving a bare framework of the
large branches. A 40 to 50 cm wide trench
1 to 2 m deep should be dug around the stem
as much distance away from
it, depending upon the stature of the specimen, cutting
all
the roots, big and small, in the process.
The trench should then be compacted with dry leaf, straw or any such material followed by
heavy irrigation which would be repeated from time according to necessity. In spring, new
shoots
will come out along with a new set of fibrous roots. These will grow during the
summer months.
It would be desirable to execute the transplantation under expert
supervision.
In the beginning of rainy season, the trench would be reopened by removing the packing
materials, thereby exposing the new roots. The big earth ball at the base of the tree would
be wrapped firmly with burlap. The trunk should simultaneously be covered with several
rounds of gunny on which a strong iron chain will be tied like a belt.
Now a crane would be summoned and the tree securely attached to
it through the iron
chain. The basal roots would then be cut to free the tree from the ground and carried on a
vehicle to the new site where a suitable pit has already been dug to receive the huge earth
ball. The tree would be placed in this pit with its trunk in an upright position. The cavity of
the pit would be filled-up with manured soil followed by heavy irrigation.
The tree would grow vigorously in the new place and in 2 to 3 years will put forth so much
vegetative growth that
it
will be
difficult to recognize
it as a displaced specimen. The
percentage of success is very high,
if all the operations are done carefully and properly.
4 LANDSCAPE DEVELOPMENT - RURAL AREAS
4.1
Road Land Width
4.1.1
Land width
is usually not a serious constraint in rural areas. The width acquired
should be as liberal and feasible with adequate provision for current as well as anticipated
requirements. While taking a decision in this regard interalia the following factors deserve
consideration:
•
Need to have stable side slopes for cuts/fills;
•
Requirement of contouring in portions of deep cut or high
fill to bring these into
scale with the surroundings;
12



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:SP:21-2009
•
Provision for roadside arboriculture including screen plantations for shielding
unsightly areas;
•
Desirability of a wider median or central verge in the case of dual carriageways
to avoid headlight glare;
•
Incorporation of adjacent plantations and beauty spots
in the general road
landscape.
4.1.2
The minimum land width should normally not be less than that recommended by
the Indian Roads Congress. Apart from above, consideration should be given to acquisition
of additional land width to take advantage of existing plantations, scenic spots, cultivated
areas
etc., forming a part of the highway landscape and to provide at intervals group
plantations and other landscape treatments. Such measures
will not only improve the
aesthetics of the road, thereby reducing monotony for the road users, but also help
in
preservation and propagation of natural plant and animal life towards maintaining ecological
balance in the area.
4.1.3
Acquisition of adequate land width by itself
is, however, not enough.
All efforts
should be made to ensure that the land acquired is not encroached upon.
It is also advisable
to lay down restrictions regarding building line, set-back distance, control line, height of
buildings, etc. Guidance in this regard can be had from IRC:SP:15-1996.
4.2
Route Location and Road Aiignment
4.2.1
Route location and road alignment are key elements affecting the road landscape.
The alignment should be fluent and blend with the surrounding topography.
It should create
the impression of moving naturally through the countryside instead of being forced through.
To achieve best results, the following points should be kept in view:
i)
Uniformity
in design standards
is an important factor
in road alignment.
Consistent application of a standard on a given length of a design element
over a given length of road can considerably increase aesthetics and safety.
For instance, a short sharp curve in an otherwise good alignment will lead to
poor appearance besides creating an accident-prone spot.
Similarly,
if a
change
in standards becomes unavoidable, for instance where a
hill road
enters the
plains,
it
will be desirable to effect the transition smoothly by
introducing successive sections with gradually increasing design speed;
ii)
A flowing line which conforms generally to the natural contours is preferable
to one with
long tangents slashing through the
terrain.
In
this way,
construction scars can be kept to the minimum and natural slopes and plant
growth preserved;
iii)
A winding alignment composed
of short curves or broken-back curves
(broken-back curve
is one which has a short tangent section between two

beauty in appearance.
4.2.2
For more information on geometric design features of road, reference may be
made to IRC:73-1980 "Geometric Design Standards for Rural (Non-Urban) Highways".
4.3
Highway Cross-Section
4.3.1
Cross-Section is an important constituent of highway design as
it determines the
special
relationship between roadside and the component parts of the highway.
The
elements involved
in highway cross-section are the carriageway, shoulders, median,
embankment slopes, cut slopes, drainage system and roadside land. Design requirements
for these are laid down in relevant standards, for example, IRC:73-1980, but from landscape
point of view. certain special considerations are required and are highlighted in Fig. 9.
4.4
Carriageway
4.4.1
Proper marking of the centre-line, edge-line and other pavement markings, and
neat and unbroken delineation of the joints between the pavement and shoulder can improve
road aesthetics a great deal besides safety. Attention should also be paid to maintain
these features in proper order.
Guidance about pavement and road marking details are
given in IRC:35-1997.
4.5
Shoylders
4.5.1
Shoulders are the portions of a roadway continuous with the carriageway. This is
essentially intended
for accommodation
of stalled vehicles,
for facilitating crossing
manoeuvres' or other emergency use and lateral support of the pavement courses. From
landscaping point of view,
it is desirable that the shoulders should be kept maintained to
given lines and levels.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:21-2009
4.5.2
On high speed highways,
it is advisable to surface the shoulders with the same
materia! as the main carriageway. On other roads, the shoulders may be turfed or treated
with gravel, stabilized soil, metalling or bituminous surfacing.
4.6
i^edian
4.6.1
Median
is provided primarily to separate opposing traffic streams. To meet this
objective,
it should have good visibility both during day and night.
Moreover, the median
should contrast well with the through traffic lanes. A larger width for the median is desirable
but this should be
in balance with other components of the highway and consistent with
economy.
In deciding on median width, consideration of following factors will be helpful:
i)
Preservation of natural vegetation or beauty spots by including these within
the median area;
ii)
Adequate space for screen planting to check headlight glare;
iii)
Sufficient separation between roadways to eliminate head-on collisions;
iv)
Space for emergency stopping of traffic.
4.6.2
Considering the width of about 4.5 m,
it is normal to provide kerbs on both sides.
But,
if the median
is considerably wider by any chance, the preferred course from
landscaping point of view will be to grade the median area suitably towards the middle
where a central drain may be provided.
4.7
Side Slopes in Cut and
Fill
4.7.1
Roads may be
in embankment,
cutting,
or partly
in
cutting and
partly
in
embankment depending on the natural topography of the area. From safety and stability
angle, side slopes in cut or fill will depend on the type of material encountered, the height/
depth of fill/cut and other related factors. However, from landscape considerations
it will
be desirable to adopt gentler slopes with corners rounded
off smoothly.
Flatter slopes
improve appearance, prevent erosion, permit seeding, encourage growth of grass and
contribute to road
safety.
In cuttings more than 6 m deep,
it
will be good practice to
provide benches at intermediate heights alongwith softening of profile at top and bottom
so that the long cutting slopes
fit into the landscape comfortably. High embankments,
espe'cially at isolated over bridge crossings, warrant similar care and effort
in design to
avoid looking unduly conspicuous
in the natural
skyline.
In these cases,
satisfactory
treatment will usually require taking of more land for contouring.
4.7.2
The top and bottom of fills and cuts and
all other sharp corners
in the highway
cross-section, should be smoothly rounded off and turfed so that they flow into the natural
contours and blend with the original ground.
4.7.3
Likewise, the transition areas between cut and
fill slopes shouW be treated carefully
in order
to make the earthworks confirm
to the adjacent terrain, encourage
rapid
establishment of vegetation cover and ensure economy in maintenance.
16



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:SP:21-2009
4.7.4
Slopes of cutting and embankment should be covered with vegetation to prevent
erosion and integrate the road with the surrounding landscape. Seeding may be done on
freshly graded slopes concurrently with grading or immediately thereafter. Grass
is the
basic erosion control material
for highways but
it requires maintenance. The primary
function of grass
is to stabilize slopes against erosion
until voluntary shrubs, trees and
weeds can establish themselves on the slopes.
4.7.5
An alternative to turfing is to encourage growth of ground cover consisting of bushy,
dense-foliaged plants which have water holding capacity, along with iow growing shrubs
which afford protection against erosion. Rapid growing species with inconspicuous flowers
may be preferred from the point of view of maximum survival and avoidance of artificial
effects. The governing principle should be preservation of natural growth and use of local
varieties of grass, creepers and shrubs. Where low growing shrubs are used as ground
cover, they are better planted in irregular masses or colonies rather than in rows. In heavy
rainfall areas, preference should be given to broad leaf shrubs as they have better resistance
against erosion.
4.7.6
The erosion control devices, such as, kerbs and paved gutters,
if required, should
be so designed and located that they are not unsightly.
4.8
Drainage
4.8.1
Drainage of surface and sub-surface water is a vital requirement of road design
and construction.
From landscape angle, the concern
is mostly with surface water. Any
ponding of water either on the roadway or in an uncontrolled manner on the adjoining road
land
is not only injurious to the road structure, but also not permissible from landscape
angle.
4.8.2
Care should be taken to disturb natural drainage to the minimum.
In many cases,
it should be possible to develop low-lying areas by the roadside into beauty spots by a
suitable plantation scheme taking advantage of the natural tendency for water to pond.
4.8.3
For ensuring better surface water drainage, the road camber should be consistent
with the
rainfall of the area and the rugosity or surface texture of the road surfacing.
Shoulders should also have the requisite slope and there should not be any break in profile
between the pavement and shoulder. Side drains should be properly connected to natural
outfalls.
The drainage system should be so located that
it merges into the surrounding
landscape. Where necessary, intercepting drains should be provided and other measures
taken to protect natural surfaces from water erosion.
4.9
Roadside Borrow Areas
4.9.1
Roadside borrow pits disturb the natural setting of the ground and as such are
undesirable from landscaping angle.
Effort should be to balance the cuts and
fills as far
17



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:SP:21-2009
as possible, so that borrow pits are altogether avoided, but this is not generally practicable
in plain terrain especially where high embankments are involved.
4.9.2
In selecting roadside borrow areas, due consideration should be given to the
requirements set out in IRC: 10-1 961. Desirably, the borrow areas selected, as also the
waste disposal areas, should not be visible from the highway
if
it can be so managed.
4.9.3
Roadside borrow areas should be suitably treated, so that these do not have an
adverse impact on the road landscape. Basic requirement is that the neighbouring ground
should be rendered acceptable in appearance.
To achieve this, the cut faces should be
moulded to a flatter slope and the corners rounded off. Bottom of the pits should be sloped
towards available natural outfalls so that water does not stagnate.
If the borrow area
is
sufficiently large,
possibility of converting
it into a water spot to serve as a landscape
feature should be explored.
4.9.4
After every major construction or repair work involving borrow of earth,
it is essential
that the borrow sites should be closely examined for all possible remedial measures to
minimize damage to the environment. This should not be left over as a secondary task but
regarded as a part of the project itself.
^Bri;
4.9.5
Where the above measures are not practicable, adequate space should be
provided to allow for installation of screen planting.
4.10
Roadside Arboriculture
i enfc
r
4.10.1
Apart from the consideration of alignment, grades, cross-section, etc. the most
important factor in landscaping
is tree plantation and preservation.
Unless this
is done
with care, the highway landscaping will not be complete.
Plants placed wrongly or badly
maintained may, in fact, mar the environment and cause danger to high speed traffic through
obstruction of sight distance,
risk of collision with tree trunks, and skidding caused by
fallen leaves.
4.10.2
Appropriate planting also contributes to road aesthetics and visual enjoyment by
motorists which can act as a check on excessive speeding. For detailed guidelines about
roadside arboriculture, refer to Section 11.
4.11
Highway Structures and Appurtenants
4.11.1
Different structures
like bridges,
culverts, subways and flyovers, apart from
abutments such as guard-rails, delineators and road signs are encountered along the
rural highway.
In hilly mountainous terrain, retaining walls and breast walls are a frequent
occurrence.
Design and construction of all such structures requires care so that these
blend well into the natural landscape without being out of scale with the surroundings.

5 LANDSCAPE DEVELOPMENT
URBAN AREAS
-
d
5.1
General
5.1 .1
Principles of landscape development are essentially the same, whether the situation
be urban or rural. But their application in and around cities has its own ramifications since
the environment
is mostly man-made and the scope for natural landscape features
is
_
greatly restricted.
In larger cities the position
is
still more
difficult because of almost
continuous built-up areas along the existing roads. Due to these differences, urban
landscape efforts normally require more careful and skillful designs to plan and execute
than rural highways.
5.1.2
The more important factors affecting landscape development in urban areas are
discussed below with a view to evolving appropriate designs in such cases.
5.2
Road Land Width
5.2.1
The factors influencing land width for roads in urban areas are:
i)
City zoning requirements as per regional/master plan;
ii)
Functional classification of the road e.g. arterial road, local street, etc;
iii)
Present and anticipated traffic;
iv)
Need for service roads, footpaths, cycle tracks, medians, space for under
and over-ground services, rotary intersections, etc; c,vbv.
v)
Provision
for environmental
protection and landscape development
measures, such as noise barriers, screen plantations, etc.;
vi)
Requirement of open space for recreation;
vii)
Cost of land
5.2.2
Besides the above factors and the tangible economic as well as the intangible
aesthetic benefits of roadside, landscape should be weighed while taking a final decision
about the land width.
5.2.3
Road land in urban areas is highly susceptible to encroachment.
5.3
Road Alignment
5.3.1
Location of urban roads is often dictated by the type of road system decided upon
in the regional/master plan of the area.
It
is, therefore, necessary that landscape
requirements of these roads be given due consideration at the time of preparation of such
plans.
Guiding principles should be that the road fits into the city surroundings and
is so
landscaped that
it has a healthy effect on the development of adjoining areas. As such, the
landscape measures should fully keep in view the requirements of residents of the locality
19



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:SP:21-2009
besides those of users of the route.
Overall attempt should be that residents, pedestrians
and road users all derive maximum possible benefit and enjoyment.
5.4
Highway Cross-Section
5.4.1
Cross-section of the road determines the relationship of the roadside to pavement
and other component parts of the highway.
Guidelines with regard to design of different
cross-section elements from landscape angle given
in para 4.3 for roads
in
rural areas
apply to urban areas as well, but with certain variations. Important among these are:
\)
Some
definite space should be earmarked
for underground/ overhead
services. The services should be so located and planned that these do not
interfere,
in any way, with
traffic operations and are not out of scale with
overall appearance of the road.
ii)
Careful consideration should be given
to the location and spacing of
all
access points including terminals, railway stations, parking areas etc., so
as to ensure safety and freedom from congestion.
ill)
The cross-section should have provision for footpaths, cycle tracks, service
or frontage roads, etc., depending on the anticipated requirements.
iv)
Due care should be taken to maintain the median plantation in order to avoid
.
'
its spread beyond the median margins. On urban highways the medians
should be provided with a continuous line of shrubs to cut off headlight dazzle.
However,
in such cases where the median is too narrow (say upto
1 .5 m) to
permit plant growth,
it should be turfed with grass and flowering plants. Narrow
medians may be covered with suitable contrasting material or paved with
hard materials like chequered tiles for improving the appearance.
v)
It may be necessary in certain cases, for reasons of engineering and cost of
land
acquisition,
to use
retaining walls
in
lieu
of slopes
(Fig. 10). The
relationship of the height of the retaining wall to the width of the roadway is
important from the stand-point of appearance. Retaining walls may be faced
with stone masonry to yield an attractive appearance. As a better alternative,
creepers could be trained on the retaining walls to beautify the surroundings.
5.5
Drainage
5.5.1
Surface drainage
in urban areas
is generally ensured through a gutter and kerb
arrangement with drain inlets connected to the storm water system.
Desirably, all unpaved
areas in the highway cross-section should be provided with erosion-proof turf to prevent
soil from being carried into the storm sewer system. Lack of effective erosion control may
result in unsightly small channels or eroded areas, which may be costly to repair.

Fig. 10 Economy and Pleasing Effect Achiev;
' by Reducing the Height of Retaining Wall
5.6
Borrow Areas
5.6.1
Borrow pits should not be allowed in urban areas though these may occur in sub-
urban situations. Landscape treatment of such pits should be taken up on lines discussed
in Para 4.9.
5.7
Roadside Arboriculture
5.7.1
Because of the high cost of land, Right of Way available is often a limiting factor in
urban areas as to the extent and character of landscape development. The land width
may vary from an extremely narrow strip, enabling only limited opportunities for planting,
to areas of sufficient width, which have
all the space required for this purpose. At the
same time,
if suitable plantation in the form of shrubs, flower beds, avenue trees, etc. can
somehow be provided,
it can considerably enhance the economic and aesthetic value of
area in and around the highway (Figs. 11 and 12).

5.8
Highway Structures and Appurtenants
5.8.1
Besides structures
like bridges,
culverts, subways
etc., a large number of
miscellaneous appurtenants such as lamp posts, bus shelters, overhead service lines, kiosks
etc. frequent the roadside in urban areas. Road intersections occur more frequently and are
usually of different type compared to rural highways. Some relevant aspects in this regard
are brought out in Section 6.
6 HIGHWAY STRUCTURES AND APPURTENANTS
6,1
Bridges and Approaches
6.1.1
In the choice, design and construction
of bridges and approaches, the basic
consideration is that these should not only be structurally sound but pleasing in appearance
and appropriate to the setting. The following points may be kept in view in this regard:
i)
The bridge structure including appurtenants like railings, parapet walls etc.
should be designed to contribute to the overall aesthetic quality of the road
and landscape.
ii)
The size
of the obstacle
(e.g.
river,
railway
line
etc.)
to be crossed,
engineering requirements and the physical properties of the
site
largely
determine the type of structure.
The general character of the surrounding
land, its topography (flat, rolling,
hill etc.), and its use (e.g. rural, agriculture,
wooded-land, built-up, industrial, etc.) will be relevant to the distant or near
view of the bridge. These factors along with the natural/man-made features
22



======================================================================
PAGE 31 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:SP:21-2009
will help to determine the scale of the bridge,
its proportions and general
design including that of railings, parapets etc.
iii)
Where a new bridge is to be built in lieu of an old historic structure,
it will be
desirable to site
it a
little
bit away, so that a view of the existing bridge
is
available.
It is equally important that the scale and height of the new bridge
should be in consonance with the setting.
iv)
Consideration should be given to the use of building materials of such type,
colour and texture that these not only make the structures architecturally
attractive but also help to harmonise them with the natural landscape of the
area.
For instance, coarse finished or stone-faced structures will be more
appropriate in forest areas.
v)
Approaches to bridges should blend with the terrain of the land, retaining
natural beauty of the surrounding areas. Where possible, the approaches
to major bridges should be so aligned that the bridge is visible from a distance
and catches the eye of tne road users, thereby breaking the monotony of
travel.
vi)
Adequate planting and other landscape measures in the proximity of bridges
can enhance the beauty of the area (Figs. 13 to 16).
vii)
Where adequate level ground is available in the vicinity of bridges, the same
could be developed into a roadside rest area so that travellers may halt there
for short periods and enjoy the beauty of the river, bridge and the landscape.
viii)
Proper merging of bridge structure with the approaches, each
of whom
normally has a different cross-section, is an important factor which will affect
aesthetics of the highway. The transition should be smooth and gradual for
better appearance and safety.

IRC:SP:21-2009
6.2
Crash Barrier
6.2.1
These are generally warranted on approaches to bridges, high embankments and
other similar locations. Proper thought should be given to the layout and choice of material
for the rails so that these easily blend with the surrounding landscape.
6.3
Tree Guards
6.3.1
Tree guards should be of appropriate design to so that these are functional and at
the same time add to the aesthetic view of the highway (refer Section 11).
6.4
Road-Intersections ~ Rotary/Roundabout
6.4.1
Road intersections are main nodal spaces and are of vital importance in terms of
road aesthetics. Proper landscaping of the traffic islands and the surrounding areas should
integrate these features with the surrounding landscape. The lay out of traffic intersections
should be fixed by the traffic needs of the junction. The landscape design should consider
the basic standards of height limitations, appropriate sight lines and other geometric design
elements that are applicable to each type of traffic intersection.
6.4.2
Different types of intersections are met with along a road.
In rural areas, these
are generally of channelised type.
Occasionally, rotaries with low kerbs for the central
island are also used.
Grade-separated interchange may also be necessary
in certain
urban and rural locations.
6.4.3
Basically, the type and layout of an intersection will depend on the volume and
turning movements of traffic. Appropriate landscaping measures at these locations can
improve the aesthetics as well as contribute to safety. While the actual landscape treatment
will depend on the individual site conditions, the following guidelines will be helpful:
i)
The
intersection should be
visible
for sufficient distance from
all the
approaching roads;
ii)
Smooth flowing lines and liberal turning curves will improve the appearance,
besides safety.
iii)
Traffic islands should be turfed and provided with flower beds or short
growing shrubs.
Central
island sand corners of rotaries
offer great
potentiality for such a treatment.
In such cases, particularly in urban areas,
provision of fountains and coloured lighting in the central island will not only
enhance the overall aesthetics but also provide a place for rest and recreation
(Figs. 17 and 18).
iv)
At grade separated
intersections, the entire interchange area should be
designed as a unit
in relation to the surrounding topography and potential
land use development of the adjacent area. Slope grading, drainage; erosion
control and turfing should be co-related with the design of all roadways and
25

IRC:SP:21-2009
structures,
both
to enhance the appearance of the area and
to keep
construction and maintenance costs to the minimum.
Effort should be to
make the interchange complex as less out of scale with the surroundings
as possible. While preparing the detailed design of the ramps, loops and
interchanges, planning should be done with the help of landscaping
architects.

Landscape Treatment of a Large Rotary and Included Corners through
various Measures
6.5
Road Signs
6.5.1
Road signs are an important component of the traffic control system. Type, size
colouring and lettering pattern of the signs should be as per IRC: 67-2001 "Code of Practice
for Road Signs". The sign system can be made more pleasing by treating an entire road
section in one go, instead of sporadic actions at individual locations. At intersections, the
26



======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:SP:21-2009
signs should be planned
in a logical sequence, instead of haphazard placement. On the
whole, there should be no proliferation or clustering of signs, especially in conjunction with
different utility posts, which could lead to unsightly conditions.
6.6
Miscellaneous Roadside Appurtenants
6.6.1
Design and construction of roadside appurtenants like railings, parapets, retaining
walls, light poles etc., need careful consideration with regard to their effect on the landscape.
It will be advantageous to associate landscape architects/urban designers
in the design
of their appurtenants. A typical design for a roadside railing
in urban areas
is shown
in
Fig. 19.
Fig. 19
Typical Design for Road Side Railing in Urban Area
6.6.2
Lamp posts on urban roads should be of appropriate design, so that in combination
with other posts and verticles they produce a pleasing appearance.
In historic towns or
other areas of special architectural character and on roads having completely open vistas,
the effect of some forms of lighting installations which tend to be over prominent can be
completely devastating to the surroundings. Special care in the selection of lighting fixtures
is, as such, necessary.
6.6.3
Bus bays and bus shelters should satisfy the functional requirements and also
suitably merge with the landscape of the road so as to enhance the general view.
6.6.4
Letter boxes, telephone junction boxes, electric transformers, overhead power/
telephone lines etc., need similar care in design and erection so that these do not spoil the
beauty of the road.
6.6.5
In urban areas, both along the road as well as at junction corners, amenity of the
surroundings can be considerably enhanced by constructing small water fountains with
lighting arrangement, green grass strips, flower-beds etc. But
it should be carefully planned
with the help of an architect.

7 ROAD SAFETY AND ROAD AMENITIES
7.1
Road Safety
7.1.1
The landscaping and plantation along highway play an important role in providing
road-safety for road users as under:
•
To define the toe and median of the carriageway, specially horizontal sharp
curve during night time.
•
Prevention of glaring from headlight of incoming vehicles.
•
Control of erosion by turfing the slope of the embankments
•
Trees along the embankment slopes and near major water bodies play a major
role in control of erosion. Similarly, green cover in the form of turfing stabilizes
steep slopes and high embankment.
•
Moderating the effect of wind and incoming radiation
•
Large and spreading shade trees, with thick foliage provide much needed shade.
•
To
provide much needed shade on glaring hot roads during summer
•
To define the historical places by landscaping and turfing as per the existing
scenario.
7.2
Roadside Amenities
7.2.1
General
7.2.1 .1
Importance of roadside amenities along trunk highways needs no emphasis since
such amenities can contribute greatly to the safety, convenience and enjoyment of road
travellers.
7.2.1 .2
Roadside amenities are of the following types:
•
Roadside rest areas
•
Truck parks
•
Off strip parking places (roadside lay byes)
•
Service Stations
7.2.1.3
Choice
of location, the type of facility and
its frequency
will depend on the
classification of the highway, traffic volume, topography and other related factors.
Overall
consideration should be that the amenities fit into the natural surroundings and are designed
and treated in such a way that these form a part of general road landscape.
7.2.1 .4
Specific features of the different types of roadside amenities are discussed further.
7.2.2
Roadside rest areas
7.2.2.1
Roadside rest areas are intended for rest and relaxation of long distance travellers
28



======================================================================
PAGE 37 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:SP:21-2009
and may occasionally provide facility for over-night stay also. These may be in the form of
rest houses specially developed for the purpose.
In the selection of individual sites, due
consideration should be given to the topography, existing vegetation growth, scenic and
historic values, cost of land, land use pattern, availability of facilities like water supply,
sewerage etc. and the distance from other similar areas.
7.2.2.2
Drinking water supply, toilets, provision for food/snacks, shady or covered areas
for rest, space for parking are some of the essential facilities to be provided at roadside
rests. Accommodation for over-night stay may also be provided, where feasible.
7.2.2.3
At the rest areas, ample shady trees should be developed for parking of cars in
summer and to provide shade to travellers who may like to use grassy lawns for recreation.
The lawns may be provided with proper footpaths to preserve the grass. Footpaths should
be planned and constructed in a manner that these become part of the landscape. Suitable
plantation for screening the noise of moving vehicles on the highway may also be provided.
7.2.2.4
Furniture items like benches, tables,
litter boxes, etc. should be of natural design
so that these form part of the landscape and involve minimum maintenance. The benches
could be made of wooden logs, stones etc. All these aspects should be carefully planned
in consideration with the natural surroundings.
7.2.2.5
Normally, spacjng of roadside rest spots along National Highways and State
Highways should be 100-125 km.
In actual location, preference should be given to sites
which are of interest to the travellers such as dam sites, bird sanctuaries, water falls and
other places with beautiful vistas like snow-clad mountains, river/canal banks or sea shore.
7.2.2.6
Typical layout design for a roadside rest area
is shown
in Figs. 20, 21 and 22
which show the views of a roadside rest area developed along a National Highway.

Fig. 22 Another View of Rest Area
7.2.3
Truck lay byes
7.2.3.1
Truck lay byes are intended mainly for the convenience of long distance truck operators.
These must provide the same basic facilities as at roadside rest areas (vide para 7.2) but the
parking lots will have to be bigger in area to accommodate a larger number of trucks.
7.2.3.2
Truck parks are generally developed near check barriers or at inter-state borders
or at places of conventional stops of the truck operators. These places should have ample
space for parking where big trees are planted to provide shade for trucks, besides lawns
for the relaxation of truck operators.
The trees and shrubs should be of hardy type.
In
order to break harshness of the big parking area, some green pockets should also be
developed. As regards open area,
it would be advantageous to go for a combination of
paving and grassing so as to reduce maintenance cost.
Proper screen planting may also
be required to insulate the area from the highway. Typical layout for a truck park is shown
in Figs. 23 and 24.

Screen Plantation along Urban Highway
7.2.4
Off-strip parking places (bus lay byes)
7.2.4.1
Off-strip parking places are basically roadside lay byes constructed parallel to the
road. They serve a purpose similar to roadside rest places, except that these are smaller in
size, have comparatively limited
facilities and are intended to be used for short periods,
mainly for stoppage of buses. Because of the nature of their usage, the spacing of such lay
byes is generally much closer than full-fledged rest areas. On busy trunk routes,
it may be
desirable to aim at a spacing of about 70-80 km. At times,
it may be advantageous to start
with a smaller off-strip parking place and develop
it gradually into a bigger rest area.
7.2.4.2
The direction of the sun may also be considered while planting the shade trees in
order to ensure that the shade is available to the parking vehicles.
If feasible, the position
of off-strip parking places should be adjusted to combine with any natural scenic lookouts
by the side of the road.
In such locations, besides planting of new trees, existing trees
31



======================================================================
PAGE 40 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:SP:21-2009
should be preserved for the purpose of shade and beauty. Benches and tables and a
small shelter could also be provided for the facility of drivers. The architectural treatment
of these features should be such that they merge with the surroundings and do not appear
isolated.
Similarly,
if any railing is provided,
it should be rustic in appearance and made of
local materials. An important consideration should be that the maintenance cost is minimum.
7.2.4.3
Fig. 25 illustrates the salient features of an off-strip parking place in plain terrain.
Fig. 25
Typical Layout of an Off-Strip Parking Place in Plain Terrain
7.2.5
Service stations
7.2.5.1
Service stations catering to fuel, oil and repair requirements of vehicles are needed
to be spaced out at more or less regular intervals along important highways and as such
the choice of sites with respect to the road landscape will generally be restricted.
All the
same,
it should be ensured that these do not adversely affect the natural beauty.
All efforts
should be made to blend the service stations with the natural landscape by choosing suitable
designs for structures and necessary planting.
8 LANDSCAPE TREATMENT FOR SPECIAL AREAS
8.1
Special points needing attention when dealing with landscape treatment of roads
passing through industrialized belts, water-logged areas, sandy/desert tracts, forest areas
and coastal regions are dealt with
in
this Section.
These are
in addition to the basic
design considerations discussed
in this Manual, which remain the same.
8.2
Landscaping Treatment at Sensitive Noise Receptors
8.2.1
All along the highway corridor certain sensitive receptors for noise should be
identified,
like the Schools, residential colonies and Hospitals. Special treatment should
32



======================================================================
PAGE 41 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:SP:21-2009
be given to all these sites in terms of landscaping and planting. A lot depends on the space
available for providing noise barriers. Within the limitations of the available space, physical
noise barriers and plantations can be combined to reduce the noise levels considerably.
At these sites the first row should be of tall shrub of
1 .5-3 m height with dense foliage for
the purpose of maximum possible screening
effect. Species
like Cassia
alata, Cassia
biflora, Hemelia patens, etc are used for this purpose. Last row could be planted with
trees like Neem (Azadirachta Indica), Mango (Mangifera Indica), Shisham (Dalbergia Sisso),
Imli (Tamarindus
Indica), and Karanj (Pongamia sp.). The intermediate rows may have
flowering trees
like Amaltas, Gulmohar, Kachnar etc. As far as possible, three rows of
plantation may be planted for reducing the noise levels.
8.3
Landscape Treatment for Highly Industrialized Areas
8.3.1
If some heavy industry already exists by the side of the road,
it will be advisable to
provide planting on both sides of the road to screen out any possible unsightly views (Fig. 26).
Fig. 26 Use of Screen Plantation to Insulate Slums and Other Unsightly View
8.3.2
Where a new industrial area is to be developed, requirements of landscape should
be kept in view at all stages of planning, design and construction.
8.3.3
In areas where some chemical industry has been set up,
it is possible that fumes
from factories may prove injurious to the drivers or create difficulties
in safe driving. To
minimize these effects,
it
will be desirable to create a thick green
buffer between the
highway and the industrial area, using plants which can safely grow in such environment.
8.4
Landscape Treatment in Waterlogged Areas
8.4.1
The type of landscape treatment to be given will depend upon the extent of water
logging in the area.
33



======================================================================
PAGE 42 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:SP:21-2009
8.4.2
If the surrounding area has standing water on both sides of the road,
it may not be
possible to treat land in the usual way.
In such cases, aquatic plants like water lilies, lotus,
etc., should be introduced to make the area beautiful.
8.4.3
At some places where water level is very high, the water logged portion could be
developed into a pond or lake for use as a rest spot by the road users.
8.4.4
Plantation scheme for such areas should be so decided that the plants can grow
well under the waterlogged conditions, do not need much maintenance and,
if possible,
can even help in lowering the water table. For plantation details, refer to Section
1 1
8.5
Landscape Treatment in Sandy/Desert Areas
8.5.1
In sandy areas, only such species of vegetation are recommended which have
the least water requirement and are of succulent and spring type with thinner leaves. As
far as possible, local plants should be preferred from the angle of easier maintenance and
bringing up.
8.5.2
Besides beautification, one of the functions of vegetation in desert areas is to act
as a barrier against shifting sand. Where
it is not possible to grow plants for this purpose
all along the road, effort should be to develop at least smaller pockets at intervals which
could also act as
rest areas.
Such
rest areas
in the desert
will be able
to provide
considerable relief to road users in intense heat.
For more details about plantation, refer
to Section 11
8.6
Landscape Treatment in Forest Areas
8.6.1
As far as possible, no new road should be aligned through the forest. Only under
unavoidable circumstances, a road may be planned with restricted ROW.
8.6.2
Cutting of trees should be avoided, as far as possible.
But wherever road passes
through animal corridor,
it may be ascertained that there
is minimum disturbance to the
forest and the animal
life. This is illustrated in Fig. 27.
8.6.3
In continuously wooded areas, there might be scenic spots and open vistas hidden
behind vegetation. By selective thinning and pruning of vegetation, contrasting views could
be developed so as to break the monotony of travel, (Fig. 28).
8.7
Landscaping of Coastal Highways
8.7.1
Desirably, the road should be aligned along the sea coast so that the travellers
can fully enjoy the natural scenery. At the same time, the road should not be so conspicuous
and close to the waterline that there is an adverse effect on the overall surroundings.
For
instance, the route could be located behind sparingly planted groups of trees which will
permit full views to the travellers and yet disturbance as regards visitors to the beach will
not be so much. At places, dense plantation could be made use of to screen private areas
and undesirable views.

9 IMPROVING LANDSCAPE OF
EXISTING ROADS
9.1
To improve the appearance of existing roads through landscaping measures, can
prove to be a variably difficult task because of several limitations, e.g. restricted land width,
difficulties in road realignment, presence of man-made features not conducive to aesthetic
treatment, etc. Yet, every possibility of beautifying the landscape should be investigated
and feasible steps taken.
9.2
Inventory of Existing Features/Facilities
9.2.1
The first stage in formulation of a viable programme for beautification of an existing
road will be to prepare an up-to-date inventory of all landscape features including existing
plants and other amenities by the side of the road. The inventory should be depicted on
linear plans together with indication about potential locations where scenic lay byes, roadside
parks, group plantations
etc., could be developed. The existing features and roadside
shoulders should be maintained properly.
9.3
Acquisition of Additional Land
9.3.1
Based on the inventory, an action programme should be prepared as regards
additional landscaping measures and traveller amenities.
If available land width is insufficient
to implement this programme, acquisition of additional land should be seriously considered
keeping in view the following requirements:
i)
To provide flatter side slopes
in cuts and
fills alongwith contouring of the
adjacent land.
36



======================================================================
PAGE 45 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:SP:21-2009
ii)
To provide enough space for planting suitable trees and plants.
iii)
To provide sufficient area for parking, look out spots and other aesthetic
features.
9.4
Borrowpits
9.4.1
Treatment to borrowpits should be planned on the following lines:
1)
Improvements to the existing borrowpits by remoulding them into water spot.
ii)
Grading the sides of existing borrowpits with suitable curves to minimize
the effect of harsh vertical faces.
iii)
Avoiding future borrowpits,
or
if absolutely necessary regulating
their
excavation according to prescribed norms.
9.5
Arboriculture
9.5.1
Detailed guidelines about arboriculture are given in Section 11
. On existing roads,
the following points deserve special consideration:
i)
Adopting an integrated scheme of planting so that the new trees and shrubs
go well with existing vegetation.
^
-
'
-
ii)
Grassing/turfing for erosion prevention.
iii)
Screen planting to block unsightly views.
9.6
Other Measures
9.6.1
By properly regulating the advertisement boards and improving the illumination,
the road may be made more pleasant to the traveller.
9.6.2
Sides of roadside drains should be dressed and trimmed properly to improve the
appearance. Where there is a steep fall in levels along the drain, small weirs may be constructed
at intervals to allow the water to fall in cascades, which will create a pleasant effect.
9.6.3
Ugly manure pits, dilapidated huts and other unsightly spots which mar the beauty
of the landscape should be removed or screened off suitably.
9.6.4
Removal of tree branches obstructing smooth
traffic movement and good view
should be carried out judiciously. Similarly, old tree stumps should be removed and the
area made presentable by suitable means.
10 MAINTENANCE OF ROADSIDE PLANTATION
10.1
Maintenance of roadside arboriculture includes a number of operations such as
(i) tending saplings of trees and plants
till they can stand by themselves,
(ii) selective
pruning of shrubs, trees
etc., from considerations of traffic operations and
safety,
(iii)
37



======================================================================
PAGE 46 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:SP:21-2009
maintenance of grass in turfed areas and (iv) keeping the rest areas neat and clean.
10.2
For detailed guidelines about tending saplings of trees and plants, refer to Section
1
1 0.3
Selective pruning or cutting of trees and shrubs will be required at situations where
these
(i) interfere with sight distance,
(ii) come in the way of effective street illumination,
(iii) are too close to the carriageway so as to be hazardous, (iv) conceal desirable views
and scenic vistas and (v) have become too old or dead.
10.4
Maintenance of vegetation should be scheduled for the most effective seasons
for each class of work.
For example, grass mowing should be at intervals governed by
growth
rates,
fertilizing of turf should precede maximum growth periods and selective
pruning of plants should precede the dormant period. Some items of roadside maintenance
such as tree removal and tree care, which are not seasonal, may be scheduled for other
periods.
10.5
On heavily trafficked highways in urban areas, rising dust is a continuous problem,
particularly during the dry weather.
The dust may settle on roadside plants and shrubs
and spoil their beauty. Where the problem is acute, plants and shrubs should be periodically
given a wash to remove the dust.
10.6
The trees and plants should be maintained under the supervision of horticulture
staff and new plants put up, wherever necessary,
in adequate time, especially to replace
the dead and old trees. Proper working plans should be prepared where the work involves
felling of mature trees/plantation.
11 BROAD GUIDELINES OF ROADSIDE/MEDIAN PLANTATION
11.1
General
11.1.1
This Section gives broad guidelines about different aspects
of roadside
arboriculture. For proper selection of plant, native plant species have been recommended
for different climatic regions.
In Appendix-I principal details of each of the species, such
as, their name in different languages, characteristics of growth and the suggested location
of use has been described.
11.1.2
Tree plantation
is the most effective, economical and useful remedy for control of
environmental pollution. Besides,
it is the cheapest way of landscape improvement. Trees
have innumerable direct and indirect benefits of supplying timber and fuel at maturity. During
their
life time, they supply fodder,
fruits, seeds, help
in controlling soil erosion and water
conservation, offer shade and are oxygen producing industries to combat ever increasing
air pollution (Appendix-ll). Big foliage trees also help in reducing noise and dust pollution.
38



======================================================================
PAGE 47 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:SP:21-2009
11.2
Objectives of Tree Plantations
11.2.1
The main objectives of planting along the Highways are as follows:
•
To provide for aesthetic enhancement of the project corridors
•
To reduce the impacts of air pollution and dust, as trees and shrubs are known
to be natural sink for air pollutants.
•
To provide much needed shade on glaring hot roads during summer.
•
To reduce the impact of ever increasing noise pollution caused due to increase
in number of vehicles.
•
To arrest soil erosion at the embankment slopes.
•
Prevention of glare from the headlight of incoming vehicles.
•
Climatic amelioration,
•
Moderating the effect of wind and incoming radiation
•
To define the ROW especially, to highlight sharp horizontal curves during night
11.3
Selection of Tree Species for Landscaping
11.3.1
Trees, shrubs and climbers have been used to enhance the soft natural ambience
against harsh elements
in most of the enhancement schemes. The planting species are
decided based on the physical growth characteristics of trees, like form and shape, foliage
pattern, growth rate, branching pattern, soil characteristics and conditions of the strip like
water logged areas etc. While selecting the species of trees for landscaping, great care
should be taken to choose the species, which already exist along the project corridor.
11.3.2
The selection of plant types and planting arrangement should be based on the
following considerations:
•
Aim and objective of plantation
•
Shape (spread of the tree) and size
•
Texture and colour of foliage/flower/fruits
in different seasons and stages of
growth.
•
Adaptability and suitability to agro-climatic regions/zones
•
Growth rate (slow/fast) average age of maturity and replacement cycle
•
After-care and maintenance required for sustenance and growth
•
Economic and other social/recreational benefits
•
Drawbacks and demerits,
if any,
like prone to insects/pests disease, animal
grazing and human interference.
39



======================================================================
PAGE 48 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:SP:21-2009
11.4
Screening
:
•
Plantation of pollution resistent dwarf shrub species in the median to prevent
glare from the vehicles moving in opposite direction during night.
•
A mix of medium and large trees along roadside to screen the evening glare for
the traffic moving towards west-northwest.
•
Screen plantation as a visual barrier in schools, hospitals, residential colonies,
etc.
11.5
Aesthetics
•
Provision of flowering trees in the urban sections and major crossings
•
Provision of flowering shrubs in the median
•
Softening of vertical surfaces of the retaining walls of grade separators and
raised sections of the carriageway by climbers.
11.6
Shade
•
One of the main objectives of Roadside Avenue is to provide shade. Large and
spreading shade trees, with thick foliage are proposed to provide much needed
shade on
glaring,
hot roads during summer. Evergreen trees do not have
substantial leaf fall, which avoid the nuisance of clogging of lined drains.
11.7
Other considerations
•
Trees along the embankment slopes and near major water bodies play a major
role
in the control of erosion.
Similarly, green cover
in the form of turfing
stabilizes steep slopes and high embankments.
11.8
Plantation Pattern
11 .8.1
A soft landscape should be developed envisaging a holistic approach to the entire
stretch. A concept should be evolved so as to maintain visual characteristics and uniformity
in terms of landscape along the stretch.
In the absence of uniform land availability for the
plantations, different schemes may be worked out in tune with the local variations
in the
design. To achieve
this,
entire stretch
of the project corridor should be divided
into
homogenous landscape sections based on similarity
in terms of soil conditions, climate
(temperature and rainf?.'l) and topography. A study on the local flora and vegetative cover
native to these sections should be carried out as part of the field surveys to enable the
choice of suitable species for particular section.
11 .8.2
Earlier, the first row of plantation along the highways used to be done by using tall
shade bearing trees. But with the development of high-speed highways, the concept needs

IRC:SP:21-2009
to be changed. For the sake of better road safety and for enhancing aesthetics,
it has now
been felt better to provide the shade plants in the last available row.
In the first or the only
available row; and other intermediary rows, small to medium sized ornamental trees should
be planted.
11.8.3
The planting type should be decided based on the requirement and feasibility at
various sites along the project corridor. Physical growth characteristics of trees, like form
and shape, foliage and rooting characteristics, growth rate, canopy type and branching
pattern are the major criteria
in the selection of plantation type and density. The space
available in the ROW is one major guiding factor for different themes of landscaping applied
in the entire corridor.
11.8.4
Depending on the available ROW, plantation pattern should be worked out as
follows:
i)
The first row along the Highways will be of small to medium sized ornamental
trees.
ii)
Subsequent rows, depending on the availability of width,
will comprise of
ornamental and/or shade bearing species, of more height than those in the
first row.
In rural sections, the last row will always be of shade bearing tall
trees.
iii)
Planting of shrubs in the median.
iv)
Planting
of herbaceous species as ground cover
in the median, special
landscapes and embankment slopes.
v)
Turfing with grass
in the median, special landscapes and embankment
slopes.
11.9
Ornamental Species
11.9.1
The first and subsequent rows of plantations along the highway, except the last
row, should be worked out based on the land availability within the ROW along the various
sections. In case of urban and semi-urban areas, where because of land constraints, only
one row of plantation possible, ornamental species should be planted instead of shade
bearing species. A combination
of ornamental, shade and screening trees have been
recommended. The number of rows and the repetition of the trees and their type vary with
the landscape section, the typical cross-section and the space available
in the ROW for
tree plantation.

list a few species, which can generally be planted throughout India for this
purpose.

Shade Plants
11.10.1 One of the main objectives of Roadside Avenue
is to provide shade. The shade
trees in the last available row should be planted at a spacing of 8-1 2 m. These tree species
should be of local significance and should be mostly evergreen in nature, which ensure no
substantial leaf-fall in winters preventing the problem of blockage of roadside drains. Trees
with the following characteristics will be planted as shade trees:
i)
Trees with high crown forms secure better visibility and are therefore ideal.
ii)
Trees that retain their foliage longest are preferred to deciduous trees

It is recommended that local
experts from the Forest Department and Horticulture Department should be consulted
before finalizing the choice of species for a particular stretch.
11.11
Species for Median
11.11.1
The shrubs to be planted
in the median should be of low or medium height for
prevention of the headlight glare. One to two rows of flowering shrubs will be provided
according to the varying width of the median
in different sections.
In sections where the
median width
is less than
1.5 m, only turfing of grass
is proposed.
Some herbaceous
species may also be planted as a ground cover, not only on the medians but on special
landscapes and embankment slopes also. The species proposed for the purpose of turfing/
ground cover are: Cynodon dactylon, Cythocline perpurea, Solanum nigrum, Alternanthera,
Chlorophytum, Eupatorium, Wedelia, Duranta, Portulacca, Ipomea, Pelia cadrii, Beleprone
oblongata, Tradescantia, Asparagus, Opheopogon grass etc. The shrub species proposed
in the median are mainly Bougainvillea and Thevetia
nerifolia (Kaner). However, other
suitable species may be planted
in consultation with the
local
horticulture specialists.
Region-wise specific lists have been given in Annex A to F.

11.12
Plantation Agency
11.12.1
The entire highway network can be divided into two categories based on the
legal status of the existing road-side plantations.
In most of the areas, the existing
plantations along the highways have been notified as protected forests.
For these areas,
permission for tree cutting
is required to be taken from the Forest Department under the
Forest Conservation Act, 1980.
While granting the permission, the Forest Department
stipulates the conditions not only for compensatory afforestation
but also for avenue
plantations.
In these cases, the amount for plantation
is deposited with the Forest
Department and normally the work of avenue plantation
is taken up by them.
11.12.2
In other category, such highway corridors are considered where the existing
road side plantations have not been declared as Protected Forests.
In these cases, as in
the cases of bypasses also, the plantation may be taken either through the contractor (if
it
is a BOQ item). Forest Department as an agency for plantation, or, from a private contractor.
11.13
Concept of Plantation in Different Areas
11.13.1
Rural Areas
:
•
^' I
^-A-f
11.13.1.1
Common
plants generally recommended
for National Highways and State
Highways passing through
rural areas are Amaltas (Cassia fistula), Neem (Azadirachta
indica), Jamun (syzygium cumini),
Imli (Tarmarindus indicus). Tall trees
like Eucalyptus
are not suitable (except for waterlogged areas) as they interfere with electric and telephone
lines and are safety hazards on the road. Medium trees like. Acacia auriculiformis,
Gravillea
robusta, are ideal for screening.
In a tropical country like India, where the temperature
during summer months may
rise up to a maximum of 46°C or more, the 'shade'
is of
greatest value to the travelers. Thorny trees like Acacia Arabica and Ber (Zizyphus jujuba)
are avoided, as these create a nuisance for the pneumatic tyre of motor vehicles.
11.13.2
Urban Areas
11.13.2.1
Near market places and congested areas, the trees known for behaving as
'pollution sink' are proposed. Though, trees in general absorb the pollutants, filter the air
from pollutants, and act as noise barrier, but some trees like Neem (Azadirachta Indica),
Mango (Mangifera
Indica), Shisham (Dalbergia Sisso),
Imli (Tamarindus Indica), Karanj
(Pongamia sp.), and some flowering trees like Amaltas, Gulmohar, Kachnar etc. can do
't
in a better way.
11.13.2.2
Near sensitive areas like schools and hospitals,
tall trees with thick canopies
can create a wind screen through which the air can be filtered and the noise levels be
reduced to some extent. Some such trees are Pongamia sp.. Acacia auriculiformis and
Gravillea robusta. Tall shrubs like Casia biflora, hamelia patens etc. are also provided at
the sensitive noise receptors for maximum possible screening.

11.13.3
Edges Along Clear Zone
11.13.3.1
The clear zone along the road
is of varied nature depending upon the different
embankment heights. Some areas have steep gradients that need intensive stone pitching
treatment. In order to increase the structural stability, this type of treatments, plant materials
such as shrubs and ground covers, can be introduced
in the
interstices. They can be
used with emphasis on their rooting characteristics, so that they help in binding the stone
pitching treatments. In areas of high water table or water logging, special emphasis should
be given on the selection of plant materials that can survive in moist conditions.
11.13.4
Water Logged Areas
11.13.4.1
Waterlogged areas along the roads are generally due to inadequate drainage
pattern. The road acts as a bund and contributes to water logging
in the region of high
water table or the low lying nature of the terrain.
11.13.4.2
This type of situation is common throughout the plains in the country. Planting
of such
sites
after proper drainage
is now a common
practice.
T. Arjuna, Jamun and
Eucalyptus are usually recommended for waterlogged areas. Bamboos can also be planted
in such areas.
11.13.5
AlkalineSoils
11.13.5.1
Alkaline (Usar) soils are frequently encountered along the highways through
out the country.
The species recommended for such soils include; Azadirachta indica,
Ailanthus, Terminalia arjuna, Pongamia, Albizzia lebbeck, A. procera.
11.14
Specifications for Avenue Plantations

In
localities where a really bad patch of saline
soil (usar) occurs, there
is a
need to dig deep pits by augur [mechanical device] to break the kankar pan down below
and replacing the soil by good quality soil. The pits should be filled with the soil amender,
Gypsum (1 to 3 kg per pit, depending on the pH) along with 2 kg compost and sand. The
treatment helps in lowering down the pH and thus enabling better survival of plants.
11.15.
Protection Measures
11 .1 5.1
The fencing of single row plantations is generally done by using iron/brick/cement
guards Fig. 29 (a) (b). Locally available bamboo guards or thorn fencing should be used
where protection can be ensured through them. The description and specifications for the
iron and brick guards are as given in Figs, 29 to 31

Specifications for Grass Turfing
11.18.1 The surface
is to be prepared adequately for grass sowing. The grass and shrub
planting
is done to provide a strong surface cover but needs a well-prepared surface. All
masses of loose debris should be removed. Any convexities should be removed and
similarly any concavities are to be filled by good soil. The surface should have sufficient
layer of good quality soil [upto 45 cm] so as to have better growth and survival of grasses
and shrubs.

IRC:SP:21-2009
11.18.2 Grass lines are used to provide a strong surface cover but need a well-prepared
surface in which to be planted.
If grass is to be an effective form, then
it must be allowed
to establish properly on a slope which doss not subject
it to undue stress from erosion
and mass movement in
its
initial stages.
i)
Sowing
of grasses
is intended
to create a strengthened surface that
is
resistant to erosion,
ii)
It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that the condition of the site
is good enough for the successful establishment of grasses.
iii)
The contractor is required to supervise all field operations like preparation of
surface, sowing of grasses and quality of grass seeds used.
iv)
A cover of 25 gram of grass seed per square meter of surface should be
achieved.
v)
The timing of sowing
is of utmost importance. The seed sowing must be
carried out before the onset of monsoon [May & June] so that they yield
desired results. The watering of the surface will be done by tankers
till the
onset of the monsoon.
vi)
After sowing, mulch of prepared and dried out herbs should be laid over the
whole seeded area in a thin layer so that the direct sunlight and transpiration
loss may not affect the grasses,

Activity Schedule
Plantation activities are highly time specific, as the plants respond to the seasonal variations
In climatic conditions. Even in highly mechanized irrigated plantations, the growth of plants
Is not uniform throughout the year and is governed by the atmospheric factors,
It is therefore,
vital to plan the planting activities in advance as per the prevailing climatic conditions of
the area, especially the time and duration of monsoon. Generally, plantations works are
started
In our country with the onset of monsoon. However,
if
it
is possible to provide
irrigation.
It
Is advisable to
utilize the high temperatures of summers. Generally, plants
respond well
to
Irrigation during peak summer seasons, as the conditions are very
favourable for growth
If moisture Is not the limiting factor,
11.20.1 Watering of Plants
Water Is a ©ssentlal component of living organism, since
It constitutes 30-40 percent of
their body weight, Most of the organic and inorganic substances are sparingly, partly and
completely soluble in
It,
It Is a major raw material for the photosynthesis by wh'ch plants
produce their food.
The iisential nutrient for plants are mostly transported by the water either by
Itself or
when water mixes with other eonstituenti
like elemental, molecular or compound form.
Sometimes,
It may act as a bridge between two or more intra or inter-constituents which
will help to supply the desired nutrients from soil and also from atmosphere.
The quantity of water requirement largely depends on the nature of species, soil quality,
and depth of the first aquifer and on the ellmatle condition of that area, The relative humidity,
ttmptriture, wind speed and wind direction have major role In this regard. About 4a0 to

650 litres of water is required per plant per year since the very beginning of the plantation
till
it attains to its normal safe size and growth i.e. about 6-7 years from the date of plantation.
The external supply of water is to be continued
till the roots of that species may be able to
absorb the required quantity of water from the soil strata. The quantity and frequency of
watering is given in Table 5.

Although, normally, the plantations get established by the end of 3"^ year of
planting, but in some cases the plantations require maintenance for some more years.
It
will depend upon the
soil and climatic conditions, besides the nature of the plant. The
following maintenance measures are recommended:
,
i)
Regular maintenance of the barbed wire fencing or other fencing material
used for protection
ii)
Periodic pruning of trees planted in median so that branches do not spread
on to the carriageway
iii)
Casualty replacement of plants before monsoon

Training and Pruning of Shrubs
?
11.23.1
By nature of their growth habit, shrubs tend to take extna growth or unbalanced
growth. Thus, regular training and pruning by cutting and removal of undesired parts of
twigs
is required.
11.23.1.1
Training
I
The process of providing desired form and size to a shrub plant is training. This is done by
cutting away all growth that does not come in the desired frame, shape and size. Training
53



======================================================================
PAGE 62 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:SP:21-2009
of plants is started when they are still young. 3-4 branches are allowed to grow from main
stem near the ground, radially to different directions. These are further divided
into 2-3
branches, each making oval shape of 3 m dia
in spread near the ground and 1.5 to 2 m
high. This process is completed in 3-4 operations of cutting and pruning in first 2 years of
growth. The sequence of training
is shown through sketches
in Fig. 4. When the plants
take their final size and shape, they are annually cut to this shape by pruning extra growth
once or twice a year.
11.23.1.2
Pruning
Pruning involves cutting and removal of parts, twigs limbs or branches of shrubs. Besides,
giving desired shape and size, pruning helps in:
•
Encouraging vigorous growth by allowing proper air, light and food to the
parts retained.
•
Removing over-crowding and weak branches.
•
Removing dried up, diseased and pest infested parts
•
Regulating and increasing flowers/fruit/production.
While doing operations of training/pruning; proper tools and implements like pruning knife,
pruning saw, tree pruner & shears etc. should be used. Care should be taken that bark of
the plants
is not damaged, ruptured, or peeled
off.
After deciding the framework to be
retained,
shoots should be cut back to desired size and shape.
All the sick, thin and
interwining
twigs should be removed for allowing air & light to the desired ones.
Generally, flowering buds are produced
in 6-8 month old shoots, which are usually cut
away through repeated
indiscriminate cutting without applying
scientific principles of
pruning. Consequently, neither these shrubs take their optimum spread (vertical & lateral)
nor produce colourful flowers, as required.
Time of pruning is very important and
it should be done only in the season of dormancy i.e.
when the plants are not in active growth. In India, this period comes usually from December
to January & May to June. Blooming time is February to June & September to December.
However,
light pruning and pinching of tips can be done any time when
it becomes
necessary due to other emergent reasons of safety and sanitation etc.
Special Treatment Required^pfor Trees Planted
in Median of Divided
Carriageways
11.24.1
At many places medium size trees are also grown
in the medians. But
it has
been observed that
if they grow to their optimum height and spread, they may cover
approximately 8 to 10 m space, both in height and spread. In that case, following problems
may occur which should be considered at the time when these trees are
still young and
manageable in alternative ways:
54



======================================================================
PAGE 63 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:SP:21-2009
11.24.2 Grown up trees may cover the entire median and may cause shade to the shrubbery
planted in the median resulting into very poor growth or non-survival of shrubbery/bushes
under shade.
11.24.3 Large size trees
in median are more prone
to cyclone damage
resulting
in
accidents and disruption of traffic. Only those plants should be used in the median, which
are not prone to cyclone damage.
11 .24.4 During rains and wet weather, roads beneath the tree canopy get damp and slippery
due to dripping of water for long time.
This causes damage to asphalted road and makes
it more prone to accidents due to skidding and slippages when emergency brakes are
applied.
,
,
.
^
,
11.24.5 Large size trees develop a very strong and large taproot and lateral root system,
which weakens the compaction and pavement of the carriageway with the passage of
time.
1 1 .24.6 Trees planted in the median provide shade in carriageway resulting in poor visibility
especially during dawn and dusk.
11.24.7
It is advisable to avoid planting large size trees in median. Trees already planted
in the median, which are
still young, should be trained as Topiary and Bonsais as an
innovation in the highway landscaping.
11.24.8 TOPIARY
is an art of developing the plants and trees/hardy bushes
in special
features/figures by regular and repeated training and pruning and keeping them
in fixed
size and shape.
11.24.9 BONSAIS are trees developed into miniature or dwarfed forms. These are highly
developed art forms of gardening originated in Europe and Japan. Illustration/sketches for
artful Topiary and Bonsais for preparation in the median are given in Figs. 5 and 6.
«
11.25
Clearance on Curves
11.25.1
For the shade bearing large trees, an average spacing of
8-12 m requiring 84
plants per km will provide ample growing space for most species. Too many trees, apart
from involving higher planting costs, very often unnecessarily reduce visibility for fast traffic.
Excessive dense avenues serve no useful purpose, apart from affecting the tree growth
adversely, also reduces visibility and proves to be dangerous to fast moving traffic. Growth
of vegetation close on the road curves may lead to serious reduction of clear sight distance
and may cause accidents. Such accidents can be easily avoided by avoiding planting on
near the curves. Close spacing on curves and crossing can be dangerous. So best plan is
not to plant the ornamental rows, and miss a tree or two of the shade row at such locations.
Even the existing vegetation on such areas may need to be removed/thinned or trimmed.

IRC:SP:21-2009
In plain terrain, a stopping sight distance of 170 m corresponding to the design speed of
100 km per hour should be ensured on
all curved sections, on the innermost lane of the
curve.
11.26
No Plantation Zone
11.26.1 The plantation may not be carried out in the following areas:
•
Within
1 .5 m from the toe of the carriageway.
•
At median cut and grade separator, at least 5 m blank space shall be
left for
clear view of the traffic
.
"
At curve, dense and tall height tree reduce visibility in plain terrain, a stopping
sight distance of 170 m corresponding to the design speed of 100 km per hour
should be ensured on
all curved sections, on the innermost lane of the curve.
•
At median, medium and large size trees are more prone to cyclone damage
resulting
in accidents, disruption of traffic and clear view of the carriageway.
Long rooted plants may also damage the carriageway.
•
Screen plantation as a visual barrier in schools, hospitals, residential colonies,
etc.

Of the above species eucalyptus rostrata can not only grow under marshy conditions, but
has capacity to draw up large quantities of water for transpiration. Sometimes this species
is used for drying up marshy land.
Trees Suitable for Saline Tracts
Saline tract
is present along the coastal areas where the tidal waves submerge the land
periodically. Besides, vast saline tracts are met with
in the country where waterlogging
is
a perennial problem. Here the accumulated body of water finds release mainly
in to the
atmosphere through evaporation leaving behind the salts on the surface, This condition
for decades, or even for centuries, have turned the soil very saline. Trees suitable for such
tracts are those that can stand drought as well as high concentration
of salinity. The
example of such trees are
:
.
1.
Acacia auriculiformis
2.
Butea monosperma
3.
Casuarina equisetifolia

(Refer to Para 11.1.2)
SLOPE PROTECTION AND LANDSCAPING
SOIL EROSION
>
When soil erodes, particles
move from
the p.a^e
of
origin and are deposited
elsewhere.
>
Soil erosion destroys the
ability to produce crops
>
Results in deforestation
>
Reduces storage capacity
of water in Lakes,
River,
canal.
>
Wind Erosion starts when
the
force
of
the
wind
overcomes gravity.
Soil
is
carried by the wind in three
ways-suspension, saltation
and surface creep.
>
Suspended soil particles
can be carried by the wind
for great distances. Coarser
particles
will be bounced
along by the
wind.
The
process is called saltation.
Surface creep refers
to a
process
where
larger
particles roll the direction of
the wind.

EROSION CONTROL BLANKETS
Erosion Control blankets protect soil and seed from
erosion by providing a cover against the erosive forces
of overland storm water flow and the effect of rainfall.
Erosion Control blankets act as a non-deteriorating
mulch that promotes seed germination beneath the
mat. Vegetcition easily grows through it because of It's
high porosity.
SOIL EROSION CONTROL BLANKETS
BENEFITS OF COIR
>
Coir is natureal and 100% biodegradable. Coir is one
of nature's strongest fibres and will maintain its tensile
strength under soil & water.
It is also highly UV
resistant.
>
Coir has the best content of Lignin and is resistant to
mould and rot. Coir biodegrades very slowly over a 5-
10 year period and
>
Coir retains moisture, act as a mulch and provides an
excellent microclimate for faster growth of plant and
root system.
>
Re-vegetation measures using coir encourage the
restoration of terrestrial and aquatic riparian habitat.
