TENTATIVE GUIDELINES FOR THE USE OF
LIME-FLY ASH CONCRETE AS PAVEMENT
BASE OR SUB-BASE
1.1.
These guidelines were approved by the Cement Concrete
Road Surfacing Committee
(personnel given below) in
their
meet-
ing held at Chandigarh on the 1st March, 1975.
These
were
processed
by
the
Specifications
and Standards
Committee in their meeting held on the 13th
December
1975
and
later
approved
by
the
Executive
Committee
and the Council in
their meetings held on the 22nd
December
1975
and
3rd January
1976 respectively.
1.2.
General
Lime-fly ash
concrete is a semi-rigid material having distinctly
superior load dispersion characteristics as compared to conventional
granular bases and sub-bases like water-bound macadam.
As such
a smaller thickness of this material
can be used to replace the con-
ventional base and subbase courses in flexible
and
rigid
pavement
construction.
IRC: 15-1970
'^Standard Specifications and Code of
Practice
for
Construction
of
Concrete
Roads
(First
Revision)"
permits the use of 10 cm
thick lime-pozzolana
concrete
in place of
15 cm
thick
water-bound macadam
as
subbase
under
concrete
pavement.

Besides
superior
load
spreading properties, lime-fly ash con-
crete is resistant to softening under water action and can serve as a
good
working
platform
on
softer
foundations.
These
properties
make this material particularly
suitable
for
use
in
heavy
rainfall
areas,
black
cotton soil areas (when laid over lime-stabilised
black
cotton soil) and in
areas where good quality
stone for base courses
has to be obtained from long distances.
Lime-fly ash concrete will
enable 20-30 per cent
reduction in thickness
vis-a-vis granular base
courses.
As
disposal
of
fly
ash
from
thermal power stations is a re-
cognised national
problem, use of
lime-fly ash concrete as a struc-
turally
superior paving
layer will also
contribute towards relieving
this problem.
2.
THICKNESS DESIGN OF LIME-FLY ASH CONCRETE
BASE/SUBBASE LAYER
2.1.
As Base Course in Flexible Pavement
The
thickness
of
lime-fly
ash concrete layer for use as base
course in flexible pavement should be
designed in
accordance with
the GBR method of design, vide
IRC: 37-1970 ''Guidelines
for
the
Design of
Flexible
Pavements,"
using
an
equivalency
factor
of
1.25-1.5
depending
on
the
discretion of the
designer.
Thickness
of lime-fly ash concrete layer should, however,
in
no
case
be
less
than 10 cm.
2.2.
As Subbase Course under Rigid Pavement
The
thickness
of lime-fly ash concrete layer for use as a sub-
base course under cement
concrete
pavement
should
be
as
per
IRG:
15-1970
''Standard
Specifications
and
Code of Practice for
Construction
of
Concrete
Roads
(First
Revision)".
IRC
:
15-
1970
recommends
the
provision
of
10 cm
thickness
of
lime-
pozzolana
concrete
subbase
in
lieu
of 15 cm thickness of water
bound macadam.
3.
MATERIALS FOR LIME-FLY ASH CONCRETE
3.1.
Lime
Lime used for lime-fly ash
concrete should, as far as possible,
conform to Class C
variety as per IS: 712-1972:
"Standard Specifi-
cations for Building Limes."
The purity shall, however, not be less
than 60 per cent.
Lime shall be used in hydrated form.
2



======================================================================
PAGE 7 of 16
======================================================================
IRC
: 60-1976
3.2.
Fly Ash
Fly
ash
should
conform
to IS: 3812 (Part II)-1 966: Standard
Specifications for Fly Ash: Part II.
3.3.
Aggregates
Coarse aggregate for use
in
lime-fly ash
concrete
should be
either natural stone aggregate conforming to IS: 383-1970: Standard
Specifications for Coarse and Fine Aggregates from Natural Sources
for Concrete (Revised), or broken brick conforming to IS: 3068-1965:
Specification for Broken Brick
Coarse
Aggregate
for
Use in Lime
Concrete, or Cinder aggregate conforming to IS: 2686-1964: Specifi-
cations for cinder aggregates for
use
in
lime
concrete,
depending
upon the situation of use.
Similarly, fine
aggregate for use
in lime-
fly ash concrete should
conform to IS: 383-1970:
Specifications
for
Coarse and Fine Aggregates from Natural
Sources for
Concrete or
IS: 3182-1967: Specification for Broken Brick Fine Aggregate for use
in Lime Mortar. Aggregates conforming to IS: 2686-1964 and having
the required grading for fine aggregate as stipulated in IS: 383-1970
may also be considered.
In selecting the
aggregates,
the strength
requirement stipulated in para 4.1. should be kept in view.
3.4.
Water
Water used in-mixing or
curing of
concrete
should be clean
and free from
injurious
amounts
of
deleterious
matter.
Potable
water is generally considered satisfactory for this purpose.
4.
PROPORTIONING OF LIME FLY ASH CONCRETE
4.1.
Mix Design Criteria
To act as a semi-rigid pavement
layer,
lime-fly
ash concrete
should be
designed to give
a minimum
compressive
strength
of
40-60 kg/cm2 at 28 days in the field, as
specified
in
IRC: 15-1970.
As compaction in the field
is done by rolling, workability
should be
kept low, with zero slump.
4.2.
Mix Design
4.2.1.
Like lean cement
concrete,
the
mix
proportions
for
lime-fly ash concrete are
designed by
trial and
error
method.
To
facilitate selection of suitable proportions of the trial mix, particulars
for a few lime-fly ash concrete mixes,
designed with fly
ash having
lime-reactivity of 40-50 kg/cm^ lime of 60 per cent purity, medium
coarse sand, and good quality
crushed
coarse
aggregate of 20 mm
max. size are given in Table
1.

The
maximum
size of the
coarse
aggregate
in
the mix
is
limited by the
thickness of the
lime-fly
ash
concrete
layer
to be
laid, and should generally not
exceed 40 mm for
10 cm
thickness.
For thicknesses exceeding 10 cm, multilayer construction should be
adopted when compaction
is effected through rolling. While
select-
ing trial mix proportions from Table
1,
allowance
should be made
for change in the maximum size and shape of aggregate, as increase
in maximum size of aggregate requires
reduction in
water
content,
change in shape from angular (crushed
aggregate) to
rounded (un-
crushed gravel) requires reduction in both water and sand contents,
and increase or decrease in fineness modulus of sand, a
like change
in sand content.
Significantly lower strength may be expected when
broken brick or
cinder
is
used as
coarse
and/or
fine
aggregate
instead of crushed stone.
As a rough
guide, for
the
stipulated 28
days compressive strength of 40-60
kg/cm^, the
approximate
total
aggregate/binder (lime + fly ash) ratio may be
between
2.5
and 3.5
(by wt.) with water
content about
10-11 per
cent by wt.
of total
dry materials, when crushed stone is used as coarse aggregate.
4.2.2.
To ensure min. 28 day
field
compressive
strength of
40-60
kg/cm^,
allowing
for
process
variances
in
the
field, the
laborarory mix should be designed for 1.25
times the required field
strength.
4.2.3. Wherever practicable, both cube and beam test samples
should be made for the
trial
mixes to
determine
compressive
as
well as fiexural
strength of the mixes.
Where
casting and testing
4



======================================================================
PAGE 9 of 16
======================================================================
IRC
: 60-1976
beam samples is not feasible, only cube
samples for
determination
of compressive strength may be made.
In the
latter case,
flexural
strength of
lime-fly
ash
concrete
(in the
range of 40-60
kg/cm^
compressive strength)
should be
assumed to
be l/6th of
the com-
pressive strength.
The
strength
tests should be conducted as per
relevant Indian Standard specifications for cement concrete.
5.
EQUIPMENTS
5. 1
.
Batching and mixing Equipment for Lime-Fly Ash
Concrete
Batching of materials for lime-fly ash concrete should be done
by weight, and volume
batching may be
permitted only when un-
avoidable. Mixing should be done in power driven
concrete mixers
of adequate capacity.
The stipulations of
IRC: 43-1972
''Recom-
mended Practice for Tools, Equipment and
A.ppliances for Concrete
Pavement Construction" in
respect of
weigh-batchers and
mixers
for concrete pavements should be followed in this case also.
5.2.
Compacting Equipment
Compaction of lime-fly ash
concrete layer in the
field should
be done by means of an 8 to 10 tonne smooth wheel roller for harder
aggregates and 6 to 8 tonne roller for softer aggregates.
Alternati-
vely, vibratory roller of equivalent capacity may also be used.
6.
PREPARATION OF THE SUBGRADE/SUBBASE
The subgrade or
subbase
over which
lime-fly ash
concrete,
layer is to be laid, should be
checked for
line, grade
and
cross-
section, as per provisions of Chapter 7 of IRC
SP-1973:
Handbook
of Quality Control for Construction of
Roads and Runways.
All
irregularities beyond the permitted tolerance should be rectified.
It
should be ensured that
there are no
soft
spots therein.
Soft and
yielding spots and ruts
should be corrected
and rolled
until
firm.
The checking and
rectification of the
underlying layer
should be
done at least 2 days
in
advance of
laying
lime-fly
ash
concrete
thereon.
To
prevent
absorption
of
water
from lime-fly ash concrete,
the
underlying
layer
should
either
be
covered
with water proof
paper or brought to moist condition without free water at the surface
before
laying
lime-fly
ash
concrete.
For
this purpose,
it may be
saturated
with
water not less than 6 hours nor more than 20
hours
in advance of laying lime-fly
ash
concrete,
if
necessary,
followed

\
7.
CONSTRUCTION
7.1
Storage
and Handling of Lime
Lime
should
be
stacked
under
cover in a dry place.
When
slaking
of quick
lime
is
carried
out
at
site,
the
lime should be
left
overnight
for
slaking
to complete and for cooling down.
The
lime so slaked should be used within about a week's
time
to
avoid
carbonation
by
aeration.
If
slaked
lime
is
supplied
in
airtight
bags in dry hydrated form, the period of storage can be longer (upto
3 months).
7.2.
Storage and Handling of Fly Ash
Fly ash, being a very fine material, gets
easily
air-borne.
For
protection
against this,
fly ash may be either bagged or soaked with
water
at
the
top
during
transport,
as well as storage.
When not
bagged,
it may be stored in regular trapezoidal pits dug for the
pur-
pose.
The top surface may
be
either
kept
wet
or
covered
with
tarpaulins.
7.3.
Storage and Handling of Aggregates
The provisions of IRC:
15-1970: Standard
Specifications and
Code
of
Practice
for
Construction of Concrete Roads, Clause
8.2
should
be
followed
in
respect
of
storage
and
handling
of
aggregates.
7.4
Batching and Mixing of Materials
The materials
for making lime-fly ash
concrete mix should be
batched by weight, using approved weigh-batching
equipment,
and
volume batching may be permitted only when
unavoidable.
Water
may
be
measured by volume using calibrated containers.
Propor-
tioning
of
the
constituent
materials
should be as specified on the
basis
of
designed
mix
proportions,
making due allowance for free
moisture absorption in aggregates and moisture present in
lime
and
fly ash.
It has been found that moist fly ash facilitates easy
mixing
to obtain the desired compactibility.
Mixing
should
be
done
in
power driven mixers of approved
type,
and uniform homogeneous mixing of all the ingredients should
be
ensured.
The mixer
should
not
be
overloaded, and adequate
mixing
time (1-2 min.) should be given to ensure uniform mixing.

7.5.
Transportation and Placement of Lime-Fly Ash Concrete
The lime-fly ash concrete should be transported and placed
on
the
prepared subgrade/subbase so that the compacted layer has the
required depth,
slope and camber.
The amount of surcharge requ-
ired
is
about
20-25 per cent
of
the
thickness of layer to be
laid.
The actual amount of surcharge may
be
determined
through
field
trial.
Transportation and placement should be so done
as to avoid
segregation.
Any
portion
of the batch which becomes segregated
during placing should be thoroughly mixed with the main body of the
batch during the process of spreading.
7.6.
Compaction
When sufficient length of lime-fly ash concrete has been laid to
permit rolling, compaction should be done by
rolling
(see para 5.2).
Rolling
should
start from the outer edges of the pavement and pro-
ceed towards the middle except at superelevated
portions
where
it
should commence
at
the
lower
edge
and
progress
towards
the
higher.
Adequate
number of passes should be given to ensure
full
compaction.
The grade and camber of the surface should be checked during
compaction, and
all
irregularities should be corrected by removing
or adding fresh material.
Compaction should be completed within specified period which
shall not exceed 4 hours since the time of mixing as stipulated in
IS:
5817-1970:
Code
of
Practice
for
Preparation
and
Use
of
Lime
Pozzolana Concrete
in
Buildings
and
Roads.
When lime-fly ash
concrete is to be laid
in
two
layers, the second layer should be laid
within 2-3 hours of compaction of the lower layer.
7.7
Joints
No
joints may
be provided
except construction joints at the
end of the day's work, and each successive length taken up
for
roll-
ing.
These should be formed by chamfering the edge of the already
laid
concrete
at an angle of about 30°, and subsequently laying
the
fresh concrete thereon.
7.8.
Curing
After
laying
and compaction of the total thickness of
hme-fly
ash concrete base or sub-base has been completed,
it should be cured
for the first 48 hours by covering
it with wet gunny bags
or
hessian
and subsequently by spreading wet sand
or
watering
frequently
in
moderate
quantities,
but not
by
ponding
as
that
would
lead to

leaching.
Curing should be carried out for not less than 7 days, and
preferably 14 days depending on seasonal and other
considerations.
No
traffic
should
be
allowed
on
the
lime-fly
ash concrete layer
before top courses thereon are placed.
7.9.
Rectification of Surface Irregularities
The
finished
surface
should
be checked for line, level, grade
and
surface
finish.
Provisions of Chapter 7 of IRC SP-1 1-1973:
Handbook
of Quality Control for Construction of Roads and
Run-
ways should be followed for this purpose.
The
checking and recti-
fication
should
be
carried
out while the mix
is still
plastic.
Any
surface
irregularities
left in the hardened layer should be
corrected
by
cutting
out
sufficiently
large
patches
and
relaying
to
speci-
fication.
8.
SURFACE COURSE
Lime-fly ash concrete, being a semi-rigid material, may develop
transverse
cracks on
account
of thermal/drying
shrinkage
effects.
These cracks are likely to get reflected on the surface if the pavement
thickness
over
lime-fly
ash
concrete
is
insufficient.
To
prevent
such
reflection
cracking,
when
lime-fly
ash
concrete
is used as a
base course in flexible pavement construction,
it
is recommended that
an intermediate layer of bitumen bound material should be provided
thereon
before
providing
the
wearing
course,
so as to absorb the
movement of cracks in the hme-fly ash concrete base, and to prevent
their reflection on the surface.
Water
bound macadam may
also
be
considered tentatively in lieu of bitumen bound
materials.
The
minimum
thickness
of
this
intermediate layer plus wearing course
should not be less than 10 cm.
In case of rigid pavement, where lime-fly ash
concrete
is used
as
a
subbase, the cement concrete wearing course can be laid
dire-
ctly thereon without provision of any intermediate
layer,
as
due
to
greater
rigidity
of the cement concrete layer, such cracks from
the
semi-rigid subbase do not get reflected thereon.
9.
QUALITY CONTROL
Quality control of lime-fly ash concrete construction should be
done as per the provisions of IRC SP-1 1-1973: "Handbook
of Qua-
lity Control for Construction of Roads and Runways", in
respect
of
