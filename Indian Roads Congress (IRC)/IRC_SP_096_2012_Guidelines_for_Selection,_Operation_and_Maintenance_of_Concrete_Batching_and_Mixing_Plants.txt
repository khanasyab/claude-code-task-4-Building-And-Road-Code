CONCRETE BATCHING AND MIXING PLANTS
1 INTRODUCTION
1.1
There
has
been
considerable
growth
in
the
construction
of
Concrete
Roads
over
the
last two decades.
To
create awareness among
the
various
stakeholders
like
Consultants, Contractors, Planning and Construction Engineers about the technical
details
of various road construction machinery, a need to prepare document titled "Guidelines for
Selection Operation and Maintenance of Concrete Batching & Mixing Plant" was realized.
This document will help in the Selection, Operation and Maintenance of the plant.
1.2
The growing emphasis on mechanization
in Road
Construction
projects
in
the
country has made
it necessary to create awareness among the various stakeholders
like
consultants, contractors, planning and construction engineers about the technical details of
various road construction machinery. This document covers the details in respect of concrete
batching and mixing plant. The pace of construction of rigid pavements has been on the rise
because of its better performance with minimum maintenance. There is a demand for a higher
volume of quality concrete in a shorter duration to execute mega projects. This has led to the
introduction of Concrete Batching and Mixing plants to meet the requirements of the Road
Construction Projects. A comprehensive document titled "Guidelines for Selection, Operation
and Maintenance of Concrete Batching and Mixing Plants" has been prepared, which will be
helpful
in selecting the appropriate type of plant, better operation of the plant, reducing the
down time and creating awareness about the maintenance aspects of the plant.
St will also be
helpful in production of quality concrete.
It is hoped that this document will serve its intended
purpose.
1.3
The base document was prepared by the Convenor, Mechanization Committee,
(Shri
S.N.
Das)
with
the assistance
of the
officers
of the Mechanical Zone
of MoRTH.
Thereafter, a subcommittee was constituted comprising of Shri Satender Kumar,
Scientist
(Retd.) CRRI to discusss the various issues relating to the preparation of the document. The
meetings of the subcommittee were supervised by the connenor and regularly attended by
Shri Satender Kumar, Scientist (Retd.) CRRI, Shri. S.V. Patwardhan from M/s Madhucon, Shri
Kapil Kumar Jain from M/s Greaves Cotton, Shri Kalpesh Soni from M/s Conmat Systems,
Shri K.C. Sharma EE (Mech) and Shri Jitendra Kumar EE (Mech) MoRT&H. The outcome of
the sub-committee was reviewed by the Connenor along with the officers of the Mechanical
Zone and the final draft document was prepared and circulated among the members of the
Mechanization committee during
its meeting on 03.08.2011 (Personnel given below):

2 BACKGROUND
2.1
In the past, wheel barrows were used to "batch" and load the concrete mixer. Tipping
trucks were used to haul the fine and coarse aggregate to the work site and dump the material
in piles along the roadside. With hand shovel, the workman was loading the material into wheel
barrows: which also served as a volumetric measure to load the skip hoist with two-bags,
in a
stem-powered concrete mixer. Cement bage were loaded by hand into the skip hoist.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:96-2012
2.2
The next step was to reduce labour to achieve volumetric batching during early 1 920s.
Material was piled along roadside and workers used to hand-shovel them into the volumetric
hoppers. A mobile (steel wheels) belt conveyor arrangement was devised with three-or four-
wheeled volumetric hoppers. The pioneer plant manufacturers started to construct aggregate
bins with batch gates and volumetric batchers.
2.3
Between
1 925 and
1 960 there were significant improvements in the fabrication of such
plants. Prior to 1930, volumetric batching was used to proportion the material. This was replaced
by weigh batching with a beam fitted with dial scales, being more accurate in proportioning the
material. The first ready-mix plant was built in the 1930.
2.4
With the increase
in paving capacity the demand of paving concrete also increased.
Mostly stationary plants were designed and constructed for specific application, through modular
concept approach. The plant was divided into three distinct modules: aggregate storage and
batching, cement silos, and the mixer unit.
2.5
In India, the Concrete Plants were introduced in 1970's and their use was restricted
to major construction projects. Bhakra Dam was the first project where RMC was used. Later
on Concrete Plants were used for other large projects such as construction of long span
bridges, industrial complexes etc. In 1993, first Concrete Batching and Mixing Plant was used
for NH-2 Delhi-Mathura Road concrete pavement project of the Ministry of Road Transport
and Highways.
2.6
Modern concrete plants employ computer aided control system
to assist
in
fast,
accurate measurement of input ingredients, as well as to synthesize the various parts and
accessories for coordinated and safe operation. With the performance of concrete being
dependent on accurate water measurement, systems
will
often use
moisture probes
to
measure the amount of water that
is part of the aggregate (sand and coarse aggregates)
while
it is being weighed, and then automatically compensate to account for in mix design for
water target. The plant can be supplied for virtually any type of batching, whether wet, dry, and
half-wet or slurry (colloidal).
3 PURPOSE
3. 1
Infrastructure development has resulted in increase in the demand for quality concrete.
The two main
criteria determining the quality of concrete are
its strength and durability. The
process of achievement of strength and durability of concrete begins with
its production. The
ease with which quality control measures can be implemented at the production stage
is not
available in later stages of transportation and placement of concrete.
3.2
Ready-mix concrete is a type of concrete that is manufactured in a factory or in batching
plant, according to a set recipe, and then delivered to the work site. A Concrete Batching and
Mixing Plant, combines various ingredients like sand, water, aggregates, chemical and mineral
admixtures (fly ash, plasticizer etc), and cement by weight to form concrete. Capacity of the plant
is measured
in cum per hour.
It depends upon capacity of mixer, number of mixers, charging,
mixing and discharge time of each mixer. The purpose of Concrete Batching and Mixing Plant
is to produce homogenous and uniform concrete, as indicated by physical properties such as
unit weight, slump, air content, and strength in individual batches and successive batches of the
same mix proportions.

(a)
Stationary Plants
: Stationary plants are central mix plants. A central mix plant consist
of batching facility and a mixer which completely mixes the concrete before discharging
it into
a dump truck, agitator truck, mixer truck, conveyor or some other means of transporting the
concrete to the work site
. Central-mix plant is sometimes referred to as wet batch plant. Principal
advantages of the central-mix plants are as under:
•
higher production capability
•
better concrete quality control and consistency,
•
reduced wear on the truck mixer drums.
Concrete material
is batched
into three groups. One group
is the aggregate group,
and another
is the cementitious material group
(like
fly ash,). The material
is either weighed
individually or cumulatively. Water and admixtures comprise the third group.
In many central
mixing plants, the batching is done by computerized control system.
Fig. 1 Central Mix Concrete Plant
Transit mixers or truck mixers are used to transport concrete from the concrete batching
and mixing plant to the work site.

======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 72
======================================================================
IRC:SP:96-2012
Transit mixer has a revolving drum with the axis inclined to the horizontal. Inside the shell of the
mixer drum are pair of blades or fins that wrap in a helical (spiral) configuration from the head to
the opening of the drum. This configuration enables the concrete to mix when the drum spins in
one direction and causes
it to discharge when the direction of spin is reversed. The mixing drum
can rotate at different rotational speeds: at the highest speed while being filled or emptied, at
a lower speed during mixing and at the lowest speed during travel. For this reason a hydraulic
drive
is commonly used for rotation of the drum. After the concrete
is loaded,
it
is normally
hauled to the work site with the drum rotations at a speed in the range of 2 to 6 rpm.
The factor limiting the distance over which concrete mix can be transported by the Transit mixers
is the setting time, determined mainly by the ambient temperature, temperature of the mix and
the type of cement. Concrete should be delivered and discharged to maintain onsite quality
control
. For further details IS:4926: 2003 may be referred.
(b)
Mobile Concrete Batching and Mixing Plant: The trailer-mounted mobile concrete
batching and
mixing
plant carries cement,
sand, and coarse aggregates
in
different
bins.
The cement
is carried
in a separate bin located across the rear of the unit, and the sand and
aggregates are carried on each side of the unit. Water
is carried
in a single tank mounted
in
front of the aggregate bins and
is pumped to the mix auger. Under the normal circumstances,
concrete pump
is used to pour concrete at the delivery
site. However,
if the delivery site
is
beyond the reach of the concrete pump, concrete
is transferred to the site
in a transit mixer.
Concrete is poured in a Transit mixer with the help of a concrete conveyor. Sand and aggregates
are accurately proportioned by weight or volume and dropped one after the other with cement
from the material feed system into the charging end of the mix auger/conveyor at the rear of
the unit. At this point, a pre-determined amount of water enters the mix auger. The action of this
combined auger and paddle homogenizer mixes the ingredients and water rapidly, thoroughly,
and continuously to produce the concrete of uniform quality. The material mixing action
is a
continuous process that can proceed
until the aggregate bins are empty. On the other hand,
mixing and delivery may be stopped at any time and then started again as per requirement
.
These are often used for pouring sideways and other applications where concrete is needed in
multiple areas for small works.

•
State of the art control system designed for in house concrete production.
•
Discharging of concrete directly into pump hopper.
•
Less load helps keeping the electricity costs lower.
•
Very low operation and maintenance costs.
Limitations of Mobile Concrete Batching and Mixing Plant:
1
.
Capacity of mobile concrete batching plant is low.
2.
Low discharge height and
it is difficult to pour directly into transit mixer.
It can be done
by the use of concrete conveyer.
3.
Storage capacity of aggregate is limited
4.
Wastage of Aggregate due to frequent shifting of the plant.
4.2
Classification Based on Type of Batcher:
Batching controls are the part of the batching equipment that provides means for operating
the batching device for an individual material. They may be mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic,
electrical, etc. or a combination of these means. A batching system is a combination of batching
devices and batching controls necessary for the accurate and consistent batching of concrete
ingredients
in the desired
proportions. Normally a batching system would
include batching
devices and controls for cementitious material, aggregates, water and admixtures. Some may
not include admixture
if they are not used at the plant or may not have batching equipment for
water
if
it is entirely batched through the truck mixer water system.
Weigh Batcher Controls
: Cementitious material and aggregates must be batched by weight;
water and admixtures may be batched
in a weigh batcher or by volume measured by a flow
meter.
(a)
Manual Control
: Manual weigh-batcher control exists when the batching devices
are actuated manually. The accuracy of the batching operation
is dependent on the operator's
observation of the scale.
(b)
Semi-Automatic
: In semi automatic plant except weighment of the Aggregate, water,
cement and admixtures,
all other operations are controlled manually. By using digital display
meters,
load
cells, junction
box, pneumatic controlled
gates, the weighing
of the concrete
ingredients are done automatically and rest
i.e. starting up the motors, controlling the mixing
time, discharging the concrete into truck or transit mixers are done manually.
The semi-automatic controls are further classified into the following two types.
(i)
Semi-Automatic
Control
:
When
actuated
by
one
or
more
starting
mechanisms, a semi-automatic weigh-batcher control shall start the weighing
operation of the material and stop the flow automatically when the designated
weight has been reached. No interlocks are required.
(ii)
Semi-Automatic Interlocked Control
: When actuated by one or more starting
mechanisms, a semi-automatic interlocked weigh-batcher control shall start
7



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 72
======================================================================
IRC:SP:96-2012
the weighing operation of the material and stop the flow automatically when
the designated weight has been reached.
It shall be interlocked to assure
that the discharge mechanism cannot be opened until the weight is within the
tolerance limit.
(c)
Automatic Control
: When actuated by a single starting signal, an automatic weigh-
batcher control shall
start the weighing operation of cementitious material, aggregate, water,
or admixture, and stop the flow automatically when the designated weight/volume has been
reached.
It will also do all the operations like starting of all the motors at right time, mixing and
discharging of concrete etc. automatically.
It shall be interlocked to ensure that:
(i)
the charging gate or valve cannot be opened
until the scale has returned to
zero balance within -0.3 per cent of scale capacity.
(ii)
the charging gate or valve cannot be opened
if the discharge mechanism
is
open.
(iii)
the discharge mechanism cannot be actuated
if the charging gate or valve is
open; and
(iv)
the discharge mechanism cannot be actuated
until the weight of material
is
within the tolerance limit.
Automatic control provides greater accuracy for High speed production than any of the above
type of weigh batcher controls.
Volumetric Batching Controls for water and admixture
: This pertains to the controls
used for measurement of admixtures in a volumetric admixture dispenser or the measurement
of water with a water meter or a volumetric batcher tank.
(i)
Manual Control
: Manual volumetric control for water or admixture exists when
the volumetric measuring device is actuated manually with the accuracy of the
measuring operation being dependent on the operator's visual observation of
a volumetric indicator (such as a digital meter display or a sight gauge) and
manual cut-off of the flow at the desired volume. The flow of liquid may be
controlled manually, or by pneumatic, hydraulic, or electrical power.
(ii)
Automatic Control
: When actuated by a single starting signal, an automatic
volumetric
control
shall
start the measuring
operation and
stop
the
flow
automatically when the designated volume has been reached.
4.3.
Classification Based on type of Mixer:
Based on mixing technique mixers are classified as (a) Drum mixer or free fall mixers or gravity
mixers
( b) power mixers. The size of mixer is measured by volume. Manufacturers commonly
categorize mixers by nominal volume or drum size rather than by the "total volume" or the "dry
charge". The nominal volume
is the maximum batch capacity, the output of mixer. The total
volume of the dry charge is the maximum volume of unmixed ingredients which the drum can
hold. Maximum batch capacity is commonly two-thirds of total drum volume.
(a)
Drum Mixer
:
This
is also called as free fall mixer or gratify mixer.
In this type of mixer, concrete
is mixed by
lifting the ingredients with the help of fixed blades inside a rotating drum and then dropping the

material by overcoming the friction between the mixture and the blades. The drum of the mixer
can be filled and emptied by changing its direction of rotation, opening
it, or tipping
it up. Rotation
speed must carefully follow machine-specific instructions and should not be too fast so that the
free fall of the mixture is not interrupted by the centrifugal force. The drum mixer suits concretes
that are not too stiff, usually with a slump, upto 50 mm is commonly used on construction sites.
Truck mixers also use freefall mixing. Since the ingredients in a free fall mixer fall from height,
there is some attrition of aggregates.
This type of mixer is used for producing large volume of concrete. These mixers are noted for
having high production speeds, low maintenance, and ideal for slump concrete.
This drum mixer is available in the following three forms:-
(i) tilting mixers
(
ii) reversible mixers
(iii) non - tilting mixers

(i)
Tilting Mixers:
Tilting mixers are usually trailer-mounted or otherwise portable, small to mid-size mixers, used
either as main concrete mixing equipment on small sites or as ancillary equipment on sites
served by concrete plant. The drum has two axes: one around which the drum rotates and
another that serves to change from loading and mixing position (drum opening up) to discharging
position (drum opening down). This position change
is done manually by a dump wheel
(or
handle, in the smaller mixers), while drum rotation is electric, gasoline, or diesel powered. Drums
are traditionally made of steel, but polyethylene drums for easier cleaning are now offered.
Most mixers are of the side-dump type, but end-dump mixers are also manufactured. Material
is generally loaded manually,
directly into the drum. There are larger-size self-loading units
equipped with a
tilting hopper. After being filled manually at ground level, the hopper
is tilted
up mechanically and dumps the material
into the drum. A built-in mechanical drag shovel to
facilitate aggregate loading into the hopper is optional in some models.

Discharging the mixer
Fig. 5 Cross Section of Tilting Mixer
Fig. 6 Tilting Mixer
The drum
is conical
or bowl shaped with
internal vanes and the discharge
is
rapid and
unsegregated so that these mixers are suitable for mixes of low workability and for those
containing
larger size aggregate. The drum axis usually stays
at an angle of 15 degree
from
horizontal during mixing.
Tilt mixer offers consistent mixing with lower operating and
maintenance cost. Tilting drum
is the most common type of drum mixers for small batches.
Tilting mixers can handle larger size aggregates more easily and will discharge mixed concrete
rapidly than a non tilting mixer.

IRC:SP:96-2012
(ii)
Reversible Mixers:
The reversible drum mixer is similar to the non tilting mixer except that the same opening is used
to add the constituents and to discharge the aggregate. The drum on a reversible mixer has
one horizontal axis around which
it rotates. In mixing position, the drum rotates in one direction;
while for discharging, the rotation
is reversed. Commonly self-loading, reversible mixers are
mid-size to large-size units mounted on a two-or four-wheeled trailer for transportation between
sites. The mixer
is equipped with a tilting hopper similar to that occasionally found on a tilting
mixer, or with a hoist-like hopper that moves up and down on a short inclined set of rails and
that dumps the ingredients through a bottom opening into the drum. A built-in mechanical skip
to facilitate aggregate loading into the hopper is optional on many models. Most models of this
mixer type are equipped with a water tank and meter, and optionally (the larger models) with a
built-in aggregates batcher.
(iii)
Non-tilting mixers
A non tilting drum mixer is one in which the axis of the mixer is always horizontal, and discharge
takes place by inserting a chute into the drum or by reversing the direction of rotation of drum.
Because of slow rate of discharge, some segregation may occur. There are two openings, one
at each end of the drum: one for feeding the ingredients, the other for discharging the mixture.

Power Mixers: Power mixers, also known as forced mixers, or compulsory mixers, mix
concrete by rapid rotary motion of paddles (or mixer heads) moving in centric or eccentric courses
inside the mixing drum. To prevent the concrete from sticking to the drum sides and bottom, some
of the paddles must constantly clean the concrete off the sides and bottom and
redirect
it to
the drum center. The intensive mixing also causes excessive wear to drum surface, which
is
not present
in free
fall mixers. To prevent this wear, the inside of the drum
is lined with small,
easily replaceable plates that are made of specialized abrasion resistant material. The mixing
output of power mixer
is higher than free
fall mixers. Power mixers can also handle extra dry
mixtures unmanageable by free fall mixers. They have either one or two mixing shafts that impart
significantly higher horsepower in mixing than the typical drum mixer. The intensity of the mixing
action is somewhat greater than that of the
tilt drum mixer. There is also no danger of attrition as
the ingredients are not made to fall from gravity. The softer aggregates can also be used.
Power Mixers are classified as follows:
(i)
Vertical Shaft Mixers or Pan Mixers
(ii)
Horizontal Shaft Mixers or Trough Mixers
(i)
Vertical Shaft Mixers or Pan Mixers:
A pan mixer
is a forced-action mixer.
It consists of a
cylindrical or annular pan
(fixed or
rotating) shaped drum contains the concrete to be mixed, while the blades rotate inside the
pan around vertical axis to mix the material and a blade suspended with the inner wall of
the pan scrapes the wall of the pan. The shapes of the blades and axis of rotation vary. Pan
mixers are available in six types e.g., turbo concrete mixers, planetary concrete mixers, turbo
planetary concrete mixers, countercurrent operation concrete mixers, concurrent operation
concrete mixers, and concrete mixers with high speed stirrer. These days, the first three types
12



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 72
======================================================================
IRC:SP:96-2012
of concrete mixers
i.e. turbo concrete mixers,
planetary concrete mixers, turbo planetary
concrete mixers are commonly used.
(a)
Turbo Concrete Mixers:
In turbo mixers the vertical shaft is fixed and located in the
centre of the drum. There are models in which (1 ) the drum is stationary while all paddles rotate,
in the same direction, (2) the drum is stationary but paddles rotate in counter directions, (3) both
drum and paddles rotate
in counter direction. The turbo mixers upto 60 cum per
hr. capacity
are available with the manufacturers.
It can handle upto 40 mm aggregate. Turbo Mixers are
suitable for ready mix concrete and Pre-cast products performing better on wet mixes. They are
easily discharged and can be used for coloured mixes. They are simple mechanically and they
need less maintenance.
Fig. 9 Turbo Mixer
(b)
Planetary Concrete Mixers:
In planetary mixers, the vertical shaft
is rotary and
located eccentrically
in the stationary drum. Due to this the intensity of mixing
is increased.
Planetary mixers are generally used to mix material
in a fast manner and utilize the multiple
discharge gates to serve multiple production lines. The planetary mixer has one or two mixing
stars that rotate themselves while also rotating around a central point, allowing each arm to
cover the whole mixer floor in a number of revolutions. This powerful mixing action
is both
fast and thorough, resulting
in lowering of the mixing time. The result
is more production of
concrete per hour for the same size plant, as well as better consistency and greater strength
or, saving on cement. These are used for precast concrete and dry mixes, self compacting
concrete, coloured concrete mixes, specially high strength, wet and dry mortar. This mixer
is efficient
in handling
stiff and cohesive mixes. Planetary Mixer
is the best choice for Pre-
cast products and dry mixes. They are designed for high speed homogenization. Cleaning
towards the end of the shift is easy. Due to their low height they are also used in mobile Ready
Mix plants. They need medium maintenance but they require proper blade adjustment. The

Horizontal Shaft Mixers
Horizontal Shaft Mixers are also known as Trough mixers. Horizontal shaft mixers are
of two types.
(a)
Single Shaft Mixer
(b)
Twin Shaft Mixer
(a)
Single Shaft Mixer: This
is a power mixer which has a trough-shaped drum
(i.e.
resembling a horizontally placed
barrel cut by
half). The single shaft mixer has horizontal
shaft onto which the paddles are connected
in a spiral-like arrangement;
in some models,
wave shaped mixing arms replace the paddles. The combination of radial (rotary) and axial
(horizontal) movements obtained produces a three dimensional
circular path
that further
increases mixing intensity and therefore results in short mixing time. Some single shaft mixer
models are used in central mixing plants as climbing mixers; the drum moves up on an inclined

is accompanied by tilting the drum at the top of
the truck.

(b)
Twin Shaft Mixer: A twin shaft mixer has two parallel horizontal shafts with end
scrappers. The mixing technique
is similar to single shaft
mixer,
but due
to high degree
of turbulence developed
in the intersection zone of the two mixing
circles,
better mixture
homogeneity is effectively achieved with minimum mixing time. Additionally, due to the design
of the twin shaft mixer and
build up of the mix between the shafts, wear
is considerably
reduced as compared to single shaft horizontal mixer and pan type mixer. Because the mixing
15



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 72
======================================================================
IRC:SP:96-2012
occurs in free space above the mixer floor, the wear on the liner plates are very low. Only thirty
percent of the tiles or liners are subjected to wear. Hence maintenance cost is low.
The powerful twin-shaft mixer, with counter rotating shafts, delivers fast and homogeneous
mixing action, and rapid, complete discharge and handles mix designs with coarse aggregates
Fig. 12(i) Twin Shaft Blades and Shaft
Fig. 12(H) Twin Shaft Blades and Shaft
may be upto 150 mm size. Twin shaft mixers are used for production of large quantities of
concrete
in a very short time period. They are also commonly used for mixing high strength
concrete. Twin shaft mixers upto 240 cum per hr. are available.

Advantage of Twin Shaft Mixer:
•
Suitable for Mass production.
•
Capacity varies from
1 to 8 cubic meter per batch.
•
Optimum filling level due to exceptionally large mixing area.
•
Uniform distribution of fine and coarse aggregates and water.
•
Fast homogenization, uniform quality of mix, faster discharge without segregation.
•
Low wear and maintenance.
•
Suitable for mixing of large grain size aggregates.
Limitations of Twin Shaft Mixers:
Twin shaft mixers require more time for cleaning at the end of the shift compared to
other mixer types.
•
Twin shaft mixer does not empty completely during batches and thus
is not
recommended for several colour mix.
•
Twin shaft mixers are not recommended for dry mix or waterless mixtures.
( In
such a case, planetary (vertical shaft) mixers are suggested.

Types of Controls:
The following two types of controls are available in concrete Batching & Mixing Plant
(a)
Manual control
(b)
Computer and Programmable Logic Control
( PLC)
a)
Manual Control:
It allows to control all actuators of the concrete-mixing plant by hand.
Manual control systems are those systems in which all the activities are manually controlled.
Its
use is anticipated only for emergencies, when the computer and PLC control
is out of order.
In
such systems, the collection of material is flow based.
b)
Computer and PLC (Programmable Logic Control) Control: The concrete batching
and mixing plant fitted with PLC facilitates the complete control and interlocks for operating the
system in auto mode.
It improves the productivity of the plant to a great extent and provides a
17

IRC:SP:96-2012
foolproof method of producing the right mix.
It can be operated by even a semi-skilled operator,
and at the same time, avoids any chance of wrong doings by interlocks. The supervision of
operations is done by the Programmable Logic Control (PLC) and the control, operator interface
and report generation
is done by the computer.
The batch control unit of the system ensures only the exact set quantity of the ingredients
is
fed into the process,
first time and each time. The PLC assures the quality of the mix and at
the same time avoids the wastage of the raw material. This system automatically re-feeds the
aggregates
if there is shortage of weight, warns
if there is overweight.

The instantaneous weight in the weigh hoppers are displayed on the batch controllers and the
annunciations on the computer gives working condition of each equipment at any given point
of time. Any malfunction or fault in the operation can be identified from the custom engineered
computer screen, which makes the rectification quick and easy. The various sensors and limit
switches provides the necessary feedback signal to the PLC. The PLC is again connected to
the computer and the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) software controls the
functioning. The SCADA package makes the PLC flexible and user friendly. The annunciations
like operating conditions; fault indications etc. can be very easily displayed on the computer
screen with the help of SCADA. The software makes the data storage and printout very flexible
and easy. The live weight of the ingredient in the weigh hoppers are continuously upgraded on
the computer along with the operating status of equipments.
The recipes can be entered from the computer. The history of all the batches is stored, and is
available for printout. The daily, monthly and yearly report are available for print.
The automation of Concrete Batching and Mixing Plant comprises of the load
cells, batch
controllers, PLC with SCADA package and
software,
control desk. The main function
of
this equipment
is to produce the right grade mix
in the fastest possible time. The Concrete
Batching and Mixing Plant comprises of storage bunker for various raw material, aggregate
weigh hopper, skip hoist, cement weigh hopper, storage silos and feeding screw conveyors,
weigh tanks and storage tanks for water and admix along with feeding and discharge devices,
mixer
etc. The raw material
like aggregate, sand
dust, cement, water and admixure are
initially loaded into the storage hoppers. The material from storage bunkers for the aggregate,
sand and dust are extracted through sector gates. The extracted material
is collected at a
weigh hopper below as per the preset recipe, before discharging into the skip hoist. The skip
hoist delivers material to the mixer. From the storage into silo, the cement is extracted to the
cement weigh hopper through the screw conveyor depending on the recipe value. Similarly,
the required quantity of water and admix also are collected separately at the weigh hoppers.
These weighed raw material
is then discharged
into the mixer as per the preset sequence.
The operations like the mixing time and sequence of operations are controlled by the PLC.
The quantity of material to be fed from each hopper is set prior to the operation. The setting
can be done as recipe on the computer. The required recipe for the mix can be selected from
the memory or new values can be entered in the blank recipe format. The load indicator units
on the control desk sends the weight data continuously to the PLC in the form of 4-20 mA and
the PLC controls the feeding gates and screw conveyor at the bottom of the storage hoppers.
Once the correct weight quantity
is achieved, the weigh hoppers discharge sequentially into
the mixer. The mixer is run for a certain preset period of time and then empties the material
into the truck.
The load cells are mounted on support frame, which
in turn
is bolted to the weigh hoppers.
There are at least four weigh hoppers in the system one each for aggregates, cement, water
and admix.

The aggregate weigh conveyor
is mounted on load
cells, whereas the cement and water
weigh hoppers are also supported on load cells and admix on single load
cell. These load
cells are having parallel termination onto a junction box. From each junction box, a single
four Core shielded cable connects to the corresponding load indicator on the control panel.
There are four load indicators in the control panel corresponding to four weigh hoppers. The
load
cells give
milli
volt (mV) signal corresponding to the load applied. These signals are
amplified at the load indicator converted to digital, processed and then displayed as weight
data. The weight data
is transferred to the PLC and as per the recipe settings, the relays are
energised. These control relays in turn operate the field devices viz. pneumatically operated
gates, screw conveyor and ball valves. Limit switch inputs are used for various inter-locks to
make the system fool proof. Additional controls and data regarding batch time, date, individual
raw material weight etc.,
is provided at the computer.

5 COMPONENTS OF CONCRETE BATCHING AND MIXING PLANTS
5.1
Storage Equipments:
The storage equipment consists of aggregate storage, cement storage, water storage and
admixture storage.
Aggregates Storage:
Aggregates storage components should be of adequate size to accommodate the productive
capacity of the
plant. Storage bins
shall be provided
for different sizes of fine and coarse
aggregates. Sand bin should be equipped with vibrator for free flow of sand.
The aggregate bins should be designed so that material can not hang up in the bins or spill from
one compartment to the other. Graded aggregate shall be provided in the bins.
There are three types of aggregate storage systems
(a)
Star Type
(b)
Mushroom Type
(c
)
Inline Bin Type
(a)
Star Type:
In Star type aggregate storage system, five walls are fabricated at site.
The star batchers are attached to the backside of the batching plant
in which, various sizes
of aggregates are stored with partitions
. Drag
line with a rotating boom cabin
is provided to
accumulate the aggregates towards the pouring point.

(b)
Mushroom Type: In mushroom type aggregate storage system, four bins are attached
to the back side of the batching plant which is used to store the various types of aggregates. To
feed the aggregates two methods are used:
(i)
Using wheel loader with Ramp
(ii)
Using belt Conveyor.
(c)
Inline Bin Type:
In the inline bin type, four pre-fabricated bins are assembled one
behind the other on the back side of the batching plant as a separate unit.
To feed the aggregate, two methods are used. One
is using wheel loader with ramp. Another
method
is using belt conveyor.
In this type, Belt conveyor is used to send the aggregates from bin to Skip bucket.

Fig. 20 Inline Compartment Type Batching Plant.
Silo Type Aggregate Storage System:
The aggregates can be stored
in
silos positioned above the mixing
unit or
in bins near the
concrete plant. This type of aggregate storage is used in higher capacity batching plants.
STORAGE OF CEMENTS:
Cements Storage are of two types
1
.
Godown storage

Silo Storage
1.
Godown Storage:
In godown storage type cement is stored
in bags. The cement is
sent to the cement weighing hoppers using manual feeding through screw conveyor or bucket
elevators.
2.
Silo Storage: In higher capacity plants i.e. 30 cum or above, the said system (through
manual unloading of cement bags)
is not able to provide the continuous feed of the cement to
the plant and thus the full capacity of the plant is not utilized.
In such cases 100 MT or above
capacity of cement silo which are air tight, are attached to the plant for supplying uninterrupted
cement to the plant. Cement stored
in bags or carried to the plants in mobile cement bunkers
are unloaded
in these silos by using low pressure pneumatic cement pumps. Also the cement
bags are cut by using Bag slitting machines. The main component of the Slitting machine and
the cement pumps are as follows:-

Cement silos can be used as large amount of storage solutions. Cement Silos are vertical
tanks used to store bulk material as a reservoir. Cement silo can be a stable configuration, or
a transportable type that can be transferred when necessary. Like many other types of silos,
the cement silo usually is equipped with a blower to help in expelling the stored contents into
the receptacle. The permanent and the portable cement silo are generally set with various
types of blowers. The blower makes
it simpler to emit the product from the silo. Blowers are
frequently driven by power, although there are types that use propane or even gasoline for
operation. Blower equipment with the portable silos takes
little time to set up, and can also
be stored easily when not
in use. Highest quality cement silos are manufactured by using
laser cutting technique and special equipments with high sensitivity. The interior of cement
silos should be smooth, with a minimum bottom slope of 50 degrees. Bolted type cement
silos which are manufactured
in different capacities, provide great advantages especially
in
transportation.
Following accessories are essential for a cement silo

is separated from the air flow by filter elements and can be re- introduced into the silos by an
integrated automatic compressed air cleaning system.
2.
Level Indicator: This device is used for level monitoring in silos.
It is used to monitor
the level of cement and gives indication to the operator, such as top level and bottom level.
For each level, one level indicator will be used.

Pressure Relief Valve: On top of silos pressure relief valve are installed.
Its main
function
is to avoid overpressure and negative pressure which prevent problems that could
severely damage both silo and filter.

Vibrator/Aeration System: Vibrator Bin aerators combine aeration and vibration
which favours material flowfrom silos in an efficient way. Fluidization pads offer high performance
in partial pulse jet fluidization. Both type can be used individually or in combination. These are
usually fitted on the bottom cone of the silos.

Storage of Water: Water is stored in separate lined tanks and is supplied using water pump to
the batching plant.
Storage of Chemicals: Chemicals are stored
in tanks supplied by the manufacturers. These
chemicals are conveyed to plant by using a special pump supplied by the plant manufacture.
5.2
Batching Equipment
Batching by weight
is the best and most accurate method. Therefore, load
cells are used
and weigh-batching of cement, aggregates and admixtures
is done. Even water is added by
weight with the use of a pulse meter or water gauge. Cement hopper is a self-cleansing type
and is connected to the mixing unit through a hose to avoid any pollution. For higher capacity
plant, cement hopper
is also equipped with vibrator for free flow of cement. The types of
aggregates to be used need to be pre-decided as their number affects the concrete plant
specifications. The maximum size of aggregates is also required to be fixed. When there are
frequent changes
in plant locations, a compartment type batcher
is preferred. The weighing
hoppers should be manufactured so as to discharge efficiently and prevent the buildup of
material. Dust seals should be provided on cement hoppers between the loading mechanism
and weigh hopper.
Weigh Batcher:
•
Weigh Batchers should be charged with easily operated clam shell or undercut radial
type.
•
Gates used
to charge the semi automatic or automatic batchers should be power
operated and equipped with a suitable control to allow the desired weighing accuracy.
•
Load Cells: Load
cells are designed to resist the moisture, dust, leakage, damage
from overload, drift from high voltage to high temperature, line noise or radio frequency
interference.
The batchers are vented to permit the escape of air.
It shall be self cleaning and may be fitted
with the vibrator to ensure complete discharge.

is used for weighing the admixture accurately before feeding
into the mixer.
It consists of weighing jar suspended with load
cell, where the admixture
is
collected and transferred to the mixer for mixing.

5.3.
Conveying Equipment:
The concrete batching and mixing plant
is equipped with a mixer discharge hopper with a
rubber hose to
fill the transit mixers, feeder skip, belt conveyor and screw conveyor of suitable
diameter for cement with lengths generally varying from 6 to
1 2 m. The aggregate and sand as
conveyed to the top of the bins shall be charged by a power-operated or manually operated in
the case of smaller plants, centrally revolving heavy duty chute mounted on central pivot and
capable of operation from the top of bins.
The screw conveyor body and the screw is generally manufactured from heavy duty 'C class
pipe and the flutes are fabricated from thick plate. Running clearances are provided between
body and flutes for smooth running. The screw
is supported on both ends by bearing and at
center by hanger bearing having renewable hard bush. The screw conveyor is provided with
suitable vertical supports.
It is a system which transfers the material to the mixer after weighing of aggregates. Various
types of conveying systems are used. Few conveying equipments are illustrated below:-

Mixing Equipment
The mixing equipment used for mixing concrete ingredients play a vital role in deciding
the quality of concrete produced. For small capacity batching plants, pan or drum type
mixers are used while for large capacity plants, twin shaft mixers are most suitable.
The basic requirements of the mixers are as under:
1.
The shaft end should be sealed by oil pressure and mechanism,
(for twin shaft
mixers only).
2.
Concrete mixer should be designed with oversized discharge gate that is controlled
by an advanced hydraulic/pneumatic system. Thus, the cycle time
is shortened
for quick production.
31



======================================================================
PAGE 40 of 72
======================================================================
IRC:SP:96-2012
3.
Mixing arms, blades and liners should be made of wear-resistant alloys with high
hardness and toughness, so that concrete mixing equipment has a long service
life.
4.
Pressurized water spraying system
shall be used
in
high capacity plants
for
conveying of water.
5.
The motor used for driving the mixer should have sufficient power to mix the
ingredients of required capacity.
6.
Concrete mixers with elastically suspended mixing blade arms are better suited
for the purpose
of using
large
size coarse aggregates than those with
rigid
suspension of the mixing blade arms.
7.
Environmental Compatibility: The design of the upper cover of the mixer should
protect the environment against cement dust emission and concrete mix splashing.
The seal of discharge gate should prevent concrete mix leakage.
8.
The use
of hydraulic torque converters
prevents
drive system overload and
ensures a smooth start of the rotation of agitators as the mixer is filled.
It acts as
a protection against agitator drive system overload. Also elastic suspension of
mixing blades protects the drive from overloading and deformation of the mixing
blade arms.
9.
Several suitably arranged water nozzles ensures that concrete
is quickly mixed
homogenously.
1 0. The concrete mixer dimensions should be suitable for transport on public roads.

.
Better equipped mixers have a mixer trough covering, hinged cover in the covering,
safety switch for automatic stoppage of mixer on opening the hinged cover, and a
sight flap, inspection window.
5.5.
Control Systems
The use of
fully automatic micro computer control system ensures, complete
control over
concrete production.
It can give directions for aggregate, cement, water and admixtures as per
mix design normally stored in
its memory. Control systems allow switching over to the manual
system also. An emergency cut-off is also available
if erroneous entries have been made. Digital
display for
all weighing systems for cement, water, admixture and aggregate are part of the
control system.
Digital weighing indicators provide the interface between the load
cell scales
and the computer. The number of batches released and pending production can be viewed on
the control panel. Batch log print-outs can also be issued by
it. The control panel also has the
facility of moisture correction for sand and accordingly, automatic reduction in quantity of water
can be done. Control systems are facilitated with under and over voltage tripping
facility to
protect control panel.
Advantage of fully automatic control system:
production
increases
the
production
to
cope
with
the
requirement
of
concrete.

Automatic Wash Out System
Cleaning of mixers
is necessary to produce quality mixes and prevent premature component
wear.

without cement and operate the mixer for a minute and discharge into truck. This activity
is
repeated at least three times and after that mixer is washed by water.

6.2.1
Handling and Storage of Ingredients
Proper storage practices are critical to protect material from intermingling, contamination, or
degradation, and to maintain consistent aggregate gradation throughout a project. Aggregates
have a natural tendency to segregate whenever loaded, natural deposits consist of gravel and
sand that can be transported, or otherwise disturbed. Aggregates should be used in concrete
after minimal processing. The aggregates should always be handled and stored by a method
that minimizes segregation. To produce concrete of high quality, aggregates should be clean,
hard, strong, durable and round or cubical in shape. Fine aggregates that are transported over
wet, unimproved haul roads can become contaminated with clay lumps. The source of this
contamination
is usually accumulation of mud between tyres and mud flaps that is dislodged
during dumping of the transporting unit. Clay lumps or clay balls can usually be removed from
the fine aggregates by placing a scalping screen over the batch plant bin.
The bottom of an overhead charging
bin should always slope at least 50 degrees towards
the center outlet.
If the slope
is less than 50 degrees, segregation will occur as the material
is
discharged. When a bin is being charged, the material should be dropped from a point directly
over the outlet. Material dropped
in at an angle or discharged against the sides of the bin will
segregate. Since a long drop causes both segregation and the breakage of aggregate particles,
the length of a drop into a bin should be kept to a minimum by keeping the bin as full as possible
at ail times. Also, keep storage bins as full as possible to minimize breakage and changes in
grading as material is withdrawn. Oversize aggregate should not enter the bin.
34



======================================================================
PAGE 43 of 72
======================================================================
IRC:SP:96-2012
Oldest cement should be used first.
In case, the cement remains in storage for more than 3
months, the cement should be retested before use and should be rejected
if
it fails to conform
to any of the requirements. Portland cement
is a moisture-sensitive material that must be
protected from damp air or moisture. Cement not protected when in storage sets more slowly
because hydration has already begun; therefore,
it has less strength than portland cement that
is kept dry. Cement compartment shall be watertight and provided with necessary air vent;
aeration fittings for proper flow of cement and emergency cement cut off gate. Fugitive dust
should be controlled during loading and transferring. The dust control system of silo shall be
of sufficient size to allow delivery of cement to be maintained at a specified pressure, and shall
be properly maintained to prevent undue emission of cement dust and prevent interference
with weighing accuracy by the build up of pressure.
Water is generally stored in tanks located close to the plant. An adequate water supply should
be provided and when stored on the plant, such storage facilities shall be designed to minimize
the risk of contamination.
Most chemical admixtures are delivered
in
liquid form and should be
protected
against
freezing.
If liquid admixtures are frozen, they should be properly blended before they are used
in concrete. Long term storage of liquid admixtures should be avoided. Evaporation of the
liquid could adversely affect the performance of admixture. Tanks or drums containing liquid
admixtures should be clearly labeled for identification purposes and stored
in such a way to
avoid damage, contamination or effects of prolonged exposure to sunlight
(if applicable).
6.2.2.
Batching
Batching
is the process of measuring concrete mix ingredients either by volume or by weight
and introducing them into the mixer. Accurate proportioning or batching of these material as
per approved mix design
is essential to produce concrete with satisfactory properties. The
first step to achieve proper proportioning is to have all the weighing and measuring equipment
properly calibrated. With the increasing use of computerized batching equipment,
it
is now
possible to have the computer do the subtraction and print the weights of individual material
in cumulative batcher including recognition of the zero reading or tare. Use of load cells to
support the batchers has the potential to simplify a scale by eliminating much of the lever
system and dial scale that has typically been used.
Typical Batching Tolerances
As per IS:4925-1968, the batching tolerances are as under:
Ingredients
Individual Batchers and Cumulative
Batchers Batching Tolerances
Cement and other cementitious material
+
1 Per cent
Aggregates
+ 2 Per cent
Water

6. 2. 2. 1
Check points during batching
The following points should be given due care while batching the ingreadients.
(a)
Calibration of batching equipment
(b)
Isolation of Batching Equipment from plant vibration
(c)
Protection of Batching controls from dust.
(d)
Frequent checking and cleaning of scales and beam pivot points.
(e)
The batching sequence in accordance with the specifications.
(f)
Measurement of all the ingredients within tolerances.
(g)
Wind protection sufficient to prevent interference with weighing accuracy.
Mixing
The mixing operation consists of rotation or stirring, the objective being to coat the surface of
all aggregate particles with cement paste, and to blend all the ingredients of the concrete into
a uniform mass; this uniformity must not be disturbed by the process of discharging from the
mixer. When
it comes to improvements in concrete properties, mixing technology is as important
as concrete composition. A concrete is said to be adequately mixed
if the samples taken from
different portions of a batch will have essentially the same unit weight, air content, slump, and
coarse-aggregate content within the permissible errors.
It is decisive, that water, cement and
admixtures are evenly dispersed and distributed to a fine scale and that agglomerate (jumbled
mass)
is sufficiently dispersed.
Insufficient dispersing or deagglomeration results
in inferior
concrete properties. Mixing cycle consists of charging of mixer, mixing of all the components
and discharging of the concrete.
Charging the mixer consists of transferring
all the weighed or measured material from weigh
hoppers and silos into the central-mixer. Aggregates are loaded on conveyer belts. There are
no general rules on the order of feeding the ingredients into the mixer as this depend on the
properties of the mixer and mix.
The particle movement during mixing
in power mixers can be divided into a convective and
dispersive transport. Convective transport is a forced, directed movement of larger portion of
mix, e.g. by the mixing tool (coarse dispersion).
This
is superimposed by disruptive transport. Disruptive transport
is the random movement
of the individual particle due to collision between the particles. This leads to a mixing in small
areas (fine dispersion), as well as disintegration of agglomerates.
While
in case of free
fall
mixers, the height to which the concrete climbs against gravity
overcomes friction and causes
it to fall back towards the bottom of the drum depends upon
following two factors:
Linear Velocity: The greater the linear velocity, the higher the break away point of the concrete.
However,
if the linear velocity is very high break-away is prevented and the spins full circle in
contact with the drum.
36



======================================================================
PAGE 45 of 72
======================================================================
IRC:SP:96-2012
Workability of concrete: The coefficients of friction both internal and between the concrete
and drum surface, increase with reduction in workability. The lower the workability, the higher
is the break-away point.
As the concrete breaks away and
rolls onto
itself, highly efficient local mixing occurs. The
efficiency of mixing operation depends upon the shape and size of vanes (blades) fixed inside
the drum.
It is important to know the minimum mixing time necessary to produce a concrete of uniform
composition, and of reliable strength. Longer mixing time increases the homogeneity of the
concrete discharged up to a point. Also, mixing for long periods of time at high speeds, can
result in damages to the quality of concrete, tends to grind the aggregate into smaller pieces,
increases the temperature of the
mix,
lowers the slump, decreases
air entrainment, and
decreases the strength of the concrete. A secondary effect is that of grinding of the aggregate,
particularly
if soft; the grading thus becomes finer and the workability lower. Of course, shorter
mixing times that still obtain an acceptable homogeneity for a given mixture are desired.
This could determine the best mixer for the application,
if the loading method is kept constant.
Shortening the mixing time may be achieved by increasing the mixing tool velocity. Further, the
maximum flowability decreases with increased tool speed due to increase in the temperature
of the mix which increases the water demand.
Therefore, the optimum mixing time should be determined for each concrete mixture before
starting a large production. Mixing time generally depends on the workability of concrete mix,
type of mixer and
its size or capacity, working speed etc.
The discharge from the mixer should be arranged so
that
it increases
productivity
(fast
discharge), and
it does not modify (slow discharge) the homogeneity of the concrete. For
instance,
if the discharge involves a sudden change in velocity—as in falling a long distance
onto a rigid surface—there could be a separation of the constituents by size or, in other words,
segregation
.
Mixer efficiency is defined as the adequacy of a mixer in rendering a homogeneous
product within a stated period; homogeneity
is determined by testing for relative differences
in physical properties or composition of samples extracted from different portions of a freshly
mixed
batch.
In any
mixer,
it
is essential that a
sufficient interchange of material occurs
between parts of the chamber, so that a uniform concrete
is produced. The efficiency of the
mixer can be measured by the variability of the samples from the mix.
6. 2. 3. 1
Check points during mixing:
1
.
A non uniform slump or air content in the concrete throughout the discharge is a
sign of poor mixing either due to worn lips or blade or due to excessive buildup
of hardened concrete inside the drum.
2.
For increasing the output, concrete mixers should neither be overloaded nor be
speeded up than the designed capacities and speed. For an increased output,
the use of a larger mixer or additional mixers are recommended.
37



======================================================================
PAGE 46 of 72
======================================================================
IRC:SP:96-2012
3.
Blade wear may adversely affect the mixer performance. Extended mixing time
and longer discharge of low slump concrete is usually an indicator of excessive
blade wear or blades with excessive hardened buildup. Therefore, for better
mixing action the badly worn blades should be replaced to have uniform mixing,
as per recommendation of the manufacturer and hardened concrete should be
removed preferably after each day of production of concrete.
4.
Mixers and agitators should always be operated within the limits of the volume
and speed of rotation designated by the equipment manufacturer.
5.
The central mixer is equipped with an approved timing device that will not permit
the batch to be discharged until the specified mixing time has elapsed.
6.
Mixers are free of hardened concrete.
7.
All blades are greater than 90 percent of design height.
6.3
Monitoring and Measuring Moisture Content Through Automation
Automatic Moisture Measurement
One of the major problems of inconsistency in batching concrete is the ever varying moisture
content of sand and aggregates from one batch to another. Good storage of the sand and
aggregates is desirable. Moisture content in stored sand and aggregates can have effects on
the water/cement ratio, the aggregate/cement ratio, yield and the colour of the mix. Measuring
the moisture content of the raw material can enable the plant controller to adjust water addition
into the mix in real time. This enables batch after batch of concrete to be produced of consistent
quality.
The installation of moisture measurement sensors into the manufacturing process or entering
moisture data into control panel provides the producer with an on-line system that operates in
and enables the accurate control of the water/cement or aggregate/cement ratios. Knowing
the moisture level of the raw material allows the producer to accurately calculate not only the
amount of water to be added to the mix but also the correct amount of cement and aggregates.
This will maintain the quality of concrete with reduction
in costs and also the level of rejected
batches.
Benefits of Monitoring and Control of Moisture Content
(i)
Consistent batch quality
(ii)
Consistent batch sizes
(iii)
Reduction in cement use
(iv)
Reduction in wastage due to incorrect moisture or slump
(v)
Reduced mix cycle times
The sensors are used
for moisture measurement
in concrete production, and are
built to
survive the harsh environment of flowing aggregates and the turbulence of a concrete mixer.
Microwave moisture measurement sensors can be installed in a variety of locations depending
upon the individual requirements of the plant. Microwave energy is absorbed by moisture
in
direct proportion to the moisture present in the material.
38



======================================================================
PAGE 47 of 72
======================================================================
IRC:SP:96-2012
A microwave moisture sensor can be installed either in or underneath an aggregate bin and
measures moisture as the raw material exits the bin. Alternatively,
it could be mounted above
a conveyor and measure the aggregate as
it flows past the sensor head. Measurements
may be taken 25 times per second as the material passes over or around the sensor head,
meaning that the sensor can rapidly detect changes in moisture levels.
There are microwave moisture sensors which have been designed to
fit level with the floor
and measures moisture and temperature in the mixer.
Fig. 34 Sensor for Measuring Moisture and Temperature in the Mixer
All sensors connect directly to the plant control system using an analogue output or digital
communications. For optimum accuracy of the mixer, sensors
will also connect to a water
control system, allowing precise control of the water in the shortest possible mixing time. This
water control system is a unit that can be connected to a batch control system to easily enable
the transfer of mix cycle information. With features such as automatic receipe selection and
a colour touch screen display, the unit
is designed for simplicity of use and integration into
existing control systems. Using the reading from a microwave sensor installed inside a mixer,
the unit accurately and continuously monitors, displays and adjusts the moisture levels of the
material throughout the mix cycle. Using known recipes, this unit automatically calculates and
adds the correct amount of water to the mix. This ensures that the required moisture target
can be easily achieved, batch after batch. For optimum control, measurement in the sands
and fine aggregates to provide weight correction is also recommended. Measuring only in the
aggregates may provide a solution but greater care
is required
in ensuring the sensors are
calibrated.

Preventive Maintenance (PM)
Preventive Maintenance involves scheduling and performing repair tasks on equipment before
it becomes necessary. Preventive Maintenance
is required to prevent frequent breakdown
of the
plant. To
attain
this objective, the
periodicity
of the change
of spares/minor/major
assemblies as recommended by the supplier has to be observed.
Plants where a formalized inspection and maintenance schedule
is
in place tend to have
fewer breakdowns. Preventive Maintenance should be undertaken regularly to identify the
condition of bearings, belts, leaky air systems, and filter bags and the defective item may be
repaired/replaced before breakdowns interrupt plant operations.
A list of spares for maintenance should be made available at the site. Set up a maintenance
programme using Preventive Maintenance software, either stand-alone or as part of batching
software.
For example, some batch
control manufacturers
offer an
integrated
Preventive
Maintenance schedule. This provides a very useful way to track parts and equipment and can
help with spotting failure trends.

•
Check running items: Consumable Items, Shrouds, Skirting, Wipers, Filters,
and Dust Collector Bags
7.5
Calibration of Load Cells
The process of calibration
is carried out once
in a month or as per recommendation of the
manufacturer,
in the following manner.
(i)
The
calibration
is
decided
based
on
the
per
batch
capacity. The aim
of
calibration
is
to compare
the
display
readings
in
the
digital
display
unit/computer with standard weights.
(ii)
There should be sufficient number of standard weights ranging from
1 kg
to 50 kg so that there
is a
sufficient number of incremental weights for
aggregate, cement, water or admixture.
42



======================================================================
PAGE 51 of 72
======================================================================
IRC:SP:96-2012
(iii)
Scales shall have increments as per IS 4926.
(iv)
50 percent of the capacity of the weigh batcher has to be added sequentially
in a gradual manner. The gradual increase of standard weights should be
reflected
in the digital display unit/computer.
(v)
In case of mismatch between the reading of the display unit and the standard
weight, calibration of the digital display unit has to be done as per the standard
weight loaded.
(vi)
The process
is repeated and the readings rechecked.
If there
is no match
between the readings of the display unit and the standard weights used,
then the following points need to be checked.
(a)
Installation of the load cells.
(b)
Level of weigh batcher.
(c
)
Free movement of weigh batcher onto the load cell studs,
(d)
Proper Input/Output voltage of the load cells.
(vi)
Again repeat the above process
until the correct readings are achieved
within the tolerance limits.
(vii)
Increase the weights from 50 percent to 100 percent of the weigh batcher
and repeat the process of incrementally increasing the standard weight and
corresponding reading of the
digital display unit on the computer screen.
The display unit should indicate a zero
, the moment the standard weights
are removed.
7.6
Plant Safety
Employees working around conveyors, aggregates and
electrical
panels are exposed
to
potential
injury, which translates from exposure for the plant operator—to downtime as well
as legal
liability. Safety features that should be
in every plant include emergency pull-cord
shutoffs and
safety disconnects on conveyor and
turn head
motors, and confined
entry
access manholes in aggregate and cement bin compartments. Wherever possible, stairs with
handrails are preferred over ladders. Going one step further, certain kinds of automation can
keep workers away from harm.

8 QUALITY CONTROL IN CONCRETE BATCHING & MIXING PLANT
The degree of control can be estimated
statistically by the variations
in test
results. The
variation
in strength results from the variations
in the properties of the mix ingredients. This
also arises due to lack of accuracy in batching, mixing, placing, curing and testing. The lower
the difference between the mean and minimum strengths of the mix, lower will be the cement-
content required. The factor controlling this difference is termed as quality control.
Quality Control of concrete can be divided into three convenient areas which basically deal
with procedures of quality control to be followed before the production process.

of
concrete
during
production and
delivery (assessment of
uniformity,
cohesion,
workability,
adjustment
of
water content)
,
/;;;\
(III)
Making corresponding adjustments at the

results,
(ii)

======================================================================
IRC:SP:96-2012
The power consumption
is often used to estimate the workability of the concrete. The theory
of usage
is based on principle of rheometer. A rheometer is an instrument that measures the
stress generated by the material tested while applying the strain.
In this case, the strain
is
constant speed of the blades and the stress
is measured by the energy consumption.
If the
power consumption increases,
it is an indication that concrete workability is reduced.
To accurately measure the viscosity of the mix
, the most direct and accurate measurement in
an active process is to measure the input torque to the mixer.

Mix Design
Quality
of the
concrete
is dependent on
the
mix
design.
The
design
of the
mix ensures
the
proportion
of various
ingredients, mixing time, temperature, moisture content, curing
time, gradation of the aggregate etc. and thus quality and the
strength depends on
it.

as mentioned above, a concrete plant of right capacity should be installed.
It should take into
account various ingredients proposed for use in the mix like, flyash, admixtures like plasticizer,
retarder, air entraining agent etc.
2.
Multiple Mix Design Options: A batching plant needs to be shifted from site to site
on completion of projects and different mix designs are required to be followed at different sites,
as per strength and workability requirements of concrete and the quality of locally available
aggregates.
3.
Mobility of Concrete Plant: Depending upon the location of work site the plants'
mobility is considered.
51



======================================================================
PAGE 60 of 72
======================================================================
IRC:SP:96-2012
4
Automatic Controls: Most of the activities in the running of the batching plant should
be under automatic controls. Once the directions are fed, the plant should be able to read and
operate automatically. However, manual switchover options should also be available.
5.
Type of Mixer: Suggested criteria for the selection of mixer is as under:
•
Size of aggregate
•
Easy to clean
•
Difficulty of replacing the blades or parts
Sensitivity of the blades to wear and tear
o
Mixer Capacity (Size of drum)
•
Mixing energy required
©
Efficiency of a mixer
•
Mixing time
•
Mixing method
©
Location of the construction site (distance from the batching plant)
•
Amount of concrete needed
6.
Accurate Weigh Batching of Concrete Ingredients: The batching
plant must
have accurate weigh batching systems in
it, with electronic controls and calibrated gauges for
measurements.
7.
Feeding and Storage Mechanisms: There should be adequate number of bins to
feed aggregate of various sizes including sand. Before commencing work, the Contractor has
to prepare a plan as to determine how he will produce and transport mix within the specified
time limit. Adequate storage facility for cement for carrying out 2-3 days work, feeding facilities
for coarse and fine aggregates, cement and other cementitious material like flyash, admixtures
should be taken care of.
8.
Safe Operation of Plant:
Safety features of the
plant should be studied. Easy
access, easy escape, protection against dust and smoke, proper insulation against shocks
should be some essential features. The plant should be equipped with automatic emergency
stoppage arrangements in case of emergencies to avoid accidents on site.
9.
Easy Availability of Spares: Sales is combined with service in today's scenario.
It
should be ensured that spares are easily available for replacements as and when required.
In addition, service and repairs should be prompt. The company's track record
in this matter
should be considered.
10.
Minimum Wear and Tear: The components of the batching plant should undergo
minimum wear and tear despite constant use. The warranty period and clauses should be
carefully scrutinised.
11.
Minimum Energy Consumption:
It
is another important
factor
to
look
into
to
minimize running expenses of the batching plant.
12.
Minimum Maintenance Requirements: The
batching
plant should
be
able
to
withstand rough handling and demand minimum maintenance.
52

Low Consumption
of Consumables:
In
addition
to
low power consumption,
the plant should have low consumption of consumables such as
oils to minimise running
expenses.
14.
Noise Pollution: The plant should make minimum noise during
its operation.
15.
Miscellaneous Requirements

Hire charges = l+ll+lll+IV+V
For Equipment provided Given to Contractor and Outside Agencies
When the equipment is issued to contractors, interest and insurance charges @ 10
per cent of the average investment per year will be calculated as under and added.

" 1500* x
100
100
= Rs.
* 1500 is the life of machine in a year
** 60/100
is due to average investment per year when the
life of equipment is taken 5 years
and depreciation
is assumed to be uniform,
(M)
Interest and insurance charges per hour
Therefore the total charges in that case would be as follows:
(i)
Owner-ship charges (E+F+M)

(ii)
Operational charges

(iii)
Running charges
=

(iv)
Over-head charges @ 5 per cent of total charges
=
V

Hence hire charges per hour
=

Appendix "D"
SAMPLE CALCULATION TO WORK OUT REQUIREMENT OF CONCRETE BATCHING
.'-m mmm paaut
1
.
Quantity of concrete required say 500000 cum.
2.
Time period for completion tenure of the project say 24 months.
(i)
Assume number of working months = 16 months
(ii)
Number of working days per month = 20 days
(iii)
Number of working hours per day
( 2 shifts) =
1 0 hours
(iv)
Total working hours of Plant = 16x20x10 = 3200 hours
3.
Quantity of concrete required to be produced per Hours = 500000/( 3200) = 156.25
cum.
4.
Assuming the efficiency of the plant is 80 per cent,
Quantity of concrete required to be produced per Hour = 156.25/0.80 = 195.31 cum
5.
Next available capacity of Concrete Batching and Mixing Plant = 240 cum/hr.
6.
Hence, there will be requirement of one number concrete batching and mixing plant
of capacity 240 cum/hour for producing concrete of 5,00,000 cum for the project.
7.
While working out the requirement of the concrete batching and mixing
plant, the
aspect of monthly requirement of concrete must also be considered. The plants
available with the contractors at a particular site may preferably be of a single make.
This would lead to standardization of the plant inventory and reduce variations
in
the output of the plants (due to
likely differences
in the plant characteristics and
settings).
