The

Specifications
and
Standards
Committee
during
its
meeting
held on
14th
July,
2001
approved
the
document
for printing
as
a
Special
Publication of the IRC
subject to certain modifications in light of the comments made
by the members. The
draft was approved by the Executive
Committee in its meeting held on the 16th December, 2001 and
later by the Council of the IRC
in
its
164th meeting held
at
Kochi (Cochin) on the 8th January, 2002.
With
ever
increasing
stock
of
distressed
bridges
and
dwindling resource position for maintaining the same, the need
of assessment of remaining useful
life of bridges
in Bridge
Management Systems cannot be over emphasised.
It has been
recognised that despite
its crucial role the
life assessment has
eluded
explicit
modelling
and
numerical
evaluation
of
its
'absolute' value due enormous complexities in the degradation
mechanism, and lack of data-base on material degradation and
bridge performance. The problem has got further compounded
due
to
uncertainties
associated
with
material
properties,
construction
details,
exposure
conditions,
deterioration
rates
and the quality of maintenance.
1. INTRODUCTION

======================================================================

IRC:SP:60-2002
Therefore, to predict as to how long the given bridge will
last is perhaps beyond the present level of development of the
subject. At
best one can
try
to
estimate whether
the given
bridge can reach a
specific
age, with the help of probability
distribution function of service life. This
is also possible if the
acceptable degree of failure probability can be pre-determined.
24
It has been emphasised
that our design philosophy
comprises a number ofessential and interacting elements, such as:
a behavioural model,
criteria defining satisfactory performance,
loads under which these criteria should be satisfied,
relevant characteristic material properties, which should reliably
be achievable in the construction process,
factors or margins to take account of vagaries and variability
in the system.
But the present day predictive models, however, consider
the first three of the above elements reasonably accurately. The
relationship between materials forming the
structure and the
overall response of the structure
is often so complicated that
this
indeed poses
a
question
as
to whether
the
service
life
prediction can ever be generalised.
However, given its crucial role in distressed or rehabilitated
bridges,
it becomes imperative
to make a beginning
in
this
direction.
It
is necessary to create awareness to keep track of
performance against the assumed expectations
in general and
to look into specific issues, such as:
existing load carrying capacity,
cause of distress,
if already noticed,
degree of aggressiveness of the environment,
risk of future damage,
rate of deterioration, and
the effect of repairs conducted from time to time on the rates
of deterioration.
3



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:SP:60-2002
There
is also an urgent need to document data, wherever
available,
on
degradation
causing
factors,
deterioration
processes, damage modes, and deterioration rates. With these
objectives in the background, this document aims at presenting
the existing status of the subject by synthesising the available
knowledge
in
the
fields of material degradation and
life
assessment to initiate further steps and make a beginning towards
introducing the concept of life prediction.
Given
the developmental
stage of this
subject,
the
document is prepared as an approach document only, to enable
engineers to appreciate the need of the subject, to understand
present
status of the knowledge and
its
limitations, and
to
introduce road map for future course of actions. Obviously the
subject has not attained the level where it can be enforced as a
part of normal design procedure.
1.1.
Durability Concept
Durability
is the property expressing the ability of the
structure/component/product to maintain the required performance
level over at least a specified time under the influence of the
degradation factors. The minimum acceptable values for
performance (or maximum acceptable values for degradation) are
called durability limit states. The limit-state
is a performance
requirement critical to the service life, which can be set with regard
to either the ultimate limit or the serviceability limit. A new feature
here
is the incorporation of time into the design problems.
It,
thereby, allows the possibility oftreating degradation ofmaterials
as an essential part of structural calculations. Traditionally, the
durability design is based on implicit rules for materials, material
compositions, working conditions, structural dimensions,
etc.
(e.g., minimum concrete cover, maximum water/cement ratio,
minimum cement content, crack width limitations, cement type,
coatings on concrete, categorisation of exposure conditions).

1.2.
Service Life
The concept of service
life can be approached from
at
least three different aspects:
(i) technical,
(ii) functional and
(iii) economic. The service life of a bridge span, component or
its constituting materials
is defined as the period of time after
installation during which its essential properties meet or exceed
minimum acceptable values, when routinely maintained.
It
is
the period during which no excessive expenditure is required in
operation,
maintenance
or
repair.
Each
component
has
an
expected
service
life. The exact
definition of service
life
is
obscured by the maintenance
routines performed during the
service
life. Maintenance can influence the length of service
life and hence,
the
definition of service
life should
include
"when
routinely
maintained".
Some
components,
such
as,
bearings,
expansion
joints,
wearing
coat,
require
periodic
maintenance
or
replacement,
whereas,
the
main
structural
components may also require periodic inspection and preventive
maintenance but are expected to perform their expected functions
during
their
service
life.
Required
service
life imposed by
general rules, the client or the owner of the structure is called
the target service
life.
Fig.
1 shows a generalised pattern of
deterioration and maintenance cycles
in the
life of a bridge.
Considering
the
corrosion-induced
deterioration,
life
of the
structure can be split into following four periods, Fig.

safety (e.g., wider cracks, spalling), viz., end of the operational
period

Design Life
Distinction needs to be made between Service Life and
Design Life. The design
life
is a period considered (possibly
longer than
the
service
life)
that will
give
sufficiently high
probability of the structure achieving the required service
life.
The
design
life would depend upon
the
importance of the
structure.
It would ensure required safety against falling below
the
target
service
life. The design
life would
influence
the
6



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:SP:60-2002
specifications and detailing of structural components.
Various service/design
life periods are prescribed
in the
literature according to importance,
e.g.,
Studies
for
a major
suspension
bridge
over
the
Straits
of
Messina have
indicated that the conventional service
life of
such structures should be 200 years.
In the U.K., according to BS:5400,
it
is assumed
to be
120
years.
For the construction of structures for Oresund Link between
Denmark and Sweden
2
, the owners have specified a service
life of 100 years, out of which the first 50 years must be totally
free
of maintenance,
while minor
concrete
repairs
will be
acceptable after the
first 50 years.
Different components can have different design lives. Figures
can vary from bridge to bridge as well as with wide range of
structural systems and material qualities of components. Typical
figures for different components are indicated in the following:
Foundation
Piers & abutments
Bearings
Steel main members
Concrete decking
Wearing coat
Expansion joints
Same as design
life of the bridge
Same as design life of the bridge with
periodic minor concrete repairs
(e.g.,
after every 20 years)
Varying
depending
upon
type

In fact, it is not feasible to design a bridge for a very specific
life period. The available experience of traditional materials is
often inappropriate and many modern high technology products
are relatively untried. Hence, the anticipated durability can only
be an estimate, its prediction being subject to many variables. In
general, the designer has in mind a useful
life for the bridge
alongwith reasonable level of maintenance from time to time.
2. DEGRADATION CAUSING FACTORS,
DETERIORATION PROCESSES AND
DAMAGE MODES
The process
in which the resistance (and thereby
performance) decreases with time is called degradation process.
Materials and components have finite service lives since they
gradually undergo chemical, physical or mechanical changes
resulting in degradation and reduction in their ability to perform
as required. Degradation processes are numerous. The type and
the rates of deterioration processes determine the resistance and
rigidity of the materials, sections and the elements constituting
the bridge structure.

2.1.
Degradation Causing Factors
Commonly recognised degradation causing
factors can
broadly be categorised into the following:
(i)
Water
Liquid (e.g., rain water/stagnating/trapped/splashing zone, etc.)
Solid (e.g., snow, freezing of water)
Vapour (e.g., air humidity, moisture in pores)
(ii)
Aggressive air constituents
Carbon dioxide (leading to carbonation)
Chlorides (promoting corrosion)
Sulphates (leading to expansive reaction with cement)
Acids (dissolving cement)
Alkalies (leading to expansive reaction with aggregates)
Ozone
Ammonia (leading to disintegration of concrete)
High voltage transmission lines (stray currents)
(iii)
Biological agents
Micro-organism
Fungi
(iv)
Temperature
Absolute value
Gradient
Cycle
Solar radiation
(v)
Foundation condition
Scour around piers and foundations
Sub-soil strata leading to settlement,
tilt, etc.
(vi)

Relaxation in steel

(vii)
Traffic
Axle loads (leading to abrasion, impact or exceeding design
load limits)
Frequency (leading to fatigue)
(viii)
Other non-continuous actions
Earthquake
Cyclone
Collision with vehicle, barge, etc.
Vandalism
Climatic influences on bridge components can be further
sub-divided into macro, meso and micro climates, corresponding
to country, site and specific element ofthe structure respectively.
Depending upon the nature and duration ofthe degradation causing
factors and the type ofthe bridge, it will lead to partial or complete
loss of serviceability or of its mere aesthetic appearance.
2.2.
Degradation Processes/Mechanisms
Bridge component fails, if the strength of that component
is no longer sufficient to
resist the actual load
effects. The
resistance
of
the
component
is
affected
due
to
various
degradation
processes
to which
the
material
of the
bridge
component
is exposed. The sequence of chemical or physical
changes
that
lead
to
detrimental
changes
in
one
or more
properties of structural materials or components when exposed
to
one
or
a
combination
of degradation
factors,
is
called
Degradation
mechanism.
The
degradation
processes
follow
different patterns as listed below:
(i)
Degradation processes progressing
linearly with
time,
e.g.,
corrosion process over years, wear and tear of the deck.
(ii)
Degradation
processes
slowing down
with
time,
e.g.,
carbonation in concrete.
(iii)
Exponentially accelerating degradation process, e.g., fatigue.
(iv)
Degradation process non-continuous
in time,
e.g.,
collision,
earthquake, etc.

(v)
Two-stage mechanism of degradation process, e.g., degradation
of protection layer first as in the case of cover on reinforcement,
or as in the case of coating on a steel member.
Fig. 3 depicts the above patterns of degradation. Some of
the commonly
observed
deterioration
processes
are
the
following:
2.2.1.
Fatigue
:
It
is defined as the tendency of the
material to break under repeated cyclic stresses considerably
below the ultimate
tensile
stress.
Cyclic loading induces or
propagates the pre-existing cracks in the bridge. Movement of
frequently occurring heavily loaded commercial vehicles can
cause
fatigue damage
in
road
bridges.
The
fatigue
action
comprises three phases: (a) crack nucleation in which invisible
changes occur,
(b) crack propagation
in which micro-cracks
grow to visible macroscopic dimensions, and (c) instant failure.
2.2.2.
Corrosion of steel
: Bridges
in a coastal belt
have shown premature distress due to corrosion of steel arising
from salinity in the
air. Corrosion of steel
in concrete girder
can be
faster than
that
in the
steel
in the deck slab due to
crowding of reinforcement in girders especially at the lap joints
with accompanying honey-combing.
Corrosion
is the mechanism, which
is
in most cases an
important parameter
to
influence
the
load-carrying
capacity
and the service life of the bridge. It can lead to: (a) loss in steel
integrity,
(b) possible
loss
in mechanical properties of steel,
strength and ductility, (c) spitting and spalling of the concrete
cover and
possible
loss of effective
concrete
cross-section,
(d) loss of bond between steel and concrete in case of cracks
running parallel to the steel, and (e) loss of prestress in the case
of corrosion of pre-stressing
steel.
Pre-stressing
steel
apart
from uniform corrosion may also suffer from pitting corrosion,
crevice corrosion, stress corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement.

2.2.4. Combination effect (Synergy)
: In actual service,
degradation factors may interact to increase the rate of degradation.
Synergistic actions are in fact difficult to simulate or to account for,
e.g., the effect ofcorrosion induced defects on the fatigue strength of
steel bridges, or influence oftemperature on creep in concrete bridges.
In
the
presence
of
aggressive
environment
causing
corrosion of embedded steel as well as deterioration of concrete,
the
fatigue
life of the
structural component can
get reduced
considerably. The phenomenon is termed as corrosion fatigue.
It is reported
that fatigue lives of beams exposed to sea-water
are fifty per cent less than those in
air.
Initiation and later the development of corrosion can also
get accelerated by alkali-aggregate reaction (AAR) and
frost
impact. Furthermore, AAR and frost taking place at the same
time may accelerate each other39
.
2.3.
Damage Modes
The degradation causing factors have different effects on
the structure, leading to different damage modes. A distinction
has to be made between the disintegration at the micro level in
the
material and
the
collapse mode of the bridge from
the
structural
consideration.
Degradation
mechanism
can
be
discovered at an early stage in some situations by measuring
-
potential
differences,
settlement, sagging and
strains, density
and
thickness
of concrete
cover,
depth
of carbonation
and
chloride penetration, etc. But the severity of the damages needs
to be examined from their range of influence,
e.g.,
(i) loss of
section,
(ii) limited to failure of structural element,
(iii) failure
of the entire structure. In this exercise, weightage needs to be
given to the degree of risk involved. Risk
is defined as the
product of failure consequence and failure probability. A minor
fault in a critical part of the bridge may signify a greater risk
than a more extended fault in a less critical area.

3. DETERIORATION RATES
The
correlation
between
the
attacking
agent
and
the
quantum of deterioration with time
is the first requirement in
prediction of the remaining life. However, there are considerable
difficulties in modelling deterioration or in collection of past
data on performance leading to extrapolation of available stray
information.
Despite
the
on
going
research
world
wide,
exhaustive analytical models to predict rates of deterioration in
different components of the bridge are not yet available for
their
application
in
practical
cases.
Models
are
also
not
available to consider interaction of aggressive actions that can
act simultaneously.
Deterioration
rates suggested by various
researchers are discussed in the following paras.
3.1.
Deterioration Rate Due to Carbonation
Carbonation is the reaction ofC02 in the air with hydrated
minerals in concrete, leading to lowering of the pH value in the
carbonated zone. The protective film on the surface of the steel
lying in the carbonated zone is destroyed and the propagation
of corrosion
starts.
Time
for
carbonation
front
to
reach
reinforcement leading to initiation of corrosion is called initiation
time. The rate depends upon cover thickness, cement, curing,
density, water cement ratio, etc. Carbonation penetration below
the
concrete
surface progresses
as
the
square-root of time.
Thus, if concrete cover is doubled, corrosion of reinforcement
is delayed by four times. By the same token errors in fixing
reinforcement which may reduce cover can
affect the
steel
earlier than expected. Expressed mathematically44
,
M (d) = Kt"
2
Where,
\i (d)
is the mean of the depth of carbonation at time
t (mm)
Kc
is the carbonation rate factor (mm/year*) and
t
is the time (or age in years)
14



======================================================================
PAGE 27 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:SP:60-2002
The initiation time ofcorrosion t0 can hence be expressed as
t0 = [*kcy
Where,
d is the concrete cover
The carbonation rate factor Kc depends upon the strength
and composition of the concrete, and on environmental factors,
like, humidity, temperature,
etc. The depth of carbonation
is
assumed
normally distributed and the coefficient of variation
(ratio of standard deviation to mean) is assumed to be constant.
Fig. 4 shows the process of carbonation in the concrete cover.
Fig. 4. Schematic representation of the process of carbonation within
a concrete cover
The part of distribution of carbonation depth that exceeds the
thickness of the concrete cover shows the failure probability.
There are several formulae for modelling of carbonation rate

corrosion due to carbonation in various grades of concrete. Yet
another study

penetrate to the interior of concrete at a lower rate than would be
given by a square-root of time function. This means that if the
concrete cover is halved, the critical state for incipient danger of
corrosion will be reached in less than a quarter of the time.

Deterioration Rate Due to Corrosion
Corrosion ofreinforcement in reinforced concrete members
can lead to rust strains on the concrete surface, cracks in the cover,
spalling of concrete and the loss of bond between steel and
concrete. The action is complex since apart from general uniform
corrosion, there can be localised corrosion with pit depths as much
as five to ten times deeper than the average corrosion penetration.

Concrete protects steel physically and chemically.
It provides
physical barrier against agents that promote corrosion, e.g., water,
oxygen, chlorides. The chemical effect of concrete is attributed
to its alkalinity, causing oxide layer to form on the steel surface.
The deterioration due to corrosion consists oftwo time segments:
(i) Initiation Time to i.e., the time required for external agents to
de-passivate the protective oxide film on steel bars, and
(ii)
Propagation time t. i.e., corrosion action leading to rust formation,
reduction in bar diameter, cracking of concrete, loss ofbond, etc.
(Fig. 8). As a conservative approach it is advisable to limit the
service life of the member corresponding to initiation time only.
Governing deterioration rates in such cases would be those due to
actions of causing de-passivation of steel.

PAGE 32 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:SP:60-2002
be noted that the rate of corrosion of steel in cracks or in the
presence of chlorides
is not yet fully understood.
Several techniques are being explored to detect presence
of corrosion activity. Techniques involving visual inspection,
detection of laminations, measurement of corrosion potentials
or the extraction of physical samples for laboratory analysis is
generally both time-consuming and expensive. Rapid and non-
contact type techniques, such
as, impulse radar and infrared
thermography may prove useful. But although these techniques
would detect delamination
that may be due
to corrosion of
reinforcement, they do not detect corrosion directly. Quantitative
assessment
of corrosion
activity

concrete

Rates of Corrosion
The rate of corrosion in concrete required in the above
expressions depends strongly on the environmental factors, such
as, temperature and humidity, besides chloride contents. Influence
of temperature is considered by the following expressions:

iii) Linear Polarisation Resistance (LPR) technique46
This method developed
for
on-site
study of corrosion
rates
of
steel
in
concrete,
is
based on
the
experimentally
observed assumption that the polarisation curve for a few mV
around the corrosion potential obeys quasi-linear relationship.
The slope of this curve is the polarisation resistance R
p where
AV
R = — asAV->0
P
AI
From
this slope the corrosion
rate
is determined using
relationship
i
= B/R
corr
p
where
i
is the corrosion current or corrosion rate (uA/
corr
vr
cm2
) and B
is a constant the value of which lies between 13 and
52 mV. B equal to 40 is considered to be adequate in many cases.
A typical plot of linear polarisation resistance curve is shown in
Fig. 9.

time after beginning of the propagation period (years), 0.023
is
the conversion
factor of jiA/cm
into mm/year. From above
expression, it can be deduced that the corrosion current of 1 [iAJ
cm2
, measured by resistance polarisation can be expected to
lead to corrosion penetration into iron of 11.6 jum/year
10
.
The above formula
for degradation
in reinforcement
bar has been further modified
by multiplying
icorr t by two
more parameters 'W
t
' and
'a' to include localised corrosion
effect,
since
pitting corrosion can
affect smaller diameter
23

bars significantly. Here 'W
t
f is the wetness period or effective
time of corrosion and
'a'
is the concentration factor due to
localised corrosion (varying from 2 to
10).
In order to determine the impact of this loss of steel section
on the structure,
it
is necessary to distinguish between the
serviceability and the ultimate limit states. While the loss of
diameter ofsteel section would affect the ultimate flexural strength,
much before that cracking of concrete cover due to corrosion
would determine the permissible threshold value for corrosion
penetration from serviceability and durability considerations. A
value ofabout 1 50 fim is generally considered the threshold value
for corrosion penetration to cause cracking of concrete. Based on
this value and the deduction arrived at from the above corrosion
rate (i.e., i
corr of 1 |iA/cm2 leading to 1 1 .6 fim corrosion penetration
per year), following guidelines are available
:
i
coiT < 0.22 fiA/cm
2
no corrosion damage exected.
0.22 <

1 .08 fiA/cm

of 10-15 years
1.08 < i
corr < 10.8 (iiA/cm
2
corrosion damage expected in 2-10 years
Kon > 10.8 nA/cm
2
corrosion damage expected in less than
2 years.
Above guidelines need to be revised with more experience
and as the data becomes available. For example, with respect to
cracking of the cover which results from the expansive character
of the
iron oxides,
it has been reported
that around
10-50
microns of corrosion penetration
is enough to produce visible

.
Further,
the
technique may be suitable in RC components but may not help
in detecting damage to prestressed steel. For prestressing steel
in view of their smaller diameters, initiation time alone should
be considered to determine the onset of corrosion.

3.3. Deterioration Rate Due to Ingress of Chloride
Because
of exposure
to
the
salt water
in
the
coastal
regions, concrete bridges are contaminated with chlorides. The
presence
of
chlorides
(resulting
in
the
loss
of
alkaline
environment), oxygen and water lead to corrosion of embedded
steel. Chloride ions diffuse through the porous concrete and
reach the corrosion threshold value. The resultant cracking of
concrete cover allows intrusion of chlorides and oxygen
at a
much faster rate, thus accelerating the corrosion process. Existing
chloride in concrete is not considered in the following expression.
As a result of chloride penetration a gradient is set up near the
concrete surface. The time at which the critical chloride content
reaches the steel surface and de-passivates
it, is regarded as the
initiation time of corrosion.
Estimation of service life in this case is based on FICK's
second law on diffusion of chloride ions through porous materials
such as, concrete
18
. To model the chloride transport process in
a porous material, it is assumed that a saturated condition exists
and that, FICK's law applies, even though corrosion does not
occur when the material
is continuously saturated because of
lack of oxygen
for cathodic
reactions.
In
reality,
there
is
a
combination
of exposure
conditions.
Further,
one
of
the
assumptions
in the derivation of FICK's 2 nd law
is
that
the
porous medium
is homogeneous, which
is not
the case
for
concrete.
It
is also assumed that the medium
is non-reactive
and non-absorptive, and that does not hold for concrete either.
Chloride ions can be physically absorbed on to the surface of
the
pores
and
chemically
combined
to
the
aluminates.
Furthermore, experimental testing
in concrete specimens has
shown that the diffusion coefficient varies with time, solution
type and
concentration. The time dependence
is,
in
part,
a
direct consequence of the continuing cement hydration reactions

and
pore
blocking.
Despite
the
differences
between
the
assumptions, FICK's law
still provides the only way available
to model chloride diffusion into concrete
.
It
is expressed as
C(X,
t)
=
C0
{1
- erf [(X/2)/(VD
e .t)]}
Where,
C (X,
t)
=
chloride concentration (kg/m
3
) at depth X
at time
t
C
=
equilibrium chloride concentration (kg/m
3
)
(assumed
1.3 cm below the surface)
erf
=
error function
D
c
=
chloride diffusion constant (property of
concrete cmVyear)
t
=
time in years (for initiation time,
X = cover of concrete)
X
=
depth at which chloride concentration is required
(i.e., depth where steel
is located)
Thus,
the
initiation
time
is
calculated
using
above
expression on the basis of chloride measurements carried out
on the bridge, and/or from measurements of carbonation. Instead
of modelling chloride ingress gradient by error function, the
formula is simplified by using a parabolic function as follows44
:
C(X,t) = C

As an illustration, Fig. 10 gives the theoretical service life
as a function of D
c (Diffusion coefficient) and cover for C
s
(chloride content as per cent by weight of dry concrete)= 0.2 per
cent and 0.1 per cent2
. Diffusion coefficient D
c is calculated as
equal to 5000 * (W/C)
5 mm/year. Limited data is available since

it is either based on laboratory experiments or from practical data
collected from existing structures of approximately same age
group (20-30 years old) only. General validity of the model for
use in long term predictions has, therefore, not been confirmed in
practice. Sensitivity of parameters C
and D
c can be seen from
Fig. 102
. IfC
s is not 0.2 per cent as estimated but 0.4 per cent, the
service life is theoretically reduced from 40 to 30 years. If D
is
not 40 mm/year but say 80, service life is theoretically reduced
from 40 to 28 years2

Scale for Deterioration Rate
Deterioration rates discussed earlier relate to micro-level
degradation inside the body of the structure. Different ratings

for damages or for performance of the bridge component have
been proposed in the literature.
RILEM draft recommendations for damage classification
of concrete
structures

indicate
ratings
for
different

damages. ECB
bulletin

classifies
different
levels
of
deterioration
states
arising from damages
due
to
corrosion
based on
external
signs,
such
as,

spots,
cracks,

spalling and reduction in the reinforcement cross-section.
Under the FHWA inspection procedure
9 condition ofbridge
elements, such as, deck, superstructure or substructure is evaluated
on a scale of 9 to 0 (9 being the perfect condition and 0 the worst).
Thus, when the bridge element rating changes from one condition
rating to another, it can only change in integer values, such as,
1
2, etc. The data for condition rating versus time, therefore, do not
yield a smooth curve when plotted (Fig.

maintenance or rehabilitation is performed the element condition
rating is expected to remain unchanged or to drop downward on
any subsequent inspection, which is normally conducted once in
every two years by trained technicians. Several studies
incorporating the above condition rating scale have been reported
from the U.S. Although the observations from these studies cannot
be directly extended in a generalised manner, a few of the
observations extracted below can be of interest.
A study9 has indicated that the structural condition of the
deck would deteriorate at the rate of 0.094 per year during the
first ten years and thereafter at 0.025 per year. This implies that
the average condition would never fall below a condition rating
of 6 until after 60 years.
Another study
9 indicated that the deck would deteriorate
slightly faster with age than the superstructure or substructure.
The study estimated the average deterioration of decks
to be
about
1
point
in
8 years and that of both superstructure and
substructure to be about
1 point in
10 years.
22
In yet another study^
, bridge superstructure deterioration
was found to be a convex function, with superstructure condition
ratings deteriorating more slowly as the bridge ages.

4. METHODOLOGIES FOR LIFE PREDICTIONS
In the case of a bridge under investigation,
a clear
understanding of the agencies which can cause decay and the
manner and extent to which they will have an effect, singly or in
combination becomes a pre-requisite. Obviously, fewer the 'ageing
causes' (e.g., only carbon dioxide or fatigue), easier becomes the
handling of life estimation. Synergistic effects are complicated
29



======================================================================
PAGE 42 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:SP:60-2002
and unpredictable. The situation becomes worse if accidental
actions are also to be considered along with environmental
aggressivity . Further for prediction ofremaining life, in the absence
ofdata on construction defects, it may become necessary to assume
that the bridge has been designed and constructed as per the known
provisions in codes and specifications.
To determine service life,
it is necessary to model bridge
deterioration process. A number of methods have been proposed,
although most of them
are
still
in the developmental
stage.
They are summarised in the following:
4.1.
Estimates Based on Experience
This method
relies primarily on engineering judgement
and past experience of the investigator.
4.2. A Comparative Approach
For estimating
life of specific
material, deductions
are
made from
the performance of similar
quality
materials
in
similar exposure
conditions. One
approach
is,
therefore,
to
record
condition
states of a
particular bridge element from
similar bridges
of different age
groups,
so
that
a graph of
degradation pattern
against time can be plotted. This would
help in estimating rate of degradation and thereby to predict the
remaining
life of the element in question.
The following are some of the potential determinants of
bridge superstructure deterioration
22
.
AGE
•
Average daily total volume of traffic (ADT)
Average daily total volume of truck traffic (ADTT)
•
Bridge structural material
•
Structural type
•
Span length
30



======================================================================
PAGE 43 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:SP:60-2002
•
Maintenance level
•
Environment
This approach, therefore, assumes that above data in addition
to the periodic condition rating assigned by the evaluator to the
bridge components, such as, deck, superstructure, sub-structure,
etc.
is available. Regression analysis
is used in such cases to
estimate parameters, which describe a functional relationship
between empirically measured sets ofdependent and independent
variables. Here, condition rating becomes the dependent variable
and the factors leading to degradation, such as, age of concrete,
live load intensity, etc., are the independent variables.
For example, one such regression based equation obtained
in one study
12 where AGE and ADT were considered the likely
primary determinants of superstructure deterioration,
is:
Superstructure
=
9.0 - 0.674 (log AGE) - 0.005 (log ADT)
condition rating
(for steel)
9.0 - 0.444 (log AGE) - 0.024 (log ADT)
(for prestressed concrete)
Where, AGE is the age of the bridge in years, and ADT
is the average daily traffic. (The ADT is calculated as per item
29 of the National Bridge Inventory of the Federal Highway
22
Administration
). With the help of such expressions, the age
corresponding
to
the
lower end of the
rating
scale would
indicate the threshold of the service
life.
Problems in comparative approach
(i)
One has to be cautious in utilising data from different bridges.
Sometimes the failures/degradations are caused due to incorrect
design, poor construction work or faulty maintenance. The field
data from such sites may generate important information on the
quality of design, construction and maintenance but does not
necessarily give the required feedback of information on
performance of materials.
31



======================================================================
PAGE 44 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:SP:60-2002
(ii)
In regression
analysis
finer the homogeneity of the bridge
group, better could be the accuracy of the regression equation.
(iii)
Accuracy of the regression equations hinges upon accuracy of
the initial data, in particular, the rating assigned by the investigator
after the inspection. This in turn would depend upon the NDT,
instrumentation and judgement of the investigator.
(iv)
The problem
arises with many of the materials used today,
such as, admixtures, protective coatings which have a relatively
short performance history.
Reliable
data
can,
therefore,
be
generated
from
field
performance only if the data stems from well planned systematic
inspections of the
state of thoroughly characterised
existing
bridges in thoroughly characterised environments.
4.3.
Accelerated Testing
Simulated testing, properly correlated with service
conditions can enable life predictions with reasonable confidence.
Accuracy in prediction would logically depend on how accurately
the environmental agencies that produce changes in the materials
are defined and simulated in the tests. It is mainly because of lack
of knowledge of the quantitative levels of the agencies likely to
cause deterioration that researchers are tempted to test samples
exposed in the
field. This, however, being an extremely slow
process, one resorts to an accelerated version in the laboratory.
Here an assumption
is made that the number of cycles in the
accelerated ageing test have some kind of relationship to the life
time of that material in actual condition. Before designing the
accelerated laboratory test, it is, therefore, necessary to understand
degradation mechanism so that in the test only those factors of
degradation are incorporated which are most influential.
Fatigue testing of structural steel of railway bridges in the
laboratories
is a typical example of accelerated testing
11
. The
32



======================================================================
PAGE 45 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:SP:60-2002
prediction of fatigue life in these bridges is based either on (a)
cumulative damage assessment based on S-N curves or (b)
cumulative crack increments based on Fracture Mechanics. Both
approaches require assessment of cumulative fatigue damage
because fatigue behaviour under constant amplitude loading can
be markedly different than that under variable amplitude loading.
The prediction of fatigue life through S-N curves comprises
following activities:
In-situ strain measurements at critical locations
Theoretical corroborative analysis
Live load surveys
Dynamic signal analysis
Preparation of stress histograms
Fatigue tests in the laboratory
Plotting of S-N curves
Estimation of rate of fatigue damage
Assessment of remaining
life

Stress-history
: This involves instrumentation
of the bridge and measurement of strain-time history at critical
sections,
Fig.
12. Corroboration of stress
intensities through
analytical modelling is desirable. Traffic surveys and old records
help to estimate the number of cycles of different stress ranges
to which the bridge components are already subjected. Possibility
of future
increase
in
the
traffic
intensity
also
needs
to
be
considered.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:60-2002
4.3.2.
Stress-histograms
: Stress-history traces from the
field are analysed to construct stress-histograms showing the
number of cycles for different stress ranges by using one of the
counting methods, such as, Rain-flow counting, or any other
suitable method
. The choice depends upon the type of signal to
be analysed. In these methods, time element
is not taken into
account. FFT analysers process a random dynamic signal on
automatic basis. Similarly by making use of analogue to digital
converters and dedicated software, dynamic signals are analysed
to obtain stress ranges and their corresponding number of
occurrences.
4.3.3.
Fatigue testing in laboratory
: Fatigue tests are
conducted on representative samples (about 6 to 8) from the bridge
for each stress range. Programmable loading facilitates better
simulation ofthe actual load. Tests are continued till the failure of
the specimen or upto two million cycles. Few specimens are also
tested to assess the physical and chemical properties of the
material, so that fatigue test data from similar materials can also
be taken into consideration. If the number of specimens tested is
small, S-N curve is plotted through test points taking geometric
mean of all the test results for each stress-range and assuming
that the curve follows a straight line between N = 104 and N = 106
cycles. If median value of test results for each stress-range
is
plotted against the number of cycles to
failure, then this
relationship would provide 50 per cent probability offatigue failure
for the member, Fig.
1 3 . This means that at particular stress range
value SI, 50 per cent of the samples will have failed before
reaching the cycles N.. For more exact determination of the P-S-
N curves where P is the probability of the specimen's survival, a
large number of specimens need to be tested.

stress,
in
reality
the
bridge
components receive a load spectrum,
i.e., the load and cyclic
stress vary in some fashion under service conditions. To consider
this feature, it is assumed in Miner's hypothesis that the damage
by fatigue action accumulates before failure.
As per Palmgren-Miner's hypothesis, ifN. cycles ofconstant
amplitude stress cause failure, then n. cycles of the same stress
range use up a fraction of (a / N.) of the life. Failure would occur
when the sum of used life fractions D
f reaches unity, i.e.,
D r = 2
(n.
/ N.) =
1
Numerous variable amplitude loading tests have shown that
sum ofthe average cycles at failure, called the damage sum at failure
D
f , may deviate considerably from unity. The main reason for the
deviation ofthe damage sum (D
f ) from unity is that fatigue damage
is assumed to be a linear function of 2 n./N. =1, irrespective of the
35



======================================================================
PAGE 48 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:SP:60-2002
loading sequence and stress level. But non-linear damage
accumulation, effect of residual stresses and some other interaction
effects can result in conservative and non-conservative deviations
from Miner's fatigue criterion and in different values of the damage
sum. Therefore, researchers recommend that 50 per cent probability
of fatigue failure curves (S-N curves) and Palmgren-Miner's
summation of 0.3 in place of 1
Miner's damage accumulation index (D.) caused per day
or per vehicle is computed from the equation, D. = 2
(n./ N),
where n.
is the number of stress cycles actually applied and N.
are
the number of
stress
cycles
to
cause
failure.
Here
the
number of cycles n. for each stress range level is obtained from
the stress-histograms of the component and the corresponding
values of N. are obtained from the S-N curve. The remaining
fatigue life is computed by dividing-D (Miner's damage index)
with fatigue damage caused per day (D.).
D
is taken equal to one at failure,
if the S-N curve for
1
per cent probability of fatigue
failure
is used
for predicting
partial damage per day. Test results have, however, shown that
the sum of cycle ratios (n/N) defers widely from the value of
unity. In case S-N curves with 50 per cent probability of fatigue
failure are used to compute damage per day. Damage Index D
is taken as 0.3
at failure. Fatigue behaviour forms the distinct
branch of research with a large specialised literature
Problems in accelerated testing
The
difficulties experienced
in
utilising the accelerated
tests are the following:
(i)
Along with the accelerated test,
it
is necessary to check how
well the results of this accelerated ageing test compare with
those from
an
in-service
exposure. But
this comparison
is
seldom definitive, more often the correlation
is only marginal.
36



======================================================================
PAGE 49 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:SP:60-2002
(ii)
Most
of
the
test
methods
that
have
been
developed
for
generating service
life data focus upon climatic agents as the
factors causing degradation. These climatic agents are difficult
to quantify and to incorporate meaningfully into accelerated
tests.
(iii)
Short term
accelerated ageing
tests
are
usually designed
to
evaluate the effect of a small number of degradation factors.
Although
such
test
results may
be
useful
for
ranking
of
materials, they are only of limited value for predicting service
life, unless the degradation factors studied are those that are
responsible for all of the in-service degradation.
(iv)
It takes a long time to obtain results from field exposure tests
unless the property changes leading to upgradation are detectable
at eerly stages in the exposure.
(v)
Ex posure conditions cannot be controlled and the intensities of
weathering
factors are seldom measured,
particularly
at the
micro-environmental level.
It is difficult, therefore, from field
exposure tests to identify mechanisms of degradation and to
isolate the effects of various degradation factors.
(vi)
Accelerated
testing
is
satisfactory
provided
the
artificial
environment does not induce forms of degradations which do
not occur in the service environment.
A
typical
case of service
life
prediction
17 of concrete
coating used to restrict ingress of chlorides based on laboratory
tests
is illustrated in the Appendix.
4.4.
Mathematical and Simulation Modelling
Models used
to
consider
effect of degradation can be
deterministic or stochastic. Deterministic models do not consider
scatter of concerned values. The model yields only one value
of degradation, performance or service
life
that
is
often
the
mean value. In some cases, however, deterministic models are
formulated to give a specific fractile value instead of the mean.
In many cases, however, the deterministic models are insufficient
37



======================================================================
PAGE 50 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:SP:60-2002
to evaluate the risk of not reaching a definite figure of service
life.
In
structural
designs,
therefore,
stochastic
approach
is
considered essential as the scatter due to degradation can be
wide and the degree of risk may be high. In stochastic modelling
for assessing remaining
life,
certain minimum
reliability or
failure probability is assumed. In stochastic design, deterministic
design models
are normally used
for
evaluating
the mean
degradation. To
evaluate
the
standard
deviation,
a
constant
coefficient of variation
is given:
Thus,
o = v.u
Where,
o = the standard deviation of degradation
\i = the mean of degradation, and
v = the coefficient of variation
Standard deviation can also be obtained analytically as
follows:
Where,
a (tL) = the standard deviation of service life distribution (tL )
a (x.) = the standard deviation of parameter x.
X.
= one of the n parameters in the service life model
(tL)
An example to calculate service
life
is illustrated in the
Appendix.
In the exercise for life prediction, one not only considers
the target service life but also assumes the value of maximum
allowable probability of not reaching the target service
life.
It
is called the probability of failure. Hence, the probability of
failure can be defined as the probability of exceeding or falling
38

below a certain limit state, which may be an ultimate limit state
or a serviceability limit state.
4.4.1. Discrete time markov chain process
: Markov
chain {Xn
: n n >
0,
1, 2
...}
is a discrete time
stochastic
process, which is used to model the deterioration process as a
decay of condition ratings over time. A stochastic process is an
indexed
set of variables which evolve randomly over time.
Stochastic methods rely on the analysis of performance data
without consideration of the mechanisms involved. Here X
is
n
the bridge condition-state at the n* time point.
The method simulates a natural deterioration process starting
with perfect condition and proceeding with gradual and random
degradation. However, unlike other probability methods, no
parameters or assumptions for the type ofdistribution are needed.
The state space S in the present case consists of condition ratings
ofthe bridge components at any time described by a number from
a pre-selected discrete numerical scale (say
1 to 5 with
1 and 5
being the initial and the worst states respectively).
In this process, the probability that an element transitions
from condition state i to another condition state j does not depend
how the element arrived at the
i
th state. Probability of transition
from state i to state j at time point n is denoted by P. (n)

jes
M being the total number of degradation condition stages.
Matrix
[P] has rows and columns equal to assumed discrete
condition, states (M).
Initially, it is necessary to assign p.. values, e.g., 0. 1 , 0.2, 0.7
depending upon the probability ofthe element transitioning from
its initial state, say
1 to 2, 3 or will continue to remain in
1 itself.
Existing bridge deterioration models used in the Markov
chain theory invariably assume that
(i)
the
condition of structure
cannot be improved
during
the
process, and
(ii)
the condition can either remain same or shift to the next state
within one transition of
1 year step.
With the first assumption all transition probabilities below
the diagonal probabilities are zero, since, e.g., in p2l condition
state 2 cannot transit backwards to condition state
1,
i.e., from
existing state to improved state. Due to the second assumption,
all probabilities above those next to diagonal ones are zero. As
the structure must remain at the same state or drop to the next
one only within one year step and cannot jump to any other
lower
state, sum
of
probabilities
of remaining
(diagonal
elements) and dropping to the next state (elements next to the
diagonal ones) must be
1. Thus, the probabilities of dropping to
the next
state can be calculated by subtracting the diagonal
probability values from
1.
Consequently, only the
diagonal
probabilities of the matrices are unknown parameters.

The expected condition of the bridge at a future time n or
conversely, the expected time to reach any specific future state,
can be calculated by using the following relationship:

Where, 7t

consisting of the probability mass function (pmf) of Xn or the
degradation index distribution vector for n

(0)
is the
initial state probability vector and [P] n
is the n
th power of the
transition probability matrix [P]. Vector matrix [tz] has elements
equal to the assumed condition states (M). Thus, changes after
n years can be predicted by multiplying the initial degradation
index
distribution
7tio) by the
transition matrix n
times. The
process
is depicted in Fig.
14. If we assume structure initially
in best condition then 7t
(o) would be
[1 0 0
...0] meaning that
structure
is at degradation index indicating the best stage.
The
Markov
chain
theory
assumes
that
transition
probabilities depend upon the current state irrespective of age
of the bridge, thus only one transition matrix [P] is used for the
whole life span. As a modification, some BMS softwares use

4.4.1.1. Estimation of transition
probabilities
: Two
methods
-
'Frequency approach' and
'Regression approach'
have been suggested
to estimate transition probabilities.
In the Frequency approach,
P..
is calculated as
P«=^
i,j =
l, 2,
3..., M
Where,
n..
is the number of bridges originally in state
i
which have moved to state j
in one step, and
n.,
is the total
number of bridges in state
i before the transition. This approach
42



======================================================================
PAGE 55 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:SP:60-2002
would require at least two sets of inspection data pertaining to
two different points in time.
In Regression approach, only one set of bridge data is needed.
A regression
function
is
first obtained by regressing condition
ratings on ages. Transition probabilities are then estimated by fitting
the regression function with the transition matrix.
Here degradation index distribution for each year jr
(t)
is
obtained by multiplying the degradation index distribution of
the previous year by the transition matrix
[P].
•• k

l = k

The mean of the degradation index distribution
at each
year E(t, P)
is obtained by multiplying the scale index vector

(Vector multiplication)

E(t, P) =

This mean of the degradation E
is compared with the
available reference degradation curve for that particular year. The
probabilities p in the transition matrix are selected by minimising
the sum of yearly deviations between the reference degradation
curve and the Markov estimation for the degradation curve, i.e.,
N

It has been observed that the tractability of the Markov
chain mean curve is best with respect to square root pattern of
reference degradation curve.
4.4.1.2. Problems in application
: In the absence of any
other more
accurate method,
Discrete Time Markov Chain
(DTMC) has been gaining entry into the Bridge Management
System software packages. A network optimisation system for
bridge
improvement
and
maintenance PONTIS
of FHWA
assumes
transition
probabilities
to depend upon
the
current
states and not on the ages of the bridges and hence uses only
19
one transition matrix for the whole life sjpan
. BRIDGIT is yet
another software developed in the U.S.
. There are, however,
19
several issues
connected with this method which need to be
examined by applying the technique to practical problems:
(i)
Suitability of Markov Chain
theory
in bridge
deterioration
modelling
This can be confirmed only from the accuracy achieved
in
prediction of remaining
life.
Presently,
structural
reliability
based
methods
are
the
only
alternative
option
available.
Confirmation from the actual performance
is a slow process,
till such time
it is necessary to keep applying the DTMC on a
variety of bridges with whatever initial data is available.
(h)
Suitability of condition rating as the bridge performance index
Although, it is relatively simpler it has, however, been observed
that
condition
rating
in numeric
scale
is
not
adequate
as
performance
index.
Condition
rating
does
not
reflect
the
structural
integrity of the bridge.
It has been suggested that
bridge deterioration modelling should include load rating.
(iii)
Method of estimating the transition probabilities p
u
This difficulty is expected in the beginning as no field data are
available. However, based on instrumentation, non-destructive
testing and visual inspection an experienced bridge engineer
44



======================================================================
PAGE 57 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:SP:60-2002
can
assign number
representing
condition
state
after
each
inspection. With the availability of condition states from the
past inspections, the transition probability matrix can be further
improved.
Readers are advised to refer the modern text books on
probabilistic methods for detailed treatment of the method
38,42,44
.
4.4.2. Reliability based methods
: Decisions to continue
service and/or to perform maintenance need to be supported by
quantitative evidence that the strength is sufficient to withstand
future extreme events within the proposed service period with
an acceptable level of reliability. Structural reliability methods
provide the basis for this evaluation.
Statistical simulation
is
used
in
stochastic methods
to
estimate
the
likelihood of a
bridge component being in a certain state of condition at some
point of time
in
future.
In
contrast
to
stochastic
methods,
reliability based methods do
require
that the mechanism of
degradation is understood. As the service life is often represented
by a failure distribution, and since the variable conditions exist
in both the loading and resistance characteristics of any bridge,
it is claimed that reliability theory can be an effecti ve modelling
tool.
It
involves
a
systematic
probabilistic
procedure
for
quantitative
prediction
of
service
lives
of
materials
and
components. Main features of this approach are given below:
Structural
loads,
engineering
material
properties
and
strength degradation mechanisms are random function of time,
and, therefore, the performance of the bridge is also of random
variable
nature
depending
upon
material
characteristics,
workmanship, maintenance standard, etc. The margin of safety
M(t) at any time
t can be expressed as:
M (t) = R (t) - S (t), in which R (t) and S (t) are resistance
and structural actions respectively. The approach
is based on
45



======================================================================
PAGE 58 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:SP:60-2002
the criterion that the probability of the resistance of the structure
being smaller than the load within the target service life
(t
g)
is
smaller than a certain maximum acceptable failure probability
Mathematically expressed,
P{failure}
tg = P{R-S<0}
tg < P fmax
Where, P
{ failure }
= the probability of failure of the structure
within tg. The problem can be solved if the distribution of the
load and the resistance are known and the P.
is defined.
fmax
If R
(r) and
S(r)
are instantaneous physical values of
resistance and the load at the moment r, the failure probability
P
f in a life time
t can be expressed as:
P
f (t) = P{R(r) < S (r)}
for all r <
t
As R and S are stochastic quantities with time-dependent
or constant density distributions, P^t) can be expressed as:
P{R(t)< S(t)}
It will be seen from Fig.
15 that the failure probability
increases with time. At t = 0, the density distributions of load
and resistance are far apart and the failure probability is small.
With time, the distributions approach each other, forming an
overlapping
area
of increasing
size.
This
overlapping
area
illustrates the failure probability.
Loads (S) and resistance (R) are generally assumed as
normally distributed. Considering continuous distributions, the
failure
probability P
f
at
certain moment of time
x
can be
determined using the following convolution integral:

Pf(t)= jFR (s)f s (s)ds

In
this
case,
the
failure probability can be determined
using the test index 6

The failure probabilities corresponding to p are available
as
tables. To
obtain
the
distribution of service,
the
failure
probabilities have to be solved with several values of t (e.g.,
10, 20,
etc. years).
As an example
the case of carbonation of cc icrete
is
44
considered
.
Failure
is assumed
to occur when carbonation
depth exceeds the depth of reinforcement. Here S
is the time
related
to
carbonation process and R
the
constant
concrete
cover is also considered as stochastic quantity. For the numerical
data given in section 3.1, the test index P can be expressed as

The corresponding probability distribution function and
probability density function are given in Figs. 5 and 6.
For service life prediction and reliability assessment, one
is more interested in the satisfactory performance over some
period of time,
say
(0,t). The
probability
that
the
structure
would
survive during
interval
(0,t)
is
defined by
reliability
function L
(0,t),
in other words,
it
is the probability that the
time to reach failure exceeds the time
t,
i.e.,
L(t) = P[T>t]
where,
t > 0
Where, T is the non-negative random variable representing the
time
to
failure. For detailed understanding of the procedure,
attention
is drawn to specialised literature

4.4.3. Fracture mechanics approach": Techniques based
on fracture mechanics have also been used in modelling creep,
fatigue or fracture degradation of metals. As an alternative to
cumulative damage assessment based on S-N curves, fracture
mechanics approach based on cumulative crack increments has
also been attempted. Flaw size is an additional variable in this
approach, and fracture toughness replaces strength as the relevant
material property. This approach appears to be more useful in
fatigue related studies, since the measure of damage,
i.e., the
crack length can be physically assessed whereas S-N curve
approach does not allow for direct measurement of damage and
damage increments.
5. GENERAL PROCEDURE FOR LIFE ASSESSMENT
Procedures are available
in the
literature to predict the
service life in the case of building materials and components'
2
.
In fact there cannot be one general procedure for all types of
bridges and
environments.
Considering
the
history and
the
environmental conditions of the bridge in question, the procedure
will require modification. The deterioration and actual damage
levels differ from structure to structure, making it impossible to
lay down a strict framework of the procedure.
Before predicting the remaining life,
it is essential to fix
performance criteria for the bridges and in the case of reliability
based approach, the acceptable level of probability of failure.
Factors that would affect the safety and serviceability of the
bridge, inspite of periodic routine maintenance, are required to
estimate
the
remaining
life. A
concrete
bridge component
reaches the end of its functional service
life (Fig.
I) when the
level
of
physical
damage
warrants
not
just
repair
but
rehabilitation of the component
15
. There are several examples
of wear and tear affecting the riding quality, or of malfunctioning
of bearings, expansion joints, etc. These are the results of lack
49



======================================================================
PAGE 62 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:SP:60-2002
of maintenance and cannot be the governing considerations to
determine the remaining
life.
5.1.
Broad Steps
Based on
the
various
aspects
discussed
in
the
earlier
sections, a comprehensive procedure to assess the remaining
life of an existing bridge
is summarised below. All the listed
activities may not be necessary in all the situations. However,
for the sake of comprehensiveness, they are listed together.
Step
1:
Defining of minimum
acceptable performance
limits,
e.g.,
span/deflection
ratio,
deflection
recovery under
loads,
sag,
crack
widths,
riding
quality,
vibration
levels,
acceptable probability of failure,
etc.
Step 2: Characterisation of existing status of the bridge: Status
of constituting materials, component, etc. based on condition survey,
i.e., visual inspection for cracks, chloride content, carbonation level,
porosity, corrosion mapping, hammer tapping, cover scan, strength
related properties through hammer, UPV and core tests, petrography,
radiography, endoscopy, etc., if situation demands, condition state
rating (component wise), installation of strain, rotation, deflection
and temperature sensors (for periodic evaluation) followed by static
load test and dynamic signature tests.
Step 3: Analysis of the environment (Macro, meso and
micro level)
Chloride ion contents from concrete samples
Quality of water below the bridge
Daily and seasonal temperature changes at the site, within the
box (in the case of closed sections), and within the concrete
Relative humidity level
Air pollution data
Live load induced stress histograms
Water discharge, scour level
Drainage arrangement at the deck level
50



======================================================================
PAGE 63 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:SP:60-2002
Step 4: Identification of critical degradation causing agents
and their rates,
e.g., Carbonation induced corrosion, Chloride
ingress-induced
corrosion,
Live
load induced
fatigue,
wear-
tear, abrasion, scour.
To determine deterioration rate ideally one would require
past periodic data on the performance and access to the accelerated
testing facility. But this would rarely be available. In the absence
ofthe same, the identification ofpotential degradation agents and
their rates will largely depend upon investigator's engineering
judgement and past experience. While selecting the degradation
rate,
it should be kept into consideration that some prestressed
concrete bridges have suffered premature deterioration52 53
. Guess
work will have to be made based on the data available from the
in-situ tests, quantification of deterioration vs. time rates based
on field data from similar cases, empirical formulae,
e.g., on
corrosion, carbonation, chloride diffusion discussed in section
3.0, results from accelerated tests, etc.
Maintenance of bridges should be need based addressing
the causes of damage.
Influence of repairs or the level of maintenance measures
to be undertaken in future may also have bearing on the rate of
deterioration.
However,
for
conservative
estimate,
this may
either be ignored or suitable allowance be given.
Step 5: Identification of structural failure modes
: Scanning
of
critical
sections/zones
based
on
Design
calculations,
Construction data, Condition survey, Observation during load
test, Maintenance record,
etc.
Conversion of deterioration processes into structural failure
modes, and estimation of critical structural parameters, such as,
Loss of prestress, Loss of bond and
area of
steel, Loss of
51



======================================================================
PAGE 64 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:SP:60-2002
composite
action,
Change
in
stiffness- E
value,
Excessive
geometrical changes,
e.g., settlement, sag, etc.
Step 6: Prediction of remaining life based on most critical
deterioration rate and corresponding structural failure mode.
No unique procedure is feasible for all types of situations.
Available approaches include,
•
Estimation based on engineering judgement
•
Regression
function
to
model
deterioration
based
on
performance of bridges having
similar
materials
in
similar
exposure conditions.
•
Probabilistic
approaches,
such
as, Markov
chain
process,
structural reliability approach.
As
the
entire procedure becomes
qualitative based on
several assumptions, it is desirable to supplement the prediction
with more than one approaches.
5.2.
Limitations
It
is to be appreciated that the calculations of remaining
life involves many uncertainties,
e.g.,
range and accuracy of in-situ investigation procedures
estimated deterioration rates
selection of critical damage mode which would become the
cause of failure in future
assumption of environmental conditions and the level of repair/
maintenance during the remaining
life,
since the long term
performance of the bridges would depend upon their periodic
maintenance.
In all above considerations, sound engineering judgement
and past experience of the investigator plays a crucial role. The
service
life determination helps to forecast the time frame for
possible
repair
or
rehabilitation
in
future.
Therefore,
from
practical point of view, even a broad range of time period in
years would be useful.

IRC:SP:60-2002
The prediction of residual service life, where long periods
(e.g., 50
- 100 years) are involved or where no visible signs of
distress are apparent, can at times be difficult. But in such cases,
the situation also allows more inspections to apply mid-course
corrections. From the present status of the knowledge and
technology, it appears possible to carry out a qualified service life
prediction. But in damaged structures, there will always be a need
for more intensive inspections during the predicted period, no
matter how advanced the service life modelling is.
6. ACTION PLAN
The status of life assessment of bridges world wide is at
such
a
stage
that while
its importance
is being
recognised,
scientific data on material degradation and bridge performance
is lacking. As a consequence, the available analytical tools for
life prediction have remained untested. Therefore, in order to
create
awareness
to
monitor
bridge perfonnance
during
its
service life and to develop data bank several steps need to be
initiated in Highway Departments and Research Institutions.
It
is
necessary
to
characterise
degradation
agents,
understand damage modes, develop accelerated test procedures
and generate data, document field performances, report bridges
in distress to the concerned authorities, test the available and
newly
emerging
mathematical
models,
and
above
all
an
institutionalised arrangement to overview and co-ordinate these
tasks on a long term basis. The ultimate objective is to introduce
achievements of material research of concrete structures
into
the art of structural design involving 'time' dimension. Specific
tasks requiring actions are the following:
(a)
To develop effective mechanism for reporting data on actual
in-service performance of bridges including lessons from cases
where failures have clearly occurred.
53

(b)
Identification and grouping of bridges based on bridge geometry
and
exposure
to
aggressive
environment
(e.g.,
aggressive
climate, heavy traffic, scour, etc.)
(c)
Guidelines for minimum expected performance levels.
Structurally acceptable
limits, such
as, on
deflection, crack
widths, riding quality, vibration level prescribed in the codes
of practice, provide one set of threshold values. However, the
limiting values indicating the end of the functional service life
have
bearing on techno-economic
considerations. A bridge
component reaches the end of its functional life when the level
of damage warrants not just repair but rehabilitation of the
component. Unlike the end of the structural service life, which
often
can
be
objectively
defined on
the
basis
of readily
observable distress signs, the end of functional service life,
is
ultimately a matter of opinion.
(d)
To
develop
data
bank
for
documentation
of
periodically
collected data from bridges and arrangement for drawing of
statistical conclusions.
(This
feedback would form
the
source and
the
data
base
required
to
assign
transition
probabilities
in Markov
chain
process as well as to develop regression expressions connecting
condition ratings with the potential degradation agents.)
(e)
Collection
of
data
on
the
environmental
factors
causing
degradation and improved methods to measure the intensities
of the factors.
(f)
To develop improved knowledge of the mechanisms by which
constituting materials (including coatings/sealers) degrade.
This would involve laboratory tests under controlled conditions
to collect data on deterioration rates, such as, in corrosion-affected
passive and prestressed steel, rate of carbonation in concrete,
fatigue accumulation under programmable loading. Deterioration
rates referred in earlier sections relate to specific case studies.
The scope would increase as more and more forms ofdeterioration
processes are identified. This would also lead to establishing
laboratory infrastructure for testing, e.g., weathering chambers,
programmable pulsating loading facility, etc.

acting concurrently and development of methods to simulate

or account for synergism amongst degradation factors. This
is
essential since
it has been the experience that failure
- mild or
severe - generally will be due to combination of factors, many
of which are not amenable to mathematical modelling.
To
develop
instrumentation
based performance
monitoring
procedures incorporating time saving, easy to handle improved
tools and methods
for measuring degradation
in-situ and
a
mobile laboratory operated by trained engineers to evaluate the
condition of the structure on site during testing.
Testing efficacy of different service models
Research programme to analyze concrete structures subjected
to time-related degradation processes need to be planned. Not
only are
'first
level' cross-sectional studies but 'second
level'
related
to the behaviour of the component and
'third
level'
related to the response of the whole structural assembly also
need to be included in such a programme.
It
is necessary to
understand accuracy of different
life prediction methods, as
well as the difficulties in their applications to field examples.
This is true particularly in the cases of Discrete Time Markov
Chain (including its procedure to evolve elements of Transition
Probability
Matrix)
and
structural
reliability
methods.
Application of these techniques to a large number of existing
and new bridges where in-situ test data on a periodic basis
is
available, needs to be undertaken.
Development of durability design philosophy
Control of the durability
is gaining increasing importance in
the design of concrete bridges. It is necessary to introduce into
conventional structural design, structural concept of targeted
service life, general theory of structural reliability and available
calculation models for the commonest degradation processes.
Concept of durability at the design stage would enable fixing
durability related parameters, such as, concrete cover, properties
of materials, amount of reinforcement and dimension of the
members taking into account the actual degradation process.
Further
the
introduction
of
'time'
element
in
the
design,
availability of periodically updated degradation rates during
service
life and the predefined targeted service
life, would all
help to plan the scope and schedule of maintenance measures.

It has to be appreciated that estimation of remaining life
is
not
a
straight-jacket
exercise but
is an
inter-disciplinary
science
covering
as
divergent
subjects
as
material
science,
electro-chemistry,
fracture
mechanics,
fatigue,
statistics,
probability theories, instrumentation, besides failure mechanisms
of structural engineering. In an effort to expose the readers to
the recent developments in all the related disciplines, it is likely
that the document would give
the impression of being
less
user-friendly and wanting in precise steps to be followed by the
prospective user in handling the practical cases.
However,
it will be realised that the life prediction is one
of today's front line areas of research and given the complexities
involved, every investigation has to be bridge-specific. While it
was necessary to touch upon various related subjects, being an
approach document, any attempt towards spelling out precise
step-by-step procedure would have been inconsistent with the
level of development of the subject. Need in fact is to draw up
a long term plan and co-ordinated efforts from bridge owners,
designer, academic and research establishments, so that at least
the qualitative estimation of health and the remaining life enters
the Bridge Maintenance Systems in future. The purpose of this
document would be served if it triggers action in this direction.

NUMERICAL ILLUSTRATIONS FROM LITERATURE
Being a newly emerging area of R&D, there are not many
reported case studies of practical applications. Three numerical
illustrations from the literature are, however, presented in the
following, primarily to bring out the status of the subject. They
cover the following cases:
RC column and beam under degradation of both concrete and
steel

Service Life Predictions in RC Column and Beam44
Cross-sections of a simple axially loaded square column
and a beam are considered to illustrate
life estimation under
degradation in both concrete and steel (Figs. 16 and 17).

Service Life Calculation in the Case of Chloride
Attack39
The
Danish
Bridge
Maintenance
System
comprises
modules where service
life calculations are necessary for the
optimum use of the system. To meet the requirement of the
Danish Road
Directorate, Henriksen of RH&H Consult has
reported a test-cum-service life calculation methodology using
services of a mobile laboratory to evaluate the condition of the
structure
on-site during
testing. The
test
results
are used
to
determine the actual position of the structure on the service life
deterioration vs. age curve and obtain the four points T
2 , T
3 , T4
and T

is estimated on the basis of measurement
on the structure of the electrical resistance, the moisture content,
the porosity of the concrete and the annual average temperature

calculating the deterioration of concrete.
The time periods are intended to enable plan the bridge

ingress
of chlorides
from
salt-water environment based
on
accelerated tests in the laboratory is described in the following.
The example
illustrates the application of accelerated
test
as
well as simulation of field condition.
Series of tests are performed in the laboratory on specially
designed surface coated concrete specimens immersed in sodium
chloride for a long period (one year in the present case).
Due
to
the
presence
of
coating,
surface
chloride
concentration
is
not
constant.
The
equilibrium
chloride
concentration (kg/m ) assumed
1.3 cm below the
surface
is
hence treated as surface concentration. The regression analysis
carried out on the test result values of concentration at
1.3 cm
from the surface shows
that
it varies
as square root of time.
(=k t
1
) where k is the chloride ingress rate through coated or
uncoated layer.
The
solution
to
the problem
of semi-infinite medium
whose surface concentration varies in proportion to the function
of time
(square
root)
is
obtained by Laplace Transform of
diffusion equation,
as:
