SPECIFICATIONS FOR DENSE BITUMINOUS MACADAM AND  
BITUMINOUS CONCRETE FOR AIRFIELD PAVEMENTS
1. Introduction
Airfield pavements are one of the most important assets of any Nation. Keeping these national 
assets operational all the time has strategic importance. The IRC prepared IRC: 105 “Tentative 
Specification for Bituminous Concrete (Asphaltic Concrete) for Airfield Pavements” in the year 
1988. However, with the induction of New Large Aircrafts and heavy weight fighter aircrafts with 
high tyre pressure and single wheel landing gear, a need has emerged to revise the technical 
specifications of different asphalt pavement layers in the airfield pavement. Besides reducing 
fatigue cracking, these high-quality pavement layers would increase the service life of the 
pavement. Sophisticated and high-speed weigh batch hot mix asphalt plants available in the 
industry can ensure a high degree of quality output conforming to the mix design parameters. 
This high-quality material can be rapidly paved with the new technology paving and compacting 
equipment available. Hence need was felt to revise this document. According, the task of revision 
of this document was entrusted to Flexible Pavement, Airfield & Runways Committee (H-2) of 
IRC during tenure 2018-20. The initial draft was prepared by the subgroup comprising Col. R.S. 
Bhanwala and Shri Manoj Kumar Shukla. Later H-2 Committee co-opted officers Col. Kulbir 
Singh, MES and Shri Manoj Kumar Garg, AAI in the sub group. The draft was further deliberated 
in various meetings of H-2 Committee. The H-2 Committee in its meeting held on 08.06.2019 
approved the document subject to incorporation of comments of members for placing before 
HSS Committee.
The composition of the H-2 Committee is given below:

The draft document was placed before the Highways Specifications and Standards Committee 
(HSS) in its meeting held on 20.07.2019. The HSS Committee decided that Co-Convenor, H-2 
Committee will modify the document based on written comments and verbal comments offered 
during the meeting and submit the final document to IRC for placing before the IRC Mid-Term 
Council meeting. The Mid-Term Council in its meeting held on 9th and 10th August, 2019 at Goa 
approved the document for publishing.
The HSS Committee in its meeting held on 20.07.2019 authorized the Co-Convenor to finalize 
the document based on comments offered during the meeting and submit final document to IRC 
for placing in the Mid-Term Council meeting. The Mid-Term Council in its meeting held on 9th

2. SCOPE
2.1	
These Specifications deal with the basic outline for the design, construction and 
controls needed while laying dense graded bituminous mixes in base course, binder course and 
wearing course for airfield pavements.
2.2	
Dense graded bituminous mixes shall consist of mineral aggregate and appropriate 
bituminous binder, mixed in a hot mix plant and laid with a mechanized paver. Dense graded 
bituminous mixes such as binder and wearing courses are usually laid on a previously prepared 
bituminous layer. Binder course is the intermediate layer between bituminous base course and 
bituminous wearing course. Three different Specifications for dense graded bituminous mixes 
are available for use for airfield pavements. Purpose, layer thickness and number of layers 
allowed for these Specifications are given in Table 2.1.

Material
3.1.1	
Bitumen
The bitumen for dense graded bituminous mixes shall comply with Indian Standard Specification 
for viscosity-graded paving bitumen, IS:73 or Polymer Modified Bitumen (PMB) complying with 
the Bureau of Indian Standards Specification IS:15462. Only elastomeric Polymer Modified 
Binder (PMB) with an elastic recovery value of at least 75% at 15ºC for the unaged binder shall 
be used. All VG grades shall be produced at refineries only with conventional refining processes. 
Guidelines for selection of grade of viscosity-graded paving bitumen and modified bitumen are 
given in Tables 3.1 and 3.2.
As per given design Specification, the type and grade of modified bitumen to be used shall be 
specified in the Contract.The use of Polymer Modified Bitumen is recommended for airfields 
intended to be used by heavy aircrafts or aircrafts with high tyre pressures.
The Highest Daily Mean Air Temperatures and the Lowest Daily Mean Air Temperatures mentioned 
in Tables 3.1 and 3.2 can be obtained from the weather station nearest to the project site from 
the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). The IMD has data on daily mean high temperature 
for all 365 days in a year for all weather stations based on historical records of the last 30-40 or 
more years. This daily mean high temperature on a specific day is the same as daily “normal” 
high temperature for that day as usually reported in some newspapers. The highest of the 365 
daily mean high air temperatures (which usually occurs on some day in May or June) is used in 
Tables 3.1 and 3.2. Likewise, the lowest daily mean air temperature (which usually occurs on 
some day in January) can also be obtained from the IMD.

3.2.4	
Job Mix Formula
Prior to the start of work, the job mix formula shall be developed based on mix design conducted by 
an approved laboratory. The laboratory mix design gives the proportion of the mineral aggregate 
combination in terms of individual sieve sizes, for actual operational purpose in the field, blending 
of the two or more sizes of aggregates (each size having within its range of individual sieve size) 
would be necessary. This blending ratio is obtained on a weight basis giving percent weight of the 
coarse aggregate, fine aggregate and filler needed to give the ultimate gradation. This mineral 
aggregate combination together with the corresponding optimum bitumen content as determined 
in the laboratory, constitute the job mix formula for implementation during construction. The job 
mix formula proposed for the use in the work shall give the following details:
	
i.	
Source and location of all materials
	
ii.	
Proportions of all materials

Approval of the job mix formula shall be based on independent testing by the Engineer on 
the samples furnished by the Contractor. It should be ensured that it is based on the truly 
representative samples of the material that will be used for the work. New job mix formula shall 
be approved whenever there is change in source of any constituent material used for the work.
3.2.5	
Plant Trials
Plant trials shall be carried out to establish that the plant can produce uniform mix conforming to 
the job mix formula. The permissible variation of the various ingredients in the actual mix from 
the job mix formula shall be within the limits given in Table 3.10. These variations are intended 
to apply to individual specimen taken for quality control test.

work. A test track of 90 m long and 6-9 m wide is to be laid. This shall be similar to the project 
area on which the bituminous layer is to be laid. Methodology, equipment and mix shall also be 
similar to those proposed for the project.
The trials should establish that the proposed laying plan, compaction plan, and methodology are 
capable of producing satisfactory results. The density of finished paving layer should not be less

3.3.3	
Transportation
Bituminous material shall be transported in clean, insulated covered vehicles. Asphalt release 
agent, which does not adversely affect the bituminous mix, may be applied to the interior of the 
vehicle to prevent sticking and to facilitate discharge of the material. Use of diesel oil shall not 
be allowed as asphalt release agent. The hot mix in the truck shall be covered adequately with 
tarpaulin at all times to minimize loss of heat.
3.3.4	
Laying
(a)	
Weather and Seasonal Limitations
Bituminous mixes shall not be laid:
	
(a)	
In presence of standing water on the surface
	
(b)	
When rain is imminent and during rains, fog, or dust storm
	
(c)	
When the base/binder course is damp
	
(d)	
When the air temperature on the surface on which it is to be laid is less than 
10oC for mix with conventional bitumen as binder and is less than 15oC for mix 
with modified bitumen as binder
	
(e)	
When the wind speed at any temperature exceeds 40 km/h at 2-meter height
(b)	
Preparation of the Base: Base shall be prepared by carrying out all or some of the 
operations as per Clause 3.3.1, depending upon the site conditions.
(c)	
Spreading: Except in areas where paver cannot access, bituminous mix shall be 
spread, levelled and tamped by self-propelled hydrostatic paver finisher with a sensor. 
The paver shall be capable of laying asphalt mix to a minimum width of 7.5 m. As 
soon as possible after arrival at site the material shall be supplied continuously to 
the paver and laid without delay. The rate of delivery of material to the paver shall be 
regulated to enable the paver to operate continuously to avoid minor undulations. The 
travel rate of paver and the method of operation shall be adjusted to ensure even and 
uniform flow of bituminous mix, free from dragging, tearing and segregation.
3.3.5	
Compaction
Compaction shall commence as soon as possible after laying and shall be completed before 
the temperature falls below the minimum rolling temperatures given in Table 3.11. Rolling of the 
longitudinal joints shall be done immediately behind the paving operation. After this, the rolling 
shall commence at the edge and progress towards the center longitudinally except at sections 
with unidirectional camber, where it shall progress from lower edge to upper edge parallel to 
center line of the pavement. Paving and Rolling operations should be planned such that the 
pavers and rollers do not stop anywhere on the paving mat during the work (to avoid minor 
undulations).
The initial or breakdown rolling shall be done with a vibratory steel wheel roller in vibratory mode. 
However, the vibratory system shall be turned off during the first pass if the mix is too tender 
or plastic. The intermediate rolling shall be done with smooth wheel pneumatic tyred roller of 



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 36
======================================================================
IRC:105-2019
14
15 to 30 tonnes, with a tyre pressure of at least 7 kg/sq cm. The finished rolling shall be done 
with 8 to 10 tonnes smooth wheel roller. Rolling shall continue till all the roller marks are removed 
from the surface and the minimum specified field density is achieved. Rolling pattern shall be 
finalized by engineer while laying the trial bay.
The dense graded bituminous mixes shall be rolled in the longitudinal direction, with the roller as 
close as possible to the paver. The overlap on successive passes should be at least one-third of 
the width of the rear roll or in the case of pneumatic wheeled rollers, at least the nominal width 
of 300 mm. The roller should move at a speed of no more than 5 km/hour. The roller shall not be 
permitted to stand on the pavement, which has not been fully compacted. All precautions shall 
be taken to prevent dropping of oil, grease, petrol or other foreign material on the pavement. The 
wheel of the rollers shall be kept moist with the water or spray system provided with the machine 
to prevent the mixture from adhering to the wheels. Minimum moisture to prevent adhesion 
between wheels and mixture shall be used and surplus water shall not be allowed to stand on 
the partially completed pavement.
The final compaction will be carried out with a pneumatic tyred roller of 15 to 30-ton capacity 
having tyre pressure of 7 kg/sq cm after the of entire paving operations are completed. This 
should be done on bright sunny days such that each area on the entire airfield is rolled minimum 
five times considering overlap of each pass of PTR.
The degree of compaction achieved by rolling shall be determined by cutting 150 mm diameter 
cores from the finished surface. One field density test shall be conducted for every 500 sq m. 
If required cores can be cut as per site condition/finished surface to determine the field density 
and relative compaction in percentage. The field density should be at least 93% of the maximum 
theoretical specific gravity of the loose mix obtained on that day, that is, no more than 7% air 
voids in the compacted mat. The maximum theoretical specific gravity shall be determined in 
accordance with ASTM D 2041 (refer Annexure-II for outline of this test). The portion of the 
work represented by the field density of which is less than 93% of maximum theoretical specific 
gravity shall be rejected.
Where this is not found possible, the work shall be removed and redone by the contractor at his 
own risk and cost. Use of nuclear or non-nuclear portable density gauge to control mat density 
during paving operations is recommended. However, only core density from 150 mm diameter 
cores shall be used for acceptance. Therefore, contractor shall correlate his density gauge with 
cores for that specific project during construction.
3.3.6	
Joints
Echelon paving with two or more pavers should be used to minimize the number of longitudinal 
joints on the airfield. Longitudinal joints in successive layers shall be offset by at least 300 mm 
from parallel joints in the layer beneath.
All joints shall be cut vertical to an even line with a cutting wheel or other suitable device to 
a width not less than the course thickness. All loosened material shall be discarded and the 
vertical face be coated with tack coat of VG-30 or VG-10 viscosity grade bitumen or cold applied 
emulsified bitumen prior to laying the adjacent lane. While spreading the material along the joint 
the material spread shall overlap 25 mm to 40 mm on the previously laid mix beyond the vertical 



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 36
======================================================================
IRC:105-2019
15
face of the joint. The thickness of the loose overlap material should be approximately a quarter 
more than the final compacted thickness. The overlapped mix should be bumped back with a lute 
just across the joint so that the excess material on the hot side can be pressed to obtain a high 
joint density. Rolling of longitudinal joints shall be done with roller on the hot side with 150 mm 
overlap on the previously laid cold lane. The joint density when measured by taking 150 mm 
diameter cores right on the joint shall be at least 90% of the theoretical maximum specific gravity 
obtained on that day. In multi–layer construction, the joints in one layer shall offset the joints in 
the underlying layer by 150 mm. However, the joint in the top layer shall be along the centre line 
of the pavement and to be kept to the minimum.
3.3.7	
Arrangement for Traffic
It shall be ensured that no traffic is allowed on the surface until the paved mat has cooled below 
a temperature of 50oC, at its surface.
3.4	
Controls
3.4.1	
Thickness Control and Measurement
Thickness of various layers shall be accurately maintained during the construction as specified 
in the design and shall be checked/monitored continuously by taking regular levels and 
maintaining level sheets. Regular calibration of sensor paver to be ensured for thickness to be 
spread and compacted thickness should be monitored. In case of dispute the following method 
for determination of thickness be adopted:
Average Thickness Determination Using Cores: In areas where density testing using cores 
has been undertaken in accordance with the clause on compaction the average thickness of 
the course will be determined on the basis of thickness measurements of the cores obtained. 
Measurement of individual cores will be made after cleaning of any adhering material from 
the bottom of the core and shall be the average of four measurements of thickness made at 
approximately 90° apart. Measurements shall be made to the nearest 1 mm and the average of 
the four measurements expressed to the nearest 1 mm. The average thickness of a course in an 
area will be the average thickness of a minimum of four cores expressed to the nearest 1 mm 
and the area for each assessment shall be not less than 1,000 m² and not more than 1,500 m2.
3.4.2	
Determination of Finished Surface Levels
All finished surface levels shall be surveyed by precise levelling instruments and the survey shall 
be undertaken by Engineer-in-Charge. The finished surface level of the completed pavement 
shall not vary by more than 7 mm below or 7 mm above the finished surface level as finalized. 
Not withstanding, the interface of runway or taxiway and shoulders shall be flush.
3.4.3	
Tolerance in Surface Levels of Different Layers
The levels of the subgrade and different pavement layers as constructed shall not vary from 
those calculated with surface to the longitudinal and cross profile of pavement as per ICAO 
standards/Relevant Specifications beyond the tolerances as mentioned below :

accordance with the procedures in IRC:SP:16. The maximum permissible surface unevenness 
using this longitudinal profile 3 m straight edge shall be 3 mm.
Where the surface unevenness falls outside the tolerance, in either case i.e. the surface is low or 
high, the full depth of the layer shall be removed and replaced with fresh material and compacted

Outline of AASHTO T 283, “Resistance of Compacted Asphalt Mixtures to 
Moisture-Induced Damage”
1.	
Scope and Summary of Test Method
This method covers preparation of compacted bituminous mixtures and the measurement of the 
change of diametral tensile strength resulting from the effects of water saturation and laboratory 
accelerated stripping phenomenon with a freeze-thaw cycle. The result may be used to predict 
long-term stripping susceptibility of bituminous mixtures and evaluate liquid anti-stripping 
additives that are added to bitumen or pulverized mineral materials such as hydrated lime, which 
are added to the mineral aggregate.
Each set of 6 compacted specimens is divided into two equal subsets. One subset is tested in 
dry condition for indirect tensile strength. The other subset is subjected to vacuum saturation 
and a freeze-thaw cycle (thawing in a hot water bath) before testing for indirect tensile strength. 
Numerical indices of retained indirect tensile strength properties are calculated from the test 
data obtained by testing the two subsets: dry and conditioned.
2.	
Testing Equipment
(a)	
Vacuum container, vacuum pump, manometer, and other accessories as specified 
in ASTM D 2041, “Theoretical Maximum Specific Gravity and Density of Bituminous 
Paving Mixtures”.
(b)	
Balance or scale accurate to 0.1 percent of the test load 
(c)	
Two water baths capable of maintaining temperatures of 60ºC +/- 1ºC and 
25ºC +/- 0.5ºC
(d)	
Freezer maintained at –18ºC (+/- 3º C)
(e)	
10 ml graduate cylinder
(f)	
Loading jack and ring dynamometer (Marshall stability testing machine can be used) 
to provide a vertical rate of deformation of 50 mm (2 inches) per minute and capable 
of reading the maximum failure load
(g)	
Steel loading strips with a concave surface having a radius equal to the normal 
radius of the test specimen. The loading strips shall be 12.7 mm (0.5 inch) wide for 
specimens 100 mm (4 inches) in diameter. The loading strips for 150 mm (6 inches) 
diameter specimens shall be 19.05 mm (0.75 inch) wide. The length of the loading 
strips shall exceed the thickness of the specimens. Steel strip are provided at the top 
and bottom of specimens during indirect tensile testing.
3.	
Test Procedure
(a)	
Make at least 6 compacted specimens for each mixture, 3 to be tested dry and 3 to 
be tested after partial saturation and moisture conditioning with a freeze-thaw cycle. 
Some extra specimens will need to be made to establish compaction procedures in 
order to obtain specified air void contents in the test specimens by trial and error.

(b)	
Compact the 6 specimens with a Marshall Compactor so that the compacted specimens 
have air voids of 7.0 +/- 0.5 percent. This level of high air voids can be obtained by 
adjusting the number of Marshall blows applied on each side of the specimen by 
trial and error (start at about 10 blows as a starting point). Air void content must be 
calculated from the bulk specific gravity of the compacted specimen (determined by 
saturated surface dry method as per procedure given in the Asphalt Institute MS-2) 
and the maximum theoretical specific gravity of the loose bituminous mixture obtained 
by ASTM D 2041.
(c)	
Separate the 6 specimens into 2 subsets so that the average air voids of the two 
subsets are approximately equal.
(d)	
One set will be tested dry. Keep it at room temperature and then place in a 25ºC (+/- 
0.5ºC) water bath for 2 hours prior to determining their indirect tensile strength.
(e)	
The other subset will be conditioned as follows: 
	
(i)	
Place and submerge the 3 specimens in the vacuum container filled with water 
at room temperature. Apply a vacuum of 13-67 kPa absolute pressure (10-26 
inches Hg partial pressure) for 30 minutes. Remove the vacuum and leave the 
specimens submerged in water for 5 to 10 minutes. (Note: The water saturation 
procedure noted above deviates from AASHTO T 283, which obtains a specified 
degree of saturation. The above procedure keeps the time of saturation constant).
	
(ii)	
Wrap a plastic film around eachsaturated specimen and place the wrapped 
specimen in a plastic bag containing 10 ml of water and seal the plastic bag. 
Place the plastic bag in a freezer at temperature of –18ºC +/- 3ºC for a minimum 
of 16 hours. Remove the specimens from the freezer.
	
(iii)	 Place the specimens in a waterbath maintained at 60ºC +/- 1ºC for 24 hours. 
Remove the plastic bag and the plastic film from each specimen after placing 
the specimens under water.
	
(iv)	 Remove the specimens from hotwater bath and place in a water bath maintained 
at 25ºC +/- 0.5ºC for 2 hours.
	
(v)	
Remove the conditioned specimens and test for indirect tensile strength.
(f)	
Determine the indirect tensile strength of the 3 dry and 3 conditioned specimens at 
25º C +/- 0.5ºC after removing from water bath. First, measure their mean thicknesses 
(t). Then place the two steel loading strips on the bottom and top of the specimens 
across diameter and place in the Marshall testing machine or a compression-testing 
machine. Apply load to the specimens diametrally at a vertical rate of 50 mm (2 inches) 
per minute.
(g)	
Record the maximum compressive strength noted on the testing machine and continue 
loading until a vertical crack appears in the specimen. Remove the cracked specimen 
from the machine and visually estimate the approximate degree of moisture damage 
(extent of stripped or bare aggregate) on the fractured faces of the specimen on a 
scale of 0 to 5 (5 being the most stripping).

Calculate the tensile strength (St) in SI units of each specimen as follows: 
St = 2000 P/π td 
                 Where,	
St = tensile strength, kPa
	
P = maximum loads, N
	
t = specimen thickness, mm
	
d = specimen diameter, mm
(i)	
Express the numerical index of resistance of bituminous mixture to the detrimental 
effects of water as the ratio of the original strength that is retained after accelerated 
moisture and freeze-thaw conditioning. 
	
Calculate the tensile strength ratio (TSR) as follows:
	
Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR) = 100*(S2 / S1)
	
Where,
	
S1 = average tensile strength of the dry subset, kPa
	
S2 = average tensile strength of the conditioned subset, kPa

Annexure II
Outline of ASTM D 2041, “Theoretical Maximum Specific Gravity and 
Density of Bituminous Paving Mixtures”
1.	
Scope and Summary of the Test Method
This test method covers the determination of the theoretical maximum specific gravity and density 
of uncompacted bituminous paving mixtures at 25ºC. The theoretical maximum specific gravity 
(Gmm) is used: (a) to calculate air voids in compacted bituminous mixtures, (b) to calculate the 
amount of bitumen absorbed by the aggregate, and (c) to provide target value for the compaction 
of paving mixtures in the field.
A sample of loose paving mixture is placed in a tarred vacuum vessel. Water at 25ºC is added 
to completely submerge the sample. A specified amount of vacuum is gradually applied to 
remove the air bubbles entrapped between asphalt mix particles. After the vacuum is released, 
the volume of the sample of the void less paving mixture is obtained by either immersing the 
vacuum container with the sample in a water bath and weighing or by filling the calibrated vacuum 
container level full of water and weighing in air.
2.	
Testing Equipment
(a)	
Container (either i or ii detailed below)
	
i.	
Vacuum bowls – Either a metal or plastic bowl with a diameter arranging from 
180 to 260 mm and a bowl height of at least 160 mm. The bowl shall be equipped 
with a stiff, transparent cover fitted with a rubber gasket and a connection for the 
vacuum line. The hose connection shall be covered with a small piece of fine 
wire mesh to minimize loss of any fine material from the mix. 
	
ii.	
Vacuum flask for weighing in air only – A thick-walled volumetric glass flask with 
a capacity of approx. 4000 ml, fitted with a rubber stopper with a connection for 
the vacuum line. The hose connection shall be covered with a small piece of fine 
wire mesh to minimize loss of any fine material from the mix.
(b)	
Balance capable of being read to the nearest 0.1 gram. If weighing is to be done 
under water, a suitable suspension arrangement shall be provided for weighing the 
sample while suspended from the center of the balance.
(c)	
Vacuum pump, capable of evacuating air from the vacuum container to a residual 
pressure of 4.0 kPa (30 mm of Hg) or less. Provide a suitable trap between the pump 
and container to minimize water vapour entering the vacuum pump.
(d)	
Residual pressure manometer or calibrated absolute pressure gauge with a bleed 
valve to adjust the vacuum level.
(e)	
Water bath capable of maintaining a constant temperature of 25ºC +/-1ºC and suitable 
for immersion of the suspended container.

3.	
Calibration of Containers
(a)	
Bowls – Determine the mass (B) of the container immersed in water at 25ºC +/- 1ºC. 
If the bowl is used for weighing in air, place the volumetric lid on the bowl while under 
water. Remove the water-filled bowl with the lid in place and dry prior to determining 
the combined mass of the bowl, lid and water. Repeat 3 times and average the 
3 masses. Designate the average mass as D.
(b)	
Flasks – Calibrate the volumetric flask by accurately determining the mass of the 
flask filled with water at 25ºC +/- 1ºC. Use a glass cover plate to ensure the flask is 
completely full.
4.	
Test Procedure
(a)	
Separate the particles of the loose paving mixture (while it is warm) by hand so that 
the particles are not larger than about 6 mm. Do not fracture the aggregate. Place the 
mix sample directly into the tared bowl or flask. Weigh the container with the sample 
and designate the net mass of the sample only as A. (Note: The minimum sample 
size shall be 1500 g for mixes with nominal maximum aggregate sizes of 12.5 mm or 
smaller; and shall be 2500 g for mixes with nominal maximum aggregate sizes from 
19 to 25 mm.)
(b)	
Add sufficient water at 25ºC to cover the sample completely. Place the cover (bowels) 
or stopper (flasks) on the containers.
(c)	
Place the container with the sample and water on a mechanical agitation device or 
agitate manually at frequent intervals (2 to 3 minutes). Begin removing entrapped air 
by gradually applying vacuum and increasing the vacuum pressure until the residual 
manometer reads 3.7 +/- 0.3 kPa (27.5 +/- 2.5 mm of Hg). After achieving this level 
within 2 minutes, continue the vacuum and agitation for 15 +/- 2 minutes. Gradually 
release the vacuum with the bleed valve.
(d)	
Weighing in water: Suspend the bowl (without lid) and contents in water for 10 +/- 1 
minutes and then determine mass. Designate the mass under water of the bowl and 
sample as C.
(e)	
Weighing in air: 
	
i.	
Bowl – Submerge the bowl and sample slowly in the 25ºC +/- water bath. Keep 
it there for 10 +/- 1 minutes. Immerse the lid in water and slide it onto the bowl 
without removing water from the bowl so that no air is trapped inside the bowl. 
Remove the bowl with the lid in place from the water bath. Dry the bowl and lid 
with a dry cloth. Determine the mass of the bowl, sample, and lid and designate 
it as E. 
	
ii.	
Flask – Fill the flask slowly with water ensuring not to introduce any air into 
the sample. Place the flask in water bath for 10 +/- 1 minutes to stabilize the 
temperature at 25ºC without submerging the top of the flask. Completely fill the 
flask with water using a cover plate without entrapping air beneath the cover 
plate. Wipe the exterior of the flask and cover plate. Determine the mass of the 
flask, plate and its contents completely filled with water. Designate this mass as 
E.
