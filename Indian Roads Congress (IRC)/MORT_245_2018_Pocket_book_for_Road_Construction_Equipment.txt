Foreword
It gives me great pleasure to present the first edition of the Pocket 
Book for Road Construction Equipment.
The highway sector in India is poised for rapid growth and 
mechanisation plays an important role in achieving economy, 
speed and quality in highway construction and maintenance. 
Currently, there exists no single document covering all major 
equipment involved in road construction. Therefore, an initiative 
has been taken to come out with a compilation of construction 
equipment for road, bridge and tunnel works.
The Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment is meant to act 
as a single-stop platform for acquainting the practising Highway 
Engineers and stakeholders with the mechanisation aspect 
involved in each activity of road making. References to Ministry’s 
Specifications for Road & Bridge Works have been drawn for 
each construction activity. Critical equipment for road and bridge 
works as well as tunnel works has been discussed. A summary 
of various quality control tests along with requisite apparatus and 
reference IS Codes has also been included for easy reference. 
This book has been compiled based upon extensive study of 
the IRC Publications and IS Codes and review of literature and 
current practices.
The Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment is the result 
of the untiring efforts of the officers of the Roads Wing and other 
professionals who contributed to the drafting of this document. 
I wish to express my appreciation for the efforts put in by 
Shri K.C. Sharma, Shri Ananyabrata Maulik, Shri N.K. Nayak 
and Dr. Sanjay Wakchaure in preparing this document and GSS 
Committee for reviewing the document.

Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
I hope this Pocket Book, in its present form, will prove to be very 
useful for day to day reference for all the engineers in highway 
profession. However, the compilation of this kind of Pocket Book 
will need to be updated periodically with changes in technology 
and environment. The Indian Roads Congress would, therefore, 
welcome suggestions and feedback from users so that any 
further amplification/ modification/ updating may be attempted in 
due course.

1. INTRODUCTION
The highway sector in India has witnessed a rapid growth and this 
momentum shall continue. Mechanisation has played an important 
role in achieving economy, speed and quality in highway construction 
and maintenance. To support the construction industry and the road 
departments, an initiative has been taken by the Roads Wing of 
Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) to come out with a 
comprehensive compilation of construction equipment for road, bridge 
and tunnel works.
The first draft document was prepared by Shri Ananyabrata Maulik. 
Inputs from Shri K.C. Sharma, Shri N.K. Nayak, Dr. Sanjay Wakchaure 
and representatives of Construction and Equipment Industry and 
professionals from government organisations including Border 
Roads Organisation(BRO) were incorporated in the document. The 
document was approved by the General Specifications and Standards 
Committee(GSS) in its meeting held on 25.04.2018. The Executive 
Committee of IRC approved the document in its meeting held on 
03.05.2018 with some comments. The document, after incorporating 
necessary changes, was approved by the IRC Council in its 
215th meeting held at Aizawl (Mizoram) on 04.05.2018 for printing.
2. SCOPE
This document is intended  to act as a one-stop platform for acquainting 
the practising engineers and stakeholders with the mechanisation 
aspect involved in each activity of road construction and maintenance. 
This document has been compiled based upon extensive study of the 
IRC Publications, BIS Codes, review of literature and current practices.
This document is divided into five parts. Parts A and B cover 
equipment catering to road and bridge works respectively. 
References have been made to MoRTH Specifications. Each 
essential equipment for road and bridge works has been explained 
separately and specifications provided with respect to equipment 
performance. Part C covers equipment for tunnel works, where 
the various tunnelling methods along with types of Tunnel Boring 
Machine (TBM) and Tunnel Ventilation System (TVS) have been 
explained. Part D lists out the requisite apparatus for various quality 
control tests as well as the essential equipment recommended to be 
maintained in the central and plant laboratories. Part E identifies the 



======================================================================

======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
2
essential equipment for restoration works in landslide management. 
This list of equipment may also be used as reference for mitigation 
of other disasters like floods.
Important aspects of Bailey bridge have been included along with 
recommendations on its selection criteria. Emission norms for 
construction equipment vehicles and diesel gensets are included in 
the Appendices.
Surveying techniques and equipment have not been included in this 
document. Instrumentation for bridges and tunnels is also beyond the 
scope of this document.

for excavating with a bucket, without movement of the chassis or 
undercarriage during any part of the work cycle of the machine. An 
excavator work cycle normally comprises excavating, elevating, 
swinging and discharge of material. It can also be used for object or 
material handling/transportation.
Hydraulic excavators are versatile machines and are characterized 
by short cycle times, positive and precise control of attachments, high 
overall efficiency, smoothness and ease of operation.
A hydraulic excavator comprises of the following:
i)	
Base Machine with a cab or canopy and operator-
protective structures (if required) and possessing 
necessary mountings for equipment and attachments
ii)	
Equipment or Work Attachment (consisting of boom, 
arm/stick and bucket) catering to the primary design 
function of the excavator
iii)	
Other attachments for specific use
4.2.2	
In the road construction sector, the hydraulic excavator finds 
use for the following applications:
i)	
Site Clearance and Initial Site Preparation
ii)	
Quarrying
iii)	
Cutting and Filling
iv)	
Construction of Embankment
v)	
Breaking of Rocks

4.2.3	
Hydraulic excavator may be classified on the basis of 
undercarriage, type of equipment (or work attachment) or operating 
weight.
Based on undercarriage, excavators may be:
i)	
Crawler (or track) type
ii)	
Wheeled type
The crawler type machine has advantages of better floatation, better 
traction, better manoeuvrability and faster repositioning. It can work 
where ground conditions are severe. The shoe selection of the tracks

is determined by the underfoot conditions. The wheeled machine has 
advantages of better mobility and speed. It does not damage paved 
surfaces and stability is achieved by stabilisers.
Based on equipment (or work attachment), excavators may be 
classified as:
i)	
Hoe type (for cutting towards the machine and generally 
downwards; primarily used for below-ground level 
excavation)
ii)	
Shovel type (for cutting away from the machine and 
generally upwards; primarily used for above-ground 
level excavation)
iii)	
Clamshell type (for digging or grabbing in a generally 
vertical direction, discharging below and above the 
ground reference plane)
iv)	
Telescoping boom type (primarily used for excavation 
and/or grading of slopes above or below the ground)
Based on operating weight and with respect to application in the 
highway sector, excavators may be classified as:
i)	
Class I type (operating weight < 6 tonne)
ii)	
Class II type (operating weight 6–8 tonne)
iii)	
Class III type (operating weight 8–12 tonne)
iv)	
Class IV type (operating weight 12–19 tonne)
v)	
Class V type (operating weight 19–25 tonne)
vi)	
Class VI type (operating weight 25–36 tonne)
vii)	
Class VII type (operating weight > 36 tonnes)
Class V excavators are preferred for most construction activities. 
Class III excavators are suited for applications in trenching, irrigation 
and utility works, while Class VI and Class VII excavators are preferred 
in quarries and pits.
4.2.4	
Hydraulic excavators can be equipped with a wide variety of 
attachments like:

Operating weight of the excavator
ii)	
Hydraulic capability of the system
4.2.5	
Buckets are rated on both their struck and heaped capacities. 
Bucket capacity is usually expressed in terms of loose cubic metre 
(lcm).
4.2.6	
Hydraulic excavators with engine power ranging from 60 HP 
to 250 HP and bucket capacity varying from 0.09 cum to 2.10 cum are 
usually used in the highway sector.
4.2.7	
Since an excavator is primarily used for material handling 
and cutting, its performance can be evaluated by considering two 
important parameters:
i)	
Lifting Capacity
ii)	
Digging Capacity
Major factors that affect excavator performance are:
i)	
Site Conditions – site topography and geology, 
geotechnical characteristics of ground/rocks, climate 
etc.

Backhoe Loader
4.6.1	
Backhoe Loader (Figure 7) is a self-propelled crawler or 
wheeled machine having a main frame designed to carry both front-
mounted equipment (with loader attachment) and rear-mounted 
equipment (with backhoe attachment), normally with outriggers or 
stabilisers. When used in the backhoe mode, the machine is stationary 
and normally digs below ground level. When used in the loader mode, 
the machine loads through forward motion. 
A backhoe work cycle normally comprises excavating, elevating, 
swinging and discharging of material. A loader work cycle normally 
comprises filling, elevating, transporting and discharging of material.
Figure 7: Backhoe Loader
4.6.2	
Backhoe Loader is the most common piece of construction 
equipment for any road project. It is ideal for light excavation, 
trenching, backfilling, material moving, light underground utility works, 
site clearance, loading and other miscellaneous jobs.
Besides being used as a hoe or a loader, this machine can also 
accommodate different accessories and attachments for different 
operations, thereby increasing its versatility on a job site. Some of the 
common attachments are hydraulic rock breaker, trenching bucket, 
broom, auger, log fork, pallet fork etc.
4.6.3	
Loader bucket capacity of backhoe loader is usually about 
1–1.2 cum, while the backhoe bucket capacity is about 0.18–0.3 cum. 
4.7	
Crusher
4.7.1	
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large size rocks 
into smaller size aggregates, gravel or stone dust.



======================================================================
PAGE 66 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
46
4.7.2	
Crushers use one or combination of the following four 
mechanisms for size reduction – impact, attrition, shearing and 
compression.
4.7.3	
Crushing operation is usually carried out in multiple stages 
through step reduction. This is because the amount of size reduction 
achieved is directly related to the energy applied. When there is a 
significant difference between the feed size and the desired final 
size of the crushed product, a large amount of energy is required. 
Providing this energy in a single-step process will generate excessive 
fines, leading to wastage. Hence, the degree of crushing is spread 
over three or four stages as a means of closely controlling the product 
size.
Figures 8 and 9 illustrate basic stages of crushing activity. Crushing 
operation begins with a primary crusher (jaw crusher). ROM (run-of-
mine) boulders/rocks received in tipper trucks feed a dump hopper. 
Grizzly feeder located below dump hopper takes out the ROM feed 
at a controlled rate to feed the jaw crusher. It also prevents oversized 
material from entering the crusher and blocking its opening. Jaw 
crusher produces the first reduction in stone size, and its output is 
fed to a secondary crusher (cone crusher). Cone crusher is mostly 
operated at 25 mm CSS (Closed Side Setting) to produce (−) 55 mm 
product. Since product requirement is (−) 40 mm for road projects, 
(+) 40 mm product is recirculated to the cone crusher. A tertiary cone 
crusher may be used to achieve further size reduction in case of a four 
stage crushing plant. However, product from cone crusher may not be 
cubical shaped. To obtain cubical aggregates maintaining combined 
flakiness and elongation index within 30% as per specifications, a 
vertical shaft impactor (VSI) is required.
Screen decks are used in between the crushing stages to separate 
the aggregates into different specification sizes.

4.7.4	
Jaw Crusher (Figures 10 and 11): It is used as a primary 
crusher. It is selected on the basis of maximum lump size and plant 
capacity.
The jaw crusher contains two rectangular surfaces of jaws, one of 
which alternately approaches and recedes from the other. The jaws 
contain an angle and, together with two side plates, enclose a wedge 
shaped cavity which is wider at the upper or feed end. The material 
fed at the upper end gets crushed mainly by compression between 
the two jaws and discharges through the lower outlet. Maximum 
dimension of feed opening (gape) and the product size is determined 
by the width of discharge aperture when the jaw has retreated fully 
(open side setting).
The moving jaw may be actuated by one of the two principal 
mechanisms - ‘single toggle’ or ‘double toggle’.
The size of a jaw crusher is indicated by the jaw width and the charging 
gap width, expressed in mm.
For more information on Jaw Crusher, refer to IS:4254.

Figure 11: Jaw Crusher (Double Toggle Type)
4.7.5	
Cone Crusher (Figure 12): It is used for secondary and 
tertiary crushing. The upper half of a cone crusher consists of a conical 
crushing chamber lined with manganese steel plates called concaves 
within which an upright conical crushing head moves with an eccentric 
motion. The crushing head is mounted on a vertical steel shaft and 
suspended from the spider at the top of the frame. The lower half of the 
crusher consists of support for the shaft and driving gears. Eccentric 
rotation of the shaft causes the crushing head to gyrate within the 
crushing chamber, thereby varying the space between the concaves 
and the head and crushing the stones by attrition and compression.
Depending upon the type of cone and throw, cone crusher can be 
classified as:
i)	
Standard Cone Type – It is suited for application as a 
secondary crusher. It has a steeply inclined crushing 
chamber with shallow angle of cone and a flatter, less 
steeply inclined conical crushing head. It has a wider 
and longer crushing cavity to accommodate larger size 
feed material.
ii)	
Short-Head Cone Type – It is suited for application as 
a tertiary crusher or fine cone crusher. It has a shorter 
crushing head and a smaller throw. Both the crushing 
chamber and crushing head are steeply inclined to

promote the gravitational flow of more finely sized 
material, resulting in a shorter and a more parallel 
crushing cavity compared to the standard cone type. 
The size of a cone crusher is indicated by the diameter of the discharge 
annulus.
For more information on Cone Crusher, refer to IS:4255.
Figure 12: Cone Crusher
4.7.6	
Vertical Shaft Impactor (VSI) (Figure 13): It consists of 
an open or closed type impeller/rotor fitted with specially developed 
carbide tip ports. This impeller is mounted on a vertical shaft assembly, 
with special bearing arrangement suitable for high speeds. An outer 
ring with anvils or rock-on-rock crushing chamber is arranged around 
the impeller. Drive to the shaft assembly is given through ‘V’ belts with 
belt tensioning arrangement. Hydraulic lid lifter is provided for easy 
and quick access to major parts.

The feed material enters through feed hopper and then feed tube into 
feed cone at the centre of the impeller, which is rotating at a high 
speed. Material particles that enter the impeller attain kinetic energy 
and come out of the impeller into the crushing chamber with required 
centrifugal force (i.e. high tangential velocity) and hit the stationary 
anvils or rock box. Thus, these particles crack under their own force at 
natural fault lines and joint surfaces, and the flaky ends of the particles 
are sheared to form into cubical shape. Once particles have lost their 
kinetic energy, they will fall down, out of the crushing chamber, usually 
onto a conveyor belt at the bottom of the crusher.
Instead of sending the entire feed material into the rotor, a portion 
of the feed material may be cascaded in controlled quantity into the 
crushing chamber turbulence to increase the particle population within 
the crushing chamber, thereby improving the energy transfer and 
rock-on-rock chain reaction of crushing and grinding.

The performance of a crusher is indicated by its output/
capacity (in TPH). The capacity will vary with the type of stone/rock, 
feed size, final product size and extent to which the stone is fed 
uniformly into the crusher.
4.7.8	
Crushing plants with capacities ranging from 200 to 450 TPH 
are usually preferred in the road sector for processing of aggregates.

Execution period for most of the road projects in a particular stretch is 
usually two to three years and, thereafter, the infrastructure machinery 
has to be shifted to a new location. Hence, track mounted crushing 
stations (Figure 14) are favoured these days on account of the 
following advantages:
i)	
They are totally shop assembled without any site related 
activity for erection.
ii)	
They do not require any type of RCC works 
(e.g. retaining wall, foundation works etc.).
iii)	
They can be directly positioned at the working site and 
started immediately. 
Figure 14: Track Mounted Crushing Station
4.7.9	
Sand Preparation Plant (Manufactured Sand) – Natural 
sand is a scarce resource and its mining from river bed may lead to 
adverse environmental consequences. Hence, there is a need for an 
alternative source of sand. Moreover, sand requirement in the road 
and bridge construction sector has gone up, which cannot be met with 
standard crushing plant operations. This has led to the introduction of 
special type of cone crushers known as sanders to operate at lower 
settings to maximise the production of manufactured sand (M-sand). 
This equipment is added to standard crushing circuit where part of 
higher sized products can be converted to sand.
4.7.10	 Sand Classifier – The purpose of a sand classifier is to improve 
the quality of sand by removing unwanted material like silt, clay, dirt 
etc. and to reduce the percentage of ultrafines (−150 µ size) in sand 
to permissible limits as per specifications. This in turn will optimise the 
consumption of bitumen/cement in road/bridge construction. 



======================================================================
PAGE 74 of 316

Sand classification can be done either by wet or dry process. In dry 
process, air is used as medium to separate fine and coarse particles 
while in wet process, water is used as the separating medium.
i)	
Dry Classifier (Figure 15) – It consists of two coaxial 
cylinders, which work like an external cone and an inner 
cone. The circulating fan creates a centrifugal air flow 
that rises within the inner cylinder and then descends 
in the intermediate zone between the two cylinders. At 
the return vanes, air flow returns to the central cylinder. 
Sand particles are fed into the centre of the classifier, 
where they are dispersed by a rotating distributor and 
then meet the rising centrifugal air flow. The air vortex 
separates the coarser and finer particles – the finer 
particles will rise with the air flow and pass through the 
circulating fan while the coarser particles will be pushed 
outwards, due to greater centrifugal force, against 
the surrounding wall (of the inner cylinder) and fall 
downwards on to a chute and stockpiled on the ground 
through a conveyor belt. As the fines descend with the 
air flow to the return vanes, they lose momentum and 
continue downwards while the air flow turns into the 
centre of the classifier. These fines are discharged from 
the classifier bottom into a conveyor and transferred to 
a closed tank.

ii)	
Wet Classifier – Two types of wet classifiers are 
commonly used: hydro cyclone sand washer and 
bucket wheel sand washer.
a)	
Hydro Cyclone Sand Washer (Figure 16) – It 
consists of a slurry tank, a hydro cyclone and 
dewatering screen. Sand is fed to the feed chute 
through a belt conveyor. It then passes through 
the feed box, where water is added.  The slurry 
is fed to the first half portion of the dewatering 
screen, which separates out coarser sand 
particles [(−)5 (+)2.36 mm] and finer sand [(−)2.36 
mm] along with water is discharged to slurry tank 
below screen and, thereafter, pumped to the 
hydro cyclone. The feed slurry enters the hydro 
cyclone tangentially under pressure through the 
feed pipe into the top of the cylindrical section 
of the cyclone. It then follows a circulating path 
with high velocity within the cyclone, causing 
centrifugal forces to accelerate the movement of 
the particles towards the outer wall. The particles 
migrate downward in a spiral pattern through the 
cylindrical section and into the conical section. 
At this point the smaller mass particles migrate 
toward the centre and spiral upward and out 
through the vortex finder, discharging through 
the overflow pipe. This product, which contains 
the finer particles and the majority of the water, is 
Figure 16: Hydro Cyclone Sand Washer



======================================================================
PAGE 76 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
56
termed the overflow and is sent to slurry settling 
pond. The higher mass (i.e. coarser) particles 
remain in a downward spiral path along the 
walls of the conical section and gradually exit 
through the apex orifice. This product is termed 
the underflow and is discharged on to the second 
half portion of the dewatering screen to reduce 
the moisture percentage.
	
There are various factors that govern the 
performance of the hydro cyclone – cyclone 
diameter, area of inlet nozzle, difference between 
pressure at inlet and outlet, amount of particles 
versus water, size and shape of the particles etc.
b)	
Bucket Wheel Sand Washer (Figure 17) – 
It requires low drive power and consists of a 
fabricated tank/trough equipped with a helical 
screw and a dewatering wheel (with perforated 
buckets to drain water).
Figure 17: Bucket Wheel Sand Washer
 
	
Sand and sufficient quantity of water enters the 
trough in a non-turbulent section on the bucket 
wheel. Sand gets settled at bottom of the trough, 
and the principle of decantation is used with 
low turbulence flow – the slow and continuously 
revolving screw churns and moves the sand up 
a slope towards the rotating bucket wheel in the 
opposite direction of water flow. During this action, 
the silt/clay/dirt content in sand is dissolved in 
water and washed away by the cross-flow. To 
avoid saturation of silt/clay/dirt, a continuous 
supply of water is maintained depending upon 
the silt/clay/dirt content in sand. The waste 



======================================================================
PAGE 77 of 316
======================================================================

57
water flows over a weir at the opposite end of 
the bucket wheel. The cleaned sand, segregated 
at the upper portion of the trough, is dredged by 
the rotating dewatering bucket wheel and then 
dropped on to the discharge chute or dewatering 
screen for getting a washed product at outlet.
	
The output of the bucket wheel classifier can be 
adjusted with the following factors – speed of 
screw, quantity of water and the inclination of the 
trough.

The use of trucks as the primary hauling unit provides a high degree 
of flexibility, as the number in service can usually be increased or 
decreased easily to permit modifications in the total hauling capacity 
of a fleet.
Tipper trucks varying in size from 5 cum to 14 cum are usually 
preferred for road construction works. Tippers with 18 cum capacity 
are also available and are suited for large bridge/tunnelling works.

Wet Mix Plant
4.10.1	 A central mixing plant used for producing wet mix macadam is 
called a Wet Mix Plant (Figure 22). It has provision for:
i)	
Controlled feeding of aggregates of different sizes in 
the required proportion.
ii)	
Addition of specified quantity of water.
iii)	
Addition of specified quantity of other ingredients like 
lime or cement.
iv)	
Forced/positive mixing of all the ingredients to produce 
a consistent homogeneous mix.

4.10.3	 Efficient wet mix plant operation starts with the cold aggregate 
feeder (consisting of four or more bins). The functions of the feeder 
system are to provide an even flow of accurately metered aggregates 
(meeting the gradation requirements) and provide surge storage 
capacity between the feeders and aggregate stockpiles.
Only graded aggregates are to be fed to the feeder system. Otherwise, 
grizzly screens are to be put over the bins. Aggregate flow may be 
regulated by adjustment of gate opening and/or belt speed of the 
auxiliary conveyor below each bin.
Gathering conveyor collects aggregates of different sizes from the 
auxiliary conveyors fitted under each bin and discharges it into the 
slinger conveyor through an oversize rejection screen.
A continuous electronic weighing arrangement with load cell is 
mounted on the slinger conveyor to continuously monitor the total 
weight of aggregates being fed into the pug mill and synchronize it 
with the feed of water and other filler additives.
The twin-shaft pug mill receives aggregates from slinger conveyor 
and requisite, precise amount of water from water system and filler 
additives from filler fines feeding system, and thereafter facilitates 
forced action-mixing of the mix ingredients to ensure continuous 
outflow of uniform, homogenous mix at its discharge end.
The gob hopper arrangement at the discharge end of pug mill (or at 
the end of load-out conveyor) allows the discharge of mix into tipper 
truck without any segregation.
4.10.4	 A pug mill’s ability to achieve a homogeneous, thoroughly 
coated mix in a given number of seconds is influenced by many design 
variables:
i)	
Pug Mill’s shape, proportions and volume
ii)	
Paddle tip number, size and peripheral speed
iii)	
Paddle arm and tip shape
iv)	
Paddle arrangement
v)	
Power input
In order to have a consistent output capacity, a minimum of 230 cm2 
face area is suggested for paddle tip size. However, this may vary 
from manufacturer to manufacturer.
The number of paddle tips provided should be sufficient to ensure 
consistency of homogeneous mixing. Based on data available for 



======================================================================

various reputed manufacturers, the thumb rule of 1 paddle tip for 
every 4.6 TPH of plant output capacity may be considered to work out 
the requirement of paddle tips. This is given in Table 12.

4.10.6	 Wet Mix Plants with capacities ranging from 60 TPH to 
300 TPH are being used in India and, accordingly, a genset with 
matching capacity (usually ranging from 37.5 KVA to 150 KVA) is to be 
used to meet the power requirement.
4.10.7	 For more information on Wet Mix Plant, refer to IRC:126.
4.11	
Soil Stabilisation Equipment
4.11.1	 Soil Stabilisation improves the soil properties by mixing with 
binding agent and water, thereby producing high quality construction 
material. The binding agent can be lime, cement, fly ash or any 
special chemical stabiliser specifically oriented to the soil to be 



======================================================================
PAGE 84 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
64
treated. The choice of binding agent depends upon the soil type and 
conditions.
Soil Stabilisation offers the following advantages:
i)	
Improved soil strength and bearing capacity
ii)	
More economical in terms of cost and energy to 
increase the bearing capacity of the soil than going for 
replacement of the existing soil
iii)	
Increased soil stability in slopes or other places
iv)	
Prevent soil erosion and dust formation, which is very 
useful particularly in dry and arid weather
v)	
Soil water-proofing (which prevents water from entering 
into the soil) and prevent soil from losing its strength
vi)	
Reduce change in soil volume due to change in 
temperature or moisture content 
vii)	
Improved soil workability and durability
Soil can be stabilised either by Mix In Place or Plant Mix method. The 
Mix In Place method is usually more economical.
4.11.2	 For in situ soil stabilisation (Figure 23) depicts the typical 
equipment train involved), binder is first pre-spread by a binder spreader 
on the soil to be treated. The spreader is usually truck-mounted 
or tractor-mounted and should be equipped with an electronically 
controlled dosing system for accurately proportioning and uniformly 
distributing the binder, regardless of the spreader’s drive speed.
Figure 23: In Situ Soil Stabilisation Train
The spreader is followed by a mobile soil stabiliser (Figure 24), which is 
a self-propelled construction vehicle on four wheels (with independent 
power to these wheels) and equipped with suitable hydraulic flow 



======================================================================

distributer to avoid slippage of wheels and ensure maximum stability. 
The stabiliser has a powered milling cum mixing drum with a number 
of tools mounted on it in spatial alignment for milling up the existing 
soil and pre-spread binder and blending them with water to produce 
a homogeneous soil mixture. The mixing chamber should have a 
microprocessor-controlled spraying system for accurately metering 
and monitoring the quantity of water added.

The stabiliser should have in built engine of suitable capacity, 
preferably with belt drive system to drive the milling/pulverising drum. 
In case, belt drive system is used, it should have automatic belt 
tensioner system.
The milling cum mixing drum should have minimum working width of 
2000 mm with provisions for variable depth control and variable drum 
speed to meet site requirements. The working depth can be varied by 
lowering or raising of the complete drum and automatic adjustment 
of the mixing space in response to the particular working depth (i.e. 
larger mixing space with greater working depth). Variable drum speed 
can be obtained by combination of selectable engine speeds and 
adjustable drive belt pulley arrangements to achieve optimum working 
results.
The mobile stabiliser should have an air-conditioned cabin with 
operator console for all controls and safety features.



======================================================================

Other than the self-propelled type, it is also possible to use a tractor-
driven stabiliser with the above features.
The stabiliser is followed by a soil compactor (usually padfoot) and 
then a motor grader and, subsequently, another soil compactor for 
compacting and grading the soil mixture to the required specifications.
4.11.3	 A Wet Mix Plant can be used with slight modification and other 
optional devices (e.g. addition of lime or cement) for soil stabilisation 
by Plant Mix method. Such a soil stabilisation plant is stationary.
4.12	
Tractor-Rotavator and Disc Harrow
4.12.1	 A rotavator (Figure 25) is usually tractor-driven. It is equipped 
with rotating blades that break up soil for mixing and blending the soil 
with additives. Power to the rotary shaft can be transferred either from 
one of two ends or from the centre through chain and sprocket.
Figure 25: Rotavator
4.12.2	 Alternatively, Disc Harrow (Figure 26) is used for pulverisation 
and mixing of soil/aggregates and additives. It consists of multiple 
numbers of iron or steel discs which have slight concavity and are 
arranged into sections. The discs are also offset so that they are not 
parallel with the overall direction of the implement. This is so, they 
slice the ground they cut over a little bit to optimize the result. The 
concavity of the discs as well as their being offset causes them to 
loosen and pick up the soil they cut. Modern disc harrows are tractor-
driven and are raised hydraulically.

Figure 26: Disc Harrow
4.12.3	 Although a mobile soil stabiliser is the preferred equipment for 
the Mix in Place method of soil stabilisation, tractor driven rotavator 
and disc harrow may be used for small scale works. 
The ability of a tractor driven rotavator or disc harrow to pulverise 
and mix soil efficiently for in situ soil stabilisation is determined by 
its engine power and depends upon the plasticity of the soil material. 
For cohesive soils, a factor of the plasticity index of the soil multiplied 
by the percentage of the fraction of the soil finer than 425 micron in 
particle diameter may be used to suggest the choice of equipment 
(Table 14).

Road Sweeper
4.13.1	 A road broom or sweeper (Figure 27) performs the following 
functions:
i)	
Sweeping/Cleaning – Removal of dust and loose 
foreign material from the pavement prior to application 
of binder.
ii)	
Drag Brooming – Uniformly distribute inconsistently 
spread aggregate chips in case of chip seal application.
iii)	
Removal of loose aggregate chips from completed work 
in case of chip seal application.
In dry conditions, sweeping may cause considerable dust pollution. 
This is controlled with water applied by water tanker.
The following types of road sweepers are available:

4.13.2	 Rotary Broom – The most common form of rotary broom is a 
cylindrical broom that can range from 500 mm to 1000 mm in diameter 
and from 2 m to 3 m in length. The broom bristles should be of even 
length to ensure best performance. The broom is usually tractor-
mounted or towed. It may also be mounted on the front of truck.
The broom may be equipped with a dust collection bin at its rear for 
collection of dust and debris. It is then taken to a pit where it disposes 
the waste via a manual or hydraulic dump mechanism. In case, it is 
required to sweep the dust sideways, the broom shaft may be swung 
relative to the longitudinal direction of travel via a manual adjustment 
pin or hydraulic cylinders. 
For efficient operation, the rotating speed of the broom needs to be 
matched to the forward speed of the tractor/truck. If the machine is 
travelling too fast relative to the broom rotation, the bristles will tend to 
scuff over the surface (causing excess wear and tear of the bristles) 
and leave dirt behind. 
Pressure settings of the broom should be selected such that the bristles 
apply minimum pressure on to the pavement, which is consistent with 
the cleaning operation. Pressure settings may be manual or automatic.
Rotary brooms may be of two types:
i)	
Mechanical Broom – The broom shaft is mechanically 
driven through Power Take Off (PTO) from the tractor 
engine. Raising and lowering of the broom is achieved 
manually.
	
The broom is mounted on two wheels, which are 
capable of spinning in both clockwise and counter-
clockwise directions in response to the broom being 
moved forward or backward.
ii)	
Hydraulic Broom – In a hydraulic broom, circular 
motion of the broom is achieved hydraulically through a 
hydraulic pump coupled with the tractor engine. Raising 
and lowering of the broom is also a hydraulic function. 
4.13.3	 Suction Broom – A particular form of rotary broom is the 
suction sweeper. This type of unit uses a main rotary broom to direct 
swept material to a suction head that collects all swept material into 



======================================================================
PAGE 90 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
70
a storage tank for disposal elsewhere. A second smaller rotary broom 
assists in removing loose material from the kerb and channel.
However, suction broom is not as efficient as the vacuum broom.
4.13.4	 Vacuum Broom – It is designed specifically for chip seal 
application. It removes loose material from the surface by suction 
only. It consists of a suction unit positioned close to the road surface, 
a closed hopper to collect the material, a water sprayer and, where 
necessary, filter bags. The absence of contact with the surface 
minimises damage to new seals and is the preferred method of 
removal of loose chips from new seals. However, care must be taken 
to ensure that the broom is not stopped over a new seal surface 
(sensitive), while the suction is still operating, or the surface may be 
damaged.
Vacuum brooms can also be used for cleaning the pavement free of 
dust and debris.
4.13.5	 Drag Brooming – For chip seal applications, when the chip 
is applied at the correct rate, some areas will be chipped too lightly 
and others too heavily, even with good control. This can be rectified by 
drag brooming. A drag broom is a soft bristle broom attached to a light 
timber or steel frame used after the aggregate spreading operation. It 
is used to assist in correction of any spreading deficiencies. Dragging 
the broom across the surface, without any applied pressure, results 
in minor redistribution of loose chips and filling of open gaps between 
them. When the surface is warm, extra precautions are needed to 
avoid dislodging of chips. It is important to closely control the speed 
of dragging as excessive speed may damage the seal and cause 
scattering of chips.

4.14.1	 It is usually a self-propelled (Figure 29) or towed (Figure 28) 
unit and performs the following functions:
i)	
Spreading binder uniformly
ii)	
Spreading binder at a pre-determined rate

4.14.2	 There are four types of bitumen distributors:
i)	
Pressurised Tank Type – The bitumen tank is 
pressurised by an air compressor, thereby generating 
the necessary constant pressure at the spray bar. The 
application rate is achieved by controlling the vehicle

72
speed. It can be used successfully only for low viscosity 
binders such as emulsions. Hence, machines of this 
type are rare in practice.
ii)	
Constant Rate of Spread Type – Bitumen is supplied 
to the spray bar by a metering pump which is driven at 
a speed proportional to the vehicle speed by a power 
take-off from the main transmission of the vehicle 
through a multiple ratio transfer gearbox. The supply 
of bitumen to the spray bar is ‘non-return’, which 
means that during spraying operation, bitumen is not 
allowed to bypass the spray bar and recirculate to 
the tank. The required application rate is obtained by 
selecting the appropriate gear ratio at the transfer box. 
If a certain minimum (pre-determined) road speed is 
maintained, the metering pump will deliver the required 
amount of bitumen to the spray bar regardless of 
speed variations. This type of distributor suffers from 
the disadvantage that if it is required to close off some 
jets, the overall rate of spread is affected. Very few 
machines of this kind are in use.
iii)	
Constant Volume Type – This machine is fitted with 
a metering pump, the output of which can be pre-set. 
The entire quantity of bitumen delivered by the pump is 
fed to the spray bar when spraying is in progress and 
there is no bypass arrangement for recirculating binder 
to the tank. The desired application rate is achieved 
through precise control of the pump output and the 
vehicle speed. Constant volume distributors are suited 
for heavy applications of binder.
iv)	
Constant Pressure Type – Here, the spray bar 
pressure is held constant and the application rate is 
achieved by precisely controlling the vehicle speed. A 
relief valve controls the pressure in the spray bar and 
permits excess bitumen to bypass the spray bar and 
return to the tank. Constant pressure distributors are 
suited for light applications of binder.
For all bitumen distributors (except constant rate of spread type), the 
application rate is inversely proportional to the vehicle speed.
4.14.3	 A typical self-propelled bitumen distributor consists of the 
following:



======================================================================
PAGE 93 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
73
i)	
Heated, insulated bitumen storage tank (of capacity 
5,000 to 20,000 litres)
ii)	
Spray bar with spray jets (or nozzles)
iii)	
Pump for delivering bitumen to spray bar
iv)	
Spray Bar (plus a hand held spray to attend to difficult 
areas and corners where the bitumen distributor cannot 
reach)
v)	
A dial type of thermometer fitted on the body to indicate 
the bitumen temperature.
vi)	
An accurate tachometer capable of measuring travel 
speed and a locking device for fixing the desired speed.
vii)	
An electronic control device that will control the quantity 
of bitumen sprayed as well as the parameters of spraying 
(e.g. number of nozzles, speed of truck, temperature of 
the fluid etc.)
The bitumen distributor sprays the bitumen through a spray bar (and 
spray jets) to which the bitumen is supplied by a pump, drawing the 
bitumen from a heated, insulated storage tank. The bitumen pump is 
usually of gear type with positive displacement. Bitumen pressure is 
usually controlled by using either a variable speed pump or a constant 
speed pump with a pressure relief valve. The correct pump speed 
or pressure is that which neither atomizes the bitumen nor distorts 
the spray fan/ nozzle. Bitumen atomization and distortion of spray fan 
may occur if the bitumen pressure is too high. At the same time, too 
low a pressure may result in streaking from a non-uniform discharge 
of bitumen from the spray nozzles. Hence, the proper pump speed 
or pressure must be selected based upon manufacturer’s charts and 
data for determining the volume per minute discharge for each nozzle 
size.
The system of heating bitumen is generally through a hot oil boiler, 
installed on board the distributor and thermic fluid oil circulated 
through a set of coils installed in the tank. The thermic fluid oil can be 
heated either through flue/flame tubes fitted with burner (using diesel 
or kerosene) or electronic heater.  Control systems range from manual 
to fully automatic with thermostatic control and flame-out protection 
devices. A dipstick is provided to indicate the level of bitumen in the 
tank.



======================================================================

The spray bar can be of 3 different categories. While the first one 
just distributes the bitumen, the second category involves circulation 
of the bitumen, i.e., the bitumen is circulated in a closed loop from 
the tank to the spray bar and then back to the tank, thereby avoiding 
the possibility of bitumen solidifying in the spray bar and keeping the 
spray bar at the temperature of the bitumen. The third category has 
circulation of the bitumen plus a set of coils built in to allow circulation 
of hot oil into the spray bar, thus maintaining accurate temperature at 
all times.
Spray jets are usually of two types – slotted jets and whirling jets. 
While the former are high output jets and are suitable for grouting 
operations and very heavy application rates, the latter are relatively 
lower output jets and are suitable for surface dressing operations. The 
ideal viscosities of bitumen for spraying through different types of jets 
are distinctly different (check manufacturer’s recommendation), and, 
therefore, the recommended temperatures at which each individual 
type and grade of bitumen should be sprayed, through each type of 
jet, will vary.
The spray bars cover width from 1.8 to 9.1 m in one pass, depending 
on their width and pump’s capacity. In order to ensure that the spray 
nozzles do not interfere with each other, the angle of the long axis of 
the nozzle openings needs to be adjusted. The nozzle angle varies 
with the make of the equipment but is usually between 150 to 300 
(Figure 30).
Figure 30: Proper Nozzle Angle Setting
Nozzle Angle Setting = 15-30 degree
Spraybar Axis
Adjusting the height of the spray bar above the road surface is 
important to ensure uniformity of spray. The required height should be 
maintained throughout the spraying operation. The height needed for 
a double coverage is double that of a single coverage, and that of a 
triple coverage is 1.5 times that of a double coverage.



======================================================================
PAGE 95 of 316
======================================================================

75
A triple coverage with 100 mm spacing of nozzles is shown in 
Figure 31. If the spacing in between nozzles were 150 mm, the 
needed height of the spray bar for a triple coverage would have been 
so high above the road surface that wind could possibly distort the 
spray fans. In such a case, a double coverage pattern is preferable to 
use. Under no condition should a single coverage pattern be used for 
bitumen spraying.

The nozzles have to be controlled individually. The opening and 
closing of these nozzles can be operated manually or pneumatically. 
A control system should be installed which makes it possible for the 
operator to modify, at any time, the various parameters of spraying 
(e.g. either ‘start’ or ‘stop’ or ‘modify’ the number of nozzles opened, 
etc.). Basically, the rate of spread is a function of four parameters, viz. 
viscosity of the binder, speed of the pump, speed of the truck and the 
number of nozzles in the spray bar. The operator has to ensure that 
the quantity of bitumen passing through a nozzle is the one specified 
and that the binder has the desired characteristics. While spraying 
double or triple coverage, the quantity of bitumen sprayed from 1st and 
2nd nozzles of the spray bar will have lesser quantity at the edges of the 
road compared to other nozzles. Hence, the 1st and 2nd nozzles of the 
spray bar will have different sizes to have uniform spray of bitumen.

All distributors should have a bitumeter wheel or tachometer, which 
can measure the rate of the travel and distance covered. Electronically 
and laser operated speedometers are common in modern bitumen 
distributors. Modern distributors have interlocks between the bitumen 
pump and the forward speed of the distributor. As the distributor 
changes speed, the pump speed is adjusted to compensate for the 
change in speed of the distributor. As the distributor is required to 
move at slow speeds (of the order of 5-10 km/hr), there are usually 
arrangements to lock the accelerator at the required speed. 
Though, heated bitumen distributors can also be used for emulsions, 
specially designed emulsion distributors are available.
4.14.4	 It is important to regularly check and calibrate both the 
uniformity of rate of spray of bitumen along the entire length of the 
spraybar and the accuracy of the tachometer. The frequency with 
which these checks are carried out will depend to some extent on the 
regularity with which the equipment is used, but in no case should the 
interval between checks be more than six months or as recommended 
by the manufacturer, whichever is earlier. 
4.14.5	 The following points need to be given adequate attention in 
using bitumen distributors:
i)	
The spray bar and nozzles should be cleaned regularly 
to ensure flow of jets.
ii)	
The height of the spray bar above the road surface must 
be correctly adjusted and kept constant throughout the 
operation.
iii)	
The rate of application depends upon speed of travel 
and the operator should have a calibration chart that 
relates proper rate of application at any given point of 
time.
iv)	
The uniformity of application should be checked 
periodically by a tray test.
v)	
Fire extinguishers should be kept in readiness for 
emergency use.
vi)	
Suitable arrangements of side flaps should be installed 
for protecting kerbs and side-walks from getting 
sprayed.

The operator and helper operating the bitumen 
distributor should be trained personnel.

Hot Mix Plant
4.15.1	 A central mixing plant used for producing the hot bituminous 
mix 
(Bituminous 
Macadam, 
Dense 
Bituminous 
Macadam, 
Bituminous Concrete etc.) is called a hot mix plant. It has provisions 
for:
i)	
Controlled feeding and blending of aggregates of 
different sizes in the specified proportion.
ii)	
Drying of aggregates and heating them to the specified 
temperature.
iii)	
Uniform heating of bitumen at the specified temperature.
iv)	
Controlled feeding of bitumen and filler in the specified 
proportion.
v)	
Forced/ positive mixing of all the ingredients to produce 
a consistent, uniform, homogeneous mix at the specified 
temperature and as per the job mix formula. 
4.15.2	 Hot Mix Plant may be classified based on methodology of 
preparation of hot mix as follows:
i)	
Continuous/Drum Type Hot Mix Plant (Figure 32) 
– In this type of plant, aggregates, fines and bitumen 
are continuously fed into pug mill/ drum mix in 
desired proportion and hot mix is discharged without 
interruption.
	
The typical capacities of drum mix plant used in the 
road construction sector are 40-60 TPH, 60-90 TPH 
and 90-120 TPH.
	
The hot mix plant of capacity 40-60 TPH specifies that 
the output of plant shall be 40 TPH at 6 percent moisture 
content present in aggregates and 60 TPH at 2 percent 
moisture content present in aggregates.

Batch Type Hot Mix Plant (Figure 33) – In batch 
type plant, hot bitumen is added with the batch of 
hot aggregates and filler (if necessary) at required 
temperature in desired proportion in mixing unit and the 
hot mix is prepared in batches. 
	
The typical capacities of batch mix plant used in the 
road construction sector are 120 TPH, 160 TPH, 200 
TPH, 240 TPH and 320 TPH.
	
Generally, Batch type Hot Mix Plant should be preferred 
for the works involving hot bituminous mix owing to 
better gradation control.

4.15.3	 Hot Mix Plant may be classified based on direction of flow of 
aggregates and hot gases in dryer drum as – counter flow type and 
parallel flow type.

4.15.4	 Hot Mix Plant may be classified based on mobility as – 
stationary type and mobile type. Mobile plant is preferred where 
quantum of work is small and plant requires frequent shifting.
4.15.5	 The Hot Mix Plant should have following essential features:
A.	
The general features which are common for both drum and 
batch types of plant are as follows:
i)	
Cold Aggregate Storage and Supply Unit with minimum 
four bins having belt conveyor arrangement for initial 
proportioning of aggregates from each bin in the 
required quantities. The bin containing fines is fitted 
with a bin vibrator to ensure free flow of fines. Each bin 
has easily adjustable bin gate and Low Level/ No Flow 
warning device.
ii)	
Variable speed drive below each bin to control belt 
speed and, thus vary aggregate proportion. An 
electronic load sensor on the main conveyor measures 
the flow of aggregates.
iii)	
Rejection unit for oversized aggregate for preventing 
damage to dryer flights/blades.
iv)	
Dryer unit having properly designed and arranged dryer 
flights with automatic burner (i.e. auto flame failure 
detection and auto ignition system) capable of heating 
the aggregate to the required temperature without any 
visible unburnt fuel or carbon residue on the aggregate 
and reducing the moisture content of the aggregate to 
the specified minimum.
v)	
The plant is fitted with suitable type of thermometric 
instruments at appropriate places so as to indicate or 
record the temperature of heated aggregates, bitumen 
and mix.
vi)	
Bitumen storage and supply unit capable of heating, 
measuring and spraying of bitumen at specified 
temperature with automatic synchronization of bitumen 
and aggregate feed in the required proportion.
vii)	
A mineral filler system capable to feed filler material into 
the mix in the correct quantity wherever required.
viii)	
Pollution/dust control system for the dryer unit to 
prevent the exhaust of fine dust into atmosphere for

environmental control and recycle permissible fines into 
the mix.
ix)	
Arrangement for storage of hot mix, if necessary.
x)	
Centralized control panel capable of presetting, 
controlling/synchronizing all operations starting from 
feeding of cold aggregates to the discharge of the hot 
mix to ensure proper quality of mix. It should have 
indicators for any malfunctioning in the operation.
B.	
For Batch Type Plant:
i)	
Secondary gradation of aggregates, in hot condition, 
is carried out in screening unit. Screening (Gradation 
Control) unit has multi-deck vibratory screen, or rotary 
screening drum for heating and accurate sizing of hot 
aggregates and storing them in separate hot bins.
ii)	
The plant has a separate mixer unit (pug mill) for 
producing homogeneous mix unlike drum mix plant 
(where heating of aggregates as well as preparation of 
mix takes place in the same dryer drum).
In case of Hot in Plant Recycling, the plant must have suitable 
provision for addition of RBP (Reclaimed Bituminous Pavement) in 
required proportion in the mixer/ dryer drum.
For more information on Hot Mix Plant, refer to IRC:90.
4.16	
Paver Finisher
4.16.1	 A Paver Finisher (Figure 34) is used in bituminous road 
construction for laying non-bituminous as well as bituminous mixes. 
Following are the main functions of a Paver Finisher:
i)	
To lay and spread the mix to attain specified surface.
ii)	
To facilitate the attainment of specified surface quality 
and correct grade/level/ finish to meet the road design 
specifications for a safe and comfortable ride.
iii)	
To achieve specified camber and super elevation.
iv)	
To achieve required thickness, uniform degree of 
compaction, homogeneous quality of mix during laying 
and uniform bearing capacity over the entire surface.

b)	
Track Chain Paver
In case, paving width requirement is 8 m and above, use of track chain 
paver is recommended for better control over traction and pavement 
quality.
4.16.3	 The Paver Finisher consists of two units – tractor unit and 
screed unit. The tractor unit is the front part of the paver and houses 
the prime mover, pushing rollers, receiving hopper, feeding conveyors, 
spreading augers, hydraulic system, operator’s cabin and driving 
system. The primary function of the tractor is to propel the tipper 
truck, to convey and distribute the paving material through the augers 
and tow the screed. The screed unit is the rear part of the paver and 
consists of levelling screed, tow arms and mat thickness adjustment 



======================================================================

mechanism. The screed is of ‘floating, self-levelling’ type and is free 
to rise and fall, thereby seeking its own angle of attack and establish 
the desired mat thickness. The key to the levelling performance of the 
screed is to fill in low spots and decrease the influence of high spots, 
thus acting as an averaging device.
4.16.4	 There is a need to maintain a constant head of material in front 
of the screed to maintain correct depth of the mat, which is facilitated 
by proper setting of the flow gates and augers on the paver.
4.16.5	 The screed has a tamping and vibrating arrangement with 
adjustable amplitude and variable frequency for compacting the mix 
being paved. The compaction effect of the screed is determined by the 
screed weight, contact area of tamping or vibrating element, paving 
speed, frequency and amplitude of the tamping unit and screed plate.
4.16.6	 The screed has an internal heating arrangement to preheat 
the screed plate and tamper to the desired temperature before starting 
the paving of hot bituminous mixes and, thus prevent picking up or 
sticking of bitumen. There are three types of heating devices – diesel/
oil fired burner, gas burner and electric heater.
4.16.7	 The screed assist system provides partial neutralization of 
screed load and ensures constant pressure of the screed on the mix 
regardless of the bearing capacity of the mix and width being paved. 
It also enables transferring part of the screed weight to the drive axle/
tracks of the machine in order to avoid spinning of the wheels/tracks 
under adverse gradients or underfoot conditions.
4.16.8	 Another adjustment on the screed is the crown control 
mechanism, which allows adjustment of the crown to meet the 
geometric requirements of the paving lane by adjusting a turnbuckle 
device to flex the bottom of the screed to produce the desired crown.
4.16.9	 Paver finishers with paving width ranging from 1.2 m to 
1.8 m and hydraulically extendable up to 3.4 m (which can further be 
extended with bolt extension upto 5 m) and paving thickness ranging 
from 150 mm to 250 mm may be used for small road projects or in 
confined space.
Typical range of specifications for paver finishers used in medium and 
large road projects is given in Table 16.

4.16.10 For laying bituminous mixes on highway projects, self-
propelled hydrostatic paver finisher with electronic sensing instrument 
is used for automatic levelling and profile control.
Three basic types of grade reference systems have been developed 
– the erected stringline, the mobile reference and the joint matching 
shoe. These reference systems typically use a combination of 
longitudinal grade sensors to establish position in the direction of 
traffic and may include a slope control device to control transverse 
cross slope of the paving lane.

Roller
4.17.1	 A Roller is a compactor used to compact embankment, 
subgrade, Granular Sub-Base (GSB), Dry Lean Concrete (DLC) 
or bituminous mix. Selection of the roller depends on the type of 
application, thickness of the layer and the properties of the material to 
be compacted.
4.17.2	 Rollers are broadly classified into the following types 
(Figure 35) depending on their utility in different situations:
i)	
Static Roller [Three wheeled type and tandem (two-
wheeled) type]

4.17.5	 Rollers should move at uniform speed. The speed should 
not exceed 5 km/hr for static roller and 6.5 km/hr for pneumatic tyred 
roller.
Speed of a vibratory roller will depend upon the operating frequency 
and desired impact spacing (determined by the number of impacts 
per metre). For example, a vibratory roller operating at a frequency of 
60 Hz can provide 39 impacts per metre at a speed of 5.5 km/hr. The 
impact spacing should be such that it allows the entire surface to be 
impacted as the roller travels in vibratory mode. Since drum diameter 
controls the length of arc of drum contact with the pavement surface, 
impact spacing can be adjusted narrower or wider depending upon 
the drum diameter.
The general thumb rule for optimal impact spacing in case of 
bituminous compaction is 33–46 impacts per metre, with the higher 
value suited for smaller drum diameter (up to 1 m) and the lower value 
suited for larger drum diameter (1.2 – 1.4 m).
4.17.6	 While operating any vibratory roller, it is advisable to select 
the highest frequency setting recommended for a particular job 
and, thereafter, choose the lowest amplitude setting consistent with 
achieving target density. Creating excessive drum force by selecting 
amplitude too high for the material layer thickness or mix properties 
risks aggregate damage. However, with increase in lift thickness, the 
requisite amplitude setting will also be higher.
The suitable frequencies and amplitudes for different applications in 
case of vibratory rollers are indicated in Table 19. Nowadays, vibratory 
rollers with frequencies as high as 70 Hz are also available in the 
market.

Aggregate Chip Spreader
4.18.1	 An aggregate chip spreader receives and dispenses an 
aggregate material in predetermined quantities and in a layer 
having substantial uniformity in thickness. The rate of dispensing 
the aggregate material is controlled to achieve the desired weight of 
aggregate per unit area and depends upon the speed of the machine. 
Aggregate chip spreaders are of three basic types:
i)	
Tail Gate Spreader (Figure 36) – The spreader is 
connected directly to the tail gate of a tipper truck. 
Traditionally, tail gate spreaders range from the simple 
vane type to the more sophisticated hydraulically 
operated roller spreader. Only the latter type is capable 
of consistently providing the necessary control of 
evenness and application rate.

======================================================================

======================================================================

The vane spreader has a steel plate with a series of 
vanes to spread aggregates over the desired lane 
width.
	
The roller spreader has a hopper with a feed roller. 
Chips are gravity discharged from the hopper through 
an adjustable gate and onto the rotating feed roller. 
The peripheral speed of the roller and degree of gate 
opening will determine the rate at which the chips will 
flow through to the roller and onto the pavement. To 
ensure even distribution of the chippings, metering is 
done by the feed roller which is activated by small wheels 
that are driven by truck wheels. In this way, variations in 
speed of truck produce corresponding variations in the 
rate of discharge of the aggregate material.
	
Modern spreaders use pneumatically operated cut-off 
plates for varying the width of spread.
ii)	
Truck Mounted (Towed) Spreader – It is connected 
to the tail gate of the tipper truck just like a tail gate 
spreader but has wheels to support the spreader. It is 
basically a hopper on wheels which is hooked on to and 
propelled by the backing aggregate truck. The feed is 
driven by the wheels of the hopper and the chippings in 
the hopper are replenished from the raised body of the 
tipper truck. The hopper contains feed gate, auger and 
roughened spread/feed roll for distributing aggregates 
uniformly to the full width of the box. There is an 
adjustable hitch on the front of the spreader by means 
of which it is attached to the truck.
	
This type of spreader has controls to regulate the feed 
gates, feed roll, auger and truck hitch height.
iii)	
Self-Propelled Spreader (Figure 37) – It supplies the 
power for the spreading operation rather than being 
dependent on the truck itself. It is connected to the 
aggregate truck by means of a self-locking hook that 
locks on to the truck as the truck backs into the rear of 
the machine. The spreader then pulls the truck along 
the spread area. The spreader consists of a receiving 
hopper at the rear into which aggregates are discharged 
from the delivering truck. Two individual (usually 



======================================================================
PAGE 110 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
90
automatically controlled) conveyor belts transfer the 
chippings from the receiving hopper to a spreading 
hopper at the front of the machine. The spreading 
hopper is fitted with a feed gate and spread roll for 
controlling/ metering the spread of the chips relative to 
the machine speed. The gate is also used for varying 
the spread width.
Figure 37: Self-Propelled Aggregate Chip Spreader
	
The self-propelled spreader usually has a scalping 
screen at the top of the spreading hopper, which allows 
scalping of oversized material that may get into the 
receiving hopper from the truck. A sloped screen may 
alternately be used to allow larger aggregates to drop 
into the bituminous surface first with the finer aggregates 
falling afterwards through the screen. This will ensure 
that the larger aggregates are sufficiently embedded in 
the bitumen to hold them in place.
	
A self-propelled spreader has the advantage of being 
able to closely follow behind the bitumen distributor 
with minimum stoppage to change aggregate trucks. 
Other advantages of the self-propelled spreader are 
the considerably greater spreading width & speed and 
better control, because only one machine has to be set 
up and controlled. The disadvantages of a self-propelled 
chip spreader are cost, manoeuvrability is difficult in 
very tight areas, and transportation as it needs to be 
trucked to the site.

Concrete Batching and Mixing Plant
4.19.1	 A Concrete Batching and Mixing Plant combines various 
ingredients like sand, water, aggregates, chemical and mineral 
admixtures (fly ash, plasticizer etc.), and cement by weight to form 
concrete. The aim is to produce homogenous and uniform concrete, 
as indicated by physical properties such as unit weight, slump, air 
content, and strength in individual batches and successive batches of 
the same mix proportions. Capacity of the plant is measured in cubic 
metre per hour. It depends upon capacity of mixer, number of mixers, 
charging, mixing and discharge time of each mixer.

displayed on the computer screen with the help of 
SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition). 
This software makes the data storage and printout very 
flexible and easy. The live weight of the ingredients 
in the weigh hoppers are continuously upgraded 
on the computer along with the operating status of 
various equipment. SCADA based system with GPRS 
technology provides the real-time batch data to the 
client server.
The concrete is said to be adequately mixed if the samples taken from 
different portions of a batch will have essentially the same unit weight, 
air content, slump and coarse aggregate content within permissible 
limits.
The mixing action of concrete involves two operations:
i)	
A general blending of different particle sizes of the 
ingredients to be uniformly distributed throughout the 
concrete mass.
ii)	
A vigorous rubbing action of cement paste on to the 
surface of the inert aggregate particles.
The operation flowchart of a concrete batching and mixing plant is 
shown in Figure 39.

and concrete mixers, refer to IRC:SP:86.
4.20	
Transit Mixer
4.20.1	 Transit Mixer is used to transport concrete from the concrete 
batching and mixing plant to the work site. It prevents segregation of 
already mixed concrete during transit by agitation, as a result of slow 
revolution of the drum.
4.20.2	 Transit Mixer (Figure 40) has a revolving drum with the axis 
inclined to the horizontal. Inside the shell of the mixer drum are pair of 
blades (with opposite direction of helix) that wrap in a helical (spiral) 
configuration from the head to the opening of the drum. The drum is 
mounted on two sets of twin rollers with suitable cover for protection 
against dust/dirt.

Chassis
The drum is rotated by a low speed planetary gear box bolted to 
the closed end of the mixer drum, which is powered by high torque 
reversible type hydraulic motor through variable displacement 
hydraulic pump. The drum drive shall be hydrostatic type and through 
power take-off unit from the vehicle engine itself or a separate diesel 
engine.
The Transit Mixer is also equipped with a water tank for supply of flush 
water to the mixer drum.



======================================================================
PAGE 116 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
96
The charging hopper at open end of the mixer shall be stationary and 
properly supported in concentric position with the drum opening. It 
may be equipped with a drum closure plate arrangement to prevent 
spillage as encountered on hilly terrain, especially in the case of 
concrete of higher slump.
The discharge chute consists of a fixed U-chute and a set of foldable 
distributing chute. The distributing chute is of swing-away type with 
fold-over extensions. The swing out fixture prevents the need to remove 
or replace the chute for direct discharge into high forms, hoppers or 
buckets. Means shall be provided for locking the distributing chute 
components in position when the mixer is in transit. The distributing 
chute shall be equipped with ratchet type or mechanical screw jack 
type or hydraulic chute lift for its quicker positioning.
4.20.3	 The action of the helical blades prevents the concrete from 
segregating when the drum spins in one direction and causes it to 
discharge when the direction of spin is reversed. The mixing drum can 
rotate at different rotational speeds – at the highest speed while being 
filled or emptied and at the lowest speed during travel. For this reason, 
a hydraulic drive is commonly used for rotation of the drum. After the 
concrete is loaded, it is normally hauled to the work site with the drum 
rotations at a speed in the range of 2 to 6 rpm.
During movement of the transit mixer on temporary/uneven roads, the 
drum speed shall not exceed 4 rpm and the truck speed shall not 
exceed 20 km/hr to avoid accident due to overturning. However, in 
case of good road condition, drum speed may be increased to 6 rpm 
and truck speed to 40 km/hr.
4.20.4	 The factor limiting the distance over which concrete mix can 
be transported by the transit mixers is the setting time, determined 
mainly by the ambient temperature, temperature of the mix and the 
type of cement.
Concrete must be unloaded from the transit mixer within the following 
time limits after its receipt from concrete batching and mixing plant:
i)	
Within 1.5 hours when atmospheric temperature is 
above 200 C.
ii)	
Within 2 hours when atmospheric temperature is at or 
below 200 C.
4.20.5	 The size of a transit mixer is indicated by the nominal batch 
capacity of its mixer drum.

However, it may be noted that the carrying capacity of the mixer 
will reduce with concretes of higher slump and/or the uphill road 
gradient.

4.21	
Concrete Placer/Spreader
4.21.1	 It places a metered supply of concrete mix in front of the 
concrete paver using a series of conveyor belts, augers, ploughs and 
strike off devices. Using a placer/spreader allows the contractor to 
receive material from transport vehicles and place a uniform amount 
of concrete mix in front of the entire paver width, while minimizing 
segregation.
4.21.2	 Tipper trucks delivering concrete shall normally not run on 
plastic sheathing nor shall they run on completed slabs until after 
28 days of placing the concrete.
The placing of concrete in front of the PQC paver should preferably 
be from the side placer to avoid damage to DLC by concrete tipping 
trucks. In case of unavoidable situation, truck supplying concrete to 
the paver may be allowed to ply on the DLC with the approval of the 
Engineer.
4.21.3	 The sub-base must be thoroughly moistened ahead of the 
spreader to prevent rapid loss of water from the concrete. Care must 
be taken to see that the correct quantity of concrete is placed; too 
much will overload the following paver, and too little will result in having 
necessarily to halt the paving while additional material is being added. 



======================================================================
PAGE 118 of 316
======================================================================

98
The distance between the spreader and paver is important and should 
be kept as short as possible because the concrete will set in about 
20 minutes.
4.21.4	 The total time taken from the addition of water to the mix until 
the completion of the surface finishing and texturing shall not exceed 
2 hours when concrete temperature is less than 25°C and 1.5 hours 
when concrete temperature is between 25°C and 30°C.
4.21.5	 For more information on concrete spreader, refer to IS:7242.
4.22	
Concrete Paver
4.22.1	 There are two basic methods of paving concrete pavements – 
slip form paving and fixed form paving.
4.22.2	 Slip Form Paver (Figures 41 and 42) – Slip form paving is 
defined as a process used to consolidate, form into geometric shape 
and surface finish a PQC mass by pulling the forms continuously 
through and surrounding the plastic concrete mass. Slip form paving 
is most appropriate for larger jobs that require high production rates. 
Slip form paver usually uses string lines/guide wires for line and grade 
control. The paving unit is equipped with sensors at its four corners. 
The alignment of the paver shall be controlled automatically from the 
guide wire by at least one set of sensors attached to the paver. The 
alignment and level of ancillary machines for finishing, texturing and 
curing of the concrete shall be automatically controlled relative to the 
guide wire or to the surface and edge of the slab.

Slip form paving is accomplished by the use of several self-propelled 
machines in a line which is commonly known as a paving train.
The first machine in line is a concrete placer/spreader, which facilitates 
rough placement of concrete without segregation across the paving 
area and to a height, which at all times is in excess of the required 
surcharge, before the second machine, which is the slip form paver. 
Sometimes, this first machine is eliminated if the concrete can be 
deposited directly in front of the paver from the concrete delivery unit 
or if a concrete placing attachment is installed in the front of the slip 
form paver.
The slip form paver usually performs screeding, consolidation and 
initial finishing.  Some pavers are equipped to place reinforcing steel 
(if needed), dowel bars and tie rods as well. Slip form pavers use their 
own weight to mould the plastic concrete into the correct shape.
The paver spreads/distributes the concrete uniformly across the paving 
area using an auger or plough, strikes off the top of the concrete to the 



======================================================================
PAGE 120 of 316
======================================================================

necessary average and differential surcharge to feed into the mould 
that shapes the pavement into the proper geometric configuration, 
and consolidates the concrete with internal vibrators.  The equipment 
for striking off the concrete shall be capable of being rapidly adjusted 
for changes of the average and differential surcharge necessitated by 
change in slab thickness or crossfall. Depending on the manufacturer, 
some slip form pavers also utilize what is known as a tamping bar. The 
tamping bar assists in consolidation and finishing by tamping large 
aggregates into the top of the concrete slab to prevent the paver’s 
mould from snagging the aggregate and causing a tear in the top of 
the slab.
Typically, the most effective vibrator position is after the strike-off 
mechanism and at the final slab elevation. Most pavers use fully 
adjustable vibrator spacing to account for different conditions and mix 
types, while still providing adequate influence zone overlap. The paver 
shall have vibrators of variable output with a maximum energy output 
of not less than 2.5 KW per metre width of slab per 300 mm depth 
of slab for a laying speed up to 1.5 m/min. Vibrators shall operate 
at a frequency of 8000-10000 impulses per minute under load at a 
maximum spacing of 600 mm.
Initial finishing is accomplished by extruding the PQC mass through 
a moving form made up of the base course (bottom), the side forms 
(vertical edges of the paver) and the mould (flat paver pieces mounted 
behind the vibrator). Extruding PQC through the resulting rectangular 
shape provides the final slab dimensions and also serves to imbed 
larger aggregate particles below the surface, which results in a smooth 
finish.
Placing of dowel/ tie bars at their pre-designed locations is done 
through the machine integrated Dowel Bar Inserter (DBI) and Tie Bar 
Inserter (TBI).
The third machine in the paving train is a tube float. This machine 
smoothens and seals the top of the pavement by dragging diagonally 
mounted aluminium tubes forward and back along the top of the 
pavement. This machine is sometimes eliminated by attaching a super 
smoother/ auto float to the back of the slip form paver. The auto float 
automatically travels across the top of the pavement while simultaneously 
oscillating in a forward and backward motion to smoothen and seal the 
top of the pavement. The aim of this operation is to minimise surface 
irregularities caused due to various reasons like frequent stoppages of 
work, surface deformation due to plastic flow etc.

The last machine in the train is a Texturing and Curing Machine 
(TCM) (Figure 43). Although separate equipment may be used for 
texturing and curing operations, typically, in most cases, the slip 
form paver is followed by a Texturing and Curing Machine (TCM), 
which imparts macro texture as well as applies a curing membrane 
over the pavement while the concrete is still in plastic state. The 
TCM may be wheel-mounted or track-mounted with controls for 
optimised longitudinal or transverse texturing and curing. Texturing 
Equipment and Curing Compound Sprayer are discussed separately 
in Sections 4.26 and 4.27 respectively.

Advantages of slip form paving are:
i)	
Use of Low-Slump PQC – Low-slump PQC of the order 
25±10 mm is necessary so that the fresh PQC is able to 
hold its shape once the slipform paver has passed. Low 
slump PQC can be made with less water and usually 
has higher compression and flexural strengths than 
comparable high slump mixes.
ii)	
High Productivity – Large jobs generally require high 
production rates.

iii)	
Smooth Riding Surface – Automation and computer 
control allow the paver to produce very smooth riding 
surface.
Typical specifications for slip form pavers are given in Table 24. Paving 
speed shall not be less than 1 m/min.

4.22.3	 Fixed Form Paver (Figure 44) – Despite the speed and 
ease of slip form paving, there are still applications where fixed form 
paving is more practical and cost-effective. These include streets, 
intersections, local roads, and complicated short-run of variable width 
pavements.

of the sub-base. Side forms for use with wheeled paving machines 
shall incorporate metal rails firmly fixed at a constant height below 
the top of the forms. The forms shall be sufficiently robust and rigid to 
support the weight and pressure caused by the paving equipment. The 
formwork should consist of mild steel channels for straight lengths and 
wooden sections reinforced with mild steel angles for curved portions. 
Manufactured sections are also available for form work as given in 
IRC:15.
The fixed form paving train consists of separate powered machines 
which spread, compact and finish the concrete in a continuous 
operation.
The concrete shall be discharged without segregation to a uniform 
uncompacted density by a traversing hopper spreader. It is mounted 
on a self-propelled, rail-mounted frame such that it moves across 
the frame and discharges concrete at a controlled rate on to the 
sub-base as the frame moves forward. The underside of the hopper 
then strikes off the deposited concrete up to the desired surcharge 
level as it returns with the frame remaining stationary. 
The spreader is conventionally followed by a distributor (with rotary 
strike-off paddles) and a transverse vibrating compaction beam. The 
strike-off paddles trim any minor surface irregularities in the surcharged 
concrete. The vibratory compaction beam thoroughly compacts 
the layer and has adjustable amplitude and frequency to suit the 
characteristics of the PQC. If necessary, poker vibrators shall be used 
adjacent to the side forms and edges of the previously constructed 
slab. After compaction, dowel bars and tie bars, which have not been 
previously attached to the sub-base, are vibrated into position. The 
vibratory compaction beam shall be set to strike off the surface slightly 
high so that it is cut down to the required level by the oscillating beam. 
The machine shall be capable of being rapidly adjusted for changes 
in average and differential surcharge necessitated by changes in 
slab thickness or crossfall. The final finisher shall be able to finish the 
surface to the required level and smoothness as specified.
Particular advantages of fixed form paving are: 
i)	
Tight tolerances and side clearances. Existing curbs or 
other features can be used as forms.
ii)	
Custom geometry. Forms can be placed in just about 
any pavement geometry, which allows for multiple 



======================================================================

======================================================================

104
changes in pavement width, smooth curves, blockouts 
and other abnormalities.
iii)	
Better construction staging. Forms can be placed such 
that staged construction can be used to maintain traffic 
flow or intersection use.
iv)	
Less expensive equipment and mobilization. Forms 
and equipment are less expensive than slip form paving 
equipment. If paving operations are small enough, cost 
savings in fixed form paving can more than conpensate 
for the higher production rates of slip form paving.
For fixed form pavers, paving width usually varies from 2.74 to 15 m.
4.23	
Concrete Vibrator
4.23.1	 Concrete vibrators are used for compaction of Pavement 
Quality Concrete (PQC) and structural concrete and, therefore, remove 
the air voids. In addition to consolidating the concrete for maximum 
density, they also internally blend the different lifts of concrete together 
into a single solid mass with few to no air pockets and no lift lines on 
the finished exposed surface. After deciding whether to use internal or 
external vibration, following parameters shall be considered in making 
an appropriate choice:
i)	
Frequency 
ii)	
Amplitude
iii)	
Power and 
iv)	
Size 
Since concrete contains particles of varying sizes, the most 
satisfactory compaction would be obtained by using vibrators with 
different speeds of vibration. 
4.23.2	 The various types of concrete vibrators are described below:
i)	
Internal or Immersion or Needle or Poker Vibrators
	
It is the most commonly used vibrator and can be 
satisfactorily used for consolidation of plain as well as 
reinforced concrete by adequately dipping the vibrating 
needle in concrete either perpendicularly or at an angle. 
However, it should not be used where the thickness of 
concrete is less than 100 mm.

Internal vibrator (Figures 45 and 46) essentially 
consists of a steel tube (with bottom cap end closed 
and rounded) having a vibrating needle inside it. The 
vibrating needle can consist of either an eccentric 
shaft or a rotor and runner assembly (pendulum type 
vibrator). The prime mover is connected to the vibrating 
needle directly at its head or through a flexible shaft.

The vibrator may be powered by any of the following 
power units:
a)	
Electric Motor, driving the vibrator needle through 
flexible shaft or situated at the head of the 
vibrator.
b)	
Internal Combustion Engine, driving the vibrator 
needle through flexible shaft.
c)	
Compressed Air Motor, situated near the head of 
the vibrator.
	
The size of the immersion vibrator is denoted by the 
nominal outside diameter of the vibrating needle. The 
standard nominal outside diameter of the vibrating 
needle shall be – 25, 35, 40, 50, 60, 75 and 90 mm.
	
The operational frequency and optimum amplitude 
measurement in the middle of the vibrating needle 
under no load (operation in air) condition for different 
sizes of needle shall be as per Table 25.

For more information on internal vibrators, refer to 
IS:2505 and IS:3558.
ii)	
External or Shutter or Form Vibrators 
	
These vibrators are clamped rigidly to the form work at 
the pre-determined points so that the form and concrete 
are vibrated. They consume more power for a given 
compaction effect than internal vibrators.
	
These vibrators can compact up to 450 mm from the 
face but have to be moved from one place to another as 
concreting progresses. The external vibrators are more 
often used for pre-casting of thin in situ sections of

such shape and thickness as cannot be compacted by 
internal vibrators. Very stiff mixes respond better to high 
amplitude and lower frequency. The high frequency use 
tends to give a better surface appearance.
	
External Vibrators are classified according to frequency, 
power source and structure, as indicated in Table 26.

be of two types – High Frequency (HF) and Normal 
Frequency (NF). The High Frequency vibrator operates 
at a frequency of 70 Hz and above with the induction 
motor typically being fed from converter. The Normal 
Frequency vibrator operates at a frequency below 70 
Hz with the induction motor being supplied with the 
current of the power network frequency.
	
A pneumatic external vibrator (Figure 48) operates 
on the principle of bearingless turbine with pneumatic 
drive. It has typically a rotary vibration generator in the 
form of a bushing or ball located in a housing, which 
rolls on a fixed axle. The vibrator set is composed of 
the vibrator itself, supply hose with on/off stopcock and 
various fixtures for use with metal and wooden type 
shuttering. The on/off stopcock makes it possible to 
change the vibration parameters.

A hydraulic external vibrator (Figure 49) consists of a 
rotating eccentric mass directly coupled to a specially 
designed hydraulic motor. It is supplied with a feeder 
containing hydraulic pump, pressure and flow controls, 
with the aim of precise regulation of vibration frequency 
to suit requirements.

A fixed vibrator is one which is fixed to the vibrating 
object directly by means of treads.
	
A removable vibrator is one which is fixed to the 
vibrating object indirectly by means of a quick-action 
clamping and releasing device.

External vibrators with power not less than 500 W 
should be used for road works.
	
For more information on external vibrators, refer to IS/
ISO:18652.
iii)	
Surface or Screed or Pan Vibrators 
	
These are placed directly on the concrete mass. These 
are best suited for compaction of concrete pavements 
and shallow elements (e.g. thin slabs), where the area 
to be compacted is large or the thickness is too small to 
allow the use of internal vibrators. Very dry mixes can 
be most effectively compacted with surface vibrators. 
	
Screed vibrator (Figure 50) consists of one or more 
vibrating units mounted on a screed board (usually 
beam or truss type). It is powered by a suitable integral 
power unit, that is an electric motor or an internal 
combustion engine. Suitable arrangement may be 
provided for adjusting the vibration characteristics of the 
vibrating unit such that constant uniform performance of 



======================================================================
PAGE 130 of 316
======================================================================

110
the vibrator is assured for the entire range of operating 
conditions.
	
The screed vibrator should have arrangement to 
adjust a sagging curvature of the concrete which is 
produced due to amplitude of vibration. To compensate 
the sagging depression the bottom surface of screed 
should be provided with reverse sag. The amount of 
adjustment depends upon the span of screed, the 
thickness and workability of concrete being vibrated.

Screed Board
	
The size of the screed vibrator is designated by the 
overall length of the screed board. Common sizes are 
3, 4 and 5 m.
	
The frequency and amplitude of the screed vibrator 
under no load (operation in air) condition shall not be 
less than 3000 vpm (vibrations per minute) and 1.5 mm 
respectively in order to achieve satisfactory compaction.
	
For more information on screed vibrators, refer to 
IS:2506 and IS:11993.
	
Hand Tamper Board – The hand tamper used in lieu of 
screed board vibrator for compacting concrete for minor 
jobs or as an emergency stop-gap arrangement in 
case of breakdown of the screed board vibrator should 
consist of a hard wood beam of rectangular section 
of sufficient weight to ensure adequate compaction 
and should be fixed securely with sturdy handles to

withstand the tamping action. The lower face of the 
tamper board should conform to the desired profile of 
the pavement cross-section and be fitted with a mild 
steel shoe of appropriate width as in the case of screed 
board to prevent wear.
iv)	
Vibrating Tables
	
Vibrating tables  are  generally  used  for compaction of 
precast concrete units because  of  advantages  they 
offer with respect to  uniformity  of  treatment  given  to 
the  casting.  With  their use,  vibration  can  start  from 
the  moment  concrete  is  placed  on  the base  of  the 
mould,  so  that  the  expulsion  of  air  is  facilitated  and 
compaction  increases steadily  with  the  addition  of 
each  batch  of  concrete.
	
Vibrating tables can be considered as a case of form 
work clamped to the vibrator instead of the other way 
round. They shall  include  all  appliances  creating 
rapidly  alternating  horizontal,  vertical  or  circular 
vibrations  and  capable  of  transmitting  these  to 
moulds  filled  with  concrete  and  placed  or  clamped 
on the  table  top.
	
The  vibrating  table  shall  be  capable  of  being 
operated  either  through an  eccentric  rotor  driven 
by  a  prime  mover,  such  as  electric  motor, internal 
combustion  engine,  pneumatic  power,  or  directly  by 
electro-magnetic  pulsators.
	
The  frequency  of  vibration  for  the  table  operating 
at  its maximum load capacity  shall be between 3000 
to 6000 vpm (vibrations per minute).
	
The size of the vibrating table is designated by the 
overall length and breadth of the table top, expressed 
in metres. The capacity is indicated by the maximum 
weight, expressed in tonnes, of the mould plus the 
concrete in the mould, which can be effectively 
vibrated by operating the table at specified vibration 
characteristics.
	
Different sizes and capacities of the vibrating table are 
indicated in Table 27.

Floater/Trowel
4.24.1	 It is used for smoothening the compacted concrete (PQC or 
structural concrete) to obtain a high quality concrete surface. Finish/
Final floating is called troweling. Prior to floating operation, a screed 
may be required to shape the concrete surface to correct elevation by 
striking off the excess concrete.
4.24.2	 Traditional floater is made of hard wood or aluminium 
magnesium board, planned to true surface and fixed with a suitable 
handle. Mechanised floater (power floater), in addition to finishing 
operation, can also make the surface abrasion resistant using some 
commercial hardener. 
4.24.3	 Mechanized floating operation includes two main steps:
i)	
Floating is aimed at removing protruding aggregate 
grains, levelling off swells, filling cavities, and 
compacting the face of the concrete. At this stage, the 
blades of the power floater are kept flat.



======================================================================
PAGE 133 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
113
ii)	
Troweling is aimed at polishing, smoothening and 
hardening the face of the concrete. At this stage, the 
blades of the power trowel are slightly angled.
4.24.4	 Power floaters are normally of two types – single rotor 
(Figure 51) and double rotor (Figure 52). 
A single rotor power floater is of the walk-behind type and consists of a 
disc or rotor (having 4 to 6 blades) that is driven by combustion engine 
or electric motor. Use of a combustion engine allows step-less control 
of the floating tool’s rotational speed, whereas, in a two-step electric 
motor, one has to select the appropriate speed of rotation as per 
requirement (rough floating or finish floating). The angle of inclination 
of the blade can be adjusted from the long handle connected to the 
floating tool.

A double rotor power floater is of the ride-on type and consists of two 
rotors, which may be overlapping or non-overlapping. It is larger and 
heavier than the single rotor power floater and is used for floating 
large surfaces.

Scabbler
4.25.1	 Scabbler (Figure 53) is used for concrete reduction and 
finishing. It is used for the following purposes:
i)	
Scabbling down high spots or levelling uneven joints

4.25.2	 Scabbler uses compressed air to hammer piston mounted 
bits into the concrete surface. It may be hand-held, push-type or self-
propelled.
Figure 53: Scabbler (Push Type)
4.26	
Texturing Equipment
4.26.1	 Surface texture is required to provide skid resistance. 
Texturing is achieved by using a tining device (Figure 54) or texturing 
brush/broom or other suitable means as approved by the Site 
Engineer. The texturing equipment should be capable of moving over 
the concrete slab in transverse or longitudinal direction. Wooden or 
steel beam/bridge is used for stradding (spanning across the nascent 
slabs without touching it) the slabs to enable the masons to carry out 
surface finishing operations on the compacted concrete.

operated with automatic sensing and control devices from main paver 
or auxiliary unit.
The tining unit shall have facility for adjustment of the downward 
pressure on the tines as necessary to produce the desired finish.
In case of transverse tining, a beam of at least 3 m length mounted 
with tines shall be used. The grooves produced shall be at random 
spacing of grooves but uniform in width and depth. The spacing shall 
conform to a pattern shown in Figure 55.

In case of longitudinal tining, the texturing bridge shall be wide enough 
to cover the entire width of the carriageway but within 75 mm from the 
pavement edge. The centre to centre spacing between the tines shall 
be 18 to 21 mm.
Tined grooves shall be 3 mm wide and 3 to 4 mm deep for both 
transverse and longitudinal tining.



======================================================================

4.26.3	 In case of brush texturing, a wire brush of not less than 450 mm 
width shall be used to brush evenly across the slab in one direction. 
Normally, wider brushes of 3 m length are preferred. The brush shall 
be made of 32 gauge tape wires grouped together in tufts placed at 
10 mm centres. The tufts shall contain an average of 14 wires and 
initially be 100 mm long. The brush shall have two rows of tufts.  The 
rows shall be 20 mm apart and the tufts in one row shall be opposite 
the centre of the gap between tufts in the other row. The brush shall 
be replaced when the shortest tuft wears down to 90 mm long.
4.26.4	 Before commencing texturing, the bleeding water, if any, shall 
be removed using suitable means and texturing shall be done on a 
firm surface.
4.27	
Curing Compound Sprayer
4.27.1	 Curing compound sprayer (Figure 56) consists of an assembly 
of tank for storing curing compound and a hose which can be mounted 
on a frame that enables an easy movement of the equipment. It may 
also be provided with a pump that helps in generating the required 
rate and pressure. Pressure settings can also be adjusted in some 
equipment.

4.27.2	 The curing compound sprayer shall incorporate an efficient 
mechanical device for continuous agitation and mixing of the 
compound during spraying.
4.28	
Diamond Cutter/Saw
4.28.1	 A Diamond Cutter/Saw (Figure 57) is used for cutting, 
grooving or grinding concrete, bituminous, stone or masonry works. It 
may be hand-held or walk-behind and is either electric or petrol/diesel 
driven type.
Walk Behind Saw
Hand Held Saw
Figure 57: Diamond Saw
As the name suggests, cutting is facilitated by grinding action using a 
rotating diamond blade mounted on a shaft and clamped tightly into 
place between two collars or flanges. A diamond blade is made up of 
two basic parts:
i)	
A Steel Core, which is in the shape of a circular steel 
disc.
ii)	
Diamond Segment or Rim, which is made up of 
diamond crystals dispersed through a metal matrix and 
is attached to the steel core by means of brazing, laser 
welding or diffusion bonding of rim to core.
4.28.2	 A diamond saw allows two types of cutting:
i)	
Wet Cutting – Water is used as a coolant to keep the 
blade from overheating through friction during cutting. 



======================================================================
PAGE 139 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
119
Water also reduces dust and helps removing cuttings 
from the bottom of the cut. Wet cutting blades are 
recommended for continuous or deep cutting.
ii)	
Dry Cutting – Dry cutting blades are air-cooled and 
should be used only for intermittent or shallow cutting 
to allow the air flow around the blades to dissipate the 
heat. 
4.28.3	 For a walk-behind diamond saw (e.g. joint cutting machine 
used in construction of cement concrete pavement), there should 
be appropriate arrangement for lowering or raising the blade to any 
desired level. It should also have suitable guides for enabling a straight 
cut to be made along the desired line. Since a joint cutting machine 
is usually used for continuous cutting, it should have a water feeding 
arrangement for cooling.
4.28.4	 Selection of diamond blade diameter depends upon the job 
at hand. The blade for cutting concrete must be compatible with the 
output and speed of the saw, concrete strength and application.
4.29	
Joint Sealing Machine 
4.29.1	 Joint Sealing Machine (Figure 58) is meant for application of 
joint sealant in cement concrete pavement. It consists of the following:
Figure 58: Joint Sealing Machine



======================================================================
PAGE 140 of 316
======================================================================

120
i)	
Melter in case of hot applied material. The sealant is 
heated in a melter cum storage vessel to the specified 
temperature. Heating should be done in a controlled 
and uniform manner by indirect method (preferably by 
oil jacketing). The melter should be thermostatically 
controlled to prevent overheating and degradation of 
the sealant. Provision of mechanical agitator in the 
melter helps control local overheating.
ii)	
Compressed Air powered Pump and Applicator/ 
Extruder for hot as well as cold applied material. 
Sealant material from the storage vessel is pumped to 
the applicator wand equipped with flexible hose and 
nozzle for application into the sealing groove.
4.29.2	 The traditional technique of joint sealing, however, involves 
use of a separate joint sealant melter (for heating hot applied sealant) 
(Figure 59) and a joint sealant pourer/ kettle (Figure 60) for sealing 
manually.

4.30.2	 A slip form kerb casting machine (sometimes also referred to 
as an offset slip form paver) (Figure 61) consists of the following:
i)	
A hopper which is filled with concrete mix prepared in a 
concrete mixer or concrete batching and mixing plant.
ii)	
An extrusion mould of desired profile for extruding the 
concrete mix onto the ground.
iii)	
Sensors for automatic horizontal and vertical controls 
to be used in conjunction with at least one guideline 
(stringline) to achieve the desired grade, slope and 
alignment.

provisions (e.g. mechanical stirrer) to keep the material 
from segregating or scorching. The kettle should be 
equipped with an automatic temperature control device 
and material thermometer for positive temperature 
control and to prevent overheating or scorching of 
the thermoplastic material. In case the melting pot is 
not an integral part of the machine, the thermoplastic 
material is first melted in a separate preheater and then 
transferred to a storage tank in the machine, where 
it should be maintained within the temperature range 
specified by the manufacturer to achieve the desired 
consistency for laying. The storage tank should have 
a mechanical stirrer to prevent segregation and a 
thermometer to monitor material temperature.
ii)	
Extrusion/ Screed Device (e.g. die or shoe) or Spray 
Gun for application of hot thermoplastic material on 
to the road surface. The spray process differs from 
extrusion process in that the hot thermoplastic material 
is combined with pressurised air to force its application 
on to the road surface.
Figure 62:  Road Marking Machine
iii)	
Glass Bead Hopper and Dispenser. The bead dispenser 
shall be attached to the road marking machine in such 
a manner that the glass beads are dispensed closely 
behind with the thermoplastic material. The bead

dispenser should be equipped with an automatic cut-off 
control system that is synchronized with the cut-off of 
the thermoplastic material and applies the glass beads 
in a uniform manner on the entire road marking surface 
with requisite embedment.
4.31.3	 The road marking machine should be capable of travelling 
at uniform speed, both uphill and downhill, to produce a uniform 
application of striking material and capable of following straight lines 
and making normal curves in a true arc.

Hot In Place Recycling (HIPR) Equipment 
4.32.1	 Hot In Place Recycling (HIPR) Equipment for Remixing 
(Figure 63) should be equipped with suitable features to carry out 
different functions such as:
i)	
An indirect heating system (infra-red or hot air or as 
the case may be) for heating the existing bituminous 
pavement surface uniformly without burning it.
ii)	
A milling drum/scarifier to rip the heated bituminous 
surface to the required depth.
iii)	
Suitable means (e.g. hopper and conveyor system 
coupled with feed systems for hot virgin mix and 
rejuvenator) for transferring the heated milled material 
along with additional hot virgin mix/rejuvenator to the 
pug mill mixer.
iv)	
A pug mill mixer for preparation of homogenised uniform 
remixed material.

v)	
A paving unit for laying the remixed material on the 
milled pavement surface.
vi)	
A compaction unit to compact the mix after paving.
A single machine can have all of the above features or there can be a 
train of equipment for performing different functions. 
The HIPR equipment should have electronic controls to monitor 
the processes of heating, feeding of materials, mixing and laying. It 
should be capable of maintaining the mix temperature throughout the 
recycling process with the final mix conforming to specifications.
4.32.2	 The HIPR Equipment should have working width at least 
equal to a single carriageway with adjustable arrangement. The 
heated width of surfacing should exceed the scarified width by at least 
75 mm on each side.
The HIPR Equipment should be capable of milling up to a depth of 
50 mm with a working output of 2 – 5 m/min. It should also be capable of 
incorporating more than 50% RBP (Reclaimed Bituminous Pavement) 
in the recycled mix.
4.33	
Cold In Place Recycling (CIR) Equipment
4.33.1	 Cold In Place Recycling (CIR) of bituminous pavement is 
in situ process of rehabilitation of damaged bituminous pavement 
involving 100% reuse of the existing bituminous pavement materials. 
The process is called cold recycling because the aggregates are not 
heated and are processed at ambient temperature with addition of fresh 
aggregates, water and recycling agent. The recycling agent can be 
bitumen emulsion, foamed bitumen and cementitious materials, either 
alone or in combination. While bitumen emulsion or foamed bitumen, 
as the case may be, is usually added in the mixing drum, cement may 
be added in slurry form in the mixing drum or it may be pre-spread on 
the damaged pavement by a spreader and consequently picked up by 
the milling drum of the recycler.
4.33.2	 A Cold In Place Recycling Equipment should have suitable 
features and controls for carrying out and monitoring the following 
fundamental operations:
i)	
Reclamation of the existing pavement to the specified 
depth in one pass
ii)	
Transformation of the reclaimed pavement into 
bituminous aggregates of suitable size

iii)	
Addition of fresh aggregates, water and recycling agent
iv)	
Uniform mixing of all the components to produce a 
homogeneous mix
v)	
Placement of the recycled mix on the pavement
vi)	
Compaction of the mix
A single machine can perform all of the above operations (except 
compaction, which is carried out by a separate roller) or there can be 
a train of equipment for performing different functions. 
An example of single unit recycling equipment (Figures 64 and 65) 
would be one which reclaims, sizes and mixes in the additives in the 
milling cum mixing drum while the placement operation is performed 
with a hydraulically adjustable scraper blade/screed attached to the 
back of the unit. The milling cum mixing drum has a hydraulically 
adjustable milling drum flap front for gradation control of the cut 
aggregates and microprocessor-controlled injection systems for 
addition of water and recycling agent.

An example of a multi-unit recycling train would be the case where 
the reclamation of the pavement is performed by a milling drum, the 
sizing is accomplished by a mobile screen/crusher unit, the mixing is 
done with a mobile pug mill and the placement is carried out with a 
standard paver. Figure 66 illustrates another configuration of a multi-
unit recycling train where a milling cum mixing drum pulverizes the 
pavement and prepares the recycled mix and then transfers the mix 
via a conveyor to a bituminous paver finisher for placement.

4.33.3	 Milling can be done either in up-cut or down-cut mode 
(Figure 67). The milling rotor operates against the recycler’s direction 
of travel when using the up-cut process, and in the recycler’s direction 
of travel when using the down-cut process.
Figure 67: Down-Cut Milling versus Up-Cut Milling
4.33.4	 Foamed Bitumen (Figure 68) – Foamed bitumen is produced 
from hot standard viscosity grade bitumen. In the process, the bitumen 
is heated electrically and small amounts of water and air are injected

into the hot bitumen at high pressure in the expansion chamber which 
results in the bitumen foaming and expanding to around 15-20 times 
its original volume. The bitumen foam, while still in its unstable foamed 
state, is then injected into the mixing drum via pneumatic injection 
nozzles. The greater the volume of the foam, the better will be the 
distribution of the bitumen in the aggregate.
Separate spraying systems are provided for addition of water and 
foam bitumen in the mixing drum and are microprocessor-controlled 
for accurate metering of the requisite quantities.
4.33.5	 The machine shall be equipped with levelling/grade controls 
to ensure longitudinal as well as transverse profile. Figure 69 
illustrates a four-way lifting pendulum arrangement in a four wheel 
drive crawler unit for height adjustment and to compensate for 
unevenness in the ground and to match the gradient/slope as per 
pavement requirements.
Figure 69: Four Way Lifting Pendulum Arrangement for  
Height Adjustment and Grade Control
4.33.6	 The milling drum should have minimum working width of 
2400 mm with variable depth control and variable drum speed to meet 
site requirements. Equipment with working depth up to 510 mm is 
available in the market.

Cold Milling Machine 
4.34.1	 Removal of existing bituminous pavement can be facilitated 
by either of the following two methods:



======================================================================
PAGE 150 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
130
i)	
Cold Milling
ii)	
Ripping and Crushing
Cold milling is the most widely used method. It involves automatically 
controlled removal of pavement to a desired depth and restoration of 
the surface free of ruts, humps and other imperfections to a specific 
grade or slope with special equipment called Milling Machine. The 
resulting surface can be used immediately as a driving surface to 
ensure ease of traffic and RBP (Reclaimed Bituminous Pavement) 
can be reused as aggregates back in system.
4.34.2	 The key benefits/functions of cold milling (Figures 70 and 71) 
are:
i)	
Scaled and required removal of bituminous pavement 
layers ensuring end product is granulated for further 
reuse of RBP.
ii)	
Improve riding quality and cross slope of the existing 
pavement.
iii)	
Lower the finished grade adjacent to existing curb or 
shoulder prior to resurfacing.
iv)	
Lower FRL (Finished Road Level) which has abruptly 
increased due to periodic overlays.
v)	
Ensure that the distresses in pavement are eliminated 
and that pavement is crack free and further overlay on 
milled surface ensures long lasting pavement.

(e.g. cases where the milled surface is to be the final 
surface of the pavement).
4.34.3	 The cold milling machine may be front loading (Figure 72) or 
rear loading (Figure 73) type and consists of the following:
i)	
A rotating cutting drum (Figure 74) equipped with a 
series of tungsten carbide tipped teeth (with variable 
tool spacing) for milling the pavement to the required 
depth. The drum has a number of tools mounted on the 
drum with uniform spacing ensuring the final cut size 
meets the gradation requirement for further aggregate 
reuse. The speed of the machine and milling depth are 
adjustable quickly at a push of a button.  Milling drum 
(with variable width 0.3 – 2 m) may be of various types 
depending upon the job requirement – removal of one 
or several pavement layers, removal of thin layers of

pavement package (at full depth) etc.
ii)	
A conveyor system for collecting the granulated 
bituminous material from the milling drum and 
discharging it directly onto waiting tipper trucks.

The milling machine is self-propelled with suitable power drive. It 
should be equipped with four wheels with “all-wheel” drive or equipped 
with four independently operated tracks fitted with track pads, thereby 
eliminating any damage to the bituminous surface. 
To ensure proper milling operation, the machine should have complete 
data displayed on the working panel of the machine. The machine 
should be capable of maintaining a depth of cut and cross slope as per 
requirements. The varying depth of cut and variable speed of operation 
should ensure the desired cut size of the RBP used for recycling.  
The machine shall be equipped with sensors for automatic grade 
controls (Figure 75), which ensures longitudinal as well as transverse 
profile.

The milling machine should be equipped with suitable means such 
as water spray system to effectively limit the amount of dust escaping 
from the removal operations. It should provide edge to edge milling in 
order to maintain even profile and reduce error.
A smaller milling machine may be used when milling adjacent to 
existing curb, around utilities or other areas where it is not practical to 
use the larger machine.
4.35	
Pneumatic Breaker
4.35.1	 It is a percussive tool where the piston reciprocates in 
a cylinder and gives a blow at one end of its stroke. It is used for 
demolition of rocks, structures and in construction quarrying.



======================================================================
PAGE 154 of 316

4.35.2	 Pneumatic breaker consists of the following:
i)	
A back head assembly equipped with a ‘T’-handle and 
a throttle lever. The throttle lever shall be located to 
permit operation of the breaker from either side.
ii)	
A cylinder assembly equipped with a valve mechanism 
to control the direction of air required for actuation of the 
piston, an anvil block sleeve and a reversible piston.
iii)	
Flanges – All flanges shall have sufficient thickness 
and strength to prevent failure during operation and to 
withstand mechanical stress when back head and front 
head assemblies are installed.
iv)	
 A front head assembly equipped with a chuck for the 
collar shanked tool and a positive shank retaining 
device such as latch retainer or swing stirrup type 
spring retainer. The chuck housing of the breaker shall 
contain a renewable liner or shall be of solid type.
v)	
Air inlet connection for supply of fresh air to the breaker. 
The end of the air inlet connection shall have an 
extended thread and shall be provided with a nipple for 
connection to 20 mm air hose. The air inlet connection 
shall permit operation of the breaker without any 
obstruction to the normal working or any restraint on 
the operator.
vi)	
Exhaust port for directing the exhaust air downward and 
away from the operator when the breaker is operated 
from either side.
vii)	
Suitable air cushions at both ends of the piston in the 
cylinder.
viii)	
An internal oil reservoir or an air line oiler for lubrication 
of the breaker. 
4.35.3	 Pneumatic breakers may be classified on the basis of weight 
of the basic unit as:
i)	
Light (for weight up to 20 kg) – for light demolition work.
ii)	
Medium (for weight over 20 kg and up to 32 kg) – for 
breaking light concrete pavements, macadam, frozen 
ground and gravel.
iii)	
Heavy (for weight over 32 kg and up to 40 kg) – for 
breaking concrete pavements, demolition of concrete

foundation and walls, cutting pavements and sub-
bases, trenching in hard ground and for breaking 
boulders which cannot be otherwise blasted.
4.35.4	 An example of a hand-held pneumatic breaker is jack hammer 
(Figure 106). The tool may be non-rotary or rotary type depending 
upon the application (e.g. chisel, drill bit, tamping rod, spike or sheeting 
driver etc.).
4.35.5	 For more information on pneumatic breaker, refer to IS:3559.
4.36	
Hydraulic Breaker
4.36.1	 Hydraulic Breaker is a percussive tool used for demolition 
works just like pneumatic breaker except that it is hydraulically 
powered. It is usually used as an attachment in hydraulic excavator or 
backhoe loader. It (Figure 76) comprises of the following:
Figure 76: Hydraulic Breaker

======================================================================

======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
136
ii)	
An accumulator to store potential energy (most 
commonly by means of compressed gas) and act as 
a quick secondary source of fluid power capable of 
doing useful work as required by the system. It helps to 
smooth out pulsations in the breaker.
iii)	
A back head filled with nitrogen gas
iv)	
Impact piston for delivering the striking energy to the 
chisel while performing a reciprocal motion
v)	
A tool (or chisel) that breaks the subject material directly
Blowing operation of the hydraulic breaker involves downward 
movement of the valve spool in the control valve to allow high 
pressure oil to act on the impact piston in the cylinder and cause it 
to move upward, thereby compressing the nitrogen gas in the back 
head. Subsequently, the direction of oil flow in the directional control 
valve changes such that it causes the valve spool to rise upward, 
thereby, reducing the upward oil pressure acting on the impact piston. 
As a result, the compressed nitrogen gas in the back head now exerts 
sufficient downward force on the piston, thereby, causing it to move 
downward and strike the top of the chisel. This sends a compressive 
stress wave to the working end of the chisel, which causes the rock in 
touch with it to fracture. Immediately following the initial compressive 
stress wave, a reflected stress wave is formed, which travels back 
up the tool, bouncing the piston up off the top of the tool. This cycle 
of compressive and tensile stresses flowing up and down the tool is 
repeated with each piston blow.
Anything interfering with the strength of the compressive stress waves 
during operation such as blank-firing (free-running) or prying with 
the tool, can lower breaker performance and cause tool fatigue. The 
breaker must be at a 90° angle to the face of the rock.
Effective measures for controlling dust when using hydraulic breakers 
include continuous feeding of water to the point of impact through 
water spray system, provision of a shroud or cowling with a vacuum 
dust collecting system, etc.
4.36.2	 Since a hydraulic breaker is often operated under extreme 
conditions and has to endure impact vibrations and impact 
loads, therefore structural stability of the housing is critical to the 
performance, durability and lifespan of the equipment and hence, one 
of the most important design factors. Other design factors influencing 
performance of the breaker include the hydraulic circuit, design of the 
striking piston, shuttle valve etc.

Mobile Slurry Seal Equipment
4.37.1	 It consists of a self-propelled assembly of either truck-mounted 
or continuous run design, which simultaneously manufactures and 
spreads the mix on the job. In addition to slurry seal, the equipment 
can be used with slight modification for micro-surfacing. The primary 
difference between slurry seal and micro-surfacing is that the former 
uses a bitumen emulsion and the latter a modified bitumen emulsion.
The difference between truck-mounted design and continuous run 
design (Figure 77) of the machine is that the latter is equipped with a 
self-loading device to replenish its stock of material from specialised 
feeder truck while continuing to lay slurry seal. Such a machine can 
run continuously with minimal stops, thereby minimising construction 
joints.

The process consists of feeding the aggregates, filler, water and 
bitumen emulsion into a hydraulic or mechanical continuous flow 
mixer at the specified rates. The mixer shall be a multi-blade or spiral 
continuous flow unit capable of accurately proportioning and mixing 
the ingredients, thereby producing a homogenised mix. The mix is 
then discharged onto a spreader box on a continuous basis. 
Individual volume or weight controls for proportioning each material 
to be added to the mix shall be provided and properly marked. The 
proportioning devices are usually revolution counters or flow meters or 
totalizer meters or similar devices – a counter to count the revolutions 
of the aggregate/filler belt head pulley, a metering device capable 
of measuring the quantity of water and a separate metering device 
capable of measuring the quantity of bitumen emulsion.
In a hydraulic continuous flow mixer, the drive shaft of the hydraulic 
motor is connected directly to the emulsion pump and has the same 
or a parallel shaft connected to the hydraulic motor that drives the 
aggregate belt head pulley. In a mechanical continuous flow mixer, 
the emulsion pump and aggregate belt head pulley are driven off the 
same drive shaft.



======================================================================

The mix shall be spread uniformly by means of a conventional 
surfacing spreader box attached to the mixer and equipped to agitate 
and spread the material evenly throughout the box. The agitator 
consists of paddles mounted on an adjustable shaft and provides 
sufficient turbulence to prevent the mix from setting in the box or 
causing excessive side build up or lumps. The spreader box shall be 
equipped with flexible material (seal) in continuous contact with the 
existing bituminous pavement and shall be capable of controlling the 
rate of application. A front seal shall be provided to ensure no loss of 
the mixture at the road contact point. The rear seal shall act as final 
strike-off and shall be adjustable to get suitable strike-off height. The 
spreader box and rear strike-off shall be so designed and operated 
that a uniform consistency is achieved to produce a free flow of 
material to the rear strike-off. A secondary strike-off shall have the 
same adjustment as the spreader box. The spreader box shall have 
adjustable width and suitable means provided to side shift the box to 
compensate for variations in the pavement geometry. A burlap drag 
or other approved screed may be attached to the rear of the spreader 
box to provide a uniform, smooth and highly textured mat.
Some spreader boxes are equipped with one or more sets of augers 
to improve the distribution of slurry seal in the spreader box.
For continuous run design of mobile slurry seal equipment, the 
machine shall be equipped with a self-loading device and forward and 
reverse speed controls to enable the operator to have full control of 
the forward and reverse speed during application of the slurry seal. 
For more information on mobile slurry seal/ micro-surfacing equipment, 
refer to IRC:SP:81.

Mastic Cooker
4.38.1	 Mastic cooker (Figure 79) is mobile equipment meant for 
preparation of mastic asphalt. It is suited for small scale works.
4.38.2	 It consists of compartments, where each compartment is 
an insulated tank with provision for heating. Heating is usually done 
by oil fired burners. The central and main compartment is equipped 
with a mechanical agitator and is used for heating bitumen and for 
preparing the mix, while the side pockets or compartments are meant 
for preheating of coarse and fine aggregates and filler.
4.38.3	 Mastic cookers of various capacities ranging from 0.5 tonne to 
3 tonne are usually used depending on the amount of work involved.

An auger system to cut and disaggregate a snow pack.
ii)	
An impeller system for casting/blowing the broken snow 
particles via a chute.
iii)	
A chute capable of rotating about a vertical axis for 
casting the snow in the desired direction.
The machine should be capable of operating at high altitudes (up 
to 5500 m above mean sea level). It should have adequate lighting

Cold Bituminous Mixing Plant
4.40.1	 As the name suggests, this plant is used for preparation of 
cold bituminous mix by blending bitumen emulsion with pre-wetted 
aggregates according to a laboratory job mix formula. The cold mix 
may be used for base, binder, levelling or wearing course or structural 
overlays, especially during the rainy season. The plant may be mobile 
or stationary and is powered by a diesel engine or electric motor. A 
mobile plant is mounted on a chassis with pneumatic tyres of adequate 
size and with over-run and parking brakes. 
4.40.2	 A mobile mixing plant is usually preferred and consists of the 
following components:
i)	
Aggregate Feeder – It shall have not less than two 
bins or compartments, each of sufficient capacity and 
provided with accurate mechanical means for feeding 
the aggregate at a uniform and predetermined rate 
to the elevator or to some intermediated conveyor 
delivering the aggregate to the weighing or measuring 
equipment. The feeder shall provide for adjustment of 
total and proportional feed. For smaller plants, the cold 
feed hopper may be directly mounted over the pug mill 
and discharge door opened or closed manually. The 
loading of the cold feed hopper may be done manually 
or by mechanical means.
ii)	
Aggregate Elevator (if necessary) – The aggregate 
may be elevated to the mixer by a bucket conveyor, a 
skip hoist or a belt conveyor.
iii)	
Bitumen Emulsion Storage Unit – It should have 
sufficient capacity for at least one day run.
iv)	
Mixer –The mixer is usually a twin shaft pug mill and 
can be either of the continuous or batch mixing type. 
Suitable means shall be provided for accurate weighing 
and feeding of aggregates and bitumen emulsion 
into the mixer. However, in case of smaller mixers, 
volumetric measurement of both aggregates and 
bitumen emulsion may be permitted.
	
The mixer can have capacity ranging from 6 TPH to 
60 TPH.
4.40.3	 For more information on mobile cold bituminous mixing plant, 
refer to IS:5435.

6.  DESCRIPTION  OF  ESSENTIAL  EQUIPMENT  FOR  
BRIDGE  WORKS
Bulk of the equipment used for bridge works has already been 
described in Section 4.
Other essential equipment for bridge works are discussed below:
6.1	
Concrete Placement Equipment
6.1.1	
Concrete is either mixed at the project site itself or transported 
to the site via a transit mixer or agitator truck. Thereafter, it must 
be placed to its final position without segregation and before it has 
achieved an initial set. Depending on the horizontal and vertical 
distance of the concrete movement and other constraints, the following 
means are available for placement of concrete:
i)	
Concrete Buckets 
ii)	
Skip and Hoist
iii)	
Buggies and Wheel Barrows
iv)	
Chutes
v)	
Drop Pipes
vi)	
Belt Conveyors
vii)	
Concrete Pumps
6.1.2	
Concrete Bucket – Commonly lifted by cranes, concrete 
buckets should be selected such that they can be lifted safely to the 
required concrete placing locations by the job site crane. Selection 
of bucket size is governed by the desired production rate. Larger the 
bucket size, smaller will be the number of work cycles required to 



======================================================================
PAGE 178 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
158
execute a given concrete placement. Accordingly, the crane should 
be selected such that its lifting capacity is more than the weight of the 
loaded bucket.
The discharge gate (usually of clamshell type) at the bottom of the 
bucket may be operated manually or with aid from external power. 
Since the bucket must be raised and lowered and allowed to swing 
freely, it is not feasible to have a permanent connecting line to supply 
power for the discharge gate. An effective technique to operate the 
gate with external power is by compressed air. A compressed air 
line can be attached to the bucket by means of a quick-connecting 
coupling and detached simply by twisting.
6.1.3	
Skip and Hoist – This method is used for transporting 
concrete vertically. At the ground level, the skip is first loaded with 
concrete and it, then, travels vertically on rails up to the desired level, 
where it discharges concrete by manual or automatic operation. Lifting 
of the skip is powered by a hoist of minimum 0.5 ton capacity.
6.1.4	
Buggies and Wheel Barrows – Buggies and wheel barrows 
are suitable for concrete placement over short distances. They are 
used for small works or as a complementary means on projects utilizing 
cranes or concrete pumps as the major concrete placing equipment. 
When considering the use of buggies and wheel barrows, the expense 
of building ramps, runways and similar setups should be taken into 
account as they can operate only on smooth and rigid surfaces.
Buggies can be manual (hand buggies) or motor-propelled (power 
buggies). The power buggy has a single lever controlled hydraulic 
dumping mechanism.
6.1.5	
Chute – Chutes are often used to transfer concrete from 
a higher elevation to a lower elevation. They should have a round 
bottom, and the slope should be steep enough for the concrete to 
flow continuously without segregation. Transit mixers are normally 
equipped with built-in swing (and often extendable) chutes. These 
chutes are hydraulically operated for direct placing of the mix when 
the concreting location is within chute reach.
6.1.6	
Drop Pipe – Drop pipes are used to transfer the concrete 
vertically down. They are used when concrete is placed in a wall 
or column to avoid segregation caused by allowing the concrete to 
free fall through the reinforcement. A tremie operation occurs when 



======================================================================
PAGE 179 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
159
a drop pipe (which in this case is called a tremie pipe) is used to 
place concrete under water. The lower end of a tremie pipe is kept 
continuously immersed in fresh plastic concrete.
6.1.7	
Belt Conveyor – Belt conveyors provide for rapid movement 
of fresh concrete. Selection of proper belt size and speed is required 
to achieve the desired rate of transportation. Particular attention 
must be given to points where the concrete leaves one conveyor for 
continuing on another conveyor or is discharged, and at the points 
where the belt passes over the rollers, so that segregation does not 
occur at any of these points.
Belt conveyors can be classified into three types:
i)	
Portable or Self-contained Conveyors
ii)	
Feeders or Series Conveyors
iii)	
Side Discharge or Spreader Conveyors

Concrete Pump
6.2.1	
Concrete pumps allow high placing rates and are useful where 
space for construction equipment is limited.
To work properly, the pump must be fed with concrete of uniform 
workability and consistency and adequate fluidity and cohesiveness. 
Concrete pumps are powered either by the engine of the trucks on 
which they are mounted or by a separate diesel engine or electric 
motor.
6.2.2	
Concrete pumps are typically classified on the basis of the 
following characteristics:
i)	
Type of pumping unit
ii)	
Mode or frequency of transportation
iii)	
Form of conveying
iv)	
Concrete-mix delivery with assistance

Piston Pump (Figure 81) – The most common concrete 
pumps are usually of the piston type and consist of a receiving hopper, 
two concrete pumping cylinders, and a valving system to alternately 
direct the flow of concrete into the pumping cylinders and from 
there to the pipeline. One concrete cylinder receives concrete from 
the receiving hopper while the other discharges into the pipeline to 
provide a relatively constant flow of concrete through the pipeline to 
the placing area. Pistons in the concrete cylinders create a vacuum to

draw in concrete on the intake stroke and mechanically push it into the 
pipeline on the discharge stroke. These pistons are driven by hydraulic 
cylinders on most pumps, but may also be driven mechanically.
Use of an agitator in the feeding/ receiving hopper helps maintain the 
flowability of concrete and prevents it from setting.
In case of very large pumping distances, relay pumping using pumps 
in series may be adopted.
Figure 81: Piston and Rotary Concrete Pumps
6.2.4	
Rotary Pump (Figure 81) – In this type of pump (also called 
squeeze pump), a peristaltic action is used to impart energy to the 
concrete mix with the intent of transporting the mix to and through 
the conveying pipe and/or hose. Concrete in the collecting/ intake 
hopper is fed by rotating blades into a flexible hose which is connected 
to and fitted inside the pumping chamber. Rollers (two or more in 
number), which are mounted on planetary gear drives at the external 
circumference of a hydraulic motor driven rotor assembly, rotate 
on the flexible hose within the pumping chamber and progressively 
squeeze the concrete out at the discharge port. Subsequently, as 
the elastic hose returns to its original shape (i.e. cylindrical) after the 
passing of the roller, concrete flow from the hopper to the pump is 
induced. Maintaining the pumping chamber under vacuum can ensure 
that except when being squeezed by roller, the hose shape remains 
cylindrical so that a continuous flow of concrete is permitted.

6.2.5	
Pump with Pipeline – In this configuration, also termed as 
a line pump, the pipeline (rigid or flexible) is a separate system that 
must be assembled by means of quick couplings and connected 
to the pump before pumping operation begins. The pipeline is laid 
from the location of the pump to the concrete placing area. The 
pump is located within good access of the transit mixer or agitator 
truck. In case of a central concrete batching and mixing plant 
located at the work site, the pump is placed with the hopper just 
under the mixer’s discharge opening. The free end of the pipeline 
has a flexible rubber pipe connected to it for better control of the 
concrete discharge location and for easier handling by the workers 
who have to direct the spreading of the concrete. However, holding 
and moving the end of the pipe may be difficult given its weight 
when filled with concrete. In such cases, it is desirable to use a 
special light weight distribution (or placing) boom, which connects 
to the end of the rigid pipe and is supported by a ballasted base. 
The entire articulated boom assembly is crane lifted for relocation 
as the concreting progresses.
The pump may be stationary or mobile (mounted on a truck or 
trailer).
6.2.6	
Pump with Integral Distribution Boom (Figure 82) – In this 
configuration, also termed as a boom pump, the pump is mounted 
on a truck and is equipped with a revolving (slewing) boom to which 
a fixed length delivery line is connected. The boom is hydraulically 
operated and consists of three to six articulating sections. For a given 
boom length, a greater number of sections provides the boom with 
greater manoeuvrability. Boom length indicates the boom’s maximum 
vertical reach, measured from the ground. Maximum horizontal reach 
is measured from the boom’s slewing axis. Effective horizontal reach 
depends upon the truck make and size, and specific boom dimensions 
and truck dimensions need to be considered when selecting a truck 
mounted pump for a given concreting operation.
Since the reach of boom pumps is limited, these pumps use ready-
mixed concrete with the pump optimally positioned to enable maximum 
coverage of the concreting area for each concreting operation.

6.2.7	
Pump with Separate Distribution Boom – This configuration 
consists of a stationary or mobile pump at the concrete loading end, a 
hydraulically articulated separate placing boom at the concrete placing 
end, and an intermediate pipeline connecting the pump to the boom. 
For applications which may be affected by the limited reach of boom 
pumps on account of large horizontal/ vertical distribution reach (e.g. 
underwater concreting in case of long span bridge over deep water 
body with long piers), it is advisable to use a pump with separate 
distribution boom. 
6.2.8	
Selection of concrete pump is primarily governed by two 
important parameters – maximum volumetric output (in cum/hour) and 
peak pumping pressure. To be able to achieve a targeted output of 
concrete at site, it is essential to determine, as accurately as possible, 
the required pumping pressure so that, together with the desired 
output, a rational basis for selecting a pump can be developed. 
Pumping pressure will depend upon factors like total lead (including 
horizontal and/or vertical distance over which the concrete is to be 
pumped), delivery pipeline diameter, directional changes in the 
pipeline, concrete consistency and delivery output.

Working Chamber – When caissons are designed to be sunk 
under compressed air, it is usual to provide a single large working

======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
165
chamber instead of having a number of working chambers separated 
by cross walls. The single chamber is a convenient arrangement for 
minimising resistance to sinking since the resistance is only given 
by the outer walls. Control of sinking by differential excavation from 
a number of cells is not necessary since control of position and 
verticality can readily be achieved by other means, for example, by the 
use of shores and wedges beneath the cutting edge, or by differential 
excavation beneath the cutting edge.
The roof of the working chamber (called corbel) must be strongly built 
as it may have to resist high air pressures over a wide span.
Access to the working chamber is through shafts. Since all excavated 
material must be lifted through the shafts, the shafts must have 
adequate capacity in size and numbers to pass the required quantity 
of spoil in buckets through the air locks to meet the desired rate of 
sinking. The air shaft is usually oval in plan and is divided into two 
compartments by a vertical ladder. One compartment is used for 
hoisting and lowering spoil buckets and the other is for the workmen. 
In case of larger caissons (where 15 or more workmen are involved), 
separate air shafts are provided for excavated muck and workmen.
6.3.3	
Air Locks – The air lock is a steel pressure vessel made in 
the form of a chamber with two doors. One door opens to the outside 
and the other to the air shaft. This arrangement makes it possible to 
maintain a constant air pressure in the working chamber during the 
passage of men and material. One of the doors must always be kept 
closed to prevent the compressed air pressure in the working chamber 
from becoming lower. In small caissons, an airlock serves several 
functions – it is used by men as an entry to the working chamber; for 
the transport of excavated muck; and for delivering concrete to fill the 
working chamber at the end of sinking. In larger caissons, separate 
locks for men and muck are provided.
The air lock is mounted on top of the air shaft and it is essential for 
the safety of the workmen to ensure that the lock is always above 
the highest tidal or river flood levels, with sufficient safety margin to 
allow for unexpected rapidity in sinking of the caisson. Alternatively, 
the air locks can be protected against flooding by building up the skin 
plating or by providing a cofferdam around the top of the caisson to 
the required height.
The size of the air locks and air shafts is governed largely by the 
quantity of material to be excavated, that is, by the size of the muck 
bucket.

6.3.4	
Air Compressor – Compressed air for the working chamber 
is delivered from a compressor plant via air locks and air shafts and a 
pipe distribution system. According to the location of the caisson, the 
compressor plant is land-based or barge mounted. 
Compressors for air supply are usually of stationary type. Ideally, they 
should be driven by variable speed motors to enable the supply to be 
progressively increased as the caisson sinks deeper.
6.3.5	
Air Conditioning Plant – Improved working conditions and 
greater immunity to caisson sickness can be ensured by using an air 
conditioning plant. The plant should aim to remove moisture and oil, 
and to warm the air for working under cold weather condition or cool 
the air for working under hot weather condition.
6.3.6	
Exhaust Valves – Exhaust valves shall be provided, having 
risers extending to the upper part of the chamber. These shall be 
operated whenever necessary, especially after a blast. Precautions 
shall be taken that men are not allowed to resume work after a blast 
until the gas and smoke have cleared.
6.3.7	
Lighting System – All lighting in compressed air chambers 
shall be operated only by electricity. Two independent electric lighting 
systems with independent sources of supply shall be used.  These 
shall be so arranged that the emergency source shall become 
automatically operative in case of failure of the regularly used source.
The minimum intensity of light on any walkway ladder, stairway or 
lower working level shall be 0.25 candlepower. In all work places, 
the lighting shall always be such as to enable workmen to see their 
way about clearly. All external parts of lighting features and electrical 
equipment lying within 2.5 m above the floor shall be constructed 
of non-combustible, non-absorbing insulating materials. If metal is 
used, it must be effectively earthed. Portable lamp shall have non-
combustible, non-absorbing insulating sockets, approved handles, 
basket guards and approved cables.
6.3.8	
Safety provisions as contained in IS:4138 and Section 1208.8 
of MoRTH’s Specifications for Road and Bridge Works shall be strictly 
followed.
6.4	
Pile Driver
6.4.1	
Driven piles are usually installed to established criteria – 
minimum blow count per unit penetration or minimum penetration.

The function of a pile driving hammer (or pile driver) is to provide the 
energy required to drive a pile. The pile driver is usually mounted on a 
piling rig (Figure 84).

Pile drivers are designated by type and size. Different types of 
pile drivers are available for catering to various subsurface conditions 
and are discussed below:
i)	
Drop type
ii)	
Single Acting (steam or compressed air) type

Drop Hammer (Figure 85) – A drop hammer is a heavy metal weight 
that is lifted by a hoist line, then released and allowed to fall onto the 
top of the pile. A pile cap is positioned between the hammer and the 
pile head because of the high dynamic forces and serves to uniformly 
distribute the blow to the pile head and, therefore, acts as a shock 
absorber.

The hammer may be released by a trip and fall freely, or it may be 
released by loosening the friction band on the hoisting drum and 
permitting the weight of the hammer to unwind the rope from the drum. 
The latter type of release reduces the effective energy of the hammer 
due to friction loss in the drum and rope. Leads are used to hold the 
pile in position and to guide the movement of the hammer so that it will 
strike the pile axially.
A drop hammer is suitable for driving piles on remote projects that 
require only a few piles and for which the time of completion is not an 
important factor.
Single Acting Hammer (Figure 86) – A single acting steam or air 
hammer consists of a freely falling weight (called ram), that is lifted by 
steam or compressed air, whose pressure is applied to the underside 
of a piston that is connected to the ram through a piston rod. When 
the piston reaches the top of the stroke, the steam or air pressure is 
released and the ram falls freely by its own weight to strike the top 
of a pile. These hammers rely solely on gravity acting on the striking 
weight through a distance to achieve their striking energy. 



======================================================================
PAGE 189 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
169
Figure 86: Single Acting Hammer
A driving cap (or anvil or helmet) is positioned between the hammer 
and the pile head to uniformly distribute the blow to the pile head. 
A single acting hammer is usually used in a pile lead, though it can be 
fitted to operate free hung.
A single acting hammer can strike higher blows per minute than a drop 
hammer.
Double Acting Hammer (Figure 87) – Here, the striking ram (piston) 
is driven by compressed air or steam when rising as well as when 
falling. The air or steam enters a valve box containing a slide valve 
that sends it alternately to each side of the piston, while the opposite 
side is connected to the exhaust ports. Thus, with a given weight of 
ram, it is possible to attain a desired amount of energy per blow with a 
shorter stroke than with a longer single-acting hammer.



======================================================================

======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment

Figure 87: Double Acting Hammer
A double acting hammer can strike higher blows per minute than a 
single acting hammer.
The lighter ram and higher striking velocity of the double acting hammer 
may be advantageous when driving light to medium weight piles into 
soils having normal frictional resistance. The high frequency of blows 
will keep a pile moving downward continuously, thereby preventing 
static skin friction from developing between blows. However, when 
heavy piles are driven, especially into soils having high frictional 
resistance, the heavier weight and slower velocity of a single acting 
hammer will transmit a greater portion of the rated energy into driving 
the piles.
Differential Acting Hammer (Figure 88) – Here, the air or steam 
pressure used to lift the ram is not exhausted at the end of the upward 
stroke but is valved over the piston to accelerate the ram on the down 
stroke.



======================================================================
PAGE 191 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
171
Figure 88: Differential Acting Hammer
The number of blows per minute is comparable with that for a double 
acting hammer, whereas the weight and equivalent free fall of the ram 
are comparable with those of a single acting hammer.
These hammers require the use of a pile cap with cushioning material 
and a set of leads.
Diesel Hammer (Figure 89) – It is a self-contained driving unit that 
does not require an external source of energy like an air compressor 
or steam boiler. It is, therefore, simpler and easily movable from one 
location to another than a steam hammer.
A diesel hammer unit consists of a vertical cylinder, a piston or ram, 
an anvil, fuel and lubricating oil tanks, a fuel pump, injectors and a 
mechanical lubricator.



======================================================================
PAGE 192 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
172
Figure 89: Diesel Hammer
Figure 90 illustrates the operation cycle of a single acting diesel 
hammer. After the hammer is placed on top of the pile, the combined 
piston and ram are lifted by a lifting attachment (e.g. cable from crane) 
to the upper end of the stroke and released to start the unit operating. 
As the free-falling ram nears the end of the down stroke, it activates a 
fuel pump that injects the fuel into the combustion chamber between 
the ram and the anvil. As soon as the ram passes the exhaust ports, 
air is trapped in the combustion chamber. The continued down stroke 
of the ram compresses the air and fuel to ignition heat. The resulting 
explosion drives the pile downward and the ram upward to repeat its 
stroke. The energy per blow can be controlled by the operator (through 
manually operated variable fuel injector) as per requirement.
Operation of a double acting diesel hammer differs from that of a 
single acting diesel hammer in the sense that the top of the cylinder 
is capped and has a “bounce chamber”, which compresses the air 
as the ram reaches near the top of its upward stroke and halts the 
ram’s upward flight when sufficient pressure builds up. The ram 
then begins its downward stroke under the effect of both gravity as 
well as the internal pressure generated in the “bounce chamber”. 
The rest of the operation cycle is similar to that of a single acting 
diesel hammer.



======================================================================
PAGE 193 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
173
Diesel hammers require a pile cap with cushioning material to protect 
the pile heads during driving.
Figure 90: Operation Cycle of Single Acting Diesel Hammer
Hydraulic Hammer – It is more efficient than steam, air or diesel 
hammers. It operates on the differential pressure of hydraulic fluid 
instead of compressed air or steam.
It can be of two types: hydraulic drop (or single acting) hammer and 
double acting hydraulic hammer. 
In a hydraulic drop hammer, the ram is lifted by hydraulic pressure to 
a preset height and then allowed to free-fall onto the anvil on account 
of gravity. With these hammers, the height of the drop can be varied to 
match the pile and ground conditions.
In a double acting hydraulic hammer, movement of the ram in both 
upward stroke and downward stroke is facilitated by hydraulic 
pressure. The net energy applied to the pile by the accelerated 
ram is measured during every blow on a control panel and can be 
continuously regulated.



======================================================================

Vibratory Hammer (Figure 91) – The hammer is equipped with 
two horizontal shafts to which eccentric weights are attached. As 
the shafts rotate in opposing directions, vibrations are produced in 
the vertical direction and then, transmitted to the pile as the pile is 
rigidly connected to the hammer by hydraulic clamps. From the pile, 
the vibrations are transmitted into the adjacent soil. The agitation of 
the soil materially reduces the skin friction between the soil and the 
pile. 
Figure 91: Vibratory Hammer
Leads are rarely employed with vibratory hammers. The hammer is 
powered either electrically (electric genset) or hydraulically (hydraulic 
power pack).
The performance of a vibratory hammer depends upon its amplitude, 
frequency, eccentric moment, vibrating weight and non-vibrating 
weight.



======================================================================
PAGE 195 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
175
Vibratory hammer should not be used for driving permanent piles 
unless specified in the Contract or approved by the Engineer because 
there is no way to determine the amount of energy delivered to the 
pile. If approved, it should be used in combination with pile load testing 
and re-tapping with an impact hammer, ensuring that acceptable load 
capacity is achieved.
However, vibratory hammer can be used to install temporary works 
(e.g. sheet piles for shoring) as well as for pile extraction.
6.4.3	
Pile drivers may be classified on the basis of weight of ram (or 
striking part) as:
i)	
Light (for weight up to 500 kg)
ii)	
Medium (for weight over 500 kg and up to 2500 kg)
iii)	
Heavy (for weight over 2500 kg)
Driven Pile Foundations (Permanent Works) – The weight or power 
of the hammer should be sufficient to ensure a penetration of at least 
5 mm per blow unless rock has been reached. It is always preferable 
to employ the heaviest hammer practicable and to limit the stroke, so 
as not to damage the pile. The minimum weight of the hammer shall 
be 2500 kg. In the case of precast concrete piles, the mass of the 
hammer shall not be less than 30 times the mass of 300 mm length 
of pile.
6.4.4	
The performance of the hammer is indicated by its weight, 
rated energy and blows per minute.
6.4.5	
Selection of the hammer type and size depends upon a variety 
of factors like:
i)	
Size, type and number of piles
ii)	
Soil characteristics and site topography
iii)	
Type of rig/crane available
iv)	
Project location – whether driving is to be done on land 
or over water
6.4.6	
Use of a water jet to assist in driving piles into sand or fine 
gravel can speed up the driving operation. Water discharged through 
a nozzle at the lower end of a jet pipe loosens and keeps the soil 



======================================================================
PAGE 196 of 316
======================================================================

around the pile in agitation (thereby reducing the resistance due to 
skin friction), and removes the soil particles from the hole ahead of the 
penetration of the pipe.
When water jetting is used, at least two jets shall be attached to the 
pile symmetrically.
If large quantities of water are used for jetting, provision shall be made 
for collecting and draining away of water when it comes to the surface 
of the ground, so that the stability of the piling plant is not endangered 
by the softening of the ground.
6.5	
Pile Boring Equipment
6.5.1	
Construction of bored piles requires careful selection of the 
boring equipment. The choice of the appropriate piling equipment 
will depend upon the subsoil strata, groundwater condition, type of 
founding material, pile diameter, pile depth etc.
6.5.2	
The following methods are usually adopted for advancing 
boreholes:
i)	
Rotary or rotary-percussion rigs using Continuous 
Mud Circulation (CMC) method – This method 
(Figure 92) uses drilling mud to bring the drill cuttings 
out as well as to stabilise the borehole. A mud pump of 
sufficient capacity (depending upon the diameter and 
depth of the borehole) is used to ensure that drilling 
fluid (bentonite) of sufficient viscosity and velocity is 
maintained in continuous circulation so that the drill 
cuttings are suspended in the mud and brought to 
the surface by the flow of bentonite. The level of the 
bentonite suspension is kept constant.
	
A minimum of 2 m length of top of the borehole shall 
invariably be provided with casing to ensure that the 
loose soil does not fall into the bore.

PAGE 197 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
177
Figure 92: Rotary or Rotary-Percussion Boring using  
Bentonite Suspension
	
The various Continuous Mud Circulation (CMC) 
methods are listed below:
a)	
Direct Mud Circulation (DMC) – Here, the bentonite 
suspension is pumped into the hole bottom through drill 
rod and it overflows at the top of the casing.
	
An improved version of the DMC method is the Rapid 
Direct Mud Circulation (R-DMC) method, where a tube 
carrying compressed air is sent to the hole bottom. The 
air improves mixing of the drill cuttings with the bentonite 
slurry so that even heavy particles can be forced out of 
the hole suspended in the bentonite.
b)	
Reverse Mud Circulation (RMC) – Here, the bentonite 
suspension is pumped directly at the top of the hole and 
is pumped out from the hole bottom through the drill rod. 
While the borehole size in DMC method is limited by the 
mud pump capacity, in RMC method even a pump of 
medium capacity can create enough bailing velocity to 
bring the cuttings up and the inner diameter of the drill 
rod need not be large.
	
An improved version of the RMC method is the Air Lift 
Reverse Mud Circulation (A-RMC) method, which uses 



======================================================================
PAGE 198 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
178
compressed air to circulate the drilling fluid and drill 
cuttings to the surface.
	
Both the RMC and A-RMC methods are suited for large 
diameter holes.
	
Principle of operation of rotary and rotary-percussion 
drills is explained in Section 6.9.
	
For rotary and rotary-percussion drills using flushing 
medium (eg: water), that aids in cutting process but not 
suitable for bore stabilisation, temporary casing should 
be provided for the entire length of the borehole.
ii)	
Cable Percussion Rig (Bailer and Chisel Method) 
– The rig consists of a tripod derrick and winch which 
are used to lift and drop heavy cutting tools down on 
to the base of the borehole. The selection of cutting 
tool depends upon the soil conditions. Heavy hammer 
weights can be added onto the top of the cutting tool to 
increase the momentum of the dropping tool.
	
In this method, the borehole is stabilised by steel 
casing instead of drilling mud. A temporary casing has 
a collar at its top to take blows during casing driving 
and a cutting edge at its bottom to facilitate driving. The 
casing is driven open ended with a pile driving hammer 
using a casing drive bar. Materials inside the casing are 
removed progressively as the percussion equipment 
drills the hole. After concreting is over, the casing is 
extracted using a casing extractor bar.
iii)	
Winch (Figure 93) – A typical piling winch consists of 
a winch drum powered by a prime mover. The standard 
capacities  (drum  rope  pull)  of the  winch drum  shall 
be  1.5  tonne, 2.5 tonne and 5 tonne; and the  drum 
diameter shall  be  not  less  than  20  times  the  diameter 
of  the wire  rope  used.
	
The  prime  mover  is usually  a diesel  engine  of the  air 
cooled  type  or  an  electric  motor. A suitable reduction 
gear shall also be provided.
	
The transmission system shall be geared, chained or 
belt (flat belt or V-belt) drive and provided with suitable 
guard cover.

The clutch system consists of a clutch wheel and friction 
plate(s) or a friction cone operated by a lever.
	
The brake system consists  of  a brake  band  connected 
with  the foot  brake pedal  or  brake  handle  for  hand 
operation.
	
The winch frame is truck-mounted, crawler-mounted or 
skid-mounted. A proper stabiliser shall be provided to 
transmit the load to the ground smoothly.
iv)	
Derrick (Figure 93) – The hoisting capacity of the 
derrick shall be at least equal to the maximum drum 
rope pull and preferably more by 25%. The standard 
derrick consists of a main shear leg and two side shear 
legs, and has a pulley at the top of the main shear leg. 
The pulley  shall  have  a  diameter  at least  20  times 
the  diameter  of  the  wire rope  used. It  shall  have 
a  suitable  guard  and  shall  be properly  lubricated. 
A safety link is provided near the top of the derrick so 
as to preclude any accidental increase in the distance 
between the legs.
Boring/Cutting Tools – The following types of boring/cutting tools are 
available for selection:

a)	
Sludge Pump (Figure 94) – Boring is usually advanced 
by using a sludge pump (also called shell). Sludge 
pump is a hollow cylindrical steel body with a cutting 
shoe at the bottom and a lifting hook at its top.  It has 
hinged trap door immediately above the bottom cutting 
edge and it has an opening (window) near the top for 
muck removal.  Above this window, lead or steel or 
concrete may be added to increase the weight of the 
sludge pump for effective boring.
	
Weight of the sludge pump shall vary with the diameter 
but normally minimum weight shall be 7.5 kN.
Figure 94: Sludge Pump
b)	
Bailer (Figure 95) – The bailer is used for removal of 
water or slush from the bore hole. It is made up of a 



======================================================================
PAGE 201 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
181
hollow steel cylinder with a lifting hook at the top and 
a truncated base plate with perforation at the bottom. 
There is a plunger passing through a central hole of the 
base plate which acts as a plug valve. This plunger is 
about 20 cm long and has about 15 cm diameter steel-
plates welded at its top and bottom. This closes the 
central hole in the base plate of the plunger and thus 
retains the slush material for removal.
Figure 95: Bailer
c)	
Chisel (Figure 96) – Hard strata during boring is broken 
by chisels. The chisel is made of solid round bar with a 
hard faced edge at the bottom. It shall weigh at least 



======================================================================

182
7.5 kN for 450 mm piles and 12.5 kN for 500 and 
600 mm piles.
Figure 96: Chisel
6.5.3	
After the boring operation is complete, the bore bottom is 
cleaned to remove rock debris, pile bore soil etc. using a special 
cleaning tool (e.g. rope operated grab or kelly mounted hydraulically 
operated grab or other suitable means) and/or washed by bentonite 
flushing. Washing the hole by bentonite flushing shall be done in 
two stages – after completion of boring and prior to concreting after 
placement of reinforcement cage. Flushing of bentonite shall be done 
continuously with fresh bentonite slurry till the consistency of inflowing 
and out flowing slurry is similar.
6.5.4	
Temporary casing has been considered in this Section for 
the purpose of bored pile construction. However, permanent steel 
liner shall be provided for the full depth of the pile in the following 
situations:

6.6	
Prestressing Equipment
6.6.1	
Prestressing Equipment (Figure 99) consists of the following:
Figure 99: Prestressing Equipment
i)	
Tensioning Apparatus – Prestressing steel may be 
tensioned by means of hydraulic or mechanical jacks, 
attached to one or both ends of the tendon. When two 
or more wires/strands constitute a tendon, a single 
multi-pull stressing jack shall be used, which is capable 
of tensioning simultaneously all the wires/strands of the 
tendon.
	
The tensioning apparatus shall be such that it facilitates 
measurement and control of application of force. The 
tensioning apparatus should be independently supported 
so that it does not induce any undesirable secondary 
stresses. The anchorage provided for the temporary 
gripping of tendons on the tensioning apparatus shall 
be secured and such as not to damage the tendon. 
Devices such as dynamometers or pressure gauges 
are attached to the tensioning apparatus for measuring 
the applied force. Suitable safety devices shall be fitted 
to protect pressure gauges against sudden release of 
pressure. Facilities shall also be provided for linear 
measurement of the extension of prestressing steel to 
the nearest mm and of any slip of the gripping devices 
at transfer.
	
The following types of prestressing jacks are usually 
available:



======================================================================
PAGE 205 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
185
a)	
Mono-Strand Jack – Jacks for stressing single 
(mono) strands generally have two cylinders, one 
on each side of the strand, with a wedge device 
for gripping and pulling the strand.
b)	
Multi-Strand Jack (Figure 100) – Jacks for 
stressing multi-strand tendons as an entire 
group are generally of the centre-hole type, i.e., 
tendons pass through a hole in the middle and 
are attached at the rear of the jack. It is important 
that all strands are orientated properly to the 
holes in the jack. A ‘star plate’ or ‘recessed plate’ 
is used to ensure proper alignment.
Figure 100: Multi-Strand, Centre-Hole Stressing Jack
c)	
Bar Jack (Figure 101) – Bar Jacks have a central 
hole through which the bar tendon passes and 
is secured by a nut at the rear of the jack. Most 
jacks have an enlarged nose to accommodate 
a bar-coupler. Many bar jacks have a hand or 
mechanical ratchet to rotate and tighten the 
anchor nut against the anchor plate as the bar 
elongates under load. A chair and open-end 
wrench may be used in lieu of nose and ratchet 
for bar jacks. By carefully tightening the anchor 
nut, anchor set or seating loss can be minimized 
or eliminated.

Figure 101: Prestressing Bar Jack
ii)	
Temporary Gripping Device – Prestressing tendons 
may be gripped by wedges, yokes, double cones or 
any other approved type of gripping devices. The 
prestressing wires may be gripped singularly or in 
groups. Gripping devices shall be such that in a tensile 
test, the wire or wires fixed by them would break before 
failure of the grip itself.
iii)	
Releasing Device – The releasing device shall be 
such that during the period between the tensioning 
and release, the tension in the prestressing elements 
is fully maintained by positive means, such as external 
anchorages. The device shall enable the transfer of 
prestress to be carried out gradually so as to avoid large 
difference of tension between wires in a tendon, severe 
eccentricities of prestress or the sudden application of 
stress to the concrete.
iv)	
Anchorage Device – The anchoring device shall fulfill 
the following requirements:
a)	
It shall be strong enough to resist in all respects 
a force equal to at least the breaking strength of 
the prestressing tendon it anchors. 
b)	
It shall transfer effectively and distribute, as 
evenly as possible, the entire force from the 



======================================================================
PAGE 207 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
187
prestressing tendon to the concrete without 
inducing undesirable secondary or local stresses.
c)	
It shall be safe and secure against both dynamic 
and static loads as well as against impact.
d)	
It shall have provision for the introduction of a 
suitable protective medium, such as cement 
grout, for the protection of the prestressing steel 
unless alternative arrangements are made.
6.6.2	
In case of pre-tensioning of tendons, the stressing bed or 
mould along with abutments shall be rigid enough to sustain the 
reaction of the prestressing force without distortion. In the long line 
method of prestressing, sufficient locator plates should be distributed 
throughout the length of the bed to ensure that the wires are maintained 
in their proper position during concreting. The moulds shall be free to 
slide in the direction of their length and thus permit the transfer of 
the prestressing force to all the concrete elements along the whole 
line. Sufficient space shall be left in between the ends of concrete 
elements to permit access for cutting the strands/wires after transfer. 
Hold-downs or deflectors shall be used for holding or deflecting the 
tendons in required position firmly.
6.6.3	
Cutting and trimming of wires or strands after prestressing 
operation shall be done by suitable mechanical or flame cutters. When 
a flame cutter is used, care shall be taken to ensure that the flame 
does not come in contact with other stressed steel. The flame cutting 
of wire or strand shall be carried out at least 75 mm beyond the point 
where the tendon will be gripped by the anchorage or jacks. In post-
tensioned members, the ends of prestressing steel projecting beyond 
the anchorages shall be cut after the grout has set.
6.7	
Grouting Equipment
6.7.1	
Grouting is required for filling up the voids or cavities in rock 
or soil mass in order to increase its strength and/or impermeability.
Grouting also finds application in filling up the ducts in case of post-
tensioned tendons of prestressed concrete members of bridges. 
Grouting protects the post-tensioned steel against corrosion and 
develops bond between the prestressing steel and the surrounding 
structural concrete.



======================================================================
PAGE 208 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
188
6.7.2	
The following equipment (Figure 102) is required for grouting:
i)	
Grout Mixer and Agitator
	
It is essential that the grout is maintained in a 
homogenous state and of uniform consistency so that 
there is no separation of cement during entire grouting 
process. 
	
Grout should be mixed in a mixer operating at 
1500 rpm or more. The high speed of mixing serves the 
purpose of violently separating each cement grain from 
its neighbour thus permitting thorough wetting of each 
grain. This proves to be advantageous by chemically 
activating each grain to thorough hydration before 
reaching its final resting place. Further, individual grains 
penetrate finer cracks more readily than flocs.
Figure 102: Grouting Equipment
	
Mixers (Figure 103) are usually of two types – paddle 
mixer and colloidal mixer. Paddle mixers are generally 
cylindrical in shape with the axis either horizontal or 
vertical and equipped with a system of power driven 
paddles for mixing by agitation. Vertical barrel type 
mixers have proved satisfactory when small mixers are 



======================================================================
PAGE 209 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
189
required for use in confined or limited working spaces. 
This type of mixer consists of a vertical barrel having a 
shaft with blades for mixing, driven by a motor mounted 
on top of the mixer above the barrel.
Figure 103: Grout Mixer
	
Centrifugal pump mixers, also called colloidal mixers, 
are also available, which consist of a mixing tank and 
a high speed mixing or recirculating pump (centrifugal 
type). The pump circulates water from the bottom to 
the top of the tank while the other mix components are 
added and pre-wetted. The cement particles are then 
individually mixed by the high shearing action of the 
pump, thereby preventing coagulations or lumps and 
ensuring homogeneity of the grout.
	
The mixer, whether paddle or colloidal, is usually a 
batch mixer, which means that a full mixing cycle has 
to be completed before the mix can be used. Therefore, 
a separate storage device is essential for continuous 
grouting operation. The storage device is equipped 
with an agitator to keep the grout moving continuously 
before it is pumped into the hole.
ii)	
Grout Pump
	
The pump should be of positive displacement type and 
capable of injecting the grout in a continuous operation 
and not by way of pulses. The grout pump shall be fitted 
with a pressure gauge to enable pressure of injection to 



======================================================================
PAGE 210 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
190
be controlled. It shall also have a relief arrangement for 
bypass of the grout in case pressure builds up. It should 
be designed to minimize clogging of valves and ports 
and allow a flexible rate of injection.
	
Use of hand pumps for grouting is not recommended. 
Compressed air operated equipment for injection 
should not be used as it is likely that there will be some 
air entrapped in grout.
iii)	
Grout Screen
	
The grouting equipment should contain a screen having 
a suitable mesh size. Prior to introduction into the grout 
pump, the grout should be passed through such screen. 
This screen should be easily accessible for inspection 
and cleaning.	
	
In case the mixer and pump are combined in one unit, 
the dry material should be screened before mixing.
iv)	
Grout Manifold and Grouting System Arrangement
	
A grout manifold or header is a ‘T’ arrangement of pipe 
and various fittings such as couplings, nipples, unions, 
tees, valves and a pressure gauge, all attached to the 
collar of the grout hole.
	
The functions of the manifold are:
a)	
Permit regulation of the flow of grout into the hole 
or duct.
b)	
Maintain the desired allowable grout pressure.
c)	
Allow any excess grout to be drained from 
the system or returned to the agitator tank for 
recirculation.
d)	
Close off the hole when washing the supply lines.
	
Manifold designs vary and depend on the type of 
grouting system.
	
Grouting system arrangement may be either of the 
following two types:
a)	
Single Line System – It consists of one grout 
supply line from the pump to the grouting 
manifold at the hole. The pressure gauge should 
be constantly monitored so that the pressure on 
the grout is regulated as long as grouting is in 



======================================================================
PAGE 211 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
191
progress. Any desired increase or decrease in 
the grouting pressure is obtained by changing 
the speed of the grout pump. When the grout in 
the supply line becomes sluggish, the grout hole 
valve should be closed and the blow-off valve 
opened so that the supply line can be flushed 
or washed. The grout hole valve should also be 
checked to ensure against a false refusal. Joints 
in hoses and pipes should be tight.
b)	
Circulation System – It requires two separate 
pipe lines, one to act as a supply line from the 
grout pump to the grout hole and the other to act 
as a return line from the grout hole to the agitator/
pump. By opening the supply and grout hole 
valves, grout is forced into the hole as required. 
Pressure is maintained by adjusting either the 
supply valve or the return valve, or both, so that 
complete control of pressure is maintained at 
the hole. There should be a pressure gauge at 
the delivery end of the pump. No grout is wasted 
when washing out the grout lines and close 
control of the grouting operation is maintained. 
When direct electric or diesel drive pumps are 
employed, use of a return line is necessary.
v)	
Water Pump
	
Before commencement of grouting, a stand-by direct 
feed high pressure water pump should be available 
at site for an emergency. For example, in case of any 
problem in grouting the ducts (in case of post-tensioned 
tendons of prestressed concrete members of bridges), 
such pump shall immediately be connected to the duct 
and all grout flushed by use of high pressure water 
flushing. It is, therefore, necessary to have adequate 
storage of clean potable water for operation of the water 
pump for such emergencies.
6.8	
Shotcreting Equipment
6.8.1	
Shotcrete is mortar or concrete conveyed through a hose and 
pneumatically projected at high velocity on to a surface. The force 
of the jet impinging on the surface compacts the material. Generally 



======================================================================
PAGE 212 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
192
a relatively dry mixture is used, and so the material is capable of 
supporting itself without sagging or sloughing, even for vertical and 
overhead applications.
Shotcrete may be of two types:
i)	
Dry Mix Shotcrete (or Gunite) – Pneumatically 
conveyed shotcrete in which most of the mixing water 
is added at the nozzle.
ii)	
Wet Mix Shotcrete – Shotcrete wherein all ingredients, 
including mixing water, are mixed in the equipment 
before introduction into the delivery hose. It may be 
pneumatically conveyed or moved by displacement.
	
In general, dry mix shotcrete shall be used. The gunite 
shall comprise 100 parts by weight of cement, 300 
parts by weight of quartz sand, 35-50 parts by weight 
of water and 2 parts by weight approved quick setting 
compound.
6.8.2	
Equipment (Figure 104) for dry mix shotcrete includes:
i)	
Batching and Mixing Equipment
ii)

6.8.3	
Batching and Mixing Equipment – Batching by mass is to 
be preferred and is strongly recommended. Sand may be batched by 
volume if periodic checks are made to ensure that the masses are 
maintained within the required tolerance.
The moisture content of the sand shall be such that the sand-cement 
mixture will flow at a uniform rate, without slugs, through the delivery 
hose. The optimum moisture content will depend upon the delivery 
equipment being used, but it is generally within the range of 3-6%. 
The sand shall be moistened or dried as required to bring the moisture 
content to a satisfactory level. Fluctuations in moisture content shall 
be avoided or appropriately managed.
The mixing equipment shall be capable of thoroughly mixing the sand 
and cement in sufficient quantity to maintain continuity of placing. The 
mixing time shall be not less than one minute in a drum-type mixer; 
where other mixers are proposed, satisfactory evidence shall be 
presented that they are capable of thorough mixing. The mixer shall 
be self-cleaning, capable of discharging all mixed material without 
any carryover from one batch to the next. It shall be inspected and 
thoroughly cleaned at least once a day (and more often if necessary) 
to prevent accumulation of batched material.
6.8.4	
Guniting Equipment – The delivery or guniting equipment 
consists of the following:
i)	
Cement gun
ii)	
Water tank
iii)	
Hose pipes (Material hose, Air hose, Water hose)

used. It consists of two interconnecting circular vessels fixed one 
above the other and having airlock valves operated by hand. The 
whole equipment when assembled shall be airtight and is mounted 
on wheels to make it mobile. The top vessel is suitable for feeding of 
sand-cement mix (via a hopper and lever operated valve) and works 
as tank storage. The bottom vessel has a lever operated valve at the 
top and feeder at the bottom rotated by means of a worm and worm 
wheel drive attached to the lower part of the bottom vessel. The bottom 
vessel is fitted with a material (or delivery) hose of sand blasting quality

6.9	
Drill
6.9.1	
Drilling may be performed to explore the types of materials 
to be encountered in a project (exploratory drilling), or it may involve 
production work such as drilling holes for pile boring, blasting, grouting 
or rock bolt stabilisation work.
Selection of equipment depends upon the following factors:
i)	
Purpose of the hole
ii)	
Nature of terrain
iii)	
Required depth of hole
iv)	
Rock Properties – hardness, texture, tenacity, formation
v)	
Project Size (i.e. Total linear amount of drilling)
vi)	
Availability of water (dry or wet drilling)
vii)	
Core Size, in case of exploration (diamond drill for small 
core and shot drill for large core)
6.9.2	
Drills use three methods to cause fragmentation of rocks:
i)	
Percussion
ii)	
Rotary Grinding
iii)	
Abrasion
Percussion and rotary drills are the primary production tools of 
construction work. Abrasion is used for special drilling applications.
6.9.3	
Percussion Drill – Here rock disintegration is facilitated by 
hammer impacts to the drill bit as well as simultaneous rotary motion 
applied to the bit. This type of drill may vary in size from handheld 
units (e.g. jackhammer) to drifters and crawler-mounted rigs.
Jackhammers (Figure 106) are hand-held, air-operated percussion 
drills used primarily for drilling in a downward direction. It consists of 
a hammer, drill steel and bit. As the compressed air flows through a 
hammer, it causes a piston to reciprocate and produce the hammer 
effect. The energy of this piston is transmitted to the bit through the 
drill steel. Air flows through a hole in the drill steel and the bit to remove 
the cuttings from the hole and to cool the bit.  The drill steel is rotated 
slightly following each blow so that the cutting edges of the bit will not 
strike at the same place each time.



======================================================================
PAGE 217 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment

Figure 106: Jackhammer
A Drifter Drill is similar to jackhammer in operation but it is larger and 
heavier and mounted on a travelling carriage (tractor) or a frame. 
A drifter can drill in downward, horizontal or upward direction and is 
used extensively in rock excavation and tunnelling. Either air or water 
can be used to remove the cuttings. The drifter’s weight is usually 
sufficient to supply the necessary feed pressure for downward drilling. 
But when used for horizontal or upward drilling, a hand-operated 
screw or a pneumatic or hydraulic piston supplies the feed pressure.
Percussion drills may also be mounted on track carriages to provide 
mobility. These are usually hydraulically powered. Hydraulic motors 
tram the machine and power the hammer, the rotation, and the feed 
of the drill. There is also a hydraulic motor driven air compressor 
onboard for blowing the hole. Hydraulic drill can normally achieve 
better penetration rate than an air-driven drill.
6.9.4	
Rotary Drill (Figure 107) – In this type of drilling (pressure 
drilling), the rock is disintegrated by applying a down pressure on the 
drill steel and bit and at the same time continuously rotating the bit in 
the hole. The pull down pressure and drill rotation is facilitated by a 
hydraulic or electric variable speed motor. To remove the rock cuttings 
and cool the bit, compressed air is constantly forced down the drill 
steel and through the bit during this process. The bit pressure and 
quantity of air are controlled as per requirement.
Continuous Mud Circulation (CMC) method (Section 6.5.2) may also 
be used to remove drill cuttings.

Rotary-Percussion Drill (Figure 108) – It combines the 
hard-hitting reciprocal action of the percussion drill with the turning-
under-pressure action of the rotary drill. While the percussion drill only 
has a rotary action to reposition the bit’s cutting edges, the rotation of 
this combination drill, with the bit under constant pressure, can result 
in faster drilling than the regular percussion drill.
Figure 108: Rotary-Percussion Drill
It involves manually hitting 
the end of the drill rod 
with the hammer. As recoil 
makes the rod jump back, 
it is rotated to ensure that 
the hole is round. The 
impact energy of the drill 
piston is transmitted to 
the drill bit in the form of 
shock waves. Drill cuttings 
are removed from the hole 
bottom by air or water 
flushing.
Top Hammer Drill
COPROD Drill
Down-The-Hole (DTH) Drill
Reverse Circulation (RC) Drill
it consists of a threadless 
drill rod stacked inside a 
threaded drill tube. The 
rod transmits impact 
energy and feed force 
to the drill bit while the 
tube transmits rotation. 
COPROD Drill combines 
the high speed and 
penetration rate of top 
Hammer Drill with the 
large hole dimensions and 
hole straightness of DTH 
Hammer Drill
The hammer is situated 
down the hole in direct 
contact with the drill bit. 
The drill piston strikes the 
drill bit resulting in efficient 
transmission of impact 
energy and insignificant 
power losses with the hole 
depth. This drill is suitable 
for drilling long holes.  
The hammer is situated down the 
hole in direct contact with the drill 
bit just like DTH Hammer Drill. 
The difference compared to DTH 
drilling is that drill cuttings are 
removed from the hole bottom 
through an inner centre tube of the 
hammer by flushing with air, water 
or drilling fluid. The drilling fluid is 
continuously circulated out of the 
drilled hole, where the drill cuttings 
are removed or disposed, and then 
recirculated back into the drilled 
hole to repeat the process.

Rotary-percussion drill can be of four types:
i)	
Top Hammer Method
ii)	
Down-The-Hole (DTH) Method
iii)	
COPROD Method
iv)	
Reverse Circulation Method
Rotary-percussion drill by any of the above methods is based upon 
combination of the following four actions:
i)	
Percussion – The piston inside the drill strikes the tail 
end of the rod or bit itself and generates shock waves 
that are transmitted to the bit through the rod (in top 
hammer) or directly upon it (in DTH hammer).
ii)	
Rotation – The rotary mechanism rotates the rod (in 
top hammer) or tube (in COPROD) or DTH hammer. 
With this movement, the bit is turned so that the impacts 
are produced on the rock at different positions.
iii)	
Feed/Thrust Load – Feed force is required to keep the 
shank in contact with the drill and the drill bit in contact 
with the rock. This ensures maximum impact energy is 
transferred from the piston to the rock. 
iv)	
Flushing – It is required to remove rock cuttings from 
the drill hole and to cool the bit. Flushing medium (air, 
water, mist, foam or drilling fluid) is forced to the bottom 
of the drill hole through the rod’s flushing hole and the 
hole in the drill bit.
6.9.6	
Abrasion Drill – Rock can be drilled by the mechanical 
wearing away of its surface by way of frictional contact with a harder 
material. Shot Drill and Diamond Drill are two common types of 
abrasion drills and used primarily for exploration drilling (core drilling).
6.9.6.1	 In a diamond drill (Figure 109), the drilling equipment consists 
of a diamond bit, a core barrel (single tube type or double tube type) 
(Figure 1110), a jointed driving tube and a rotary head to supply the 
driving torque. Water or mud is pumped through the driving tube to 
remove the cuttings. The pressure on the bit is regulated through a 
screw or hydraulic feed swivel head (or drilling head). When the bit 
advances to a depth equal to the length of the core barrel, the core is 
broken off and the drill is removed from the hole.
Two types of diamond core drilling machines are available – 
conventional (with wire line winch) and hydrostatic.

Diamond drills can drill in any direction from vertically downward to upward.
For more information on diamond drill, refer to IS:11710 (Part 1), 
IS:11710 (Part 2), IS:10208, IS:15481 (Part 1) and IS:6926.

Figure 110: Core Barrel for Diamond Drill
6.9.6.2	 Shot (or Calyx Core) Drill (Figure 111) depends on the 
abrasive effect of chilled steel shot to penetrate the rock. It consists of 



======================================================================
PAGE 221 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
201
a shot bit, core barrel, sludge barrel, drill rod, water pump and power-
driven rotation unit. The cutting action is provided by a slotted bit of 
mild steel and by very hard steel shot which is fed into the drill hole with 
the wash water and reaches the bit via the annular space between the 
core and wall of the barrel. To be effective, the shot must be crushed 
during the coring. Pre-crushed shot (under the trade name Calyxite) is 
often used in coring relatively soft rock. Water that is supplied through 
the drill rod forces the rock cuttings up around the outside of the drill, 
where they settle in a sludge barrel, to be removed when the entire unit 
is pulled from the hole. The flow of water must be carefully regulated 
so that it removes the cuttings but not the chilled shot. Periodically, it 
is necessary to break the core off and remove it from the hole so that 
drilling may proceed.
Shot Drill can only be used for downward boring and is a slow process. 
It is suited for large diameter drilling.

7.  MOBILE  ELEVATING  WORK  PLATFORM  (MEWP)
It is mobile equipment that facilitates “hands-on” inspection of bridge 
members as well as light maintenance works.  It is also known as 
Aerial Platform. 
Common types of MEWPs are indicated below:
i)	
Manlift (Figure 112) – It consists of a platform or bucket, 
capable of holding one or more persons, which is 
attached to a telescopic boom mounted on the carriage 
of the vehicle. The boom can be raised, lowered and 
slewed relative to the vertical axis. Manlifts are limited 
to use on fairly level terrain.
Figure 112:Manlift
ii)	
Scissors Lift (Figure 113) – It is equipped with a 
scissors extending structure to lift or lower the platform. 
It is designed for use on relatively level ground. Since 
its maximum vertical reach is relatively low, it is suitable 
for bridge inspections with low clearance between the 
bridge and underpassing roadway.

Truck-Mounted MEWP (Figure 114) – It consists of 
the following:
a)	
A Supporting Frame, to which protractible struts 
(outriggers), a hydraulic feeder and a slewing 
gear are fixed. The supporting frame is secured 
to a truck chassis. Struts help in maintaining 
stability of the vehicle.
b)	
A Slewing Column attached to the supporting 
frame through a crown bearing. The column 
is a slewing welded-construction frame with a 
transmission gear and brake mounted on it. The 
lower boom stage and the cylinder are attached 
to the column by articulated joints.
c)	
A Two-Stage Boom with the two stages connected 
by an articulated joint and responsible for raising 
and lowering of the work platform.
d)	
A Work Platform or Bucket for accommodating 
one or more persons.
e)	
A Straight Line System for keeping the work 
platform in a horizontal position regardless of 
the angles at which the boom’s stages are 
positioned.

The work platform positioning system consists of a 
pump, filters, distributors, valves, steel pipes, hoses 
and hydraulic cylinders. The hydraulic pump is powered 
from the truck’s gearbox via a lay shaft. Oil is supplied 
to the working cylinders through a rotary joint. The 
struts are controlled through distributors mounted on 
the supporting frame. The boom cylinders and slewing 
can be controlled through a distributor mounted near 
the slewing column or on the work platform. The system 
is protected against the eventuality of simultaneous 
steering of the struts and the boom’s cylinders. The 
boom’s cylinders and those of the struts are equipped 
with valves to prevent a pressure failure and the 
resulting uncontrolled shift of the piston rod.
	
Truck-mounted MEWPs have the following safety 
measures:
a)	
Limit switches for preventing the boom’s upper 
section from being excessively raised and the 
boom’s lower stage from being lowered while the 
boom’s upper stage is maximally raised.
b)	
A hydraulic system lock for preventing the working 
circuit and the struts from being simultaneously 
fed.

216
10.1	
Cut and Cover Method
Cut-and-cover tunnel construction typically involves digging a trench, 
constructing the tunnel structure within the trench, and covering it 
up with an engineered backfill material. Since these tunnels are dug 
from the ground surface, they are more economical when located 
at shallow depths. This method is usually not feasible for crossing 
streams, mountains, or major transportation corridors. Digging from 
the surface also presents challenges when buried utilities are present.
Two basic forms of cut-and-cover tunnelling are available:
i)	
Bottom-up Method – A trench is excavated with the 
help of ground support in the form of diaphragm walls, 
sheet piles or intersecting piles etc. and the tunnel is 
constructed within. Once the tunnel is complete, the 
trench is then backfilled with compacted fill material and 
the surface is reinstated.
	
The tunnel may be of in situ concrete, precast concrete, 
precast arches, corrugated steel arches etc.
ii)	
Top-down Method – A trench is excavated with the help 
of ground support in the form of diaphragm walls, sheet 
piles or intersecting piles etc. A shallow excavation is 
made to enable the tunnel roof to be constructed using 
precast beams or in situ concrete. The surface is then 
reinstated except for access openings. This allows 
early reinstatement of roadways, services and other 
service features. Excavation machinery is then lowered 
into the access openings, and the main excavation is 
carried out under the permanent tunnel roof, followed 
by construction of the base slab.
10.2	
Shield Tunnelling Method
The Shield Tunnelling method is used in case of excavation through 
ground that is soft, marshy, or otherwise unstable, and therefore 
needs to be controlled or otherwise supported during the excavation 
process. A tunnelling shield acts as a temporary support structure and 
is in place for the usually short time from when the tunnel section is 
excavated until it can be lined with a permanent support structure. 
The front end of the shield is in the form of a cutting edge and fitted 
with excavation facilities and the rear end has facilities for removal 
of excavation spoils and for installation of supports inside the tail 



======================================================================
PAGE 237 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
217
of the shield. With this method, a shield is advanced one cycle at 
a time typically while removing the muck and placing the ground 
support concurrent to the face. This process is then repeated as often 
as necessary to complete the tunnel. As the excavation at the face 
progresses, the shield is pushed forward with the help of hydraulic 
jacks which takes thrust from the supports at the rear end of the 
shield. During forward movement of the shield, the tail end slides past 
the supports already erected inside the tail transferring the load of the 
excavated periphery from the shield to the supports. Closed shields 
are used when groundwater control is necessary. 
Specialised applications of the shield driven tunnel include use of 
tunnel boring machines and jacked tunnels. 
10.3	
Bored Tunnelling Method
A Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) is a shield with bits mounted on a 
rotating cutter head that excavates a circular opening. Selection of tools 
and configuration of the machine depends mainly on the geotechnical 
characteristics of the ground, level of water table, rock abrasivity and 
maximum settlement allowed at the surface. Since ground conditions 
vary (sometimes dramatically) along the tunnel alignment, the final 
selection of the machine should be an optimal choice taking into 
consideration key performance parameters, particularly the speed of 
excavation.
Some TBMs allow for limited interventions at the cutting face to 
replace the cutting tools. These interventions may involve compressed 
air, termed hyperbaric interventions, to stabilise the ground at the 
excavated face. In general, most interventions are planned to take 
place at geologically favourable locations along the alignment to 
minimize the risks to work personnel and to manage production costs. 
Some of the modern TBMs allow the cutting tools to be replaced from 
within the safety of the machine; however, this has trade-offs because 
the cutting tools are very difficult to handle within these tight spaces. 
TBMs are considered to be more cost effective on longer tunnels where 
economics of scale allows the cost of the machine to be recovered.
TBM can be steered in vertical and horizontal direction along smooth 
curves. TBM has advantage of not disturbing the surrounding strata 
which makes it suitable for use in built up area.
Tunnel Boring Machines are covered in Section 11.

10.4	
Tunnel Jacking Method
Tunnel Jacking or Jacked Box Tunnelling is considered to be a relatively 
non-intrusive method of constructing shallow tunnels, large oversized 
culverts or under-bridges. It involves pushing large concrete box 
sections through the soil typically crossing under existing structures, 
infrastructure or transportation routes where settlement is of primary 
concern using specialised jacking equipment and hydraulic jacks.
Soil around the tunnel opening is stabilised using suitable technique 
(e.g. grouting). Large hydraulic jacks push the precast tunnel 
sections into place from a launching pit while the ground at the face 
is simultaneously excavated. At the end of the cycle, the jacks are 
retracted; a new segment is added at the launching pit; and the string 
of segments is gradually pushed into place to advance another cycle. 
This process is repeated as often as necessary to complete the tunnel 
from the launching pit to the receiving pit.
The main benefit of Tunnel Jacking is that it allows the infrastructure 
above the proposed tunnel structure to remain live and active during 
the construction work.
10.5	
Immersed Tube Method
An immersed/ sunken tube tunnel is a tunnel constructed directly under 
a waterway. Immersed tube tunnels are often used in conjunction with 
other forms of tunnels at their end, such as a cut and cover or bored 
tunnel, which is usually necessary to continue the tunnel from near the 
water’s edge to the entrance (portal) at the land surface.
Construction of an immersed tube tunnel involves three distinct stages:
i)	
Trench Dredging – A trench is dredged at the bottom 
of the waterway by removing underwater material, 
using a dredger, without causing significant damage to 
the marine environment. The dredged material is then 
carried off by a barge for disposal at suitable location.
The bed foundation, readied using a screed barge, 
prepares the tunnel alignment under the water surface 
where the tunnel elements/segments will rest.
ii)	
Tunnel Element Construction – Hollow box sectioned 
elements of steel or concrete used for the actual shell 
of the tunnel are constructed on dry land, usually a dry 
dock, casting basin, fabrication yard or ship-like platform 
or factory. Each segment is individually designed to fit

219
into the tunnel alignment, which usually slopes from 
each end towards the middle where the drainage is 
collected.
iii)	
Tunnel Installation – The prefabricated tunnel 
elements are then floated to the tunnel site by barge. 
With the assistance of a cable and crane/ winch system, 
the tunnel element is towed from the holding area to 
the exact place it needs to be in the tunnel trench. The 
tunnel element is held and guided by two advanced 
immersion pontoons. Their position is controlled by 
mooring cables that are connected to anchors on the 
sea/river bed. The actual immersion begins by filling the 
tunnel element’s ballast tanks with water. This makes 
the element heavy enough to sink to the bottom under 
its own weight. Using cables, winches and ballast tanks, 
the element is guided to the bottom under full control. 
For guiding the tunnel elements down to their exact 
position in the trench, suitable technology (GPS, echo 
sounding) is used. Each element is sunken into place 
and lined up next to the element already placed under 
the water. Water is pumped out of the space between 
the bulkheads. Water pressure on the free end of the 
new element lined to an existing section compresses 
a rubber seal between the two elements engaging the 
sealing membranes to lock together. Use of robust 
rubber seals is highly effective in ensuring a high 
degree of water tightness within the tunnel. Engineered, 
erosion resistant backfill is then placed over the trench 
to permanently bury the tunnel and protect it from ships, 
scour and to resist positive buoyancy.
10.6	
Drill and Blast Method
Controlled Drill and Blast Method is a conventional excavation 
technique and can provide a cost effective solution especially for 
shorter applications in hard rock tunnelling or when the rock mass 
is subject to variable conditions such as faulting and shear zones. 
Drill and blast method may be used in conjunction with sequential 
excavation method when developing large span openings in rock.
A series of holes of requisite diameter, length and direction are 
drilled into the tunnel face. The drills used for tunnelling are either 
pneumatically or hydraulically powered and having either air pusher

legs and/or mounted on drilling jumbos (Figure 119). With air pusher 
legs, it is always advisable to use templates for guiding the direction 
of drilling. Drilling jumbos can have a simple mounting arrangement 
on truck or rail. In advanced machines, the three dimensional drilling 
pattern can be fed into the program of the drilling jumbo and, hence, 
there is no need for profile marking on tunnel face prior to drilling 
unlike the conventional drilling jumbo. The choice of drilling system 
will depend upon the size, shape and length of tunnelling work at 
hand. Water pressure for flushing the drill holes must be controlled so 
as to avoid weakening of surrounding rock mass in case of tunnelling 
in jointed and weak rock mass.
Figure 119: Drilling Jumbo
Under carefully controlled and monitored conditions, the explosives 
are loaded into the drilled holes and detonated sequentially, thereby 
breaking the rock while spreading the release of energy from the 
explosives over several seconds. The blasted rock fragments are 
removed from the tunnel using conveyor belt or tipper trucks (dumpers). 
Initial support consisting of some combination of rock bolts, dowels 
and shotcrete is needed to stabilise the opening in the rock mass. This 
process is repeated in cycles as necessary to complete the length of 
the tunnel. After the tunnel is completed, a cast-in-place final liner is 
placed.
10.7	
Conventional Excavation by Road Header or Hand Tools
Other than controlled drill and blasting, conventional tunnel excavation 
involves use of two types of tools/ equipment:
i)	
Roadheader (Figure 120) – It is electro-hydraulically 
powered excavation equipment consisting of a rotary 



======================================================================
PAGE 241 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
221
cutting head mounted on a hydraulic boom, a loading 
device usually involving a conveyor, and a crawler 
travelling on track to move the entire machine forward 
into the rock face. The boom can be moved up or down 
and right or left to cover the whole face. The boom 
presses the rotating cutting head into the rock face, 
cuts the rock into small fragments which drop down to 
the invert of the tunnel. Collector arms of the machine 
pull the muck onto an apron which transfers the muck 
onto a trailing conveyor for depositing the muck into 
muck disposal vehicles. In case of soft soil tunnels, 
the Roadheaders operate under the protection of and 
inside the shields.
	
Rotary cutting head can be of two types – transverse 
(rotates parallel to cutter boom axis) or longitudinal 
(rotates perpendicular to cutter boom axis). Apart from 
rotating cutter head, various types of special function 
heads are also available.
	
Roadheader can cut variable or odd shapes and is 
suited for short tunnels. For tunnels having height more 
than about 5 m, excavation using Roadheader may 
have to be carried out in multiple stages in view of boom 
limitations, even in competent rocks.

ii)	
Hand Tools – Excavation is done manually by the 
labour using small mechanical tools.
10.8	
Rock Splitting Techniques
Where rock cannot be blasted for various reasons such as avoiding 
noise, vibrations and surface subsidence, the rock can be split 
along planes of weaknesses and fissures. Then the pieces can be 
separately picked up and removed. Various rock splitting techniques 
are described below:
i)	
Conventional Wedging and Splitting – Wedges and 
feathers are inserted into natural fissures or predrilled 
holes and the rock induced to split along the line of 
wedges, for subsequent removal.
ii)	
Hydraulic Splitters – They are inserted into holes 
predrilled in a pattern and the rock induced to split along 
the line of holes quickly and noiselessly, for subsequent 
removal.
iii)	
Chemical Splitters – After they are poured into holes/
fissures, they expand and split the rock in predetermined 
patterns, for subsequent removal.
iv)	
Other Splitting Agents such as Cardox, Nonex and 
Penetrating Cone Fracture (PCF) – The Cardox system 
is based on liquid carbon dioxide being converted to 
high pressure carbon dioxide gas with ignition. The gas 
spreads through fissures and micro-cracks in the rock 
and breaks it in tension rather than compression as with 
explosives.
	
The Nonex system consists of a cartridge containing 
a propellant, which on ignition produces gases. The 
gas pressure increases as the cartridge is sealed in a 
drillhole and, hence, causes the rock to split.
	
The PCF tube is a hollow plastic tube, open at one end 
which can then be filled with the powdered smokeless 
propellant and then closed with a small cap. The other 
end is machined into a wedge to lock into the stemming, 
and to seal the hole when inserted for ignition. In the 
cap, there is an entry port for insertion of an electric 
match, which is the means for detonation. The gases 
produced under pressure break the rock by tension 
effect.



======================================================================
PAGE 243 of 316
======================================================================

Since, the rock requires less energy to break in tension 
than compression, lower energy input is required for 
chemical splitters compared to blasting by explosives.
10.9	
Sequential Excavation Method (SEM)
When the ground lacks the strength for full-face excavation, removal 
can be done in phases. Sequential Excavation Method (SEM), also 
known as New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM) or Norwegian 
Method of Tunnelling (NMT), is a technique in which a tunnel is 
sequentially excavated in stages; the intermediate stages are 
supported, as necessary, in a controlled manner; and the next portion 
is incrementally excavated until the full cross-section is completed. 
Although SEM is commonly used in soft ground and weak rock, it 
can also be combined with drill and blast methods and used in hard 
rock applications. SEM is generally carried out in shorter tunnels and 
allows a tunnel of any shape or size to be excavated.
In SEM, excavation is carried out using common mining methods and 
equipment (like road header, hydraulic excavator, backhoe loader etc.), 
chosen according to the soil conditions. The ground for excavation 
must be fully dry for applying SEM and, hence, ground dewatering 
is essential prior to excavation. Suitable ground improvement 
techniques like grouting, ground freezing etc. may be done to increase 
the soil strength and reduce its permeability and, therefore, stabilise 
the soil for tunnelling. Excavation of ground is followed by provision 
of temporary support through shotcreting in combination with fibre or 
welded-wire fabric reinforcement, steel arches (usually lattice girders), 
and sometimes ground reinforcement (e.g. soil nailing) to line the 
tunnel or support the face and, thus, control settlement. After the 
tunnel is completed, a cast-in-place final liner (concrete) is placed to 
accommodate the permanent loads.
11. TUNNEL  BORING  MACHINE  (TBM)
11.1	
Tunnel Boring Machine (Figure 121) is a complete single 
mobile unit facilitating operation of various tunnelling activities and 
made up of mechanisms for cutting, shoving, steering, gripping, 
shielding, exploratory drilling, ground control and support, lining 
erection, muck removal, ventilation and power supply.
11.2	
TBM  typically  consists  of  one  or  two  shields  (large  metal 
cylinders)  and  trailing  support mechanisms. The main features of a 
TBM are listed below:



======================================================================
PAGE 244 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
224
i)	
At the front end of the shield, a rotating cutter wheel is 
located. 
ii)	
Behind the cutting wheel there is a chamber, where 
depending on the type of the TBM, the excavated soil is 
either mixed with slurry (Slurry-Face TBM) or left as it is. 
The chamber may be under pressure (closed machine) 
or open to external pressure (open machine).
iii)	
Behind  the  chamber  there  is  a  set  of  hydraulic 
jacks  supported  by  the  finished  part  of  the tunnel 
which push the TBM forward. The rear section of the 
TBM is braced against the tunnel walls and used to 
push the TBM head forward. At maximum extension, 
the TBM head is then braced against the tunnel walls 
and the TBM rear is dragged forward. 
iv)	
Behind the shield, inside the finished part of the tunnel, 
several support mechanisms which are part of the TBM 
can be found: muck (soil/rock) removal, slurry pipelines 
if applicable, control rooms, rails for transport of the 
precast segments, etc. 
v)	
The cutting wheel will typically rotate at 1 to 10 rpm 
(depending on size and stratum), cutting the rock face 
into chips or excavating soil (muck). Depending on the 
type of TBM, the muck will fall onto a conveyor belt 
system and be carried out of the tunnel, or be mixed 
with slurry and pumped back to the tunnel entrance. 
vi)	
Depending  on  rock  strata  and  tunnel  requirements, 
the  tunnel  may  be  cased,  lined,  or  left unlined. This 
may be done by bringing in precast concrete sections 
that are jacked into place as  the  TBM  moves  forward, 
by  assembling  concrete  forms,  or  in  some  hard 
rock  strata, leaving the tunnel unlined and relying on 
the surrounding rock to handle and distribute the load.
vii)	
A caisson system is sometimes formed at the cutting 
head (in case the pressure at the tunnel face is greater 
than that behind the chamber), which allows workers to 
go to the front of the TBM for inspection, maintenance 
and repair. If this needs to be done, safety features for 
working under pressure should be ensured and workers 
trained in the operation of the locks. Safety requirements 
for working under compressed air condition should be 
as per IS:4138.

Figure 121: Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM)
11.3	
Two different types of TBMs are used according to the 
expected ground conditions – open shield type and closed shield type.
Open type TBM refers to those providing lateral support only. It can be 
used in conditions where the face of the excavation is self-standing. 
TBMs falling under this category include Gripper or Main Beam TBM, 
Single Shield TBM, Double Shield TBM.
Closed type TBM refers to those providing lateral as well as frontal 
support. It is meant for application under the water table with water 
inflow being prevented by compressed air or by supporting the cutting 
face according to the slurry or EPB principle. TBMs falling under this 
category include Compressed Air TBM, Slurry Shield TBM, Earth 
Pressure Balance (EPB) TBM.
11.4	
Common types of TBM are discussed below:
11.4.1	 Gripper (or Main Beam) TBM
Gripper TBM (Figure 122) is the classic form of tunnel boring machine. 
It is used for boring tunnels in hard rock with medium to high stand-up 
time. To move forward, the machine uses a hydraulic gripper reaction 
system (clamping shoes) that pushes radially against the tunnel walls 
and produces thrust behind the cutter head. This TBM is normally 
used with temporary non-concrete lining, whereas most other types 
of TBMs are used with segmental lining. In Main Beam TBM, the rock 



======================================================================
PAGE 246 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
226
is held up using ground support methods such as steel ribs, rock 
anchors, ring beams meshes and shotcrete.  The advance rate of a 
Gripper TBM depends essentially on the time required to install the 
rock support devices. The Gripper TBM can be most economically 
used if the rock does not need constant support.
Figure 122: Gripper TBM
Gripper TBM may be provided with static protection roof (roof shield), 
installed behind the cutter head, to protect work personnel in case 
of isolated rock falls. Side steering shoes, if provided in addition to 
roof shield, act as a partial shield with protection function as well as 
provide support at the front when moving the machine and steering 
through boring. The side surfaces can be driven radially against the 
tunnel walls. 
In a Gripper TBM with cutter head shield, the cutter head protects the 
work personnel in the area of the cutter head. When moving such a 
machine, the short shield liner forms the forward support.



======================================================================
PAGE 247 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
227
11.4.2	 Single Shield TBM
Single Shield TBM (Figure 123) is primarily meant for application in 
hard rock with short stand-up time, soft rock and brittle or fractured 
rock. The cutter head is not essentially different from that of a Gripper 
TBM in relation to excavation tools and muck transport. This type of 
TBM is equipped with a shield to support the tunnel temporarily as well 
as to protect the machine and work personnel. The shield extends from 
the cutter head over the entire machine. The tunnel lining is installed 
under the protection of the shield tail. Support with reinforced concrete 
segments is the commonly used technique. According to the geology 
and application of the tunnel, the segments are either installed directly 
as final lining (single shell construction) or as temporary lining with 
the later addition of an in situ concrete inner skin (double shell lining). 
In contrast to Gripper TBM, the machine is thrust forward with thrust 
jacks directly against the existing tunnel support.
Figure 123: Single Shield TBM
Since this type of TBM relies solely on thrusting off the segments for 
advance, therefore larger segments are often required. The operation 
is cyclic – while segments are being placed, boring is discontinued. 
Another disadvantage is that there is no reverse force reaction to 
manipulate the shield when it starts to get trapped.



======================================================================

======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
228
11.4.3	 Double Shield TBM
Double Shield (or Telescopic Shield) TBM (Figure 124) is meant for 
application in fractured rock with low stand-up time, unstable rock 
strata (with geological fault zones) or where a high rate of advancement 
is required. It has two main components – the front shield and the 
gripper or main shield. Both shield parts are connected with each 
other with telescopic jacks. The machine can either adequately clamp 
itself radially in the tunnel using the clamping units of the gripper 
shield; or where the geology is bad, can push off the existing lining in 
the direction of the drive. The front shield can thus be thrust forward 
without influencing the gripper shield, so that in general continuous 
operation is possible, nearly independent of the installation of the 
lining.
Figure 124: Double Shield TBM
The apparent advantages of the rapid advance of a Double Shield 
TBM only apply with a single shell segmental lining. The machine 
body is fully shielded to hold rock in place until the lining is set. Boring 
and segment erection happen concurrently.
The Double Shield TBM has, however, essential disadvantages 
compared to the Single Shield TBM. When used in fractured rock with 
high strength, the rear shield can block due to the material getting into 
the telescopic joint. The machine is long and therefore prone to getting 
trapped.



======================================================================

======================================================================

229
11.4.4	 Earth Pressure Balance (EPB) TBM
Earth Pressure Balance (EPB) TBM (Figure 125) is a closed type of 
machine and relies on balancing the thrust pressure of the machine 
against the soil and water pressures from the ground being excavated. 
It is meant for application in unstable, saturated rock, loose rock, soft 
rock or fairly cohesive soils. It is, however, not recommended for very 
abrasive and hard ground.
Figure 125: Earth Pressure Balance (EPB) TBM
In this type of TBM, the soil is loosened at the tunnel face by tools 
mounted on the rotating cutter head. The excavated spoil is pressed 
through openings in the cutter head into the excavation chamber, where 
it mixes into the earth slurry and is pressurised under confinement to 
ensure tunnel face support (positive face pressure). Muck is extracted 
from the excavation chamber either continuously or intermittently by 
a pressure relief discharge system that takes it from the confinement 
pressure to the ambient pressure in the tunnel. Muck removal is 
mechanically controlled and is facilitated through the rotation of the 
screw conveyor and, subsequently, by a conveyor belt and/or skips.
11.4.5	 Slurry-Face TBM
Slurry-Face TBM (Figure 126) is a closed type of machine and is meant 
for application in problematic geological and hydrological conditions 
like faulted rock, soils of varying hardness, soft ground, tunnelling under 
waterways, areas where high water penetration (high permeability) is 



======================================================================
PAGE 250 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
230
expected or gaseous zones, requiring a complete sealing of the cutter 
head area while excavating for protection against gas/water intrusion 
into the tunnel environment. Unlike EPB TBM where the excavated 
soil acts as a supporting medium to provide supporting pressure at the 
tunnel face, in Slurry-Face TBM, a secondary support medium in the 
form of bentonite (clay) slurry ensures tunnel face support.
Figure 126: Slurry-Face TBM
In this type of TBM, the soil is loosened at the tunnel face by tools 
mounted on the rotating cutter head. The excavated spoil is pressed 
into the excavation chamber through openings in the cutter head and 
mixes into the bentonite slurry there. The slurry mix in the excavation 
chamber is pressurised to balance soil and water pressure on working 
face. Depending on the ground characteristics, conditioners may be 
added to the slurry.
Face pressure in Slurry TBM is hydraulically controlled by adopting 
one of the following two methods:
i)	
The first method uses differential pumping – variable 
speed pumps meant for supply and discharge of slurry 
from the machine are precisely controlled to ensure 
that the pressure between them is maintained at the 
face pressure. Variable speed of the discharge pump 
is regulated to control the desired flow while variable 
speed of the supply pump is regulated to determine 
face pressure in the machine. 



======================================================================
PAGE 251 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
231
ii)	
The second method uses a pocket of air trapped in 
a chamber behind the bulkhead to pressurise the 
slurry in the excavation chamber. The second method 
of pressure control is preferred over the first method 
because pressure regulation of gases is easier and 
more accurate (with tighter tolerances) than that of 
liquids. The second method is independent of the slurry 
flow and allows a larger flow around the circuit without 
affecting the accuracy of face pressure control. An 
active face pressure can be maintained, controlled and 
adjusted even when the pumping system is switched 
off.
Slurry mix from the excavation chamber is pumped out of the tunnel to 
an above-ground slurry treatment plant via a hydraulic transport system 
(long pipelines with in-line booster pumps). The excavated material is 
treated and separated from the slurry mix in the slurry treatment plant. 
This also allows safe dispersion of hazardous gaseous components, if 
any, without endangering work personnel in the tunnel.
11.4.6	 Mix Shield TBM
Mix Shield TBM is equipped with a full-face cutter head which has 
combined features for hard rock and soil excavation. It is meant for 
application in areas characterized by mixed geological conditions like 
rock-soil mixed face or unstable tunnel face. The machine can work 
in closed or open mode and with different confinement techniques 
depending on the geological conditions of the ground to be excavated. 
Changeover from one work mode to another requires mechanical 
intervention to change the machine configuration. Different means of 
muck extraction are used for each work mode.
There are three main categories of Mix Shield TBM:
i)	
Machine capable of working in open mode, with a belt 
conveyor extracting the muck, and, after a change in 
configuration, in closed mode, with earth pressure 
balance confinement provided by a screw conveyor
ii)	
Machine capable of working in open mode, with a belt 
conveyor extracting the muck, and, after a change in 
configuration, in closed mode, with slurry confinement 
provided by means of a hydraulic mucking out system 
(after isolation of the belt conveyor)



======================================================================
PAGE 252 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
232
iii)	
Machine capable of providing earth pressure balance 
and slurry confinement. TBM of this type is generally 
restricted to large diameter bores because of the space 
required for the special equipment for each confinement 
method.
Mix Shield TBM provides flexibility in excavation of rock, soil and 
mixed ground. However, cutter wear and damage is generally high 
and muck discharge may be difficult due to mixing of rock and soil. 
12.  TUNNEL  VENTILATION  SYSTEM  (TVS)
Tunnel Ventilation Systems (for vehicular traffic) operate in two modes:
i)	
Normal Mode – to dilute toxic gases and pollutants 
produced by motor vehicles to ensure safe operation.
ii)	
Emergency Mode – to remove smoke and excessive 
heat from the tunnel in case of emergency (e.g. fire).
Quantum of fresh air required to be introduced into a tunnel depends 
upon the following factors:
i)	
Traffic characteristics – traffic volume, traffic density, 
traffic composition, direction of traffic flow (unidirectional 
or bidirectional)
ii)	
Effect of elevation
iii)	
Effect of gradient and vehicle speed
iv)	
Meteorological conditions
Basic types of tunnel ventilation systems as described in Table 33 are 
used separately or in combination to expel stagnant air and introduce 
fresh air into the enclosed tunnel space.

Natural Ventilation
(Figure 127)
i)	
Movement of air is controlled only by 
meteorological 
conditions 
and 
the 
piston effect from vehicular traffic where 
stale air is pushed out of the tunnel by 
vehicles travelling through the tunnel in 
the same direction.
ii)	
Piston effect is reduced in case of 
bi-directional traffic.
iii)	 The meteorological conditions arise 
from elevation and ambient temperature 
differences between the two portals of 
the tunnel and from prevailing winds 
that channel through the tunnel.
iv)	 Normally for tunnels shorter than 500 m, 
natural ventilation is enough. Exception 
would be urban tunnels with heavy traffic 
volume having possibility of congestion 
during peak hours where provision 
of mechanical ventilation becomes 
necessary. Another exception is tunnels 
longer than 500 m, with very low traffic 
volume, where natural ventilation is 
sufficient .
v)	
Where technically feasible, provision of 
a vertical shaft near about the centre 
of the tunnel would effectively improve 
natural ventilation due to additional 
chimney effect (i.e. elevation difference). 
If such a shaft is fitted with an exhaust 
fan, the chimney stack effect will not 
be affected by change in atmospheric 
conditions.
vi)	 Axial fans often installed in naturally 
ventilated tunnels for fire and smoke 
emergencies.

Longitudinal/Linear 
Ventilation
(Figure 128)
i)	
Similar to natural ventilation with the 
addition of mechanical fans to improve 
ventilation characteristics.
ii)	
Fresh air introduced at one end mixes 
with the air inside the tunnel and travels 
through the tunnel bore to the other end 
on account of its own pressure duly 
aided by the piston effect created by 
vehicular traffic. Here, the tunnel bore 
acts as the ductwork for the fans.
iii)	 Fans can be reversible to push air into 
the tunnel or to pull air from the tunnel.
iv)	 Where a central shaft is provided, fresh 
air introduced at both the ends travels 
up to the shaft and is exhausted through 
the shaft.
v)	
This system is most effective for tunnels 
with unidirectional traffic.
vi)	 In case of long tunnels, the linear flow is 
aided by jet (booster) fans at intermittent 
locations located near and hanging from 
the arch of the tunnel.

Semi Transverse 
Ventilation
(Figure 129)
i)	
Use of mechanical fans for movement 
of air.
ii)	
 Ductwork is added with flues that 
allow the air to be uniformly distributed 
throughout the tunnel.
iii)	 This plenum or ductwork is typically 
located above a suspended ceiling or 
below a structural slab within a tunnel.
iv)	 Air either leaves or enters through 
the portals while the tunnel bore acts 
as either the exhaust or intake duct 
respectively.
v)	
Reversing the direction of fans can 
impact the efficiency of the system.
vi)	 This system is suitable for tunnels with 
bidirectional traffic.

Equipment
Features
1.
Fan 
(Figure 131)
i)	
Usually of two types – axial and centrifugal.
ii)	
Axial Fan
a)	
Discharges air parallel to the axis of the 
impeller rotation.
b)	
Common for longitudinal ventilation systems.
c)	
Two types of axial fans – tube type and vane 
type.
d)	
The difference between the two is the 
addition of guide vanes on one or both sides 
of the fan impeller in case of vane axial fan, 
which allows for delivering higher pressure 
than tube axial fan.
e)	
Axial fans commonly mounted horizontally 
on the tunnel ceiling at various intervals.
iii)	 Centrifugal Fan
a)	
Discharges air at 90° to the axis of the 
impeller rotation.
b)	
Common for semi and fully transverse 
ventilation systems as well as Saccardo nozzle 
type systems with longitudinal ventilation.
c)	
Can be either backward-curved or airfoil-
bladed, for tunnel applications.
d)	
Predominantly located within ventilation or 
portal buildings where they are connected to 
supply or exhaust ductwork.

2.
Motor
i)	
Electric motors commonly used to drive the fans.
ii)	
Constant speed or variable speed type motors 
used, depending on the design requirements.
3.
Fan Drive
i)	
Motor to be connected to the fan either directly or 
indirectly.
ii)	
In direct drive, motor is connected to the impeller 
shaft directly.
iii)	 In indirect drive, motor is connected to the impeller 
shaft using belts, chains or gears.
iv)	 Indirect drive allows for more flexibility in the 
location of the motor.
4.
Sound 
Attenuator
i)	
For mitigation of noise level generated by tunnel 
exhaust system near residential location.
ii)	
Noise attenuators mounted either directly to the 
fan or within ductwork along the system.
5.
Damper
i)	
To control air flow within the ductwork.
ii)	
Usually positioned in fully open or fully closed 
mode; however some dampers can be operated 
in an intermediate position.

13.  OTHER  TUNNEL  SYSTEMS
Other common tunnel systems are described in Table 35.
Table 35: Other Tunnel Systems
Sl. 
No.
System
Features
1.
Lighting 
System
i)	
Various lighting systems used in tunnels – 
fluorescent, high pressure sodium, low pressure 
sodium, metal halide, LED lighting.
ii)	
Selection of lighting system is determined by its 
life cycle cost and the amount of light required.
iii)	 Provision of highly reflective surfaces on the walls 
and ceiling, such as tile or metal panels, can 
improve the tunnel luminescence for a given set 
of luminaries.
iv)	 Since requirement of light intensity in different 
zones of the tunnel during day time is different 
from that during night time, required intensity 
can be achieved by putting the luminaries in two 
different circuits. Alternatively, luminaries that can 
give variable output by use of dimmers can also 
be used.
v)	
Gradual increase or decrease in the intensity of 
lighting within different zones of the tunnel can be 
achieved by installing different types of luminaries 
or by using one or two types of luminaries at a 
closer or wider spacing as required. For easier 
adjustment in spacing, the luminaries can 
be mounted on sets of ladders arranged in 
longitudinal direction and hung from the crown of 
the tunnel.
vi)	 Since tunnel lighting is required round the clock, 
it is necessary to install and maintain a 100% 
backup system.
2.
Fire and 
Life Safety 
Systems
i)	
These systems include – control panels, initiating 
devices (e.g. heat and smoke detectors, pull-
stations, 
cameras), 
notification 
appliances 
(e.g. strobes, horns, radios, variable message 
signs), wiring, conduit and cables, emergency 
egress signs, fire hydrants, extinguishers, water 
reservoir, fire-hose coil with supply, sprinklers and 
fire engines.

21.  ESSENTIAL  EQUIPMENT  FOR  RESTORATION  WORKS  
IN  LANDSLIDE  MANAGEMENT
The institutional mechanism for disaster management at the Centre, 
State and District levels is to ensure that the States manage disasters 
in an effective manner. Each State shall work out a time bound 
program with district authorities for updating of equipment inventory 
list as a part of capacity building measures required to be undertaken 
under Section 31(3)(c) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. 
It shall be mandatory for all commercial bulk suppliers (manufacturers, 
dealers, distributors, etc.) of emergency material resources and all 
employers (companies, contractors, societies, etc.) of emergency 
human resources in a district to furnish information on availability of 
such emergency resources to the designated Nodal Resources Officer 
in the District at an interval of not more than three months.

that the inventory of all the above mentioned equipment at the State 
level, including the Bailey bridges, available with the Border Roads 



======================================================================
PAGE 294 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
274
Organisation (BRO) for disaster management and which are capable 
of discharging emergency support functions, should be made available 
to the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways. The inventory should 
include all the equipment, owned both by the Government as well 
as by the private sector, along with their identified location, so that 
these could be kept in readiness for use during the disaster. A list of 
all the suppliers of equipment should also be maintained, so that such 
equipment could be utilised in emergency.  Specialised training needs 
to be imparted to the skilled workers and operators of equipment at 
regular intervals, in order to keep them in readiness for deployment 
during disasters.
22.  BAILEY  BRIDGE
22.1	
The Bailey Bridge is a prefabricated, portable steel bridge of 
the “through” type with the roadway being carried between two main 
steel panels/girders. They are designed on the “Unit Construction” 
principle – the basic unit being a 3.048 m long bay. These bays, when 
assembled together, create bridges of various lengths (in multiples 
of 3.048 m). Foot walks, if required, may be provided on one or both 
sides of the bridge. Ramps may also be provided at both ends of the 
bridge to ensure easy access to the bridge deck from the access road.
The load carrying capacity of the girder can be increased by adding 
extra panels alongside (called “truss” arrangement) and on top of the 
original panels (called “storey” arrangement).
Each of the bridge components can easily be transported in a truck or 
trailer to the site, where they are assembled to form the bridge.
22.2	
Bailey Bridge may be classified on the basis of:
i)	
Number of trusses and storeys which form its main 
girders
ii)	
Type of Deck
iii)	
Width of Roadway
22.3	
Based on the number of trusses and storeys which form its 
main girders, bailey bridge may have five different configurations 
(Figure 132):
i)	
Single Single (SS)
ii)	
Double Single (DS)
iii)	
Triple Single (TS)



======================================================================
PAGE 295 of 316
======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment
275
iv)	
Double Double (DD)
v)	
Triple Double (TD)
Note: The number of trusses is indicated first, followed by the number 
of storeys. For example, TD configuration indicates a bailey bridge 
with three trusses and two storeys on each of the two girders.
SS is the lightest combination possible while TD is the heaviest.
The various configurations stated above can be reinforced by the 
addition of chord reinforcements to the top and bottom of each truss. 
Reinforced construction is annotated by the addition of the letter “R” 
(e.g. Double Single Reinforced bridge is indicated as DSR).
Selection of a suitable configuration (Tables 40 to 47) for a bailey 
bridge depends upon the bridge span as well as its load class as per 
IRC:6.

Erection and Launching – The site preparation has to be 
done in consultation with the user department to remove any obstacles, 
to create facilities for turnaround for vehicle movement, roller layouts, 
unloading arrangements and area for assembly, launching, ramp 
assembly, jacking make and movement in unison, measurement 
of gap, soil conditions, deciding nose tip sag, truss types, grillage, 
counter weights and balancing while launching.
The Bailey Bridge is so designed that it can be completely erected 
on rollers on one side of the gap to be bridged and then launched 
across without the use of any temporary support within the gap. This 
is achieved by building on to the front end of the bridge a temporary 
skeleton cantilever structure, called “Launching Nose”, which is 
constructed from the same standard components as the bridge. To 
raise the skeleton launching nose up for facility of landing on the far 
bank, a special component known as Launching Link is inserted in 
the bottom chord between two panels of the skeleton nose. The nose 
is built up of such a length that when the whole structure is rolled 
forward, the tip of the nose lands on the rollers on the far bank before 
the point of balance is reached.
Once the bridge is in position across the gap, the launching nose is 
dismantled and the bridge jacked up off the rollers and lowered on to 
its permanent bearings on the abutments.
Rocking rollers are required on the home bank and far bank at 
positions 2 and 3 (Figure 136) and these should be set accurately to 
the same plane within ±3 mm. The bearings/ base plates should also 



======================================================================

======================================================================
Pocket Book for Road Construction Equipment

be set so that difference between the upstream side and downstream 
side bearings/ base plates on each abutment does not exceed 
±3 mm.  The thickness of grout under the base plate/ bearing should 
be adjusted to satisfy above requirement.

Panel crib piers (Figure 137) made of trusses with panels set 
horizontally or vertically may be used as intermediate support for 
long bailey bridges. They are fabricated from the same standard 
components as the bridge and can be set on concrete or masonry 
footings, timber grillage etc.

APPENDIX-IV
EQUIPMENT CALIBRATION
Bulk of the equipment used for construction, operation, maintenance 
or inspection/testing (quality control) of roads, bridges and tunnels 
involves use of measuring devices (e.g. load cells, temperature/
pressure gauges, flow meters, proving rings etc.) to monitor various 
performance parameters. The accuracy of these measuring devices is 
critical to the success and longevity/quality of the concerned project. 
It is, therefore, imperative that every equipment equipped with 
measuring devices be calibrated.
Calibration is the process of adjusting the settings for known levels 
of accuracy. Every time a measurement is made, there is an actual 
result/ value and a measured result/ value. Due to randomness and 
variability with a definite pattern, the measured value usually differs 
from the actual value. Calibration is done to identify/ rectify the 
non-random variability or account for it in such a way that the difference 
between the actual and measured results is negligible and within 
acceptable limit. Calibration is done using a reference or standard 
instrument, which is used to determine the actual result against which 
the result measured by the device to be calibrated is compared.
The accuracy of any equipment degrades with time due to various 
factors like normal wear and tear, electrical or mechanical shock, 
hazardous working environment etc. Calibration restores the accuracy 
of such equipment so that reliability in terms of quality and/or quantity 
can be ensured.
To ensure valid results, every equipment should be calibrated or 
verified prior to use and also at regular intervals, as specified by 
the manufacturer or relevant IRC/BIS Code, whichever is earlier. 
Calibration shall always be done against measurement standards 
traceable to national or international measurement standards, 
and where such standards do not exist, the basis for calibration or 
verification needs to be documented.
