1.2.
At its first meeting on 29* April, 2003,
the Committee
felt that in the light of the
massive construction programme that was
under execution in the highway sector, it was
necessary to bring out guidelines on certain
topics which were not adequately covered in
the existing IRC Codes and Standards. The
design and construction of segmental bridges
was one of the topics selected. It was decided
that while highlighting the special design and
detailing requirements in each case, the
guidlines would be generally in line with
IRC: 18 and IRC:21 with additional inputs
from BS:5400, EURO and AASHTO codes,
wherever necessary.
1.3. The initial draft of the guidelines was
prepared by Shri Vinay Gupta. The draft was
discussed by the B-6 Committee at several
meetings and finalized in its meeting held on
3'^^ September, 2004. The draft document was
approved by Bridges Specifications and
Standards Committee in its meeting held on
20'*' December, 2004. The document was
considered by IRC Council in
its
173"^
meeting held on
S^*" January, 2005
in
Bangalore and approved with
certain
modifications. The required modifications
were accordingly carried out by the Convenor,
B-6 Committee before sending the document
for publication.
2.
SCOPE
The guidelines cover the specific design and
construction requirements of precast and cast-in-
situ
prestressed
concrete
segmental
superstructures of bridges. The provisions apply
to the following types of superstructures
:
(i) Epoxy
jointed
precast
segmental
1



======================================================================
PAGE 10 of 32
======================================================================
IRC:SP:65-2005
superstructure with internal bonded tendons
as well as external unbonded tendons,
(ii) Dry jointed precast segmental superstmcture
with external unbonded tendons,
(iii) Precast as well as cast-in-situ cantilever
construction superstmcture, and
(iv) Precast
prestressed
girder
segments
assembled using post tensioning (i.e., spliced
girder system) with cast-in-situ stitch as well
as match cast epoxy jointed girder segments.
2.1. Applicability in High Seismic Areas
Dry jointed precast segmental superstructures
monolithic with piers shall not be permitted in
the seismic Zones IV and V defined in IRC:6-
2000.
3.
CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
Minimum grades of concrete, minimum
cement content, maximum water-cement ratio and
other durability requirements shall be same as
indicated in Table 5 of IRC:2 1 -2000.
There are several specific requirements
relating to construction which need to be adhered
to. These are specified hereinafter.
3.1. Precasting
All sides, bottom inside and header forms
shall be of steel. Forms shall be of sufficient
thickness, with adequate external bracing and
shall be stiffened and adequately anchored to
withstand the forces due to placement and
vibration of concrete. Compaction of concrete
may be achieved through needle vibrators or form
vibrators along with needle vibrators. For casting
of precast segmental superstructure, any of the
two commonly known techniques of precasting,
viz. Long Line method or Short Bench method
may be used. After the first segment of each unit
is cast, succeeding segments shall be match cast
against the previous ones and shall be given a
unique identification mark so as to be placed at
the intended location in the superstructure. A bond
breaking material, such as, flax soap, talc, wax or
any other approved material shall be used between
previously cast segment and newly cast segment,
as well as the end headers when required.
3.1.1. Segments shall not be moved from the
casting yard until stipulated strength requirements
have been attained and shall be supported in a
manner that will minimize warping. Under any
circumstances, the concrete shall have attained a
minimum compressive strength of 20 MPa at the
time of removal of forms. At the time of lifting
and assembly of precast segments into the
structure, the concrete
shall have attained
sufficient strength to withstand the handling
stresses. Curing of segments may be achieved
through water or steam followed by water curing.
Approved curing compound may be used.
3.1.2.
In case of spliced girder system, usually
match casting
is not necessary because the gap
between the girder segments is filled with concrete
or epoxy material at the locations of splices. The
faces, which are required to receive the cast-in-
situ stitch concrete, shall be adequately roughened
and prepared as construction joint before pouring
the
stitch concrete. In case of epoxy jointed
spliced girder system (with no gap between the
girder segments), match casting shall be resorted
to, and all provisions of epoxy jointed segmental
structure as per this document shall apply.
3.1.3. A full scale mock-up of the lifting and
holding equipment (including assembly
truss,
cantilevering formwork, etc.) shall be performed
to demonstrate their adequacy and efficacy prior
to beginning any erection/assembly of the
segments.
3.1.4. Tolerances in Precasting: Finished
segment tolerances should not exceed
the
following:
Length of match-cast segment
± 5mm
(not cumulative)
Overall span length between bearings
± 10mm
Web thickness, depths of top
and bottom flanges width of top
and bottom flanges, overall depth
2



======================================================================
PAGE 11 of 32
======================================================================
IRC:SP:65-2005
of segment, thickness of
diaphagm
Grade of edge and soffit
Tendon hole location
Position of shear keys
± 5mm
± Imm/m
± 3mm
± 5mm
However,
in
case
of
spliced
girder
superstructure, not using match casting, large
amplitude shear keys may be used.
4.
EPOXY JOINTING OF SEGMENTS
3.2. Shear Keys
Precast segments shall be provided with shear
keys at match cast joints. These shear keys shall
cover as much area of the cross-section as
possible. Shear keys in the webs shall be smaller
in size and more in number whereas those in top
flange and bottom flange may have larger sizes
with
lesser number.
Shear keys
shall
be
dimensioned in the form of trapezium. Sheai- keys
shall be avoided at the tendon hole locations. Refer
Fig.
1 for general details of shear keys in precast
box girder segments. An example of shear keys in
a box girder segment is also enumerated in Fig. 2.
In case of epoxy jointed superstructure, mating
surfaces of both adjoining segments
shall be
effectively prepared by wire brushing, water jetting
and /or any other approved means to ensure that
the bond breaking material is completely removed.
Epoxy of about 1mm thickness on each of the
mating surfaces shall be applied (usually by hand
application) within 70 per cent of its pot
life.
Subsequently, the segment shall be brought closer
to hug each other and an
axial temporary
compression of at least 0.3 MPa shall be applied
by approved means for a minimum of 24 hours.
Refer Fig. 3 for a sample arrangement of temporary
prestressing. The Epoxy shall essentially have
properties as indicated in para 4.2.1.

The contractor shall plan his erection system
in such a way that the time elapsed between
mixing of components of epoxy applied to the
mating surfaces of precast concrete segments and
application of temporary axial force does not
exceed 60 minutes. No epoxy from a batch for
which the time since combining the components
has exceeded 20 minutes shall be used.
4.1. Sequence of Operation
The broad sequence of operation
shall
generally comprise placing of all segments of a
portion intended to be assembled and prestressed
in one stage, touching each other and then visually
examining the matching of mating surfaces.
Subsequently, each segment shall be separated
from adjoining segment by
a distance just
sufficient to apply the epoxy. After applying
epoxy, temporary axial compression shall be
imparted and maintained for minimum 24 hours.
Thereafter, intended permanent prestress shall be
imparted prior to demobilizing the temporary
axial prestress.
4.2. Epoxy
Depending upon the ambient temperature
range,
following
types
of
epoxies
are
recommended for use:
5 to 20° Celsius
:
Fast reacting
15 to 30° Celsius
:
Medium fast
reacting
25 to 40° Celsius
:
Slow reacting
Epoxy comprises two components, namely,
resin and hardener. Resin must be stirred by a
mixer in its container for about 10 seconds or until
homogeneity
is reached. Thereafter, hardener
must be added and mixing continued. For a mix
of 5 kg batch, a mixing rotor attached to a 350W,
400rpm
electric hand
drilling machine
is
recommended. The speed of 400rpm should not
be exceeded because higher revolutions will
entrap air in the mix, cause excessive frictional
heat and, therefore, shorten the pot
life. The
mixing time should not exceed 3 minutes and the
temperature not allowed to rise above 40°C for
fast
reacting
and medium
fast
reacting
formulations and 60°C
for slow
reacting
formulations.
It must be ensured that mixing
paddles scrape the bottom and sides of the
container, so as to ensure complete mixing of the
tv/o components. The mixing should be carried
out as close as possible to the place where the
epoxy will be applied, so as to avoid loss of time,
and, therefore, wasting of pot life in transport.
4.2.1. Epoxy shall be tested for its conformance
to the FIP-1978 "Proposal for Standard Tests and
Verification of Epoxy Bonding Agents for
Segmental Construction". Some of the important
properties (minimum values) of epoxy are as
follows:
Pot life
: 20
minutes
(at
upper
temperature limit)
Open time
: 60
minutes
(at
upper
temperature limit)
Compressive
:
60 MPa at 24 hours
strength
and 75 MPa at 168 hours
on 50x50x50mm cube (at
lower temperature limit)
Tensile bonding
:
after
24
hours
at
100
percent strength humidity,
should
have
concrete
failure, no joint failure with
M40 concrete
(at lower
temperature
limit)
Shear strength
:
12
MPa
(at
lower
temperature limit)
Curing rate
:
compressive strength on
50x50x50mm cube shall be
20 MPa
at
12 hours, 40
MPa
at 24 hours and 75
MPa at 168 hours (at lower
temperature limit)
4.3. Cast-in-situ Concrete Pour
In every continuous precast segmental unit
of superstructure, there shall be suitable numbers
(at least one) of cast-in-situ concrete pour/stitch,
which is essential to ensure longitudinal alignment
of the segment.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:65-2005
4.4. Spliced Girder System
A spliced girder system is provided to obtain
large girder spans, given the limitations of weight
and length of individual girder segments, which
could be on account of limitations of handling or
transportation of the same. In this system, smaller
girder segments,
usually
pretensioned
at
precasting yard, are assembled together using
cast-in-situ concrete or epoxy and post tensioning.
For this purpose,
the girder segments are
temporarily supported over centering/steel tower
or assembled
at ground level and then post
tensioned after jointing. In case of superstructures
curved in plan, straight girder segments are placed
along the chord line of the curvature to obtain the
required geometr}'. In such cases,
it is necessary
to provide a cast-in-situ cross diaphragm at each
such kink in plan coinciding with the splice. The
splicing can either be done before casting the deck
or along with the deck. In the former, post-
tensioning is imparted to the girder section alone
whereas
in the
latter, the post-tensioning
is
imparted to the composite section, (refer Fig. 4
for one such arrangement). Other methods of
splicing, such as, structural steel splicing and RCC
splicing are not in the purview of these guidelines.
Similarly, RCC girder segments spliced using
post-tensioning are also not in the purview of
these guidelines.
4.4.1. A preferred location of splice will be the
points of minimum
stress, such
as,
1/3"^ span
points. At each cast-in-situ
splice location,
adequately designed untensioned reinforcement
shall be provided by lapping, welding or with the
use of mechanical reinforcement couplers subject
to the limitations of the relevant codes. However,
in
the case of epoxy jointed
splice, such
reinforcement is not provided.
4.5. Placement of Bearings
Bearings under precast segments shall be
placed by sandwiching shrinkage compensated
high strength prepackaged cement mortar in order
to ensure homogeneous contact between top
surface of the bearing and bottom surface of the
superstructure.
4.6. Prestressing Ducts
In
the
case
of dry jointed
segments,
prestressing duct shall necessarily be of HDPE
material. In the case of epoxy jointed segments,
either metallic or HDPE duct may be used for
internal prestressing and only HDPE duct for
external
prestressing. The ducts
shall be
corrugated for internal prestressing and plain for
external prestressing.
In case of external
prestressing, wall thickness of the HDPE ducts
shall be at least 1/21 of the outside diameter of
the duct and diameter as per the provisions of
IRC: 18-2000. In case of internal prestressing, duct
size and thickness shall be as per the provisions
of IRC: 18-2000. Adequate precaution shall be
taken to ensure that epoxy material does not leak
into joints of the ducts.
4.7. External Prestressing
External prestressing,
if used, shall employ
specialized external anchorages (replaceable
type), suitably protected against corrosion. In the
replaceable system of prestressing, the bearing
plate is outside the concrete, which is provided
with grease filled cap for protection against
corrosion. Usually a sliding layer
is provided
between trumpet and duct in such a way that the
duct along with bearing plate and wedges can be
removed for replacement after detensioning of the
cables. In some systems of prestressing, the
anchorage cone/trumpet remains connected to a
small piece of duct, which
is connected to the
remaining duct, through a duct coupler, which is
decoupled for replacement. For the purpose of
detensioning, the cables remain sufficiently
projected beyond
anchorages,
which
are
encompassed in long grease filled caps. Refer
Figs. 5, 6 and 7 for general system of replaceable
anchorages. The tendons may be protected against
corrosion using grouting with approved grease,
wax, cement or any other approved material. Refer
Fig.
8 for some of the systems of corrosion
protection of external prestressing tendons.
Design of end block for external anchorages shall
be in conformity with Clause 17 (along with Foot
Note (ii) below Table 8) of IRC: 18-2000.

4.7.1. In the case of external prestressing, the
minimum web thickness shall be 200 mm.
4.7.2. The loss of prestress in unbonded tendons
shall be calculated from the average creep

unbonded tendons is not directly proportional to
the local creep strain in the concrete at center of
gravity of tendons.

4.8. Deviator Blocks
In the case of external prestressing, it is a usual
practice to provide concrete protrusions inside the
box girder in order to pass the prestressing ducts
so as to maintain the intended alignment. Refer
Figs. 9 and 10 for some suggested details of
deviator blocks. These deviator blocks also help
control the vibrations of the cables. The deviator
blocks shall be located at a spacing not exceeding
12 m. In case,
it not possible to adhere to this
maximum spacing criteria, check shall be made
to ensure that the
first natural frequency of the
tendons vibrating between the fixing points
(deviator blocks or anchorage points)
is not in
the range 0.8 to
1.2 times that of the bridge.
Deviator blocks shall be so detailed as to avoid
damage to tendon/sheathing/deviator blocks

during stressing operation. In case, a permanently
embedded duct in concrete deviator block
is
provided,
it shall be of galvanized steel (at least
150 micron coating thickness).
4.9. Prestressing Couplers
In case, prestressing couplers are used, not
more than 50 per cent of the prestressing cables
passing through a section shall, in general, be
coupled
at that section. Longitudinally, the
couplers shall be staggered by at least a distance
equal to each segment length or twice the overall
depth of the girder, whichever
is more. Usual
practice is to couple half the cables in one span
and the other half in the next span and so on. Two
immediately adjacent cables shall not be provided
with couplers at one section. Void areas around
the coupler shall be deducted from the gross
concrete section area and other section properties
when computing stresses
at the stages before
grouting.
4.10.
Deck Waterproofing
Bituminous or any other approved flexible
membrane waterproofing shall be provided over
the deck slab.
5. DRY
JOINTED
PRECAST
SEGMENTAL CONSTRUCTION
Dry jointed construction shall not be used
with internal tendons. Dry jointed precast
segmental
externally
prestressed
superstructures have advantage of speed of
construction over the epoxy jointed precast
segmental
externally
prestressed
superstructures. However, adequate caution
needs to be exercised while adopting the
former. Generally, these structures have been
found to exhibit lower ductility level, lower
shear
strength
and
larger
deflections
compared to epoxy jointed superstructures
under the ultimate loading conditions.
It
is
also apprehended that a small order warping
is caused after precasting of segments due to
non-uniform exposure to the sun and other
weather conditions.
Since, dry-jointed
segments do not have
filler material,
like,
epoxy, there could be a likelihood of stress
concentrations. Precautions may be exercised
to avoid such warping. The possibility of
water leakage through the dry joints cannot
be ruled out and hence in climates where
freeze-thaw conditions
exist, dry-jointed
construction shall be avoided.
5.1. Design
Design shall, in principle, be done in the same
way as for cast-in-situ structure as per IRC: 18-
2000 except for the additional provisions and/or
deviations indicated below, which need to be
followed.
5.2. Basis of Design
Permissible
stresses
in
concrete
and
prestressing
steel
shall be applicable as per
Clauses 7 and 8 of IRC: 18-2000 respectively
except as modified below. Similarly, section
properties and modulus of elasticity
shall be
apphcable as per clauses 9 and 10 of IRC: 1 8-2000
respectively. Losses in the prestressing shall be
calculated in the manner given in Clause
1 1 of
IRC: 18-2000. Ultimate flexural strength shall be
calculated as per Clauses 12 and 13 of IRC: 18-
2000 except as modified below. Shear design shall
be done as per Clause 14 of IRC: 18-2000 except
as modified below. Other Clauses
15 to 25 of
IRC: 18-2000 shall be apphcable unaltered.
5.3. Permissible Stresses in Concrete
5.3.1. Permissible temporary stresses in
concrete: Temporary maximum compressive
stresses in concrete shall be as per Clauses 7.1.2
and 7.1.3 of IRC: 18-2000. The stresses on the
tensile face shall be limited to no tension in case
of epoxy jointed precast segments, minimum
residual compression of 0.7 MPa in case of dry
jointed precast segments and as per Clause 7.1.4
of IRC: 18-2000 for cast-in-situ segmental
structure and spliced girder structure with cast-
in-situ stitch.

5.3.2. Permissible Stresses in concrete During
Service: During service condition, after all losses
of prestressing, the maximum compressive
stresses, in normal condition, shall be limited to
0.334
per Clause 7.2.1 of IRC: 18-2000 for all
types of segmental structures. The stresses on the
tensile face shall be limited to minimum residual
compression of five per cent of maximum
permanent compressive
stress that may be
developed in the same section in case of epoxy
jointed precast segments. In case of dry jointed
precast segments, minimum residual compression
of 0.7 MPa or five per cent of maximum
permanent compressive
stress
that may be
developed in the same section, whichever is more,
shall be ensured on the tensile face. For cast-in-
situ segmental
structure and spliced girder
structure with cast-in-situ stitch, no tensile stresses
shall be permitted on the tension face as per
Clause 7.2.2 of IRC: 18-2000.
5.3.2.1. In the load combinations involving
temperature effects (over all temperature variation
as well as differential temperature gradient),
minimum residual compression of upto zero (no
tension) shall be ensured through prestressing in
all types of precast segmental
structures where
untensioned reinforcement can not continue across
the segments. The permissible compressive stresses
in concrete may be enhanced by
15 per cent.
Tension, upto a maximum of two third of the
modulus of rupture may be pennitted in case of
cast-in-situ segmental structures and spliced girder
structures with cast-in-situ stitch where adequately
designed untensioned reinforcement, continuing
across the segments, can be provided as per the
provisions of Clause 5.2(iv) of IRC: 18-2000. In
this case, permissible stresses in concrete and steel
may be increased by
15 per cent. In
all load
combinations involving differential temperature,
gradient maximum 50 per cent live load shall be
considered.
5.3.2.2. The structure shall also be checked for
20 per cent higher time dependant losses, like,
creep, shrinkage, relaxation, etc. for nomial load
combination for the above mentioned limits of
stresses as per Clause 7.2.4 of IRC: 18-2000.
5.4. Design for Ultimate Shear
Provisions of Clause 14 of IRC: 18-2000 shall apply
except as modified by the provisions given below.
5.4.1. Cast-in-Situ segmental super structures
and spliced girder super structures with cast-
in-situ stitch: Provisions of Clause 14 of IRC: 18-
2000 apply.
5.4.2. Epoxy jointed precast segmental
superstructures with internal bonded tendons
or external unbonded tendons: Ultimate load
factors shall be followed as per Clause
12 of
IRC: 18-2000. Any helping effect of bearing
resistance developed through the shear keys shall
be ignored.
5.4.2.1. For structures with internal bonded
tendons, the ultimate shear capacity calculated as
per Clause
1 4 of IRC: 1 8-2000 shall be multiplied
by a factor of 0.90.
5.4.2.2. Structure with external unbonded tendons
shall be considered as reinforced concrete column
subject to externally applied loads for the purpose
of shear design. For this purpose, the limit of
maximum shear stress shall be as per Table 6 of
IRC: 18-2000. For structures with external
unbonded tendons, calculated shear capacity shall
be multiplied by a factor of 0.85.
5.4.3.
Dry
jointed
precast
segmental
superstructures with external unbonded
tendons: Structure with external unbonded
tendons shall be considered as reinforced concrete
column subject to externally applied loads for the
purpose of shear design. For this purpose, limit
of maximum shear stress shall be as per Table 6
of IRC: 18-2000. The ultimate shear capacity so
calculated shall be multiplied by a factor of 0.85.
In the case of dry jointed segmental superstructure
associated with external unbonded tendons, under
any load combination, the design shear resistance
of mating surfaces of precast segments shall be
more than the net applied shear at any dry joint in
order to prevent joint slippage. For calculating
shear capacity of joints of segments, add a
-1- b,
where
'a'
is the capacity of shear key acting as

corbel (designed by shear friction theory) with
frictional coefficient
|Hj =
1.4 and axial force
derived from prestressing after all losses and 'b'
is equal to the capacity of the remaining web area
using friction coefficient
= 0.6 and axial force
derived from prestressing after all losses. In other
terms, a =
ja, x (0.87x prestressing force after all
losses/cross-sectional area of superstructure) x
shear key area. And b =
ja^ x (0.87x prestressing
force after
all losses/cross-sectional area of
superstructure) x (web area - shear key area). The
ultimate shear capacity of the shear keys so
calculated shall be multiplied by a factor of 0.75.
Ultimate load factors
shall be followed as per
Clause 12 of IRC: 18-2000.
5.5. Design for Ultimate Flexure
Design shall, in general, be carried out as per
Clause 13 of IRC: 18-2000 except as modified
below. Ultimate load factors shall be followed as
per Clause 12 of IRC: 18-2000. The untensioned
reinforcement not continuinig between the precast
segments shall not be assumed to contribute to
the flexural strength.
5.5.1. For Cast-in-situ segmental and spliced
girder superstructures with cast-in-situ stitch:
The provisions of Clause 13 of IRC: 18-2000 shall
apply.
5.5.2. For Epoxy jointed precast segmental
superstructure with internal bonded tendons
or external unbonded tendons: The ultimate
flexural capacity calculated as per Clause 13 of
- IRC: 18-2000 shall be multiplied by a factor of
0.95 for internal bonded tendons and 0.90 for
external unbonded tendons.
In the case of
unbonded tendons where the tendons are only
connected to the structure at the anchorages, any
strain will be distributed equally through out the
length
of the
tendon's
length.
Available
prestressing force after
all losses
is used for
working out ultimate moment carrying capacity.
In such cases, failure takes place due to crushing
of concrete. Generally, it is considered adequately
accurate to assume that deflection geometry of
superstructure will not cause any additional strain
in the tendons. It must be specifically noted that
strains in unbonded tendons are not the same as
those in the concrete. In the case of internal
bonded tendons, ultimate flexural capacity of the
structure may be calculated by principles of strain
compatibility or any other appropriate method.
Figs.
1 1 and 12 illustrate sample arrangements of
external and internal prestressing tendons
respectively. Fig
. 13 illustrates analogus model
of externally prestressed superstructure.
5.5.3. For Dry jointed precast segmental
superstructure with external unbonded
tendons:
The
ultimate
flexural
capacity
calculated as per Clause
1 3 of IRC: 1 8-2000 shall
be multiphed by a factor of 0.85. In the case of
unbonded tendons where the tendons are only
connected to the structure at the anchorages, any
strain will be distributed equally through out the
length
of
the
tendon's
length.
Available
prestressing force after
all losses
is used for
working out ultimate moment carrying capacity.
In such cases failure takes place due to crushing
of concrete. Generally,
it considered adequately
accurate to assume that deflection geometry of
superstructure will not cause any additional strain
in the tendons. It must be specifically noted that
strains in unbonded tendons are not the same as
those in the concrete.
5.6. Tension Behind Intermediate Anchorages
At the intermediate anchorage locations,
concentrated tensile stresses develop behind the
anchorages. Adequately designed reinforcement
shall be provided for the same. Appropriate
specialist literature may be followed for design
of this reinforcement. In the case of precast
segmental superstructure,
the design needs
additional precautions because the reinforcement
cannot continue between the adjoining segments.
In such cases, appropriate specialist literature may
be followed for catering to such tensions behind
the intermediate anchorages.
5.7. Correction for Centre of Gravity of
Tendons
Draped tendons shall be assumed to be below
the duct CG in hogging ducts and above the duct

CG in sagging ducts by 6 mm, 12 mm, 18 mm
and 25 mm for duct ID of 50 mm, 5 1 mm to 75
mm, 76 mm to 100 mm and above 101 mm
respectively. For portions of transitions between
hogging and sagging ducts, intermediate values
may be used appropriately.
5.8. Axial Tensions
Design shall adequately take account of the
axial tensions occurring in the superstructure on
account of bearing restraints against creep,
shrinkage, thermal movements, breaking/tractive
forces and longitudinal seismic forces. This effect
is, more importantly, required to be taken care of
in precast segmental structure due to the absence
of continuing reinforcement.
5.9. Local Effects of Blisters
It is a common practice to provide concrete
protrusions called blisters inside the box girder
to accommodate tendon anchorages. These
blisters associated with prestressing force cause
significant local bending moments. Therefore,
every possible attempt shall be made to locate
these blisters at web-bottom slab or web-top slab
junctions so as to minimize additional local
bending moments.
If
it
is inevitable to provide
blisters over the mid width of top/bottom slab or
mid-height of webs, they shall be extended
till
the adjoining top/bottom slabs or the webs, as the
case may be. In any case local bending moments
from such blisters
shall be accounted for
appropriately in the design of the adjoining
structure for which appropriate specialist literature
may be consulted.
