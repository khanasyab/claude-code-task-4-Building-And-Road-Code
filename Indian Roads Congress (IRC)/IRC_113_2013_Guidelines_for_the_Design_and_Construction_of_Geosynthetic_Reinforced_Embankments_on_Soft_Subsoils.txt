GUIDELINES FOR THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF GEOSYNTHETIC
REINFORCED EMBANKMENTS ON SOFT SUBSOILS
1 INTRODUCTION
Construction
of embankments over
soft
subsoil
often causes
difficulties
in
both design
and construction because of the low shear strength and high compressibility of such soils.
Embankments on soft soil may fail due to:
•
Failure of soft subsoil in shear (failure in bearing capacity)
•
Sliding of embankment
fill and underlying soft subsoil
(failure along a
slip
circle)
•
Excessive settlements and also lateral displacements
Various ground improvement techniques are currently being used by the practicing engineers
to safely construct the embankments over soft subsoils, such as;
•
Part
or
full
replacement
of
soft
subsoil
with
soil
of
better
load
bearing
characteristics
•
Construction of the embankment in stages
•
Deep stabilization of subsoil using admixtures, such as use of lime columns
•
Use of Prefabricated Vertical Drains with preloading
•
Use of stone columns to improve the bearing capacity of soft subsoil
•
Use
of reinforcing elements,
Metallic
or Polymer,
at the base
level and
above
•
Combination of the above
The
use
of Geosynthetic
reinforcements
in
the
construction
of embankments on
soft
subsoils has been adopted by engineers from as far back as 1980's.The behaviour of such
embankments over soft soils has been presented in various publications (Humphrey and Holtz
(1987), Jewell (1988), Rowe (1997), Leroueil and Rowe (2001), Silvestri (1983), Bonaparte
and Christopher (1987).
The
present
document
provides
Guidelines
for
the
Design
of
Embankments
Using
Geosynthetic Reinforcement at the base.
In situations where the use of basal reinforcement
has to be combined with other ground improvement methods, reference has to be made to
the following publications. In general, these publications also provide guidance for the design
and constructions guidelines of embankments.

Geosynthetic reinforcement at the base of the embankment
is often referred
to as basal
mattress and can be considered as comprising of a reinforcing element such as a geogrid
or high strength geotextile or similar reinforcing element placed
in a frictional layer which
is
generally a gravel layer.
It is also a necessary and common practice to provide a geotextile
separation layer at the interface of soft subsoil and the gravel layer.
The use of reinforcing layer serves the following functions:
•
Construction
is facilitated as machinery can move easily above the basal
mattress for placing the
fill
•
Basal mattress as above provides good drainage
•
The tensile reinforcement provides improvement in the rotational stability of
the embankment
•
General experience shows a partial control of differential settlement
•
Geosynthetic
elements
are
chemically
inactive,
non-biodegradable
and
hence durable

2 LOCATION OF SOFT SUBSOILS IN INDIA
India has about 6000 kms long coast line. All along the coast line and
in the nearby delta
areas, deposits of soft clayey soils are present. These subsoils are generally soft,
silt clays
which vary from 10 to 30 m in thickness near the coast line. Soft clays cover vast areas of the
Gulf of Kutch, river delta areas, shores of the Gulf of Cambay etc. and
in general the entire
coastal belt.
Typical geotechnical properties of these soft clays, reproduced from HRB SR No. 13 (1994)
"State of the Art: High Embankments on Soft Ground,
Part A - Stage Construction" are
summarized in Table 1. The data reveals that these deposits are soft, saturated, plastic and
highly compressible
in nature. The natural moisture content of these soft soils varies from
60 to 100 per cent. These clayey soils are highly plastic with liquid
limit ranging from 50 to
1 50 per cent. Most of these clayey soils are normally consolidated. The in-situ shear strength
generally varies from 7-20 kPa. Other geotechnical properties of relevance
in soft ground
construction are also included in Table 1.
Increased construction
activities
in the coastal
cities and harbours
in the soft soil deposit
areas pose a challenging task to engineers to meet the needs of rapid development. The

problems relate to the construction and maintenance as well as stability of embankments,
in the short term, and to the settlement of the ground,
in the long term.The stability of an
embankment on soft clay depends on interaction of the following parameters (a) Height of
embankment (b) Base width of embankment (c) Depth of soft clay (d) Shear strength of soft
clay. Depending on the values of the above parameters, failures have occurred where the
height of embankment is as low as
1 .5 m.

3 DESIGN OF GEOSYNTHETIC REINFORCED EMBANKMENT
OVER SOFT SUBSOIL
The design of embankment on soft ground
is generally governed by the shear resistance
of the
foundation. The
inclusion
of Geosynthetic
reinforcement
at
the foundation
level
(Fig. 1) could enhance the performance of embankment as
it resists the shear failure in the
embankment as well as in the soft soil. Basal reinforcement stabilizes an embankment over
soft ground by preventing lateral spreading of the fill, extrusion of the foundation and rotational
failure. This stabilizing force is generated in the reinforcement by shear stresses transmitted
from the foundation soil and
fill, which place the reinforcement
in tension.
It has also been
experienced that the reinforcement can also partially reduce the differential settlement due
to better distribution of stress over the soft soil (Rowe and Li (2005)).
The required tensile strength of reinforcement varies with time because of improvement of
soft soil shear strength during consolidation. Usually the maximum design working load
is
experienced during construction. The design
life of the reinforcement may be considered
in
general as equal to the time required to achieve 90 percent consolidation (Fig. 2),
in most
cases.

Reference can also be made to IRC:75 and HRB SR: 14 for general design procedure of
embankments. The design of Geosynthetic reinforced embankment should consider following
stability checks:
•
Rotational stability of embankment
•
Bearing Capacity failure
•
Lateral sliding stability

Rotational Stability
Rotational
stability of embanknnent
is evaluated most connmonly using method of slices.
Bishop's modified method gives the factors of safety that are sufficiently accurate for practical
purposes. The factor of safety of the embankment without reinforcement is evaluated first.
If
the factor of safety is not adequate, then rotational stability check with reinforcement is carried
out. The design tensile force required from the reinforcement
is thus obtained. From the
design tensile force, the ultimate tensile strength requirement of the geosynthetic reinforcing
material can be worked out taking into consideration the various reduction factors applicable
(Section 3.7). The factor of safety of a reinforced embankment may be expressed as:
(1)
Where
H
=
summation of resisting moment of all slices in kN-m/m
I A//^
=
summation of driving moment of all slices in kN-m/m
T
=
tensile force needed in the reinforcement kN/m
9
R
=
distance from the center of slip circle to the reinforcement layer in m
Factor of safety for various failure surfaces has to be analyzed and minimum factor of safety
should be considered as
critical. A validated computer programme or suitable software
is
generally used to analyze the circular failure surface. A minimum factor of safety of 1 .4 may
be adopted for rotational stability analysis.

3.2
Bearing Capacity Failure
Reinforced embankment over weak foundations is to be analyzed for safety in bearing capacity.
The basal reinforcement acts as a rigid layer and helps to distribute the embankment load
on to the subsoil evenly. Also the soft soil strength increases through consolidation which
is
a time dependent phenomenon.
The following expression can be used
to calculate the
ultimate bearing capacity of the
foundation:

Where
B = Width of the bottom of the embankment in meter
D = Depth of the soft soil in meter
The equations 3 and 4 take into account the influence of the B/D ratio on the bearing capacity
of the soil.
It may be seen as the B/D ratio is higher; the
value is more than the Terzaghi's
bearing capacity equation. This increase is given as the function of B/D ratio only. The above
formula for the calculation of bearing capacity
is also been referred
in FHWA NHI-95-038
(1998) "Geosynthetic Design and Construction Guidelines"
Participant Notebook for NHI
Course No. 13213.
It is advisable to have a minimum value of factor of safety as
1 .5 for bearing capacity at the
end of construction where no other ground improvement is used.
It should be noted
that
if the bearing capacity of soft
soil
is
not
sufficient then ground
improvement techniques like stage construction, vertical drains can also be used along with
basal reinforcement to increase the bearing capacity of the soft soil.
In these methods of
ground improvement, increase in strength of subsoil can be achieved within a specified time
frame. Hence the factor of safety of 1 .25 for bearing capacity at the end of construction may
be considered satisfactory.
It should be checked that the same increases to
1 .5 at the end of
consolidation period adopted for the ground improvement technique. This requirement has
to be checked for each of the stages adopted for construction. Where stone columns are

adopted for ground improvement purpose, the factor of safety in bearing capacity has to be
2.0 at the end of construction to meet the requirements of IS: 1 5284, "Design and Construction
for Ground improvement Guidelines - Part
1 - Stone Columns".
Case studies for the combined use of basal reinforcement with stone columns or vertical
drains are also included in the Section 12.
3.3
Lateral Sliding
The
lateral
sliding
stability of the embankment may be checked by considering
that the
embankment fill should not slide over the reinforcement. The basal reinforcement must resist
the outward horizontal thrust of the embankment
fill (Fig. 3 and
4). The minimum tensile
strength required to resist lateral sliding
is given below.

It is advisable to have a minimum value of critical factor of safety as

Considerations of Seismic Conditions
The stability of the embankment for its full height shall be checked under seismic conditions
as per IRC:75 guidelines. The relevant seismic zone and ground acceleration shall be worked
out as per IS: 1 893(Part
1 )-2002.
3.5
Allowable Strains in the Reinforcement
In general BS: 8006 Clause 8.3.2.11 suggests that maximum
strain
in the reinforcement
should not exceed 5% for short term applications and 5% to 10% for long term applications.
When choosing the maximum allowable strain of reinforcement, strain compatibility of the
reinforcement with the soft soil must be ensured.
3.6
Settlement Analysis
The inclusion of reinforcement alone does not reduce the total settlement of the foundation.
Hence conventional settlement analysis needs to be done to calculate the final settlement
and should be checked that
it
is within permissible limits. The tolerable settlements for the
9



======================================================================
PAGE 18 of 60
======================================================================
IRC:113-2013
embankments may also be referred from IRC:75, Section 4.6. There is a partial improvement
in the differential settlement because of the relatively uniform distribution of the stress on the
foundation layer due to the inclusion of the reinforcement.
If settlement is not within the limits,
other ground improvement techniques like stage construction, prefabricated vertical drains or
stone columns may need to be adopted.
The settlement of foundation increases the tensile strain
in the reinforcement and hence
increases the load
in reinforcement. The allowable strains
in the reinforcement should be
checked according to the values given in previous section.
The acceptable settlement value
is a serviceability function
in the case of pavements on
embankments. In this context, due to the settlement of the subsoil, pavement layers including
surface experience the stress and surfacing may be repaired
at frequent
intervals.
It
is
advisable that the high quality bituminous layers for pavement surfacing are not laid in these
cases,
till the rate of settlement stabilizes.

Design Tensile Strength of Reinforcement
The design tensile strength shall be calculated by applying the specified reduction factors to
the ultimate tensile strength of the reinforcement. Thus the long term tensile strength of the

A 3 m high embankment with 10 m crest width
is to be constructed on a 5 m thick deposit of
clay, for a road with a traffic load 20 kN/m^. The soft clay layer is underlain by medium dense
sand. The clay deposit (C^ = 0.3, e^ = 0.8) has an undrained shear strength of 10.9 kPa
and bulk density 18 kN/m^. The embankment

Without any Reinforcement
Check for Rotational Stability
By conducting analysis of rotational failure along the circular slip surface analysis by Bishop's
method, using a validated computer program^me, the embankment without any reinforcement
shows a factor of safety of 1.21, which
is less than 1.3. Since there
is a necessity to curtail
rotational failure, geogrid basal reinforcement can be adopted.
Check for Bearing Capacity
Bearing capacity of the soft foundation soil = B.C = C^N^ = 10.9 * 6.94 = 75.65 kPa
(N =4.14 + 0.5* - =6.94)
Without any reinforcement, maximum stress below the embankment
F= 18*3 + 20 = 74/cM/T?2

is just within limits as specified by IRC-75. However,
if the settlement continues
to be
in the same level, that may cause detrimental performance of the bituminous paved
surface. In this case lower quality of the surface may be adopted, but frequent resurfacing will
be needed. Alternate methods to accelerate consolidation may also be adopted. The use of
basal mattress ensures the stability of the embankment but does not control the settlement.

Need for Ground Improvement Techniques
In many
instances,
in
construction
of embankments on
soft
subsoils,
it
is
a common
experience that the settlement and their time rate of progress are critical factors and hence
other ground improvement techniques may be required along with basal reinforcement.
The geosynthetic, used for basal reinforcement has the main function of reinforcing the soil.
The different modes of failure for the geosynthetics used as basal reinforcement are - failure
by rupture, failure in bond and failure by excessive strain in the reinforcement. Consequently
the requirements to be satisfied by the reinforcement are as follows:
•
The reinforcement should have adequate long-term design strength.
•
The reinforcement should develop sufficient bond with the soil so as to prevent
the sliding of the embankment along the surface of tne reinforcement.
•
The strains developed
in the reinforcement should not exceed the values
given in Section 3.5.
To meet the above requirement, a product with high tensile strength, low elongation and
low creep
is required. Suitable products are polyester geogrids of different types or high
density
i:, ^lyethylene
(HDPE)
geogrids
or
high
strength woven
polyester
geotextiles.
Geocomposite,
in which the reinforcing as well as separating and draining materials are
bonded together, can be used for basal reinforcement where drainage function
is required.
A nonwoven geotextile bonded to a geogrid provides in-plane drainage while the geogrid
provides
tensile
reinforcement. Such
geotextile-geogrid composites are used
for
better
drainage of low-permeable soils. Since for embankments, length is much greater than width,
reinforcement
is normally required only
in the direction perpendicular to the
longitudinal

axis of embankment. Hence, reinforcement needs to have high strengths
in the transverse
(width of embankment) direction, with minimum possible strength
in the longitudinal (length
of embankment) direction for holding the longitudinal elements and easy handling. Currently
products with tensile strength as high as 1300 kN/m are available in the market. Single layer
of high strength reinforcement has proven to be more efficient than multiple layers having the
same combined total strength (Rowe and
Li (2003)). Fig. 5 to 10 presents different types of
geosynthetic basal reinforcements. For information regarding geosynthetics which may be
used as reinforcing material, reference may be taken from MORTH Clauses 700 and 3100.
Another form of basal mattress that may be used
in embankments
is a geocell mattress
which
is a three dimensional honeycomb structure formed from a series of interlocking cells
and
it should have adequate tensile strength. However, benefits and design for using geocell
mattress basal reinforcement need to be critically evaluated. Biodegradable materials cannot
be adopted as basal reinforcement.

5.2
Strength Requirements
The major properties and
its requirement for different types of geosynthetics are discussed
in Section 11.
5.3
Drainage Requirements
The geosynthetic should allow free drainage of the soft soils to reduce pore pressure build-
up below the embankment.
If geotextiles are used for reinforcement, hydraulic properties
to be checked are opening size and permeability. The opening size should be such that
there is enough resistance against piping at the same time reduces the risk of clogging and
should have enough
interaction with the embankment
fill as well as underlying
soft
soil.
It
is recommended that the permeability of the geotextile be at least 10 times that of the
underlying soil. The minimum requirement for hydraulic parameters should be according to
the specification given in Section 11 for different materials. The regular practice is to give a
drainage gravel or sand layer above the soft soil and above which reinforcement is laid.
5.4
Environmental Considerations
The resistance to chemical and biological attacks will mainly depends upon the material with
which, geosynthetics are made and the environmental conditions prevailing. Geosynthetics
have a very high resistance to chemical and biological attacks. However, in unusual situations
such as very low (< 3) or very high (> 9) pH soils, or other unusual chemical environments,
such as in industrial areas or near mine or other waste dumps, the chemical compatibility of
the polymer(s) in the geosynthetic should be checked to assure that
it will retain the design
strength at least until the underlying subsoil is strong enough to support the structure without
reinforcement.
5.5
Survivability Requirements
The geosynthetics used
for reinforcing embankments should have
sufficient strength,
in
addition to the design strength, to withstand the damages occurring during installation. The
degree to which
this occurs depends on handling of reinforcements
prior to
installation,
the structure of the reinforcements, the nature of the soil
in which the reinforcements are
installed (mainly the particle size) and the compaction forces applied. This will depend upon
the type
of
installation method adopting
for reinforcement, embankment
fill
construction
as
well. The
survivability requirement for geotextiles
is higher compared
to geogrids.
If
the geosynthetic
is ripped, punctured, or torn during construction, support strength for the
embankment structure
will be reduced and failure could
result.
If the
installation damage
factor for a particular reinforcement
is less,
naturally, the short term strength requirement
will also be
less. Reinforcement manufacturers publish the
certified reduction factors for
specified ranges of
fill types and methods of compaction. When the nature or grading of
the
fill, or the compaction method
fall outside these ranges, these factors should be found
out according to ISO/TR - 20432 or from accredited testing laboratories. Minimum strength

IRC:113-2013
requirements for puncture, grab, tear and burst, which are very much critical for geotextile,
are given in Section 11.
5.6
Fill Requirements
Fill
material should conform
to the requirement IRC:36 "Recommended
Practice for the
Construction of Earth Embankments for Road Works" and the relevant Specification of the
Ministry of Road Transport and Highways Section 305.
6 SUBSOIL INVESTIGATION AND TESTING
High
quality subsoil
investigation and testing
shall form an essential
part of any project
involving design and construction of embankments on soft ground.
It
is recommended that
one borehole shall be taken for every 100 m length of embankment. The borehole shall
extend to the
full depth of the soft soil
layer. Shear strength variation with depth shall be
established
in each borehole. This may be done by in-situ vane shear tests or by collecting
undisturbed samples and testing for unconfined compressive strength in the laboratory. These
test methods provide shear strength values having high
reliability. Static cone penetration
test (SCPT) may also be used, however,
it is desirable that a correlation
is first established
at the particular site between SCPT and vane shear values. The use of Standard Penetration
Test (SPT) in soft cohesive soils may only be used sparingly, as they do not reflect sufficiently
accurately the narrow range of strength increase
in soft clayey soils which
is the case
in
the current document. Compressibility characteristics (coefficient of consolidation (C^) and
compression index (C^)) as well as the liquid limit, plastic limit, natural moisture content, void
ratio etc. of the soft subsoil shall also be determined.
Where stage construction
is adopted, the increase
in shear strength
specified
for each
stage has to be checked
in the field, by vane shear tests or laboratory tests on undisturbed
samples. Work on next stage
filling can be permitted only after
it
is ascertained that the
strength gain needed for building the next stage has been reached. Formulae for determining
the increase in shear strength may be referred from HRB SR No. 13 "State of the Art: High
Embankments on Soft Ground, Part A - Stage Construction". However, the actual values
have to be checked
in field.
It would be desirable that laboratory tests on increase in shear
strength due to consolidation under different stage loads (preloads) are carried out and these
values may be used for design calculations.
7 INSTRUMENTATION AND MONITORING
As may be noted from the Section 3, the embankments on soft ground are designed with low
initial factor of safety, since the soft subsoil shear strength is expected to increase with time.
Because of the low initial factor of safety, monitoring of the behaviour of the embankment is
essential. The parameters to be monitored are:
1)
Increase in shear strength (Section 6)

9 CONSTRUCTiOiSt ASPECTS
The construction procedures for reinforced embankments on soft foundations require special
attention to the difficulties that can arise from site access, site clearance and
fill placement.
Improper
fill placement can
lead
to geosynthetic damage,
non-uniform settlements and
embankment failure. Construction rate should be preferably slow enough to ensure that there

IRC:113-2013
the ground. The wooden planks or pipes shall also ensure that the stacks
remain stable.
•
Fire can
inflict huge loss and damages to the materials stored
in the yard.
Therefore, adequate numbers of fire extinguishers shall be available inside
the warehouse. The entire storage yard shall be considered a 'No Smoking'
zone.
•
Ensure physical verification of the whole consignment as per packing details
& check for any visual damage. The damaged or defective materials shall be
immediately segregated and shifted to a separate area dedicated for such
storage.
•
Storing
of
material
should
be done
by
item
category,
size and
grade.
Adequate space (1 m) shall be made available between the stacks; sufficient
enough to allow movement of store/project staff for routine inspection.
•
Routine activities such as sweeping, cleaning, dusting shall be undertaken
and daily check list to be filled shall be kept at each covered area.
•
Water and moisture acts as catalyst for deterioration of material. Storage
place shall be free from any water leakages. Security arrangements with a
gate for restriction of unauthorized entry are also recommended.
•
Entrances, exits, pathways shall be kept clean and free from material. Height
and weight restrictions should be considered while stacking material and
damage due to tear and shear.
•
Provide proper drainage system and the yard shall be cleared of debris.
•
The storage yard shall be provided with a permanent constructed or fabricated
mobile ramp.
9.3
Placing of Reinforcement
•
The reinforcement shall be
laid at the proper elevation and alignment as
shown on the construction drawings.
It shall be placed with main strength
direction oriented perpendicular to centerline of the embankment.
•
The reinforcement
shall be
installed
in accordance
with
the
installation
guidelines provided by the manufacturer or as directed by the Engineer.
It
may be temporarily secured
in place with ties, staples, pins, sand bags as
required by
fill properties,
fill placement procedures or weather conditions or
as directed by the Engineer.
•
If geotextiles or low strength geogrids are used, a cushion layer of sand must
be given for minimizing installation damages. Sand layer shall be compacted
to specified design modified proctor density. Above this layer as per design
at a specified distance a layer of reinforcement shall be placed.
20



======================================================================
PAGE 29 of 60
======================================================================
IRC:113-2013
•
Care should be taken in the handling, lifting and positioning of reinforcement
rolls.
If, the weight of the rolls
is such that mechanical
lifting arrangements
are necessary, the use of a lifting beam is recommended.
•
Slack/wrinkles in the reinforcement layer shall be removed manually. Direct
movement of vehicles on the reinforcement shall be prevented.
•
The
reinforcement
should
not
be
exposed
to
sunlight
for more
than
the
maximum
duration
permitted
in
the
approved
drawing/installation
methodology.
In
the absence
of any
specific
provision
in
the drawings/
installation methodology, the reinforcement should be covered within a day
of installation.
Reinforcement Jointing
•
Required
overlapping
length
must
be
detailed
in
the
drawing
by
the
designer.
•
An overlap of 300 mm or as indicated by Engineer shall be provided between
the adjacent
rolls. There should be no joints or seams along the principal
strength direction of the basal reinforcement. However,
if unavoidable, the
overlap should have sufficient anchorage length so that overlaps are strong
enough to carry design loads.
End Anchorages
•
The roll should be unwound a small amount by pushing the roll in the direction
of the reinforcement run. The base end of the reinforcement now exposed
should be secured by weighting or pinning
it to the formation. When the
roll
is completely unwound, the free end of the reinforcement should be hand
tightened and secured by weighting or pinning.
•
Where reinforcement
is to be anchored by passing
it round an anchorage
block (thrust block), such as a gabion basket, and back on
itself, then the
reinforcement should
be
pulled
tight around
the
block and secured
by
pinning or weighting
until
fill around the block has been placed.
Fill should
not be placed on the return length of reinforcement until the length around
the anchorage block has been secured by pulling
it tight.
Fill Considerations
•
Reinforcement layer should be covered with well graded sand having angle
of internal friction as per approved drawings.
•
All filling shall be done in layers of 200 mm thickness.
If ground water table
is encountered proper dewatering arrangement shall be arranged.
•
Fill in immediate contact with the reinforcement should be placed and spread
in the longitudinal direction of the reinforcement only.

•
Under no circumstances should tracked vehicles be allowed to traffic over
the laid, unprotected reinforcement.
•
The sequence of
fill placement should be considered with care, particularly
over very poor soft soil where bearing capacity can be exceeded with small
loadings.
•
Two
placement techniques
have been
used
successfully
(Holtz
1990)-
For
less severe foundation
conditions
the technique
is
to
place
the
fill
symmetrically from the center outward
in an inverted U type construction
(Fig. 12).
•
The second technique involves the
initial construction end dump
fill along
edges
of geosynthetic
to form access roads. After access roads, the
fill
should be spread between each toe and placement should be parallel to the
alignment and symmetrical from the toe inward toward the center to maintain
a U shape (Fig. 13).
•
Use lightweight dozers and/or graders to spread the
fill.

10 EMBANKHHENT WIDENIMG
Where embankment widening is to be carried out using geosynthetic reinforcement, relative
settlement of the existing and new
fill plays a major role. The reinforcing element has to be
anchored
into the existing embankment. For this purpose,
part of the embankment may
need to be excavated, reinforcing elements are then placed and backfilled. The traffic flow
should also be considered during widening. The traffic flow through the existing
fill must be

PAGE 31 of 60
======================================================================

completely avoided or only through single lane, can be adopted, depending upon the design.
There will be a substantial difference
in the settlement of existing and new embankment,
the existing
fill also settles because of the influence of the new, adjacent
fill loads on their
foundation soils. Usually for soft soils with high compressibility, sufficient consideration during
design and construction shall be made for reducing the settlement of new
fill. Curtailment
of the settlement using
piles along with reinforcement may be preferred
in case of highly
compressible
soft subsoils.
In
moderately compressible
soft
soils,
effective methods
to
accelerate the settlement, like prefabricated vertical drains may be adopted.

Industrial
Park,
Avissawella, Srilanka
Southern Transport Development Project (STDP) was
Sri Lanka's
first major expressway
project with a length of 126 km stretching from Colombo to Matara. Part of the project at
section JBIG from Dodangoda to Kurundugahahetekma (Fig. 15) required construction of
embankment over soft foundation
soil
in a construction period of 130 days. The height of
the embankment varies from 4.0 m to 10.5 m. Soil investigation had further shown that the
environment in which the embankment is to be constructed
is acidic.
Preliminary design
analysis showed
that the
soft foundation
soil
could
not support the
embankment without treatment at the base of the embankment.
High strength geogrids
(Fig. 16 and 17) with ultimate tensile strengths of 150 kN/m^ and 200 kN/m^ were used
for basal reinforcement. The geogrid was made from high molecular weight, high tenacity
polyester multifilament yarns. The yarns were protected with a polymeric coating making
it
suitable for acidic soil.

Road Project: S.Marco-Argentano Road Italy
During the construction of the 3'"^ part of the National Highway No. 533, in junction with national
motorway A3 at the location S. Marco Argentano
in
Italy, a marshy land consisting of soft
clay was encountered near a bridge abutment. This zone had an approximate thickness of
2.50 m which extends for an area of 8,000 sqm. Anticipating the instability problems associated
with the construction of the 7 m (maximum) high embankment, high strength uni-directional
geogrid of high tenacity polyester having a tensile strength 400 kN/m^ was used as a basal
reinforcement
in between the embankment
fill and the soft soil strata as shown
in Fig. 18.
The geogrid (Fig. 19) used was having a Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) coating
to
resist chemical attacks. A non-woven geotextile used as a separator between geogrid
and the drainage blanket made of sand was also provided. Anchoring blocks were given at
higher heights to reduce the base width required for stability. Complete structure is shown in
Fig. 20.

c)
Expressway: Bangkok, Thailand
The new Bangkok Expressway was crossing a marshy area with a very soft soil consisting of
normal consolidated Bangkok clays, 20 m deep. The soft soil had a bulk density of 16 kN/m^
and undrained shear strength of 15 kN/m^. The site investigations showed that the bearing
capacity of the foundation soil was too low to support a "traditional" highway embankment.
In addition to the above considerations, high stiffness was required for the initial construction
phase to allow the heavy plant to operate on site without sinking into the extremely soft soil
that was often waterlogged. The design required four horizontal layers of biaxial geogrids
for stabilizing this embankment. The geogrid used was of tensile strengths of 32 kN/m in the
machine direction and 18 kN/m
in the cross machine direction. The geogrids were installed

Four Laning of NH-5 between Rajahmundry and Eluru, Andhra Pradesh
The four lane NH-5 project between Rajahmundry and Eluru in the Godavari delta of Andhra
Pradesh included five reinforced soil retaining walls. The maximum height of reinforced soil wall
was 15 m (Fig. 21). This made them among the highest reinforced soil retaining walls built in
India atthe time when the project was taken up (in 2001 ). The reinforced soil walls were provided
with high strength geogrid reinforcement. The subsoil formation in these stretches consisted
soft deltaic clays of varying depth. To meet the bearing capacity and settlement problems
arising from soft clay foundation layers a stepped wall configuration with wraparound geogrid
reinforcement (Fig. 22) and basal mattress at base of the reinforced soil wall were adapted. The
provided basal mattress was
1 m thick. The scheme contained a separation geotextile and
three layers of geogrids. The lower layer of geogrid was having strength 200 kN/m and two

layers of 40 kN/m geogrids were placed at 50 cm each. The space between the geogrid
layers was filled with compacted stone metal. Basal reinforcement (Fig. 23) provided a
stiff
platform on the soft clay which ensured more uniform
distribution of load on foundation.
Table 12 shows gradation of fill material used in Basal Mattress. The reinforcement absorbed
the outward shear stresses near the edge and hence prevented them from being transferred
to the soft soil. Hence, basal reinforcement enabled the soft soil to carry higher embankment
loads. Constant monitoring of settlement was done by installing settlement gauges at intervals
along the embankment length. The comparison of predicted and observed settlements was
found to be satisfactory. View of the Finished Road (NH-5) Section between Rajahmundry
and Eluru is shown in Fig. 24.

Road
Project:
Visakhapatnam
Port
Connectivity Road
Project, Andhra
Pradesh
To provide fast and easy access to Visakhapatnam port from NH-5, NHAI
in association
with Visakhapatnam Port Trust constructed a new port connectivity road. The length of this
project road was about 12.3 km out of which 4.567 km length was provided with ground
improvement using prefabricated vertical drains and high strength geotextile (Fig. 25) basal
reinforcement layer. The thickness of soft marine clay was 10 to 18 m which had undrained
shear strength of 5 to 8 kPa. Cc was varying from 0.8 -
1 .2. As per IS classification system
the soil was classified as CH type. The height of the embankment was 2.5 to 3.2 m.
The embankment construction comprised of laying working platform of 0.7 m thickness over
original ground. Prefabricated Vertical Drains were installed at 1.15 m center-to-center in a
triangular pattern after laying the initial embankment. Sand drainage layer of 0.6 m thickness
was then
laid over the
initial embankment. High strength polymeric woven geotextile was
then spread over the sand drainage layer. The design tensile strength of geotextile used was
230 kN/m. The geotextile was anchored at the ends by using sand filled bags. The embankment
construction was then taken up in two stages -
1 .75 m (first stage) and then 2.0 m (second
stage). Waiting period for each stage was 175 days. A total quantity of about 124,000 sq.m
of geotextile was used in this project as reinforcement layer. The project has been completed
and opened to traffic in 2007.

a reinforced soi! wall. (Granular
fill soil --unit weight 20 kN/m^,
(|) = 32°). Maximum height of
reinforced soi! wall was 9 m. The soil up to 3.0 m depth was clayey silt and followed by sand
with silt up to 4.5 m depth. This is underlain by sandy silt with traces of clay
till 9.0 m depth.
Ground water table was at 1.5 m depth. High strength geogrids having mono-axial array of
geosynthetic strips, which has a planar structure were used as basal reinforcement (Fig. 26)
to improve the strength of the underlying soil with a drainage layer (Fig. 27) and geotextile
in between.
The uni-directional ultimate strength of the mono-axial geogrid was 200 kN/m. Stone columns
were also used to reduce the settlement of the approach road at higher heights. The high
strength geogrids (Fig. 28) placed were effectively able to distribute the stress uniformly to
the foundation soil, thereby decreasing the differential settlement. Maximum tensile load was
calculated as the sum of the loads needed to transfer the vertical embankment loading on the
stone columns and the load needed to resist lateral sliding. Since the load was transmitted
to the stone columns, the settlement of the soil
in between the columns was also reduced
considerably. Fig. 26 shows the typical cross section of the reinforced approach road.

Four lane highway from Vallarpadam to NH-47
The 17 m highway provided four lane links for ICTT Vallarpadam to NH 47. Of this 17 km
link nearly 10 km were in backwaters and the highway was built on reclaimed bed placed by
hydraulic dredging. The embankment height was varying from 3.00 m to 7.20 m. Up to 3 m, the
subsoil was very loose clayey silt sand followed by a very soft to soft highly compressible silty
clay layer (Cu=12.5-14 kPa, Cc=1.2) of thickness 15-22 m. The layer is followed by medium
dense to stiff silty sand. Due to low shear strength and high compressibility of the clayey sub
soil the embankments were found to be unsafe
in bearing capacity, rotational stability and
could experience large settlements. The side slopes adopted for the embankments were IV:
2H. Locally available moorum was used as embankment
fill material (c=30 kPa and =27°).
Prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs were adopted as the ground improvement for stretch
in
the reclaimed area. The spacing of PVDs was kept at 1.150 m
in a triangular pattern
in
all
the locations. A layer of non-woven geotextile was laid above drainage granular blanket as
a separator between embankment
fill and drainage material. Three stage constructions for
maximum height 7.20 m was designed for a cumulative waiting period of one year, so that
the embankment construction was carried with minimum delay. Bearing capacity and stability
analysis were conducted for each stage of loading. Based on the gain in shear strength after
completion of waiting period of each stage, the height of next stage of fill placing was decided
taking into account stability and bearing capacity aspects.
In order to open one carriageway
early stone columns were adopted for ground improvement at bridge approaches where the
height of embankment was maximum. This enabled the full height to be built in a short time,
avoiding the multiple stages
if PVDs were adopted for ground improvement. Two lanes of

highway were thereby opened early for traffic. To achieve the required bearing capacity of
subsoil treated with stone columns, a waiting period of 30 days was recommended. At the
16 locations where embankment was built on 1.0 m diameter stone column the spacing of
stone column was ranged from
1 .65 m-1 .75 m in triangular pattern in all the locations. Biaxial
geogrids were used to transfer the stress uniformly to the stone columns and PVDs and thus
reducing the
differential settlement. Geogrids also helped
in preventing the embankment
from rotational failure as well. The condition of completed carriageway and traffic movement
along the corridor is shown in Fig. 29.

Road Over Bridge: Thane Bliiwandi Vadapa Road over South Kasheli Creek
For a major bridge across Thane Bhiwandi Vadapa Road, the solid approaches were required
to be retained using reinforced soil walls. There was an embankment existing for many years.
The road had to be widened to the increased width of the bridge. The subsurface comprised
of top 4 to 6 m of very soft to soft dark grey clay. From 7.5 m to 10.0 m soil constituted silty
clay. This layer was followed by medium dense dark grey medium sand. As the structures
were near a creek ground water table was at top.
Fill soil properties were considered as:
Cohesion - 0 kN/m^, Angle of friction
- 32°, Unit weight of soil - 20 kN/m^ The maximum
height of the embankment was 9.6 m.
In order to achieve the required global and bearing
stability, basal reinforcement over piles (Fig. 30) was proposed for the new embankment. The
piled embankment technique allows embankments to be constructed to the required heights

without any restraint on construction rate with control on post construction settlements. Basal
reinforcement was used to form a geosynthetic raft over piles and transfer the load to the piles,
and thus enabling to maximize the economic benefits of the piles installed in soft foundations.
The reinforcement also helped
in counteracting the horizontal thrust of the embankment
fill
and the need for raking piles along the extremities of the foundation could be eliminated.
In
the direction along the length of the embankment the maximum tensile load should be the
load needed to transfer the vertical embankment loading onto the pile caps.
In the direction
across the width of the embankment the maximum tensile load should be the sum of the load
needed to transfer the vertical embankment loading onto the pile caps and the load needed
to resist lateral sliding. Basal reinforcement proposed here was geogrid which has planar
structure consisting of a monoaxial array of composite geosynthetics strips.
Each single longitudinal strip had a core of high tenacity polyester yarns tendons encased in
a polyethylene sheath; the single strip was connected by cross laid polyethylene strip which
gave a grid
like shape to the composite. Two geogrids layers having uniaxial strength of
400 kN/m
each,
along and
across
the
road were
given. The
design was
carried
out
according to BS:8006 (1995). The design of piled embankments was not included
in the
scope of the present document.

in two layers up to a height of 0.5 m. Each layer was compacted to 95 percent of proctor
density. Bi-orientated geogrid was spread (Fig. 32) over the compacted
fill. 10 mm diameter
rods were pegged down to ensure that geogrid stayed
in

Restoration of Wharf Road (NH-9) at Vijayawada by Geocell Basal Mattress
& Reinforced Soil Wall
During September 1999, the Wharf Road
in Vijayawada Municipal limits of NH-9 collapsed
due to the failure of the retaining wall on the canal side Fig. 33. The restoration work of
this road involved using stone
filled basal mattress of geocells as foundation over which,
geosynthetic reinforced soil wall in two tiers was built. The geotechnical investigations at site
revealed that the soil profile
is varying, but in general the subsoil
in the top 2 m was clayey
(CH or CI) and
it was very soft. Below this the soil was generally CI and sometimes CH,

but in between there were few layers of sand (SM). With a wall height of 8.5 m above the
canal bed level, and a 2 m thick soft soil near the canal bed, a gravity retaining wall was not
feasible. Pile foundations needed to be at least 15 m to 20 m long and hence
it would have
been prohibitively expensive. As the road
is located
in a busy commercial area, there was
little space available for conventional construction. Also major work of foundation as well as
reinforced soil embankment for road restoration, were to be constructed during the 30-day

closure of the canal. Keeping
in view, soft nature of the soil, time constraints and inefficacy
of the vertical drains
in black soils, additional costs involved
in case of piles, the restriction
due
to the land
acquisition,
etc., the best solution was thought to be a
'basal mattress
reinforcement'.
It has thus been designed to provide a foundation from stability view point
only and not from the settlement point of view. Basal mattress used in this project,
is a three-
dimensional honeycombed structure (geocell), formed from a series of interlocking
cells.
These cells can be easily assembled at the site by using high strength geogrids, resting on
the soft foundation soil and then filled up with granular material. A basal mattress thus formed
provides a very stiff foundation platform designed to support the loads. The detailed design
has been carried out using BS:8006 (1995) and AASHTO (1998) and the overall principles
of geotechnical engineering. For the basal mattress 1.0 m high vertical geocell was formed
using uniaxial geogrids laid on biaxial geogrid base. The geocell mattress extended 2.3 m
beyond the facia. Provision of this mattress increased bearing capacity at the required level.
Fig. 34 shows sectional view of geosynthetics reinforced soil wall with stone filled geocell
basal mattress. The construction of this 200 m stretch was successfully completed during the
year 2002, despite difficulties experienced
in making a deep cut next to the busy road, and
the water level in the canal remaining at least 1 m above the bed level. Fig. 35 shows the road
section after completion of restoration works.
