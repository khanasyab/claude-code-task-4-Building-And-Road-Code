MANUAL FOR QUALITY CONTROL IN ROAD & BRIDGE WORKS
SECTION 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1	
Three special publications were published by IRC in different years regarding 
quality control on road and bridge works as mentioned below:
IRC:SP:11-1984
Handbook for Quality Control for Construction of Roads 
and Runways;
IRC:SP:57-2000
Guidelines for Quality Systems for Road Construction;
IRC:SP:47-1998
Guidelines for Quality Systems for Road & Bridges.
The above publications were formulated in pre NHDP environment when bridges were mostly 
constructed on stand-alone basis. Need was felt to merge the three publications to suit the 
manner of implementation of highway projects post NHDP and also upgrade the content to 
capture all aspects of quality assurance and control in line with best international practices.
1.2	
Accordingly, it was decided in the 1st meeting of Project Preparation, Contract 
Management, Quality Assurance and Public Private Partnership Committee (G-1) held 
on 06.06.2015 to merge the 3 special publications as above and upgrade the same. 
A sub-group was formed under the chairmanship of Co-Convenor with other members 
to prepare the draft of the “Manual for Quality Control in Road & Bridge Works”. 
The sub-group prepared different sections of the special publication, which was discussed 
in different meetings of G-1 Committee between 25.07.2015 and 19.11.2016 and lastly on 
29.04.2017 under the chairmanship of Convenor Shri B.N. Singh where Shri D. Sarangi; Shri 
Kishore Kumar; Shri A.V. Sinha; Shri Ashok Kumar; Shri Ashok Bhasin and Shri S.K. Nirmal 
attended. The sub-group gratefully acknowledges peer review of the draft by Shri D P Gupta. 
Finally the draft of the entire publication was considered and approved by G-1 Committee 
(personnel given below) in its 9th meeting held on 19.11.2016.

SECTION 2
GENERAL APPROACH
2.1	
Concept
2.1.1	
Beginning in the year 1998, when implementation of 4-laning of Golden 
Quadrilateral was announced, there have been huge strides in development of roads in India. 
The road development programme is also very wide and vast starting from expressways to 
rural roads. Road infrastructure has seen a quantum jump in investments during the past two 
decades. The agencies involved in road construction are quite disparate. The contracting 
modes are also different. But what is demanding from and common to all road projects is 
total quality starting from Project Planning to Construction to Operation and Maintenance. 
Quality of the projects/works should be such that the road performs according to the specified 
standards during the design life. Quality is essential so that i) users enjoy safe and comfortable 
riding quality throughout the design life and ii) vehicle operating costs are minimised and 
iii) resources of the nation are otherwise efficiently utilised. It also simultaneously ensures 
enrichment of knowledge in the industry, lower bid prices and faster completion of projects. 
This Manual endeavours to describe different components and aspects of Total Quality 
Management in Road Projects. It covers various steps/procedures required to be followed to 
ensure quality matching with international standards. This Manual does not embody extracts 
from other IRC Codes, Manuals and MORT&H Specifications for Road & Bridge Works. 
Therefore, this Manual needs to be used in conjunction with MORT&H Specifications for 
Road & Bridge Works and other applicable codes, manuals and guidelines.
2.1.2	
The role of Quality Manual in overall procurement of works is best described by 
the following pictorial chart:

2.1.3	
At the outset, it is necessary to recall the definition of Total Quality Management as 
stipulated in various international codes of practice along with other terminology associated 
with it for proper appreciation of quality requirements.

(i)	
Quality assurance: A planned system of activities whose purpose is to provide 
assurance that the overall quality control program (see quality control) is 
in fact being effectively implemented. This system involves a continuing 
evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the overall quality control 
program with a view to having corrective action initiated where necessary. 
For a specific material, product, service, etc., this involves verification, audits, 
and evaluations of the quality factors that affect the specification, production, 
inspection, and use of the material product, service, system, or environment.
	
(ii)	
Quality control: A planned system of activities whose purpose is to provide a 
level of quality that meets the needs of users: also, the use of such a system. 
The objective of quality control is to provide an overall system integrating 
the quality factors of several related steps including: the proper specification 
for what is wanted: production to meet the full intent of the specification: 
inspection to determine whether the resulting material, product, service, 
etc., is in accord with the specification: and  review of usage to determine 
necessary revisions of the specification.
BS 4778-Quality Vocabulary
	
(i)	
Quality: The totality of features and characteristics of a product or service 
that bear upon its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs.

The above definitions are universal in nature and apply to all fields. In the context of road 
projects, the definitions are used with suitable interpretation as considered applicable to road 
projects.
2.1.4	
There are three focal points of Total Quality Management. These are Quality 
Assurance, Quality Control and Acceptance. All the activities related to Quality spin around 
these focal points. Notwithstanding the contracting format used for a particular project, 
quality control vests with the Contractor/Concessionaire, whereas acceptance vests with the 
Employer/Authority, who is normally assisted by Consultants in medium and large size projects. 
Quality Assurance applies to all the entities involved in the project. Quality Assurance Plan 
of all the entities involved in the project must be compatible following the broad parameters 
specified in this Manual. Acceptance criteria should be built into the contract in clear and 
unambiguous terms, which makes it obligatory on the part of the Contractor/Concessionaire 
to plan, build and follow its Quality Assurance and Quality Control programme so as to fulfill 
the acceptance criteria. Whereas the Contractor/ Concessionaire and Engineer/Consultant 
are required to have a project specific Quality Assurance Plan, the Employer/Authority may 
have a generic Quality Assurance Plan/Quality Policy. This Manual attempts to specify 
various aspects of the focal points mentioned above for road projects in general, without 
any reference to particular contracting format. The contract should take care to adapt to the 
provisions of this Manual with modifications, if any, as applicable to a particular contracting 
format. The approach to quality requirements as applicable to four broad stages of a road 
project i.e. (i) project preparation, (ii) procurement, (iii) construction and (iv) operation and 
maintenance are discussed below.
2.2	
Step wise procedure in Total Quality Management
The following paragraphs of this section give an overview of different steps to be followed 
in Total Quality Management of a road project in a sequential order, whereas details are 
brought out in the succeeding sections.
2.2.1	
Selection of the class of Quality Assurance
Depending upon the rigors of control and cross verification, four classes of Quality Assurance 
(QA) are prescribed:



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 220
======================================================================

IRC:SP:112-2017
7
Classes of Quality Assurance
Class Nomenclature
Nominal QA
Q-1
Normal QA
Q-2
High QA
Q-3
Extra high QA
Q-4
Quality Assurance class needs to be decided prior to start of the Project Preparation. However, 
during the course of project implementation, Quality Assurance class of some of the items/
attributes may be upgraded to next class based on specific requirements. Provision for such 
up-gradation needs to be built into a Contract. This Manual is basically meant for Q-3 class 
of quality assurance which is applicable to projects in following situations:
	
i)	
National Highways and State Highways
	
ii)	
Coastal roads
	
iii)	
Roads in high altitudes
	
iv)	
Roads in high rainfall areas (average over 2000 mm)
	
v)	
Large size projects on Major District Roads
Q-2 class QA is recommended for rural roads and average size projects/works on Major 
District Roads. Q-1 class QA may be restricted to rural roads in remote areas subject to 
specific approval of the concerned road agency. Q-4 class QA is applicable to expressways. 
Q-4 class QA is also applicable to following specialised components of projects following 
lower class of QA.:
	
i)	
Tunnels
	
ii)	
Elevated highways
For quality management in rural roads, reference may be made to Quality Assurance 
Handbook for Rural Roads of the National Rural Roads Development Agency of the Ministry 
of Rural Development.
2.2.2	
Personnel
Both the Contractor/Concessionaire and Engineer/Consultant are required to engage 
adequate number of personnel with required knowledge, experience and expertise to control 
quality. The knowledge and experience of lab technicians who actually carry out the tests is 
also very critical. The size and complexity of a project determines the range of personnel, 
their knowledge, experience and expertise. The quality personnel of the Contractor may be 
independent of production and laying unit or part of it. This Manual suggests the list of quality 
personnel required with Contractor / Concessionaire and Engineer / Consultant for projects 
of different size and complexity in Section 3. The organizational structure of the quality 
control personnel along with qualification and experience requirements of the said personnel 
are also specified so that each of the personnel is capable of meeting the requirements 
of the chosen field and the team has the right mix of personnel to attend to all the quality 
requirements of a project.

2.2.3	
Quality Assurance Plan
Quality Assurance has already been defined as “All the planned and systematic activities 
implemented within the quality system, and demonstrated as needed, to provide adequate 
confidence that an entity will fulfill requirements for Quality.” In a way Quality Assurance 
is sum of Quality Control and Acceptance. Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) is, therefore, a 
document chronicling the actions to be taken and steps to be followed by each party to the 
project for successful implementation of the project duly fulfilling the Quality Requirements.
The project cycle involves three broad stages i.e. Project Preparation, Project Development 
and Construction. Therefore, for a single project, different quality assurance plan needs to 
be prepared by different parties in different stages. The requirement of QAP during different 
stages of a project is summarized below: 
Project stage
Requirements of QAP by different parties to project
Project Preparation
DPR consultant will prepare QAP for Project Preparation.
Client will have a general protocol for association with DPR 
consultant and scrutiny/verification of data, design and drawings.
Independent Engineer/Authority’s Engineer will have a protocol 
to review drawings in BOT/EPC Contract.
Development
Employer/Authority will have a general protocol for bid document 
preparation, bid evaluation and award.
Construction
Contractor/Concessionaire will prepare QAP.
Supervision manual prepared by Engineer/ Consultant will 
contain Quality Assurance mechanism to be followed by the 
Engineer/Consultant.
Employer/Authority will have a general protocol for Quality 
Control.
Model structure of QAPs as above and protocol for Employer/Authority/Engineer are given 
in Section 4.
2.2.4	
Quality Requirements for Factory Manufactured Materials, Products and 
Specialized Items
Supplier’s quality policy indicates commitment of the management of the supplier to achieve 
and sustain quality of the product to meet purchaser’s stated or implied needs, whether 
contractually required or not. In case of road projects, supplier’s Quality Policy in respect 
of factory manufactured materials, products and specialized items such as steel, bitumen, 
bearings, expansion joints, road signages, crash barriers etc. is very important. Section 5 
gives a broad contour of the minimum elements of quality policy of suppliers of such products. 
Notwithstanding whether a supplier is empanelled or not, the Quality Policy of the supplier 
shall be furnished by the Contractor/Concessionaire to the Engineer / Consultant, who will 
ascertain that the Quality Policy of such supplier shall be commensurate with the details 
given in Section 5. In large and complex projects, the Engineer / Consultant may further

exercise independent check as to whether the Quality Policy of the supplier is being duly 
complied with.
Section 5 stipulates testing requirements of most of the factory manufactured materials, 
products and specialised items and whether site testing facility available for them. For 
all such materials and products, the supplier/manufacturer is required to submit detailed 
documents as specified in Section 5. Section 5 also delineates responsibilities of Supplier / 
Manufacturer / Concessionaire / Contractor / Engineer / Consultant / Employer/Authority 
in further confirming quality of such materials either by witnessing tests in manufacturer’s 
laboratory or conducting third party testing.
2.2.5	
Laboratory set up
Section 6 gives a broad outline of the Contractor’s site laboratory. General infrastructure 
requirement of the laboratory, layout and suggestive list of equipments and consumables for 
main/plant laboratory, routine and special upkeep of equipments are covered in Section 6. 
Suggested codes of practice for various tests to be conducted on naturally occurring materials 
in original/crushed form and various types of mixes is also given in Section 6. Any third party 
laboratory, where testing of materials is proposed to be carried out by any entity involved with 
road project, must satisfy the requirements of Section 6 as a minimum. The requirements 
of Section 6 also apply to the laboratory for testing of different materials related to Project 
Preparation as well as Operation and Maintenance.
2.2.6	
Calibration of Inspection, Measuring and Testing Equipments 
Calibration is defined as specific type of measurement performed on measurement standards, 
material measures and measuring instruments to establish the relationship between the 
indicated values and known values of a measured quantity. The term covers calibrations 
carried out using appropriate reference equipment at any location. The requirements for 
equipment calibration, measurement and traceability are given in ISO/IEC 17025. The 
laboratory’s programme for the maintenance and calibration of equipment will typically 
comprise of periodic cleaning, servicing, calibration and safety checks (where applicable). 
While establishing a calibration programme, aspects of measurement traceability, procedures, 
intervals and records for both calibration and checks, need to be considered for each item of 
IMT equipment in relation to the particular test method for which it may be used. Calibration of 
equipment is a must for certainty/reliability of the test results. Calibration requirement ranges 
from sieves to nuclear density meter. Calibration of plant and equipments such as Hot Mix 
Plant, Concrete Batching Plant etc. are also very important. Calibration requirements, types 
of calibration, interval of calibration, and method of calibration of different IMT equipments 
typically used in a road project, recall procedure etc. are given in Section 7. Wherever time 
interval for calibration specified by the manufacturer is smaller than the time interval indicated 
in Section 7, the manufacturer’s recommendation shall be followed. External laboratory used 
for calibration must be accredited by NABL. Calibration Certificate as well as documentary 
evidence of the accreditation of the calibrating laboratory should be made available in the 
laboratory. Recall procedures of the IMT equipments are given in Section 7. The requirements 
of Section 7 also apply to calibration of testing equipments related to Project Preparation 
and Operation and Maintenance.

2.2.7	
Inspection and Testing
Inspection and Testing generally covers the following:
	
(i)	
Alignment and surface regularity
	
(ii)	
Reinforcement detailing
	
(iii)	 Positioning of furniture/accessories
	
(iv)	 Testing of constituent materials and finished products
	
(v)	
Field/in situ testing
Whereas the requirements of tests for different materials/products/works are given in 
MoRT&H Specifications for Road & Bridge Works/Section 5 of this Manual, details of testing 
procedure are given in applicable code of practice. Test frequency is given in MoRT&H 
Specifications for Road & Bridge Works/Section 5 of this Manual/ applicable codes of practice. 
Section 8 of this Manual deals with general overview of testing procedures. It includes both 
in-process and final inspection and testing. The activities include surveys, measurements 
and tests in laboratory as well as site. General principles/guidelines about inspection and 
testing including source approval, receiving inspection, in process inspection, final inspection, 
sampling of materials from quarries, borrow pits, stock piles, trucks/pavers etc., maintaining 
integrity of samples, testing method for each of the tests, handling procedures, recording 
of observations, formats for recording observations in various tests etc. are covered in 
Section 8.
2.2.8	
Documentation and Communication
Documentation of Quality Assurance and Quality Control processes with proper authenticity 
are critical for arriving at acceptance or otherwise of a finished product. The Contractor/
Concessionaire and Engineer/Consultant shall establish mechanism for documentation well 
in advance. Documentation shall be in both soft and hard format. Proper arrangement for 
security/authenticity of documentation shall be made by both Contractor/Concessionaire 
and Engineer/Consultant. General principles and guidelines for establishing mechanism for 
documentation are explained in Section 9. Communication between different parties to the 
Contract is an important aspect. Though it is not limited to only Quality Control aspects, 
communication related to Quality Control occupies a larger share of the total communication. 
Communication should be fast, reliable and well documented both in soft and hard format. 
E-tools may be followed for faster communication and contract management. General aspects 
of such e-tools are discussed in Section 9. Besides, sample formats for RFI, Notices etc. are 
given in Section 9.
2.2.9	
Statistical Analysis
Variability of materials, workmanship and construction process is a reality in road construction 
like any other manufacturing process. Adding to the variability of materials and processes, 
there is also considerable variation in the testing process resulting in measurement errors. 
Acceptance procedure is therefore, required to factor in variability of test results or in other 
words statistical analysis of test results. Section 10 gives an idea about various methods 
of statistical analysis practiced internationally. Section 10 outlines the salient aspects of 
sampling, criteria for selection of Lot (Population in statististical terms). Section 10 gives 



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 220
======================================================================

IRC:SP:112-2017
11
fundamental principles of statistical analysis and indicates relationship between mean value 
of the test results carried out on the sample in respect of particular Quality Characteristic of 
a material/item of work vis-à-vis specification limit for that particular Quality Characteristic.
2.2.10	
Acceptance/non conformance/rectification
Acceptance criteria for different materials/finished products/items of work are given in different 
Sections of MoRT&H Specifications for Road & Bridge Works whereas acceptance criteria 
of some additional Quality Characteristics of factory manufactured materials, products and 
specialized items as detailed in Section 5 of this Manual are mentioned in applicable codes 
of practice as mentioned therein. Section 11 prescribes Quality Characteristics of materials/
works where statistical analysis is to be carried out for final acceptance and also specifies 
the procedure for statistical check of such Quality Characteristics. Section 11 details the 
procedure/protocol for acceptance/rejection of raw/factory manufactured materials/mixes/
finished products/works based on quality control test results and supplemented by statistical 
analysis where ever applicable. Section 11 prescribes various options available in case of 
failure of a sample to meet acceptance criteria and also gives a detailed protocol to deal with 
non-conformance works.
2.2.11	
Third party Quality Audit
ISO 19011 specifies third party audits as audits performed by external agencies primarily 
for the purpose of certification. In the context of road projects, Third Party Quality Audit is a 
review by an independent entity (a separate firm/group of experts) of how well the key areas 
of a project quality plan is being followed and whether it’s effective in getting the quality 
results originally envisaged. Section 12 gives a general overview of third party quality audit. 
Section 12 specifies criteria for selection of road projects for third party quality audit. It 
outlines scope of third party quality audit and general requirements of audit team. A sample 
terms of reference for third party quality audit is also given in Section 12.
2.2.12	
Safety, Health and Environment
Although safety, health and environmental issues are not precisely part of this Manual, 
quality in such issues at work places has huge importance to the nearby communities, road 
users and construction workers during construction stage as well as nearby communities and 
road users post construction. It is further established that better care for Safety, Health and 
Environment at work places automatically enhances quality in road construction. 
Section 13 makes a modest approach to identify and list those aspects of safety, health and 
environment during road construction.

SECTION 4
QUALITY ASSURANCE PLAN
4.1	
Introduction
Definition of the following terms as stipulated in ISO 8402 of 1994 is reproduced below for 
proper appreciation of the subject:
Quality Policy: The overall quality intentions and directions of an organisation as regards 
quality as formally expresssed by top management;
Quality Assurance: All the planned and systematic activities implemented within the quality 
system and demonstrated as needed to provide adequate confidence that an entity will fulfill 
requirements for quality;
Quality Plan: A document setting out the specific quality practices, resources and sequence 
of activities relevant to a particular product, project or contract.
A road project goes through several stages and involves several stakeholders from inception 
to implementation. Quality of final product is possible only if quality is ensured in each stage. 
Quality Assurance Plan of each of the major stakeholders consistent with its own Quality 
Policy is crucial to ensure quality of a particular stage.
4.2	
Objective
The objectives of preparing a Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) are as follows:
	
l	
Understanding the project requirements/features in totality;
	
l	
Assessing the impact of environment on quality;
	
l	
Developing quality systems to ensure that the process and product fulfil 
quality requirements consistently;
	
l	
Assignment of responsibilities with absolute clarity;
	
l	
Establishing methods for meaningful evaluation;
	
l	
Establishing documentation processes and systems to minute details.
4.3	
General Principles
The different stages of a project cycle such as project preparation, procurement and 
implementation have different concerns with respect to quality. The following general 
principles are intended to address those concerns of quality:
	
(i)	
Preparation of Quality Assurance Plan starts with review of contract 
documents and all project related information. This will help in identifying 
thrust areas of the project from quality perspective. This will also help in 
exercising control over works programme and methodology;
	
(ii)	
Next step is evolving organisational structure of the particular stakeholder 
clearly delineating therein the personnel responsible for quality. The 
organisational structure shall be followed by establishment of interpersonal 



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 220
======================================================================
IRC:SP:112-2017
18
relationship within the organisation and entity(ies)/individual(s) outside the 
organisation for implementation and overseeing;
	
(iii)	 Data collection, validation, storage and retrieval are essential requirements 
of project preparation. Accuracy and reliability of data is key to success of 
a project. Assignment of responsibilities among the personnel for all the 
activities starting from planning of survey and investigation to storage of data 
is essential for good project preparation;
	
(iv)	 It is necessary to establish quality requirements of the material sources 
keeping specifications, terrain, climate, project completion schedule, Govt. 
regulations etc. in view so that the same are satisfied before identification of 
a particular quarry;
	
(v)	
It is necessary to establish quality requirements of the machinery to be 
deployed for a particular project keeping project completion schedule, 
packaging, specifications/capacities envisaged etc. in view;
	
(vi)	 Documentation of project related information and communication between 
the parties to the contract are very important requirements to achieve quality 
apart from project implementation itself. QAP shall establish these two 
aspects in detail considering all the aspects of project implementation;
	
(vii)	 Site laboratory is the real bastion of quality control. Infrastructure and other 
requirements of site laboratory are given in MORT&H Specifications and 
also Section 6 of this Manual. QAP shall customise it to meet the specific 
needs of a particular project;
	
(viii)	 Calibration is defined by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures 
as: “Operation that, under specified conditions, in a first step, establishes 
a relation between the quantity values with measurement uncertainties 
provided by measurement standards and corresponding indications with 
associated measurement uncertainties (of the calibrated instrument or 
secondary standard) and, in a second step, uses this information to establish 
a relation for obtaining a measurement result from an indication.”Procedure 
for calibration of instruments and frequency thereof as recommended by the 
manufacturers and standardised by NABL shall be elaborated in QAP keeping 
in view the specific needs of the project and planning for field laboratory;
	
(ix)	 Verification process (raw materials, mix, finished state) is the domain 
of quality control. It covers inspection, sampling of materials and testing. 
The details of tests to be conducted, frequency of tests etc. are given in 
MORT&H Specifications and Section 5 of this Manual and tests have to be 
conducted as per relevant BIS or other applicable code of practice/standards 
but protocol for such activities with laid down procedure in detail keeping the 
specific needs of a particular project in view shall be established in the QAP;
	
(x)	
Three aspects are of relevance in accepting or rejecting an item of a work i.e. 
result of verification process, statistical analysis and correction, corrective/
preventive actions when a Non Conformance Report (NCR) is generated. 
QAP shall establish the procedure for handling NCRs for different category 
of works.

Quality Assurance Plan for different stages of Project Implementation
4.4.1	
Project Preparation
Project preparation is traditionally carried out by a consulting firm engaged by the Client. 
Project preparation is also carried out by DBFOT Concessionaire/EPC Contractor though a 
consulting firm engaged by it although the scope of project preparation in such case is confined 
within the boundaries set out by the Schedule-B & C of Concession/Contract agreement and 
following relevant Manual of IRC i.e. IRC:SP:73/84/86. Accordingly the activities and outputs 
of project preparation by DBFOT Concessionaire/EPC Contractor is limited compared to 
the one prepared by Client. However, the quality concerns and responsibility assignment of 
personnel remain the same.
4.4.1.1	
Output Desirability
Project preparation should be such that the project is technically sound, assures optimal 
cost utilisation, adequately provides for safety requirements and social & environmental 
safeguards, is easy to implement and ensures intended performance over design life. QAP 
is a tool that guards the project preparation process in achieving its stated desirable outputs.
4.4.1.2	
QAP for Project Preparation Consultant
Model Structure is given at Annexure 4.1.
4.4.1.3	
General Protocol for Client to Supervise Project Preparation
Client has to play a crucial role in preparation of good project report. Client’s participation 
should spread over entire duration of project preparation. A critical requirement is that 
Client’s views on different reports submitted by the Consultant should be communicated to 
the Consultant within the prescribed time period so that project can be prepared within the 
scheduled time and services of the key personnel are truly utilised.
	
(i)	
Client’s participation can be meaningful if availability of minimum counterpart 
personnel of the Client exclusively assigned to project preparation is ensured. 
The following table gives desirable workload with different rank of officers for 
handling average size DPR:
Designation of officer
Maximum number of DPRs 
to be assigned
Asst. Executive Engineer/Deputy

Deputy General Manager
4 with no other responsibility/2 with 
other responsibilities
Superintending Engineer/General 
Manager
4 with other responsibilities
	
(ii)	
Client’s counterpart personnel must frequently interact with Key Personnel 
of the Consultant. The interaction should be both at site and office. For this 
purpose Client’s personnel shall visit the site often. Client’s personnel shall

finalisation as a minimum.
	
(iii)	 Client’s personnel shall verify/witness 1% of total field/laboratory tests and 
various surveys including traffic surveys as a minimum.
	
(iv)	 Client’s personnel not below the rank of Superintending Engineer/General 
Manager shall verify the alignment of the entire length of a project at site 
including widening scheme, bypasses and realignments. Based on the 
inspection report of the Superintending Engineer/General Manager, the 
alignment shall be approved by Client’s personnel not below the rank of 
Chief Engineer/Chief General Manager.

ensuring quality of construction. The broad requirements are discussed below:
	
(i)	
Employer/Authority shall ensure availability of minimum staffing both at PIU 
and HO level so that decisions are fast and just. While it may not be appropriate 
to exactly specify the details of personnel considering variability of size and 
complexity of project, additional and miscelleneous responsibilities  etc. an 
idea is given below for desirable strength at PIU level for handling average 
size projects:
Designation of officer at PIU level
Maximum number of projects to 
be assigned
Asst. Executive Engineer/Deputy 
Manager
1 with no other responsibility
Executive Engineer/ Manager/
Deputy General Manager
2 with no other responsibility/1 with 
other responsibilities
Superintending Engineer/General 
Manager
3 with other responsibilities
	
	
(ii)	
Employer/Authority shall have an independent evaluation and monitoring 
system to ascertain quality control of project. It may be through a dedicated 
cell at HO level, third party auditing or any other appropriate method but the 
extent and contour of independent evaluation and monitoring system shall 
be decided well in advance of commencement/appointed date.
	
(iii)	 Employer/Authority shall install a robust mechanism for dissemination 
of project information. Dissemination shall be multi modal to cater to the 
reach of the stakeholders and shall be continued on sustained basis upto 
completion of the project
	
(iv)	 Employer/Authority shall put in place a credible complaint and grievance 
redressal mechanism through which complaints/grievances of stakeholders 
can be genuinely and timely addressed. 
The above requirements should be inbuilt into Quality Policy/Manual of the Employer/
Authority.
4.4.3.4	
Interaction between QA & QC Personnel of Contractor and Engineer
Proper and timely interaction between QA and QC personnel of Contractor including its project 
management contractor, if engaged, and Engineer is very critical for achieving quality as well 
as progress of work. Interaction involves both physical interaction as well as communication 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:112-2017
24
in hard copy and digital format. Contractor will evolve a mechanism for interaction as above 
and include the same in its QAP.
4.4.3.5	
Pre-audit of QAP
QAP prepared by the Contractor is subject to review of Construction Supervision Consultant/
Independent Engineer/Authority’s Engineer. Contractor may also engage a separate entity 
for pre-audit of the QAP before it is submitted to the Engineer for approval. The general 
points for pre-audit/review of QAP is given below:
	
l	
QAP is prepared in sync with the Quality Policy of the Contractor.

SECTION 5
QUALITY REQUIREMENTS FOR FACTORY MANUFACTURED 
MATERIALS, PRODUCTS AND SPECIALIZED ITEMS
5.1	
Introduction
The materials used in road construction can be broadly classified into three categories 
i.e. natural materials such as soil, sand, gravel, stone etc., factory manufactured materials 
such as steel, cement, bitumen etc. products and specialized items such as bridge bearing, 
expansion joint, tolling equipment, crash barrier etc. Field laboratory is required to be equipped 
for carrying out most of the tests specified for natural materials and factory manufactured 
materials. However, the finished items are usually tested in manufacturer’s own laboratory 
or in a specialized laboratory.
5.1.1	
Tentative list of factory manufactured materials used in road construction and 
testing requirements for the same are indicated in Annexure 5.1. The tests, which are 
normally carried out in field laboratory in respect of such materials, are also indicated therein.
5.1.2	
Tentative list of factory manufactured finished items used in road construction 
and operation are indicated in Annexure 5.2 along with testing requirements for the same. 
Normally, there is no facility in field laboratory to carry out such tests.
5.1.3	
Reliability of factory manufactured materials and finished items specified in 
Annexure 5.1 & 5.2 in the absence of regular site testing has a lot of concerns which need to 
be duly addressed through a combination of testing in manufacturer’s/third party laboratory 
and rigorous protocol to ensure adoption of correct practices by the manufacturers.
5.2	
General Principles
5.2.1	
Quality of factory manufactured materials and finished items specified in 
Annexure 5.1 & 5.2 hinges upon the manufacturer’s commitment and implementation of a 
rigorous protocol in a sustained manner in pursuance to ISO 9001-2015 or similar standard. 
Three aspects are critical in this regard:
	
l	
Process approach
	
l	
Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle
	
l	
Evidence based decision making
5.2.1.1	
Process Approach
A process is defined as a set of interrelated or interacting activities that use inputs to deliver 
an intended result. The process approach is a management strategy. When a firm/company 
uses a process approach, it means that it manages and controls the processes that make up 
its organization, the interactions between these processes, and the inputs and outputs that 
tie these processes together.
When this approach is applied to quality management, it means that the processes and 
process interactions are managed by the firm/company as a coherent process-based quality

management system. A process-based quality management system (QMS) uses a process 
approach to manage and control how its quality policy is implemented and how its quality 
objectives are achieved. In a nutshell, a firm/company is required to identify the processes 
that its QMS needs, to identify their sequence and interaction, to identify required inputs and 
expected outputs for each process, to identify process risks and opportunities, and to assign 
responsibilities and authorities for each process. It also expects the firm/company to identify 
the methods needed to manage, monitor, measure, evaluate, and control each process and 
to provide the resources that each process needs.
5.2.1.2	
Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) Cycle
A firm/company is required to (i) plan its process based QMS, (ii) operate its process based 
QMS, (iii) evaluate its process based QMS and (iv) finally improve its process based QMS. 
A firm/company is required to consistently follow the steps (iii) and (iv) during its operation/
manufacturing.
5.2.1.3	
Evidence based Decision Making
Making decisions involves a degree of uncertainty, but ensuring that decisions are based on 
the analysis and evaluation of data is more likely to produce the desired result. This principle 
is directly applied to step 1,3 and 4 of PDCA cycle in managing and ensuring quality.
5.2.2	
When reliance is made on the quality of a factory manufactured material or finished 
item, it must be certified that the manufacturer is reasonably complying with the requirements 
stated in 5.2.1 above.
5.3	
Responsibility of Supplier/Manufacturer
The supplier/manufacturer has the responsibility of formulating a sound quality management 
plan (QMP) in accordance with the principles set out in clause 5.2 above that meets the 
specification requirements through systematic program of sampling, testing, and inspection.
QMP shall be consistent with quality policy of the manufacturer. The quality management 
plan shall cover aspects such as particulars of certification of company by ISO or any other 
organization, testing facilities, accreditation of manufacturer’s laboratory by NABL/equivalent 
international organisation, calibration process, QC personnel, acceptance mechanism, 
documentation, third party testing and evaluation method. The supplier shall follow its 
QMP diligently. The supplier/manufacturer shall furnish its quality management plan and 
accurate reports of its in house testing and third party laboratory test reports to the purchaser 
(employer/authority/contractor). Annexure 5.3 gives list of documents to be furnished by 
supplier/manufacturer. Annexure 5.3 is a minimum requirement only. If any Code of Practice/
Guidelines specifies the details of documents to be provided by supplier/manufacturer for a 
particular material/item, the same shall also be provided additionally. Requirements given 
in Annexure 5.3 may be further improved by concessionaire/contractor in its QAP for any 
specific factory manufactured material/finished item.
5.4	
Responsibility of Concessionaire/Contractor
The concessionaire/contractor will remain responsible for the ultimate quality of an item 
produced using factory manufactured material or a finished item itself. The contractor shall 
therefore, exercise its checks pursuant to its own QAP for such materials.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:112-2017
36
5.5	
Responsibility of Engineer/Consultant/Employer/Authority
The responsibility of Engineer/Consultant is basically threefold. First, the Quality Management 
Plan and other documents submitted by the supplier/ manufacturer shall be scrutinized at 
length to find consistency of documents in accordance with quality policy of the manufacturer. 
Second, the Engineer/Consultant is required to witness a certain percentage of in house tests 
conducted by the supplier/manufacturer. The Employer/Authority shall carry out witnessing 
of tests, wherever Engineer/Consultant is not engaged for a particular project. Engineer/
Consultant/Employer/Authority shall get third party testing of certain manufactured materials/ 
finished items in a laboratory of repute depending upon the volume of work, importance/
unique nature of a particular finished item, inconsistency of manufacturer’s test reports, fragile 
results of the tests. Random sampling along with traceability of sample is a pre-requisite for 
third party testing. Quality Assurance Mechanism of Engineer/Consultant shall firm up the 
details of tests to be witnessed by Engineer/Consultant and third party testing of certain 
manufactured materials/ finished items to be carried out.
5.6	
New Materials
Several new materials are being developed from time to time which are not incorporated in 
MoRT&H Specifications for Road & Bridge Works. Such new materials are meant for use 
in pavement courses, concrete and various miscellaneous works to bring in economy in 
construction/enhancement of performance/protection of environment etc. . Whereas decision 
as to use of such materials shall be taken as per provisions of Contract Agreement or based 
on judgement of Employer/Authority, following guidelines shall be followed to ensure that 
stated objectives are duly realized.
	
l	
All new materials proposed to be used should be fit for the intended purpose 
of the material or the work in which these are incorporated (e.g. strength, 
durability, volume stability, permeability, separation or filtration, visibility, 
reflectivity, impact resistance, etc. as relevant), tested in reputed laboratories 
and in the field.
	
l	
The material should have a technology and production base that is capable 
of producing the required quantity with consistent and reproducible quality.
	
l	
Full responsibility of the manufacturer shall be guaranteed towards 
performance of the material.
	
l	
The manufacturer’s Quality Policy shall be submitted.
	
l	
The specification limits of the material shall be informed for different quality 
characteristics.
	
l	
Undertaking of the manufacturer about no adverse environmental impact 
shall be furnished supported with test reports.

SECTION 6
FIELD LABORATORY SET UP
6.1	
Introduction
Quality Control requires testing of materials, processes and workmanship in various stages 
of road construction. Adequate number of field laboratories shall be set up by the Contractor 
at the project site by installing the equipments suggested in section 100 of the MORTH 
Specifications for Road and Bridge Works. The number and size of laboratories depend 
on the establishment and oraganisation structure at site. It also depends on the location of 
crushers, concrete batching plant, wet mix plant, hot mix plant and the camp office. If all are 
located in the same place, one single laboratory with the facilities to test all the construction 
materials shall be established in the camp site. If the plants are located in different locations, 
test facilities are required at the respective plant site for conducting corresponding tests 
and accordingly, it is a general practice to establish small plant laboratories to cater to the 
requirements of individual plants.
Generally, it is Contractor’s obligation to establish the test laboratories but where a project 
includes different packages, the Employer/Authority may choose to establish a Central 
Labortaory at a convenient location, where the Engineer may also be able to conduct tests 
on all types of materials and mixes.
6.2	
Objective
Field Laboratory is the real bastion of quality control. Infrastructure and equipments of Field 
Laboratory play critical role in quality control and, in fact, is a cornerstone in the process of 
quality assurance. The objectives of an ideal Field Laboratory can therefore, be summarized 
as:
	
i)	
Lay out plan is such that it accommodates the equipments in proper 
manner and provides good and efficient working environment.
	
ii)	
Intended equipments and accessories are available and properly maintained.
	
iii)	
Intended consumables are available and properly stored.
	
iv)	
Documentation management system is efficient.
6.3	
General Features
6.3.1	
Type of Laboratory
Depending on the size, packaging, field organization structure and geographical spread 
of the project site, there can be a central/main laboratory for each package. Further, plant 
laboratories can be established if they are located in different locations than the main camp 
site. Test equipments at each plant laboratory will be specific to the plant established at that 
location. The Authority / Employer may choose to establish a central laboratory, for conducting 
some important and critical tests.

6.3.2	
Lay out of Laboratory
The layout of the laboratory depends on the test facilities required at that location. Test 
facilities can be divided in to three principal sections namely, soil and aggregate testing 
section, concrete section, asphalt section.
Plant laboratories will have a concrete section for concrete batching plant and aggregate and 
asphalt section for wet mix macadom and hot mix plants. However, the facilities required for 
mix designs need not be established at the plant laboratory. Depending on the Contractor’s 
plans for establishing the plants and their relative positioning with the field laboratories, the 
placement of facilities may be optimized.
Considering that a field laboratory is established for each package and plant laboratory is 
established at the plant site, suggestive lay outs are furnished in Annexure 6.1 of this Section.
6.3.3	
List of Equipment & Accessories
The list of equipment and various accessories in each laboratory depends on the type of 
laboratory and the test facilities envisaged or planned by the Contractor at that location. With 
the same assumptions used for deciding the layout of various laboratories presented in para 
6.3.1, a comprehensive list of equipment in each laboratory and the suggested inventory of 
consumables are furnished in Annexure 6.2 and Annexure 6.3 of this Section, respectively. 
As such, this list shall be consistent with section 100 of MORTH Specifications for Road and 
Bridge Works. However, it may vary depending on the actual test facility envisaged at that 
location subject to approval of Engineer.
6.3.4	
Man Power
Deployment of manpower depends on the size of the laboratory, the test facilities planned 
and the volume of work involved. The central/main laboratory shall be headed by Quality 
Control/Asst. Quality Control Engineer. The qualification and experience shall be as per the 
requirements of Section 3 of this Manual. Each plant laboratory shall be manned by atleast 
one lab technician.
6.3.5	
Codes of Practice
All the tests shall be conducted as per relevant Indian Standard Codes of Practice, which 
have been mentioned in Section 900 and other sections of MORTH Specifications for Road 
and Bridge Works. In the absence of Indian Standards for any test, reference may be drawn 
from any other appropriate international code of practice such as BS, ASTM etc. A list of 
suggested codes of practice for various tests to be conducted on naturally occurring materials 
in original/crushed form is given in Section 8 whereas the same for factory manufactured 
materials/finished products is furnished in Section 5.
6.3.6	
Test Procedures
Test procedures shall be drawn from the suggested Codes of Practice in Para 6.3.5 above 
and included in the Quality Assurance Plan. Further, all the procedures shall be converted in 
to brief work instructions and displayed near the individual test facility.

IRC:SP:112-2017
63
6.3.7	
Documentation and Records
All the formats to be used for recording the results of various tests shall be included in the 
Quality Assurance Plan. A copy of the QAP shall be made available in the central/main & 
plant laboratories. Test results shall be promptly entered in suitable registers and/or forms 
(paper/electronic) soon after conducting the tests. All the linked test reports and RFIs, if 
applicable, shall be filed in a single location so that the records can be effectively retrieved 
at the time of future investigations. Quality records should be properly indexed and linked to 
suitable strip maps for traceability. They should be stored in an orderly manner in the safe 
custody of the laboratory-in-charge. An electronic copy of the records shall be maintained in 
a form that facilitates quick and easy retrieval.
6.4	
Project Preparation
It is preferable that the design consultants carry out the tests in their own laboratories as far 
as possible. In case, the Consultants do not have their own laboratories, they shall arrange 
to conduct the tests in the laboratories of reputed academic institutions or in accredited third 
party laboratories consistent with the requirements of this Manual.
6.5	
Construction
During Construction, the Contractor is required to conduct tests on every material that is being 
incorporated in to the Project including raw materials, processed materials, manufactured 
materials, proprietory materials etc. Laboratories shall be established as per the requirement 
of the Project with all the equipment listed in the Contract / Section 100 of MORTH. Plant 
laboratories shall be established as per site requirement i.e wherever a plant or group of 
plants is established.
6.6	
Upkeep and Manitenance
The laboratories shall be adequately lit, ventilated and well maintained with proper water supply 
and sanitary arrangements. The equipment / apparatus requiring temperature controlled 
environment shall be housed in air conditioned rooms. The tests that use infammable 
substances shall be conducted in separate room having adequate ventillation / windows.
All the equipment provided in the central/main as well as the plant laboratories shall be checked 
periodically for their functioning and serving the intended purpose. To ensure this, maintenance 
for all the equipment shall be carried out at fixed intervals through authenticated service 
provider and also as and when the equipment warrants repair or maintenance. Calibration 
of measuring equipments shall be carried out as per specified frequency or whenever the 
equipment undergoes repair. Thus all the time, all the equipment set in the laboratory shall 
be in working condition within the tolerable limits. Any inspection, measurement and testing 
equipment that undergoes excessive wear and tear and requires calibration more frequently 
than the frequency recommended by the manufacturer shall be replaced. Similarly, all the 
dial gauges, pressure gauges and similar equipment, whose actual readings vary by more 
than 25% of the indicated readings shall be replaced. Equipment which may be more than 
15 years also may be considered for replacement unless it is certified by the accredited 
laboratoried to be fit for use.

SECTION 7
CALIBRATION OF INSPECTION, MEASURING AND 
TESTING EQUIPMENT
7.1	
Introduction
Most of the equipment listed in Section 6 of this Manual contain/involve use of measuring 
devices namely proving rings, extension meters, dial gauges, temperature gauges, load cells, 
weighing pads /scales etc. which measure the values of various test parameters.
The accuracy of the equipment/measuring devices degrade over time. This is typically 
caused by normal wear and tear. However, changes in accuracy can also be caused by 
electric or mechanical shock or a hazardous working environment. Depending on the type 
of the instrument and the environment in which it is being used, it may degrade very quickly 
or over a long period of time. The bottom line is that, calibration restores the accuracy of a 
measuring device as prescribed by the manufacturer and thereby reliability of the material/
mix/finished product in terms of quality is ensured.
To ensure valid results, the measuring equipment shall be calibrated or verified prior to use 
and also at specific intervals normally as specified by the equipment manufacturer, against 
measurement stadards traceable to national or international measurement stadards, and 
where such standards do not exist, the basis for calibration or verification needs to be 
documented.
7.2	
Objective
Calibration is a comparison between a known measurement (the standard) and the 
measurement using the instrument to be calibrated.
Primary objective of calibration is to check and ensure that the measurements made by 
the IMT equipment has the same accuracy as specified by the equipment manufacturer. In 
practice, calibration also includes repair of the device. A report is provided by the calibration 
expert, which shows the error in the measurements with the measuring device before and 
after the calibration.
Hidden costs and risks associated with the un-calibrated measuring device could be 
much higher than the cost of calibration. Therefore, it is absolutely essential that the IMT 
equipment/measuring devices are calibrated regularly, to ensure that errors associated with 
the measurements are in the acceptable range.
7.3	
Scope
All the IMT equipment, which is used for inspection, measuring and testing during project 
preparation, construction and operation & maintenance fall within the purview of calibration. 
Besides production units such as Hot Mix Plant, Wet Mix Plant, Batching Plant, Crusher etc. 
also need to be calibrated. Further, the measuring devices of laying units such as asphalt 
paver, concrete paver need to be calibrated. Calibration of the machine parts does not fall

within the purview of this Manual. However, the Contractor needs to ensure that the Plant, 
Equipment and the Machinery deployed on the Project are well maintained and calibrated 
for the intended use. The scope of calibration in all the three stages of Project Development, 
Construction and O&M are detailed below:
7.3.1	
Project Preparation and Project Development
The Design Consultants, who carry out the feasibility study or prepare detailed project 
reports for the client, carry out various investigations as a part of their assignment, including 
Topographic Surveys, Pavement Investigations, Traffic Sudies, Sub-Soil investigations, 
Hydrographic Surveys (where applicable), laboratory tests, field tests on materials etc., where 
different kinds of IMT equipment is used. GPS, Total Station, Auto Levels, Staff, Tape used 
in topographic surveys, FWD, BBD equipment, Bump Integrator, thermometers, dial gauges 
used in pavement investigations, Traffic Counters & Weighing pads used in traffic surveys, 
proving rings, load gauges, dial gauges / extensometers, weights, simple / physical/electronic 
balances, theromometers, thermostats, used in the laboratories etc. need to be calibrated 
prior to carrying out the measurements or tests periodically for its continuing accuracy by 
appropriate means.
The Design Consultants shall use standard and approved equipment for carrying out various 
studies and well established laboratories for carrying out the tests. All the IMT equipment 
being used in the assignment shall be calibrated as per the requirements of this section.
7.3.2	
Construction
The Contractor, Engineer and Employer/Authority need to carry out various tests in the field 
and the laboratory during construction. Apart from the IMT equipment required to carry out 
quality control tests, there are some important Plants, which require calibration to produce 
the desired mixes including cement concrete mixes, asphalt mixes and wet mix macadam. 
The most commonly used IMT equipment require calibration of proving rings, load gauges, 
dial gauges / extensometers, weights, simple / physical / electronic balances, the romometers, 
thermostats etc., which are used in testing of soil, cement, aggregate, bitumen, asphalt /  
concrete mixes, pavement and sub-soil investigations.
7.3.3	
Operation & Maintenance
During the Operation & Maintenance, the agencies are required to carry out maintenance 
and repair works as a part of routine and periodic maintenance. In order to verify compliance 
to the requirements of maintenance schedules and annexes, the Contractor/Engineer have 
a mandate to conduct BBD and roughness measurements periodically. Various materials/
mixes/works are required during Operation & Maintenance. All the IMT equipment specified 
in the preceding para are used during this stage, and would require calibration.
7.3.4	
IMT equipment may be used in various stages of the Project but, the calibration 
requirements, calibration procedure, frequency and the acceptability criteria continue to be 
same.



======================================================================
PAGE 83 of 220
======================================================================

IRC:SP:112-2017
75
7.4	
Type of Calibration
All the IMT equipment/measuring devices require frequent / routine inspection and verification 
for dimensions, weight, clearances etc., which are specified in the codes of practice for 
each individual test. When some of the parameters are found to be deviating from the codal 
requirements, the following options emerge:
	
a.	
Adjust – when the load cells / balances do not show the appropriate reading, 
the load cells / balances may be adjusted by the equipment manufacturer to 
show the correct reading with reference to the required standard.
	
b.	
Calibrate – when the load gauges in the compression testing machine do not 
show the correct reading, the load gauge shall be verified against a master 
proving ring. Indicated load gauge readings will be compared with those of 
the master proving ring and a graph or chart is drawn between the indicated 
gauge readings and the actual readings.
	
c.	
Replace – for example, when the appurture of the sieves does not conform 
to the requirements, the sieve should be rejected and replaced by a new 
sieve conforming to the national standards. When the size of a mould does 
not conform to the required size, when the graduations on a measuring jar, 
or scale fade away, they should be replaced. Further, when a device can 
neither be adjusted nor calibrated, it should be replaced.
7.4.1	
Calibrations and checks to be carried out on IMT equipment/measuring devices 
can be classified into four categories:
	
a.	
Visual check – where the item is inspected to provide assurance that 
the equipment meets the requirement of appropriate standard, but no 
measurements are required. This can be done as frequently as possible but 
not later than 6 months.
	
b.	
Physical check – which may be performed by the competent staff in-house, 
using appropriately calibrated equipment to a documented procedure
	
c.	
Inhouse calibration – which may be performed to a documented method by 
competent staff inhouse, using appropriate reference standard / equipment. 
The reference standard / equipment will need to be calibrated by a laboratory 
that can demonstrate competence, measurement capability and traceability 
e.g. NABL accredited calibrating facility.
	
d.	
External calibration – which is carried out by the laboratory accredited by 
NABL for the measurement concerned and for which NABL has issued 
certificate.
7.4.2	
Some of the calibrations can be done at site by an external agency, which is qualified 
and acceredited to perform a specific calibration. Static Weigh bridge shall be calibrated by 
the legal metrology department at site itself. Compressing Testing Machine can be calibrated 
against a master proving ring at site itself by competent external agencies. Similarly, the load 
cells in the Concrete Batching Plant or Asphalt Batching Unit can be calibrated at site only. 
But, the proving rings used for measuring CBR, Marshal Stability, dial gauges, thermometers, 
electronic balances etc. will have to be sent to the accredited laboratories for calibration.



======================================================================
PAGE 84 of 220
======================================================================
IRC:SP:112-2017
76
The IMT equipment which can be calibrated with inhouse facilities shall be identified and 
suitable methodologies shall be drawn for the approval of the Competent Authority.
7.5	
Requirements for Calibration
In order to carry out the calibration, it is necessary to have the required Master Calibrating 
Devices, ambient conditions and trained man power. Master Calibrating Device is the 
instrument having capacity higher than the instrument/ equipment to be calibrated and whose 
measurements are already verified and certified by authenticated master calibration, whose 
details are traceable. 
Typically, the accuracy of the standard should be ten times the accurate of the measuring 
device being tested. However, accuracy ratio of 3:1 is acceptable by most standards 
organizations.
7.6	
Frequency of Calibration
As a general rule, the IMT equipment/measuring devices shall be calibrated at the frequency 
specified by the manufacturers of the specific equipment. In some of the cases, frequency 
depends on the use and wear and tear of the equipment. For example, the Bump Integrator 
may have to be calibrated after running a specific distance (km). Calibration shall also be 
done invariably after repair or mechanical maintenance of the equipment.
For each of the measuring and testing equipment the manufacturer specifies the time interval 
for its calibration. In addition to manufacturers’ recommendations, depending upon the usage 
wear and tear that takes place to the instrument/equipment and the limitations on master 
calibrating unit, certain interval shall be fixed for individual equipment/instruments. Details 
of calibration requirements and intervals are listed in Annexure 7.1. Wherever time interval 
for calibration specified by the manufacturer is smaller than the time interval indicated in the 
Annexure 7.1, the manufacturer’s recommendation shall be followed.
7.7	
Calibration Records
Calibration records shall be maintained and associated with a unique identifier of each piece 
of equipment. These records shall include:
	
l	
Identity of item of equipment
	
l	
Name of the manufacturer
	
l	
Serial number
	
l

IRC:SP:112-2017
77
Status of calibration and the calibration certificate shall be displayed near the respective IMT 
equipment.
7.8	
Recall Procedures
Soon after recalibration of the IMT equipment, it shall be verified whether there is any major 
difference in the old and new calibrations, and if they would affect the readings taken in the 
past. Any borderline results deduced from the readings of the equipment under reference 
in the past 3-6 months may be verified against the new calibration. If  there is any point of 
concern, then the corresponding elements or components may be identified for carrying out 
suitable confirmatory tests in field. On review of the field tests and on verification of their 
compliance with the specifications and standards, if necessary, suitable action will be iniated 
as per the requirements of Section 11 of this Manual. To this extent, it is recommended that 
the agency shall maintain a separate record of all the borderline cases in a separate location 
so that positive recall procedures can be easily applied, when found necessary.

additional tests shall be conducted for factory manufactured materials, products and 
specialized items as per Section 5 of this Manual. Requirement and procedure of testing 
during different stages of construction are given below:
8.5.1	
Approval of Sources
The Contractor will identify the sources of raw materials viz., soil, morrum, sand, fly ash, 
quarry stone etc. and thoroughly inspect the sources for adequacy of quantity, quality and 
consistency including the history of usage of the material from the quarry, details of the 
projects where the material was used and the problems observed if any. Subsequently, 
Contractor shall collect the samples and subject them to the prescribed tests to verify their 
conformity with the requirements. The proposed sources of manufactured materials viz., 
Cement, Steel, Bitumen, Emulsions, Admixtures etc. also shall be subjected to tests as 
detailed in Section 5 of this Manual at the site laboratories or third party labortories as 
applicable. The Contractor shall submit the test results along with the location and layout 
of the borrow pit or quarry and the locations of the samples and the depth of collection. For 
manufactured materials the test results shall be submitted along with the further details as 
specified in Section 5 of this Manual. The Engineer will determine the necessity of further 
tests at the site laboratory or elsewhere and communciate the approval for the sources. 
Unless the approval is received, the Contractor shall not procure the material. Engineer 
shall communciate his approval expeditiously to avoid delay in procurment of the material. 
The Contractor shall plan the activities carefully so that approval of the sources is done well 
ahead of the actual construction.
8.5.2	
Testing of Sources of Materials
The Contractor shall subject all the raw materials and the manufactured materials to testing 
as per the procedures and frequencies stipulated in Section 900 for road works and other 
applicable sections for bridges and structures of MORTH Specifications for Road & Bridge 
Works. 
For soil and moorum materials, adequate number of samples shall be collected from the 
borrow areas so that the entire borrow pit is representated in both area and depth. If the 
Contractor intends to collect samples from a deeper level, samples shall suitably cover the 
entire depth. After mapping the densities, consistency and strength properties of the material, 
the borrow area will be segragated based on their properties and an average density value is 
determined for different parts for the purpose of verifying the degree of compaction achieved 
in the field. If there is any considerable variation in the densities or visible change in the 
quality of material, the material in the borrow pits will be retested and the reference density 
is revalidated. 
Samples of aggregates shall be collected from stock piles in the stacking area or the crushers. 
Sample size depends on the quantity of stock pile and the guidelines given in IS:383 and 
IS:2386 for condcting various tests. All manufactured materials Viz., cement, steel and 
bitumen procured from pre-approved sources shall be tested prior to use. Manufacturer’s 
Test Certificates and other details specified in Section 5 of this Manual pertaining to the lot 
received shall be submitted by the Contractor for reference. In addition, the Engineer shall 
determine the tests to be conducted at the site laboratory and the 3rd party laboratory as

relevant, as per the Qulaity Assuarnce Plan approved for the project. Only after obtaining 
the approval of the Engineer, the materials shall be incorporated in the works, as concrete 
elements and bituminous courses are irreversible in nature and if any test fails, it is difficult 
to rectify.
8.5.3	
In-Process Inspection & Testing
It is advisable that test sections are prepared using any material or mix being incorporated 
in the pavement, sub-grade and filling and all the parameters are verified. This will not only 
be useful in optimising the compaction effort i.e the number passes, rolling pattern, overlaps, 
speed etc. but also to train the team in verification of process parameters viz., temperature, 
moisture, line, level etc. The compaction factor can be determined for a specific borrow area 
or the mix so that loose material can be accordingly laid in a manner that the desired levels 
are achieved at the required degree of compaction.
Test sections also ensure that the performance of the plant and equipment used for producing 
the mix and laying the mix is verified and confirmed with the requirments of the specifications. 
Material shall be collected from the cold bins/hot bins of the WMP/HMP/Concrete Batching 
Plant etc. to verify the calibration of the motors/load cells and tested for conformance to the 
mix proportions envisaged in the design. The mix finally delivered in the hopper shall be 
collected and verified for the proportions and respective properties of the ingradients and 
mixes.
The performance of the paver or grader etc., in producing the desired workmanship and 
finished properties shall be verified in the field and suitable corrections shall be made to the 
equipment / processes. The plant or equipment, which is unable to produce the desirable 
quality at site shall be removed and replaced with the approved equipment as per Contract.
All the ingredients of the concrete, GSB, WMM and Asphalt courses shall be tested on a 
day to day basis at various stages including in stock piles, bins, dry mix, final mix loaded in 
the truck and at field as applicable and relevant. This will clearly isolate the deficiency and 
provide insignts in to the reasons for variation in quality.
Samples shall be collected from the pavement layers prior to compaction and routine tests 
shall be conducted to verify the reference density and other properties if necessary. These 
control tests will explain the variation in the degree of compaction if compaction is done 
under controlled conditions, duly verifying all the process parameters. The results of the 
control tests shall be documented and monitored.
Generally, the reference values shall be those obtained during the mix design process. But, 
if necessary and found advisable, the reference densities may be obtained on a day to day 
basis from the material actually laid at site.
Process parameters viz., moisture, temperature, line and level shall be checked prior to 
compacting the layers so that the end product fulfills the requirements of the specifications. 
Record of such inspection and verification shall be maintained in relevant check lists and 
formats.
For concrete works various pre-concrete and post-concrete checks shall be made as per the 
provisions of applicable codes and good industry practice. It shall be ensured that the staging 



======================================================================
PAGE 92 of 220
======================================================================
IRC:SP:112-2017
84
conforms to pre-approved designs and all the joints are tight and safe. Further, the shuttering 
shall be as per the lines and levels given in the drawings and the joints are sealed to prevent 
leakage. It shall also be ensured that chairs and cover blocks are placed to achieve the 
spacing of reinforcement and the concrete cover respectively. All the arrangements shall be 
verified against the checklists provided in the QAP.
Reinforced Earth Walls require thorough inspection during the erection of panels itself as 
correction of the deficiency after construction is extremely difficult. Horizontal and vertical 
alignment shall be checked at each stage by appropriate means i.e total station and plumb 
bob. The c, φ and density of the reinforced soil fill should be checked regularly. Further, the 
grids or the strips should be protected from exposure to fire, sun etc. as per the manufacturer’s 
specifications and kept adequately covered. Adequate earth cushion should be ensured to 
prevent damage of the grids while compacting. Low capacity compactors should be used 
while compacting near the panels. Casting, storing and erection of friction crash barriers 
should be done with adequate care to ensure a good finish. It is emphasized that adequate 
care should be taken at each step during the construction itself.
8.5.4	
Final Inspection & Testing
It is important that the final product conforms to the requirements of the specification and 
standards and the same is verified prior to taking up the next component. 
In case of road works, each layer shall be inspected and put to tests as required by 
Section 900 of MORTH Specifications for Road and Bridge Works. Initially, the layer 
shall be visually inspected for its workmanship, uniformity in texture, undulations, roller 
marks, segregation, pumping etc. All the cross sectional elements including the width of 
the carriageway, paved shoulder, earthen shoulder, toe width, camber, side slope, surface 
regularity shall be measured and verified. Any defects shall be corrected prior to taking up 
final testing. Levels, thickness and degree of compaction of the layer shall be checked at 
prescribed spacing and intervals and checked whether they are within the specified tolerances. 
Any nonconformance shall be identified and corrected before proceeding to the next stage. 
NCRs shall be issued in case of any irreversible processes and the required corrective and 
preventive actions shall be initiated and disposed as per the provisions of Section 11 of this 
Manual. 
All concrete works shall be inspected after the removal of the false work, staging, shuttering 
and inspected for undulations, segregation, bleeding etc. and suitable rectification shall be 
carried out, if necessary. All elements shall be verified for lines, levels, dimensions and surface 
regularity for conformity to the tolerances. It shall also be verified if the concrete fulfills the 
other acceptance criteria of compressive and / or flexural strength which is generally verified 
by casting cubes, beams, cylinders etc. as required during the casting of concrete. In case 
of any shortfall in strength properties, NCR shall be issued and cores shall be collected from 
the respective components to verify the corresponding properties and the required corrective 
and preventive actions as necessary, shall be initiated and disposed as per the provisions of 
Section 11 of this Manual.
8.6	
Operation & Maintenance
During the O&M stage, the Contractor shall carry out rountine inspection of the highway at the 
time and intervals specified in the contract agreement and identify the defects and deficiencies 



======================================================================
PAGE 93 of 220
======================================================================

IRC:SP:112-2017
85
to be rectified. Generally, the contract specifies a definite time period of rectification for each 
type of distress. Accordingly, the Contractor shall prepare a maintenance programme and 
carry out the rectification accordingly. 
Engineer shall inspect the works at all the 3 stages i.e. before, during and after rectification 
and verify compliance to the requirements of the Specifications. The requirements of sub-
section 8.5 of this Manual shall apply mutatis mutandis to the various inspection and test 
requirements during O&M. 
Any other tests or surveys required during O&M viz., visual condition surveys, BBD / FWD 
and roughness tests shall be carried out in accordance with relevant codes and conformance 
to the requirements of the agreement shall be verified and ensured. Any non-conformance 
shall be processed as per Section 11 of this Manual.
8.7	
Third Party testing
Some of the tests may have to be conducted in the third party laboratories in case of special 
tests and also if the Contractor does not have the test equipment and expertise to carry 
out the tests, which include special tests on Cement, Bitumen, Steel, Bearings, Agregate, 
Geogrid, other forms of soil reinforcement, RE fill, stone polishing value of aggregate etc. In 
some cases the Employer/Authority or the Engineer may like to order confirmatory tests in 
external laboratories, even though the Contractor has the test facility at site. Such cases may 
also include extensive and poorly explained failure of structural and pavement elements.
Sampling shall be carried out jointly by the parties including the Authority, Contractor and the 
Engineer and the samples shall be carefully numbered for unique identification and packed 
for despatch. If the laboratory allows, the tests shall also be conducted in the presence of the 
parties who sampled the materials. The external laboratories shall fulfill the requirements of 
Section 5 and 6 of this Manual.
8.8	
Sampling
Sampling of the materials should be done with utmost care as the right product may fail on 
account of preparing and / or testing a wrong sample and vice versa. Moreover, the consituent 
materials of road are of heterogeneous quality and further subjected to heterogeneous 
processes. Hence, sampling done at adjacent locations may still yield different results. 
Hence, statistical procedures shall be applied for sampling and testing as per Section 10 of 
this Manual.
8.8.1	
Sampling of Quarries
While sampling the stone quarries, the entire quarry shall be visually inspected for its 
homogenity of surface, quality and the quality and extent of over burden. Representative 
sample shall be carefully selected for conducting various tests. If the quarry is being used 
in any of the crushers, crushed aggregared shall also be collected from the crushers for 
approval of the source.
8.8.2	
Sampling of Borrow Pits
The extent of the borrow pit shall be identified and marked for delineating the area in to 
various sections of atleast 25 m X 25 m. Samples shall be collected from each such section 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:112-2017
86
with an excavator if possible. Sample should represent the entire depth up to which the 
Contractor proposes to extract. Approval shall indicate the plot number and the depth of such 
plot.
8.8.3	
Sampling of Stock Piles
Material is generally segregated in the stock piles. The extent of segregation depends on 
the size of the stock pile. Well Stocked piles up to a height 2 m do not pose much problems. 
But, huge stock piles of 10 to 20 m also are sampled at times. A back hoe can be used for 
collection of samples from such piles. Samples should be collected from all the sides and 
from deep inside the stock pile. Surface samples are generaly segregated. Alternatively, front 
end loaders can be used to take out samples from deep inside and the required quantity can 
be collected from each such scoop. The material so collected shall be subjected to quartering 
and coning to arrive at the required sample for testing. The number and quantity of sample 
shall be as per IS:383.
8.8.4	
Sampling of Trucks and Pavers
Segregation is possible at each location in the process. Material shall be dumped incrementally 
in the trucks or pavers to avoid segregation. Representative samples can be collected with 
ease if such loading process is followed. It is always ideal to collect the sample at site from 
behind the paver than the hopper.
8.8.5	
Sampling on layers
Sample of adequate size shall be cut from the layer without affecting the size of the aggregates. 
In sampling an asphalt layer, it is always better to cut a rectangular section than the core, if 
we want to carry out tests for gradation and bitumen content. Core, cuts the aggregates and 
the gradation or bitumen content found from such samples is not correct.
8.8.6	
Statistical Sampling
Sample locations on the road layers can be chosen by way of random numbers to be 
generated by some electronic gadgets. The numbers can be applied on the length and 
width sequentially, to choose the locations. This prevents the bias of the testing personnel in 
selecting the location. However, all the defects shall be rectified prior to taking up the testing 
so that sampling is representative and reflects the quality of the layer.
8.9	
General Guidelines for Inspection & Testing
In-process inspection and final inspection are very important aspects in Quality Assurance and 
Control. Inspection should be done against a standard checklist at all important hold points, 
requiring final or stage approvals. The check list shall include all the steps and parameters 
indicated in the method statements and the MORTH Specifications for Road & Bridge Works. 
The work carried out using a set of equipment, materials and conditions in a day can be 
grouped for the purpose of determing the frequency / no. of tests, irrespective of the spread 
of the locations. If the frequency specified in the codes result in excessive puncturing of 
the layer or component, the frequency may be suitably reduced subject to prior approval of 
the Engineer. Reduction in number of destructive tests may be compensated by conducting 
more non-destructive tests like nuclear density tests etc.

SECTION 9
DOCUMENTATION AND COMMUNICATION
9.1	
Introduction
During implementation and upon completion of a road project, several documents are required 
to be prepared. Communication among Authority/Employer, Engineer and Concessionaire/
Contractor is a part of operational requirements of a Contract. The interaction takes places 
on issues like project execution, progress reporting, quality of works, invoicing, revised 
plans, change of scope, statutory and regulatory requirements as per Contract and any other 
requirements of Authority/Employer, Engineer and Concessionaire/Contractor.
9.2	
General Principles of Documentation and Communication
9.2.1	
Overview of documentation
Documentation is involved in the process of planning, design, reviews, procurement, storage 
& issue of materials, plant and machinery operations, changes, amendments, approvals, 
subcontracting, payment, accounting and control of obsolete documents. It also includes 
methods of controlling records, which are generated as a part of Quality Management 
System during project implementation. All the stakeholders shall ensure that the documents 
are legible, readily available and retrievable at alter date.
9.2.2	
Overview of communication practices
Communication practices should be such that there is quick and objective interaction among 
all stake-holders for the day-to-day needs. For this purpose, e-tools may be the preferred 
option for the communication. The internal and external communication needs are required 
to be identified with respect to what will be communicated, when, with whom and how- related 
to all aspects of project implementation including total quality management of the project.
9.2.3	
Requirement of Digital Technology in documentation
Document digitization is the process of converting manual documents into digital formats. 
In the process of document digitization, any type of document like text, images and videos 
are digitized and converted into digital formats such as .txt, .html, .xml, .pdf, .doc, .xls, .gif, 
.jpeg or .tif. Some of the advantages of digitization are perpetual preservation of vulnerable 
physical documents, quick and easy retrieval, easy access and easy to share.
All original records must be examined for their digitization suitability prior to the digitization 
process. This process will determine the extent of preparation required and ensure that 
successful images are obtained from the digitization process 
9.2.4	
Requirement of E-Tools in communication
E-Tools or electronic tools imply the application of modern ICT (Information and Communication 
Technology) tools to automate certain tasks. E-Tools is a generic term, which covers usage 
of a combination of computer hardware, software, communication tools and technologies for 



======================================================================
PAGE 186 of 220
======================================================================
IRC:SP:112-2017
178
a specific purpose or application. Key benefits of E-Tools are:
	
l	
Better quality, speed and effective flow of information.
	
l	
Improved accuracy and consistency of documentation.
	
l	
Paperless interaction – environment friendly.
	
l	
Builds transparency and accountability at all levels.
E-Tools should be preferred and used for communication as far as possible.
9.3	
Guidelines for establishing mechanism for documentation
9.3.1	
Project preparation
During the course of DPR preparation, several discussions are made at site as well as office, 
which impact different aspects of the project. Both Authority and Consultant shall maintain 
records of all such discussions/meetings and related communication held for finalization 
of the alignment and various provisions/components of the project in a systematic and 
chronological manner. All volumes/parts forming part of DPR shall have proper index and 
the main report shall contain consolidated index of all volumes/parts. All revisions to DPR/
any particular part of it shall be properly identified and a table inserted in the main report 
chronicling each revision. The soft and hard copies of various reports (like DPRs, Feasibility 
Reports, LA plans) submitted by the Consultant shall be maintained at the site office of 
Authority.
9.3.2	
Construction
	
(i)	
Drawings, Specifications, Work related documents: The issuing authority 
should maintain the records of drawings/documents giving information about 
reference number, revision, reference, title, date of issue, to whom issued, 
number of copies issued, status of issue, date of approval, purpose of issue 
etc. Receiving officer to whom documents are issued at site should maintain 
similar record.
	
(ii)	
Inspection Proforma: These are used for the purpose of seeking approvals 
from the ‘Engineer or his representative’ before commencing any operation, 
such as, pour cards for concrete, approval to reinforcement, approval to 
formwork, approval to setting out, approval to pre-stressing, approval to 
grouting, etc. These are usually supplemented by standard checklists which 
have to be verified by the ‘Engineer’ and after he is satisfied about contents, 
approval is then accorded on that form.
	
(iii)	 Test Results: The results of day-to-day tests carried out in accordance with 
the requirements or specifications should be recorded in the prescribed 
Proforma. The Proforma are usually maintained in two forms - one for 
recording the observations during each test and calculation of quality 
characteristics. The second is for recording the summary of test results to 
facilitate later analysis.
	
(iv)	 Method Statements: The method statements give a detailed proposal 
of the constructing agency for carrying out each and every activity in the 



======================================================================
PAGE 187 of 220
======================================================================

IRC:SP:112-2017
179
Project. These are written in form of various steps in a particular sequence 
supplemented by suitable sketches to be self-explanatory. These method 
statements shall be approved by Engineer prior to implementation.
	
(v)	
Daily Dairy of Work and Quantity Records: Records are required to be 
maintained at site for the day-to-day operations, activities and events taking 
place at the site of work, such as equipment deployed, manpower deployed, 
activities carried out, different types of materials consumed, detailed 
observations of the activities at site (foundation strata, tilts, shifts, etc.), visits 
by senior level engineers and follow-up of their instructions. These records 
will enable preparation of the completion report as well as investigation of 
any unusual observations, which come to notice afterward.
	
(vi)	 Non-conforming Products: Detailed statements have to be prepared 
describing the procedures to be followed as soon as any result not conforming 
to the requirements is obtained. Such statements include the (a) procedures 
to be adopted for rectification of a particular component where such result has 
been noticed, (b) the long term corrective action, (c) immediate preventive 
action in other similarly affected activities till the long term corrective 
actions are implemented and (d) dismantling/removal/disposal of unsuitable 
components/materials.
	
	
For the quality of the finished work, it is necessary for the materials and 
workmanship to fully comply with the work requirement. 
	
	
Special situations may, however, arise where non-conformance may only 
be known after sometime e.g., strength of concrete 28 days after casting. 
Separate recall procedures should be laid out for dealing with such non-
conforming situations.
	
(vii)	 Quality Audit Records: The audit programme shall assign qualified 
personnel to perform such audits and define the frequency and procedure 
of audit. The method of reporting the findings and recommendations and the 
means for corrective actions shall be documented.
	
(viii)	 Mechanism shall also be developed for recording and maintaining documents 
with regards to other aspects of construction such as procurement, storage 
and issue of materials, operation of plant and machinery, payment, accounting, 
approvals, traffic diversion, safety and environmental safeguards measures 
etc.

SECTION 10
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
10.1	
Introduction
10.1.1	
History of Statistical Quality Control
Prior to second decade of 20th century, industrial quality control meant inspection of products 
and removing defective ones. Dr. Shewhart started the Process Control while working in 
Western Electric Company in the year 1924 and further developed it when he moved to Bell 
Laboratories. A physicist, engineer and statistician by profession, Dr. Shewhart is also called 
father of Statistical Process Control.
Shewhart framed the problem in terms of assignable-cause and chance-cause variation and 
introduced the control chart as a tool for distinguishing between the two. Shewhart stressed 
that bringing a production process into a state of statistical control, where there is only 
chance-cause variation, and keeping it in control, is necessary to predict future output and to 
manage a process economically.
The next leap in quality control was Total Quality Management, which was developed in post 
war Japan under the aegis of William Edwards Deming a protégée of Shewhart. Apart from 
his statistical prowess,it was Deming’s philosophy to manage a “system” to achieve a high 
quality product or service that resulted in the grand success of Japanese manufacturing 
industry. Deming’s chain reaction is given below:
Improve Quality
Cost decrease because 
of less rework, fewer 
mistakes and delays, 
snags, etc
Productivity 
improves
Capture the 
market with better 
quality and lower 
prices
Stay in business 
Provide jobs 
and more 
jobs
The next step forward in quality management is six-sigma (6σ). A six sigma process is one 
in which 99.99966% of all opportunities to produce some feature of a part are statistically 
expected to be free of defects (3.4 defective features per million opportunities). Introduced 
by Bill Smith while working at Motorola in 1986, it was substantially developed by Jack Welch 
at General Electric in 1995.
The fundamental concept of six sigma process is that upper and lower specification limits 
(marked USL and LSL) are kept at a distance of 6σ from the mean. Because of the properties 
of the normal distribution, values lying that far away from the mean are extremely unlikely: 
approximately 1 in a billion too low, and the same too high. Even if the mean were to move 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:112-2017
186
right or left by 1.5σ at some point in the future, there is still a good safety cushion. This is 
why Six Sigma aims to have processes where the mean is at least 6σ away from the nearest 
specification limit.
Specific management tools are employed in all the 3 methods mentioned above by monitoring 
certain statistical parameters in different stages of manufacturing. 
10.1.2	
Variability is a reality in road construction like any other manufacturing process. It 
is like a settled order of the nature. Variability occurs in materials and processes used for road 
construction. It also occurs in different stages of road construction, has different dimensions 
and impact on quality of various components of road and bridge works in different manners. 
Limiting the variability is a prime objective of QA Plan but variability does exist and needs 
to be duly accounted for while evaluating quality of a component of road and bridge works 
for the purpose of its acceptance. Adding to the variability of materials and processes, there 
is also considerable variation in the process of sampling of materials carried out for testing 
and actual testing of materials resulting in measurement errors. Under such circumstances, 
statistical analysis helps in taking informed decisions about acceptance.While the guidelines 
stated elsewhere in this Manual shall be followed to achieve desired quality, the quality 
control test results of certain materials/layers/components as specified in Section 11 of this 
Manual shall be subjected to statistical analysis as stated in this Section for the purpose of 
acceptance of the particular material/layer/component. Essentially, statistical quality control 
for road and bridge works relates to statistical Lot inspection of an item of work and its 
acceptance.
10.2	
Glossary of Terms
Before proceeding with a particular method of analysis, it is necessary to understand various 
terms associated with statistical analysis. Whereas some of the terms are common to all 
methods, some are unique to a particular method. The standard definitions as given in 
different international codes of practice, literature are given below:
Quality Characteristics: Quality Characteristics are parameters/properties, measured 
values of which define the quality of a product i.e. material/layer/component with reference to 
its functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability, and portability.
Attributes: Characteristics that are measured as either “acceptable” or “not acceptable” are 
called Attributes. Thus Attributes have only discrete, binary, or integer values.
Variables: Characteristics that are measured on a continuous scale are called Variables.
Population: Population is a set of similar items or events, which is of interest for some 
question or experiment in statistics.
Lot: In statistical quality control for road & bridge works, Lot represents Population. For 
example it may be a section of a particular layer of pavement made from same type of 
materials and constructed on the same day.
Sample: Sample is a set of data collected and/or selected from a Lot by a defined procedure. 
The elements of a Sample are known as sample points, sampling units or observations.

187
Sample Space: In probability theory, the Sample Space of an experiment or random trial is 
the set of all possible outcomes or results of that experiment.
Random Sampling: Random Sample is a subset of a statistical population (Lot) in which 
each member of the subset has an equal probability of being chosen. A simple Random 
Sample is meant to be an unbiased representation of the Lot. The process of selecting a 
random sample is called Random Sampling.
Mean: Mean refer to a measure of the central tendency either of a Probability Distribution or 
of the Random Variable characterized by that distribution.
Variance: Variance measures how far a set of numbers is spread out. The variance of a 
Random VariableX is the expected value of the squared deviation from the Mean.
Standard Deviation: Standard Deviation (SD, also represented by the Greek letter sigma 
σ or s) is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of 
data values. The Standard Deviation of a Random Variable, Statistical Population, data set, 
or Probability Distribution is the square root of its Variance.
Continuous Probability Distribution: A Probability Distribution is a statistical function that 
describes all the possible values and likelihoods that a Random Variable can take within a 
given range. If a Random Variable is a Continuous Variable, its probability Distribution is 
called a Continuous Probability Distribution. The equation used to describe a Continuous 
Probability Distribution is called a probability density function (pdf). All probability density 
functions satisfy the conditions i.e. (i) The Random Variable Y is a function of X; that is, Y = 
f(X), (ii) The value of Y is greater than or equal to zero for all values of X and (iii) The total 
area under the curve of the function is equal to one. 
Normal Distribution: The Normal Distribution is a Probability Distribution that associates the 
normal Random Variable x with acumulative probability. Physical quantities that are expected 
to be the sum of many independent processes (such as measurement errors) often have 
distributions that are nearly normal. The Probability Density of the Normal Distribution is 
given by:
Where:
µ is mean or expectation of the distribution
σ is standard deviation
σ2 is variance
Normal Distribution curve is flatter if variation of data from mean is more and vice versa.
Standard Normal Distribution is the simplest case where Mean is 0 and Standard Deviation 
is 1.
Specification Limit(s): The limiting value(s) placed on a Quality Characteristic around a 
nominal or target value of the characteristic that may be either an individual upper or lower 
specification limit, USL or LSL, called a single specification limit; or USL and LSL together, 
called double specification limits. Specification Limits set forth in MoRT&H Specifications

for Road and Bridge Works or in applicable code of practice in respect of additional Quality 
Characteristics mentioned in the Section 5 of this Manual are to be considered for the purpose 
of acceptance.
Quality Measure: Quality Measure is a tool used in statistical acceptance of a material/
layer/component with respect to a certain Quality Characteristic. There are several quality 
measures such as Percent Defective (PD), Percent Within Limits (PWL), Average Absolute 
Deviation, Moving Average, Conformal Index etc. However PD/PWL have been preferred in 
recent years because they simultaneously measure both the average level and the variability 
in a statistically efficient way.
Percentage Within Limit (PWL): PWL is the percentage of the Lot falling above the LSL, 
beneath the USL, or between the LSL and USL. Conceptually, it is similar to determining the 
area under the normal curve bounded by LSL and/or USL. PWL is estimated using the Sample 
Mean and the Population/Sample Standard Deviation. PWL is also function of sample size.
Percentage Defective (PD): 100-PWL
Average Absolute Deviation: The Average Absolute Deviation (or Mean Absolute Deviation) 
of a data set is the average of the absolute deviations from a central point, usually Mean. It 
is a summary statistic of statistical dispersion or variability.
Moving Average: Moving Average (rolling average or running average) is a calculation to 
analyze data points by creating series of averages of different subsets of the full data set. It 
is also called a moving mean or rolling mean and is a type of finite impulse response filter.
Conformal Index: Conformal Index is a measure of the dispersion of a series of results 
around a target or specified value, expressed as the square root of the quantity obtained by 
summing the squares of the deviations from the target value and dividing by the number of 
observations. The standard deviation is a measure of precision, but the CI is a measure of 
exactness (accuracy) or degree of conformance with the target.
Producer’s Risk: Probability of the sampling and decision plan resulting in work of a 
satisfactory quality being rejected.
Consumer’s Risk: Probability of the sampling and decision plan resulting in work of an 
unsatisfactory quality being accepted.
Operating Characteristic Curve: A curve corresponding to a particular PD. The Producer 
may increase the probability of his work being accepted by reducing the PD. Conversely 
any increase in PD will increase the probability of rejection. The relationship between the 
probability of acceptance and PD for a particular quality control scheme is referred to as its 
OC curve.
10.3	
Sampling and Testing
10.3.1	
Statistical quality control for road works involves statistical Lot inspection and 
acceptance or otherwise of the Lot but not rigorous statistical process control as used in 
industrial quality control. Like statistical analysis for any other product, statistical analysis for 
road works deal with samples to draw inference about Quality Characteristic of the Population 
(Lot).

10.3.2	
Salient Aspects of Sampling
Following are the important aspects of sampling:
	
l	
Sampling plan has to be prepared for each Quality Characteristic.
	
l	
The purpose of acceptance sampling is to sentence Lots i.e. not to precisely 
estimate the Lot quality.
	
l	
The most effective use of acceptance sampling is not to “inspect quality into 
the product,” but rather as an audit tool to ensure that the output of a process 
conforms to requirements.
	
l	
When testing is destructive, there is no substitute for sampling.
	
l	
Acceptance sampling often greatly reduces the amount of inspection/testing 
error.
	
l	
There are risks of accepting “bad” Lots and rejecting “good” Lots.
	
l	
Acceptance sampling requires rigorous planning and documentation of the 
acceptance-sampling procedure.
	
l	
Variables acceptance-sampling plans assume that the distribution of the 
Quality Characteristic is nearly normal. Any substantial departure of the 
distribution of the Quality Characteristic from being normal, adversely 
impacts reliability of the analysis.
10.3.3	
Lot Selection
Lot selection is very important so that statistical analysis of samples presents good 
approximation of the Quality Characteristics of the Lot. The following criteria shall be followed 
in Lot selection for road works:
	
l	
The Lot must be defined before testing commences.
	
l	
The Lot may be of any size, but is restricted to a single day's production.
	
l	
The Lot must be homogeneous with only random variation in characteristics 
such as density, moisture content, thickness, colour and finish.
10.3.4	
Random Sampling
Random Sampling gives us a way to study Population characteristics without systematic 
bias. Random Sampling is not arbitrary sampling but there are defined ways to do it. In simple 
Random Sampling each possible Sample has equal probability of being drawn. Number of 
Samples to be taken from each Lot is specified in MoRT&H Specifications and to be followed 
although statistical tools are available to determine sample size for different conditions. The 
samples are collected in a relatively homogeneous set of conditions over time/space, which 
helps to separate  “signal” from “noise”.
10.4	
Fundamental Principles of Statistical Analysis
The Bell-shaped normal probability distribution curve is symmetrical about the vertical axis. 
The intersection point of the vertical axis with the horizontal line asymptotic to the curve or 
the mid- point represents the mean (‘μ’). The area of the curve is equal to unity representing 
probability of 1. Any value (x) of the variable can lie to the left (negative side) or right (positive 



======================================================================

190
side) of the mean and its distance from the mean in terms of standard deviation (σ) represents 
the deviation from the mean (e.g. 1,2 or 3σ). No deviation beyond 3σ on either side is possible. 
The area of the curve bounded by two ordinates, representing two values, and the curve 
indicates the probability of the values lying between the two points (e.g. -1.6σ and +1.65σ). 
The area left in either of the tails beyond any ordinate indicates the probability of the variable 
not having a value that is greater than that value (if the ordinate is on the positive side) or less 
than that value (if the ordinate is on the negative side).
Normal distribution is represented by two parameters, mean and standard deviationμ and σ 
for population or x and s for samples. Larger the value of standard deviation (as in the case of 
population) flatter is the curve and smaller is its value (as in the case of samples), the sharper 
it is. (See the figure below).
Normal Distribution Curve for Population and Sample mean
Z statistic given by (x-μ)/σ is an indication of the deviation of the value of the variable from 
the mean. The areas bound by the ordinate at any X corresponding to the Z (or vice versa) 
are tabulated in standard Statistical Tables. For example, for Z=1, the area is 0.8413, which 
means the remaining area in the tail is 0.1587. The interpretation is that there is 84.13 per 
cent probability that the given value of the variable will not be exceeded and 15.87 per cent 
probability that it will be. If Z is equal to -1, by symmetry, it can be said that there is 84.13 
per cent probability that the given value X will not fall below that value and 15.87 per cent 
probability that it will. If the areas in the two tails is deducted from 1, it will give the probability 
of the values lying between Z=+1 and -1, which in this case is 68.26 per cent.
In statistical quality control, the objective is to predict with a certain level of confidence the 
probability of a value of the desired variable (a) being exceeded or falling below this value, 
or (b) the value lying within a certain range. This confidence level in Statistics is called 
‘Confidence Interval’. The probability of non-occurrence of any event, as explained above 
is equal to the area in the tail and that is called the ‘significance level’ in Statistics. Two sets 
of values of Z, (+/-) 1.65 and  (+/-) 1.96 are of special importance as these relate to 95 per 
cent and 97.5 per cent Confidence Interval of any value of variable being exceeded or falling 
below that value (ref (a) above), which is the main concern in quality control.

The discussion so far has been on population mean and standard deviation, which refers to 
the ‘lot’ in this document. Samples are drawn from the lot and tested. A number of tests (say 
6 or 8) are carried out on each set of sample and every set will throw up a sample mean and 
the sample standard deviation. How to predict the lot from these tests is the question. This 
problem is solved in three steps, viz.
	
(i)	
Each test, if carried out with uniform procedure, equipment and personnel, 
i.e. without any bias in the testing procedure, can be considered to follow a 
normal distribution with the sample mean (x) and sample standard deviation 
(s). At 95 per cent Confidence interval, it can be said that no test value can 
fall below 1.65 s.
	
(ii)	
It is an established statistical principle that the samples follow normal 
distribution with sample mean and standard deviation of s/√n. This would 
mean that the lowest value obtained by (i) above (mean -1.65s) can further 
go down by 1.65s/√n.
	
(iii)	 Thus at 95 per cent Confidence Interval the total deviation possible from 
the sample mean is (1.65-1.65/√n) times s. In other words, if this quantity is 
subtracted from the sample mean, the value obtained should be more than 
the value specified for quality.
	
	
Explanation: If Specification requirement is compaction to 98 per cent 
density and the mean of 4 tests in a set of sample comes to 99 per cent with 
standard deviation of 3, the predicted lot density will be 99 -1.65 (1- 1/√4) 3, 
i.e. 97.525, which is less than 98 and hence unacceptable. However, if the 
variability in the tests is low and s is equal to 1.5 the predicted density would 
be 98.089 and the sample would pass.

ACCEPTANCE/NON CONFORMANCE/RECTIFICATION
11.1	
Introduction
Any material/product/specialized item received/manufactured at site and any work carried out 
at site has to be finally either accepted for the work or rejected. Rejected work may however 
be reworked to meet acceptance process. The acceptance process typically comprises of 
the following steps:
	
i)

SECTION 12
THIRD PARTY QUALITY AUDIT
12.1	
Audit- Objectives and Principles
Audit is defined in ISO 9000-2005 as “Systematic, independent and documented process for 
obtaining audit evidence and evaluating it objectively to determine the extent to which audit 
criteria are fulfilled”. Audit criteria and audit evidence are defined as follows: 
Audit criteria: Set of policies, procedures or requirements used as a reference against which 
audit evidence is compared. 
Audit evidence: Records, statements of fact or other information, which are relevant to the 
audit criteria and verifiable.
The principles of auditing should ensure that an audit is an effective and reliable tool in support 
of management policies and controls, by providing information on which an organization can 
act in order to improve its performance. The principles as outlined in ISO 19011:2011 include 
the following:
	
l	
Integrity
	
l	
Fair presentation
	
l	
Due professional care
	
l	
Confidentiality
	
l	
Independence
	
l	
Evidence-based approach
Scope of Audit is wide and varied. It applies to several management systems of an organization 
either individually or jointly. Audit is broadly classified into 3 types i.e. First Party Audit (the 
organization audits its own systems to measure the strengths and weaknesses of the 
management system against the system requirements), Second Party Audit (the customer 
or client audits the facilities of the organization with which it has a contract to supply goods 
and services) and Third Party Audit (carried out by an independent organization generally for 
the purpose of certification). Whereas the First Party Audit is an internal process, the Second 
Party Audit and Third Party Audit are external.
12.2	
Third Party Quality Audit of Road Projects- General Overview
Whereas quality audit applies to several management systems of a Concessionaire/Contractor 
organization in implementation of a project, third party quality audit is generally carried out 
by an organization independent of the project implementation agencies i.e. Concessionaire/
Contractor, Supervision Consultant/IE/AE and Employer/Authority. A Third Party Quality Audit 
is a review by an independent entity (a separate firm/group of experts) of how well the key 
areas of a project quality plan is being followed and whether it’s effective in getting the quality 
results originally envisaged. It is a value addition to the project and not just fault finding 
with the contractor. Normally audit scope covers safety adherence, occupational health and 
environmental compliance of the project apart from quality of works.

IRC:SP:112-2017
201
12.3	
Selection of Projects for Third Party Quality Audit
Employer/Authority shall take a decision on case-to-case basis for Third Party Quality Audit 
of a road project depending upon its size and complexity. However, projects fulfilling any or 
all of the following criteria may be considered for Third Party Quality Audit:
	
i)	
Projects costing more than Rs. 1000 crore (cost of civil works at 2016 prices)
	
ii)	
Projects involving tunnel
	
iii)	
Projects involving at least one bridge having individual span length more 
than 100m or total bridge/viaduct length more than 2000m
	
iv)	
Projects involving cable stay/suspension cable/any other innovative bridge 
design
12.4	
Scope of Third Party Quality Audit
Scope of Third Party Audit for a typical road project is given in Annexure 12.1. Scope may 
be modified considering complexity and special features of a particular project. If road safety 
auditor is engaged for a project, scope of Third Party Audit shall be suitably modified to 
exclude safety related issues. Third Party Quality Audit shall cover physical verification of all 
major items of work. Inception Report shall list all such items. The Quality Characteristics of 
a particular item of work and sample size for physical verification shall also be identified in 
Inception Report.
12.5	
Audit Team
Typical composition of the TPA team and qualification and experience of the TPA team 
members is given in Annexure 12.1. Depending upon size and complexity of the project, 
composition of the team and qualification and experience of the members may be modified. 
Two requirements which are critical for meeting objective of Third Party Audit are (i) integrity 
of the team members and (ii) independence of the team. The bid documents for selection 
of consultant for TPA shall make adequate provision to prevent the experts with doubtful 
integrity from being selected. Further to ensure independence of audit team from any 
undesirable influence of the representative of [Employer/Authority] in charge of a particular 
project, selection of the consultant for TPA and administration of its contract shall be done by 
a special cell or Hqs of the Employer/Authority.
12.6	
National Level Project Monitor
MoRT&H has empanelled/in the process of empanelment of some retired Govt. officers in 
the rank of Superintending Engineer and above as National Level Project Monitor (NLPM) to 
examinee issues such as inferior quality works, delay in completion, inadequate provisions 
in the project & poor services by the concessionaire and suggest remedial actions for them. 
Although exact scope of services of NLPMs shall be as per relevant guidelines/circular of 
MoRT&H, the aspects related to Quality Control shall be similar to what prescribed in this 
Section for Third Party Audit.

SECTION 13
SAFETY, HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT
13.1	
Introduction
Road construction has significant impacts on nearby communities, their health and safety as 
well as the natural environment. People and properties may be in the direct path of road works 
and affected in a major way. People may also be indirectly affected by construction, through the 
disruption of livelihood, loss of accustomed travel paths and community linkages, increases 
in noise and pollution, and more road accidents. Disturbances to the natural environment 
may include soil erosion, changes to streams and underground water, and interference with 
natural habitats and plant life. Quality in Safety, Health and Environment at work places is 
therefore of paramount importance to the nearby communities, road users and construction 
workers during construction stage. These factors also impact nearby communities and road 
users post construction. Therefore, a set of guidelines has been given in this Section to 
ensure quality in Safety, Health and Environment at work places. It is further established that 
better care for Safety, Health and Environment at work places automatically enhances quality 
in road construction.
13.2	
Transportation Planning & Health
Transportation planning can affect human health, either positively or negatively, in several 
ways. For example: 
Safety:	
	
Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death. Effective safety measures 
and responsible behaviors by all road users can reduce the number of 
fatalities and injuries. This is particularly important for vulnerable road users 
like pedestrians, bicyclists, children, differently abled persons and senior 
citizens.
Air Quality:	
Transportation planning that reduces vehicle emissions improves air quality 
for everyone. On the other hand improper planning and or implementation 
during construction stage deteriorates air quality during construction/
operation stage.
Noise:	
	
Alternatives can be designed to reduce noise and thereby prevent or reduce 
adverse health effects like hearing loss, sleep disturbances, cardiovascular 
problems, performance reduction, annoyance responses, and adverse 
social behavior - all of which are associated with exposure to varying levels 
of noise.
Transportation Planning and designing should take into account the above considerations 
for better health of society. Some of the aspects are also relevant during construction stage.
13.3	
Safety, Health & Environmental Safeguards During Construction
Following are a set of suggestive actions for the Contractor during construction stage to 
safeguard safety, health and environment:
