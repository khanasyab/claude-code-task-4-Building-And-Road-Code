The Highways Specifications & Standards Committee considered and approved the draft 
document in its meeting held on 13th October, 2017. The Executive Committee in its meeting 
held on 2nd November, 2017 considered and approved the same for placing it before the 
Council. The Council of IRC in its 213th meeting held at Bengaluru on 3rd November, 2017 
considered and approved the draft of IRC:99 “Guidelines for Traffic Calming Measures in 
Urban & Rural Areas” (First Revision) for printing. The valuable contribution made by Dr. Sanjay 
Wakchaure, SE MoRTH regarding review of detailed document deserves special mention.
1 introduction
1.1	
Road categories and their specific designs are determined by considering the 
maximum permitted speeds of vehicles that will travel on them with convenience and safety. 
At certain locations like approaches to sharp curves, congested/accident-prone locations 
and residential streets, towards manned and unmanned level crossings, control of speed 
becomes necessary to promote orderly movement of traffic and to enhance safety. 
1.2	
Traffic Calming techniques have emerged primarily as a society’s requirement 
for safety. It is widely accepted that differences and variations in the speed, direction, and 
mass of vehicles are some of the key determinants of severity of road accidents. These 
techniques have played an important role in enhancing road safety by ensuring lower driving 
speeds and smaller speed differences between different road users. Over the last 25 years, 
the residential areas in Europe have become much safer with the creation of 30 km/hr zones 
despite the considerable variation in the direction and mass of vehicles plying on them. 
Several such experiences from around the world have established that the use of Traffic 
Calming techniques to influence road design significantly reduces accidents, pollution and 
makes neighbourhoods more liveable.
1.3	
However, the case in India is quite different given the heterogeneity of modes of 
traffic on most roads (see Table 1.2). The vehicles plying on urban roads, National Highways 
(NHs) and State Highways (SHs) vary widely in terms of operating characteristics. Sometimes 
tractors and animal carts share the carriageway with fast moving motorised traffic. The 
highways that pass through villages and towns are also shared with local traffic - resulting in 
wide variations in direction, speed and vehicle mass. 
1.4	
Given the context of socio-economic conditions across the country, it is difficult to 
restrict access of non-motorised vehicles to highways. The Traffic Calming techniques have 
to be adapted to the Indian context to achieve the goals of managing efficient traffic flow at 
the same time ensuring safety of all road users especially around areas where the Highways 
pass through the villages and towns.
1.5	
Road construction and maintenance are expensive public expenditure items and 
the costs on the road users and overall society is also substantial. The social costs comprising 
of accidents involving injuries and deaths and pollution in the surrounding areas are difficult to 
quantify. In light of this, it becomes imperative to pursue policies that minimise transportation 
costs for the individual road links and the network as a whole using the limited financial 
resources efficiently. The extensiveness and diversity in road networks create opportunities 
to explore the wide range of traffic calming techniques and also consider trade-offs between 
one another to improve any situation.

1.6	
In city and metropolitan regions, roads should be designed to restrict the passenger 
vehicles speeds at 50 km/h and those of trucks and commercial vehicles at 40 km/h. This 
will ensure that the traffic moves smoothly with less acceleration and deceleration at average 
speeds between 20 and 30 kmph. 
1.7	
Vehicle speed is one of the critical factors associated with road accidents because 
higher speeds reduce the time available to avoid collisions and makes the impacts in 
collisions more severe. Research studies from around the world demonstrate conclusively 
that the frequency and severity of accidents usually reduce with reduction in average speed. 
A decrease in average speed of 1 km/h will typically result in a 3 per cent decrease in fatal 
accident frequency. Variation in speed between vehicles within the traffic stream is another 
factor that contributes to accident occurrence. Table 1.1 and Fig. 1.1 establishes the 
importance of speed management in accident severities (Elvik, Christensen, & Amundsen, 
2004).

1.8	
Given the wide differences in traffic patterns in different countries, it is recommended 
that clear and unambiguous instructions should be communicated to ensure that the design 
is appropriate for the local conditions. Two main principles for speed reducing measures 
have been discussed.

Visual measures - Speed limit signs, painted strips across the road, zebra 
crossing, stop marking on the road surface (visual brakes), three dimensional 
markings, road surface patterns and plants etc.
	
II.	
Physical measures.
It is common experience that visual measures like speed limit signs alone may not suffice 
to control driving speeds but has significant effects when combined with physical measures.
1.9 	
The goals and objectives for traffic calming are standard for most countries. 
Safety is a key objective for virtually all traffic calming schemes, not only in terms of reducing 
accidents, but also to reduce the degree of danger felt by people using the streets. In recent 
years, concerns over the environmental and public health effects of traffic have increased 
considerably leading to an additional objective of minimizing environmental impacts. Reducing 
the speed and volume of traffic can contribute to a better local environment, but it may often 
be possible, through imaginative design and the use of appropriate materials (Rehman, et 
al., 2009).
1.10	
This document aims to provide key information about Traffic Calming techniques 
for urban areas, State Highways, National Highways and rural roads. Chapter 2 lays down 
the understanding of various traffic calming techniques, followed by a detailed description of 
various techniques in urban areas in Chapter 3 and rural areas (highways) in Chapter 4.

1.
Modal mix of traffic 
in urban areas
Two-wheelers, 
three-wheelers 
and 
non-motorised 
traffic 
comprise a much larger share in 
urban traffic
Cars are the dominant mode
2.
Modal mix on 
intercity roads
Trucks, 
buses 
and 
cars 
constitute a larger share on 
most highways.
Presence of tractors and non-
motorised traffic (varies from 
road to road).
Large variation in speeds.
Cars are the dominant mode 
and there are no tractors and 
non-motorised traffic. Therefore, 
little variation in speeds.
3.
Highways passing 
through townships.
Almost all intercity roads pass 
through townships and villages. 
Therefore, all intercity traffic 
must interact with local traffic 
when passing through these 
areas. 
Extensive network of limited 
access highways ensures that 
most long-distance traffic uses 
the same.
Traffic on intercity roads passing 
through townships is generally 
not long distance traffic and 
hence has slightly different 
characteristics and needs.

Vehicle 
characteristics
The suspension systems of 
vehicles and their sizes vary 
greatly. Therefore, horizontal 
Traffic Calming measures like 
lane narrowing and staggering 
would have to be re-explored to 
deal with narrow vehicles. 
Vertical measures like humps 
(speed breakers) would affect 
cars, motorcycles, trucks and 
buses differently.
Since the vast majority of 
vehicles are cars and even larger 
vehicles, horizontal measures 
are effective. 
Vertical measures must be 
tailored to cars, buses and 
trucks, where two-wheelers is 
not a major issue.
5.
Traffic segregation
Very little segregation of traffic. 
Traffic 
Calming 
measures 
should target segregation as 
one of the major goals.
A large proportion of roads in 
Europe now have segregation of 
traffic, especially the provision 
of bicycle lanes thereby making 
the Traffic Calming measures 
easier to implement.
2 Traffic Calming
The central theme of Traffic Calming is to reduce the adverse impact of motor vehicles on 
built up areas. The techniques usually involve reducing vehicle speeds, providing more space 
for pedestrians and cyclists, and improving the local environment.
Road engineering aims to bringing the design of the road in accordance with the desired 
speeds of the vehicles plying on them, constitute the guiding principles of Speed Management 
by Design or Traffic Calming.
The basic principle of Traffic Calming remains universal, that is to lower the vehicle speeds 
in order to reduce accidents, pollution and enhance livability of surrounding areas. Vehicles 
travelling at speeds below 30 km/h can co-exist with pedestrians in relative safety. Measures 
such as road narrowing, roundabouts and road humps, reduce the negative effects of 
motor vehicle use, and alter driver behavior and improve conditions for non-motorized 
street users.
2.1	
Necessity of Traffic Calming
Studies have shown that traffic calming can reduce accident levels by up to 40 per cent, 
and have a significant impact on reducing the severity of accidents, economic loss and air 
pollution .“The main advantage of traffic calming is that it is self-enforcing and does not 
normally require any complication traffic control devices and is usually highly cost-effective; 
achieving benefits with a value far greater than the costs.

2.3	
Active or Design Enforced
Pro-active or design enforced approaches are highly effective since these can achieve almost 
100 per cent success rates in managing speed on the road with relatively low level of capital 
expenditure. The roads and vehicles can be designed to achieve a desired response to road 
and speed classification and volume recommendations. The appropriate design can address 
the driver by influencing the driving behavior. Such approaches should be the preferred 
method in most cases given their high levels of effectiveness with low investments.
A very high percentage of road accidents are attributable to human error. Changing human 
behavior of drivers and other road users is a slow process and a significant challenge. 
Several attempts and experiments at influencing road user behavior have yielded less than 
satisfactory results. The limitations of the human ability remain evident given the range of 
behavioral issues and weaknesses - motivation, attention, emotion, observation, prediction, 
knowledge and skills that prevent the human from being an ideal traffic participant. In this 
context, the strategies should focus on adapting the transportation system to suit the people 
who use them, so that they are led to behave safely, rather than nudging people adapt 
to the system failing which there are serious consequences such as permanent mutilation 
or fatalities. More precisely, the three basic elements of the system - infrastructure, road 
user and the vehicle should be adapted to each other. The endeavor should be that the 
infrastructure and the vehicle parts of the system should adapt well to the limitations of 
human ability through proper design.

2.3.1	
Physical Warnings
Traffic calming on road infrastructure can be physical measure to curtail the speed forcing 
drivers to slow down to the desired speed.
Table 2.1 Types of Physical Warnings
Intent of TC technique/
intervention
Method
Successful Examples
Physical signal to driver
Influences driver behavior 
by means of jerks and 
vibrations to the vehicle
Road humps, rumble strips, 
raised crossings, plat-form 
junctions raised at pavement 
level, speed tables and 
ramps
Psychological signal to 
driver
Directly affecting his risk 
perception by visual or audio 
means
Carriageway width 
constrictions, chicanes, 
corner blips, planted central 
reservations, bends in the 
traffic route etc.
The common factor that effect of psychological signal to the driver get reduce over time, as 
the drivers get used to the measures as part of their routine travel habits.
2.3.2	
Lane Narrowing
Lane narrowing can reduce the speed of cars but its effect is minimal for two wheelers. Also, 
in the case of bicycle lanes, there are more chances of the lane being encroached upon by 
the motorized vehicle due to a constricted carriageway. The narrowing should be indicated 
using lane marking or texture change or colour change or by kerb markers. Lane narrowing 
is shown in Fig. 2.2 and 2.3.

2.3.3	
Speed Breakers/Humps
Speed breakers are commonly used to reduce speeds and help in maintaining efficient traffic 
flows by reducing speed differences among the road users. However, the design and type of 
the speed breaker is critical. The degree of the effect of the humps in terms of speed reduction 
depends upon the profile, height, gradient, length and the material used in the design. Their 
sight indicates to the driver about the impending inconvenience in the form of a jerk and 
vertical deflection and the driver understands higher speed would cause inconvenience to 
them, thus there would be a general tendency to slow down. Their key advantage is that they 
can be easily placed at identified locations. 
2.3.3.1	
Circular Humps
The profile of this hump is circular as shown in Fig. 2.4. The radius and chord length can be 
varied to different passing speed.

2.3.3.2	
Trapezoidal Humps
The trapezoidal humps have a slightly raised flat section of a carriageway with ramps on both 
sides as shown in Fig. 2.5. These can be used in connection with pedestrian crossings. If 
installed correctly, the discomfort is moderate for cars, whereas lorries and buses must pass 
very slowly.

Rumble Strip
Rumble strips are provided at places where speed control is unavoidable in highways and 
arterial roads. Properly designed rumble strips can be provided on NHs and State Highways. 
The rumble strip can be cast in situ with cement concrete or premix bituminous materials. 
Rumble strip may be provided across the entire width of carriageway and paved shoulders 
(if any). Raised section should be 20 to 30 mm high, 200-300 mm wide and spaced about 
one meter centre to centre of roughly 6 numbers at one location as shown in Fig. 2.6. These 
are placed across the entire carriageway including the shoulder. Proper workmanship must 
be exercised to achieve the required height. On approaches to narrow bridge, rumble strips 
can be used in shoulder to force the driver to slow down and drive on restricted width of 
pavement in approaches, where shoulder gets terminated or in some case shoulder space is 
converted to raised footpath etc. In accident prone locations, where accidents have occurred 
due to departure of vehicles from shoulder on to side slope of embankment, rumble strip can 
be used on such a shoulder side also.

Transverse Bar Markings
Transverse bar marking made of thermoplastic markings is another treatment to alert and 
to reduce the speed. Number of sets of transverse bar markings on approach to hazardous 
location depending upon the speed. Each set comprises of 6 bars, 200 to 300 mm wide 
600 mm apart of 5 mm high and of 300 mm wide 1000 mm apart of 15 mm high as shown 
respectively in Figs. 2.7 and 2.8.

gets solidified. Alternatively, made of Mastic Asphalt or any 
equivalent material which would provide 15 mm high

2.3.3.5	
Speed Table (Raised Crossings)
Speed Table, which is the raised crossing, extends the full width of the carriageway between 
the kerbs and extends over a longer length of road than humps. The surface should be of a 
different material to the carriageway and footpath. Speed Table is more suitable than road 
humps when the measures are implemented on bus routes. In a corridor having considerable 
buses, the length of the Speed Table should be sufficient to accommodate the full wheelbase 
of the bus to reduce passenger discomfort to a minimum.

2.3.3.6	
Raised Crossings
Raised crossings are used to resolve conflicts between different kinds of traffic i.e. cars 
and other motor vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians and are predominantly used at minor 
junctions, property access, and entry and exit to service roads and would provide comfort, 
convenience and safety to all users.

2.3.4	
Raised Intersections
Raised intersections are used to bring all users to a common speed limit without affecting 
the cyclists too much. They can be mainly used on junctions where the intervention does not 
affect the movement of high volume through traffic.

Textured Pavements
Textured pavements are effective for reducing speed of small cars, but are to be combined 
with other measures to be effective for buses and other large sized cars.

Roundabouts
Roundabout is a junction type to reduce the speed of traffic while passing through junction. 
The central island and deflecting islands are designed in such a way that traffic has to be 
deflected to reduce the speed before entering circulatory carriageway. In the roundabout high 
speed conflicts can be avoided, as shown in Fig. 2.13. The IRC:65 “Guidelines for Planning 
and Design of Roundabouts” is recommended for design of roundabout.

2.3.7	
Mini Roundabout
In the absence of space to accommodate a normal roundabout, mini roundabouts is an 
alternative to bring about speed reduction.

Other Measures
There are other measures, which are used internationally are staggering, chicanes, chokers 
and realigned intersections etc.
2.4.1	
Staggering
Staggering is one of the few traffic calming techniques which can produce a very predictable 
effect on traffic speeds depending on the vehicle type. It is done by horizontal deviation of 
vehicles on the road, restricting them to known turning radii, which would be different speeds 
for different vehicle types. Hence, the sharper the bend, the slower would be the speed. The 
maximum achievable speed can be defined based on the geometry of deviation.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:99-2018

The angled kerb blisters which create a horizontal deflection is sufficient to slow vehicles to 
travel comparable to speed at hump (i.e. 20-25 km/hr at the device). The device operates 
differently for single lane and two lane devices as shown Figs. 2.16 and 2.17.
Fig. 2.16 Staggering - One Lane

The advantages and disadvantages of staggering is given in Table 2.2
Table 2.2 Staggering - Advantages and Disadvantages
Advantages
Disadvantages
•	
Single lane device restricts speed 
to about 25 km/hr, eliminates heavy 
vehicles. Two lane device restricts 
speed to 40 km/hr, can accommodate 
buses
•	
can be landscaped
•	
can accommodate parking bays
•	
accommodates cyclists at the kerb
•	
not recommended as an isolated device

single lane devices restrict speed off 
large emergency vehicles

2.4.3	
Realigned Intersection
Realigning of intersection such as converting skedded crossing into staggered intersection 
is a way to slow down the speed of cross road traffic as shown in Fig. 2.19 Chokers and 
chicane are other options available for reducing speed, reducing the traffic way.

Effectiveness of Traffic Calming Measures
The effectiveness of Traffic Calming measures can be appreciated in Table 2.3
Table 2.3 Objectives and Impacts of Traffic Calming Measures
S. No. Objectives of Traffic Calming Measure
Impact of Traffic Calming Measures
1
Reducing the difference in speed 
between vehicles and at different points 
along the same road.
Reduces the disturbances in traffic flow 
and thereby increases the average 
speed of all vehicles.
2
Reinforcing the road hierarchy
Slowing down vehicles significantly on 
access roads, moderately on secondary 
roads and much less on main roads. 
3
Reducing the number of accidents
Reduces the number and severity of 
traffic jams that are caused by accidents.
4
Reduction in noise, air pollution and 
aesthetics
Traffic calming generally reduces traffic 
noise. Speed reductions from 50 to 
30 km/h typically reduce noise levels 
by 4-5 decibels or more in certain 
circumstances.
5
Increases 
neighbourhood 
interaction 
and crime prevention
Helps make public streets lively and 
friendly, 
encourages 
community 
interaction, and attracts customers to 
commercial areas.
Discourages 
extreme 
anti-social 
behaviour.
Neighbourhoods that are more difficult 
to 
drive 
through 
(narrow 
streets, 
few straight through streets) have 
significantly less crime than those that 
are more permeable.
2.6	
Passive or Law enforced 
Passive measures include speed cameras and electronically displayed speed warning signs 
and the restrictions enforced by police manually for certain traffic movements, and also visual 
measures like gates, signs and markings, whereby law can be enforced for those who are 
violating the instructions and crossing the limits set therein.
2.7	
Visual Warnings or Pre-Warnings
Pre-warnings are applied to ensure that drivers become aware of the subsequent speed 
reducers or changing road speed classification. The pre-warning is not in itself intended 
to be physically speed reducing but should motivate the drivers to ease the pressure and 



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:99-2018
18
reduce speed. Pre-warnings will normally be applied on traffic roads before stretches of 
speed control and can be used for all traffic flows.
2.7.1	
Signs
Road sign warns and informs the drivers about the nature of the road stretch that they are 
approaching and about the local speed limit or recommended speed for that road stretch. 
The road signs may be supplemented by planting, other measures like gates and in certain 
cases physical warning like rumble strips. 
Among other things, road speed classification signs, speed zone signs as well other warning 
signs, should be designed to consider the reaction time and visible distance at design speeds 
in the zone that they driving, so that the drivers as well the vehicle can react accordingly 
before entering the defined zone. IRC:67 for “Code of Practice for Road Signs” should be 
followed for recommended road signs in India.
Fig. 2.20 Stop Sign
2.7.2	
Feedback Signs
Increasing number of road accidents in India due to over-speeding and the limitation of the 
current speed limit signs in India has created the need for a smart speed limiting solution. 
Driver Feedback Sign (DFS) are designed to display real-time feedback about the speed 
of the vehicle to the driver. It measures the speed of the vehicle by using a radar and 
displays the real-time speed of the vehicle on a LED display. These signs have a high impact 
polycarbonate face and can be programmed to flash when motorists exceed the speed limit. 
Driver Feedback Signs present the driver with a highly visible display in the daytime or night-
time and under all-weather conditions. DFS with its better sign visibility alerts motorists when 
they are over speeding and helps protect pedestrians and other vulnerable road users. It can 
be very effectively used on city roads near schools, hospitals and residential areas to warn 
speeding motorists to slow down. The idea is to warn speeding vehicles continuously and 
inculcate a culture of driving within suggested speed limits.

2.7.3	
Markings
Road marking also influence driver behavior and markings will invariably catch the attention 
of drivers. An optimum number of information marked on roads that driver can take action in 
appropriate time. With a traffic calming project, one should always consider whether the same 
information can be conveyed through a sensible design of other traffic control measures in 
addition to signs and marking. Road marking shall be the essential part of traffic calming 
measures. IRC:35 “Code of Practice for Road Marking” should be followed for pavement 
marking.
2.7.4	
Gates
Gates are used as traffic calming to indicate the transition from one traffic environment to 
another. It is primarily to mark the change to a lower desired speed. Gates can be used on 
roads such as at the approach to a town or an old town area, or on local roads at the entrance 
of the local traffic zone.
Gate on a traffic road must function visually by means of planting, change of road surface, 
portals and lighting and also by slightly narrowing the carriageway. At the entrance to a 
local traffic zone, humps and reduction of the trafficable width can be considered. Designers 
should establish location of gates, which, to some degree, resemble the speed reducing 
measures in the area. For example, gates for a village and town shall be located in such a 
way that restriction would be applied for a reasonable length and can bring forth compliance.

The effect of gates in reducing speed depends on their design and on their context. The effect 
is greatest if they are given a distinctive design; both visual and speed reducing techniques 
in them.
2.7.5	
3-Dimensional Marking on Roads
The 3-dimensional marking provided on road gives an impression to approaching driver 
which in-turn has an effect on speed. It is highly effective initial period of installation, but 
effect is likely to reduce as drivers are accustomed to know the location after a period of time 
but will be highly effective for first comers. Invariably, it would serve as altering measures to 
fast approaching traffic to know the location of hazardous location. 
3 Traffic Calming Measures in Urban Areas
Traffic calming can help create more attractive urban environments. Commercial areas 
along higher-speed streets tend to be unattractive, as much land is used for parking, and 
settlement patterns have no clear form. Traffic calming projects can even reduce the amount 
of land devoted to streets and parking, which in turn can increase green-space and reduce 
impervious surfaces, resulting environmental and financial benefits. Traffic calming schemes 
generally incorporate a wide range of measures designed to complement each other in 
both speed reduction and environmental terms. Schemes are designed to be self-enforcing, 
although the effectiveness of this varies according to the measures employed. The principle 
techniques used fall into four areas:
	
•	
Vertical Deflections
	
•	
Horizontal Deflections
	
•	
Road Narrowing
	
•	
Central Islands
The effects of these measures may be reinforced by a range of supporting measures.
3.1 	
Vertical Deflections
Vertical shifts in the carriageway are the most effective and reliable of the speed reduction 
measures. Some of the techniques available to achieve this include:
	
•	
Speed Breaker
	
•	
Speed Bumps
	
•	
Speed Table
	
•	
Uneven Road Surface and Stone Set Pavement
3.1.1	
Speed Breaker/Road Hump
Speed breaker may be of several varieties, the rounded and flat topped being the most 
common. The latter are particularly suitable in providing crossing places for pedestrians. The 
width of humps may be restricted to allow the longitudinal drainage. Speed breaker are not 
recommended on bus routes because of the discomfort caused to passengers.

3.1.1.1	
Circular Hump
The profile of circular shaped hump is based on the shape of a circular arc with a radius 
varying from 11 m to 113 m and a chord length varying from 3.0 m to 9.5 m to achieve desired 
speed of 20 km/h to 50 km/h. Circular shaped humps with rises less than assumed 10 cm 
will result in higher speeds than those mentioned. Rises that are higher than 10 cm may 
cause damage to vehicles. For roads with bus traffic, the table indicates the speeds at which 
buses can reasonably pass the individual humps. If buses must be able to pass at 40 km/h, 
the radius of the hump must be 180m and chord length 12 m. Fig. 3.1 gives the geometrical 
details of Road Hump.

Trapezoidal Humps
A hump, which constitutes a 50 to 100 mm raised, flat section of a carriageway with ramps 
on both sides is called a trapezoidal hump. If designed correctly, the discomfort is moderate 
for cars, whereas lorries and buses must pass very slowly. Fig. 3.2 gives geometric details of 
trapezoidal hump for various speed and also the speeds at which the buses may reasonably 
pass the individual humps. If buses must be able to pass at speeds of 35 and 40 km/h 
respectively, ramp lengths must be 3.3 and 4.0 m, and gradients 3.0 and 2.5 per cent 
respectively

3.1.2	
Speed Bumps
Precast, ready to install bumps are available and are being fixed on the road. These bumps 
can be nailed to the pavement. In high speed environment, these bumps prove to be traffic 
hazard. Once the bumps get damaged by repeated striking of traffic movement, the nail 
remains on the pavement and prove to be damaging the tyres of vehicle. Therefore, its usage 
is recommended for local and collector streets.

Speed Table/Raised Pedestrian Crossing
In a road section having substantial pedestrian crossing, raised pedestrian crossing called 
Speed Table is a solution, where vertical deflection can be achieved to reduce traffic speed 
and flat topped portion for pedestrian to cross. Fig. 3.6 gives the geometrical details of a 
Speed Table.

3.1.4	
Uneven Road Surface and Stone Set Pavement
Uneven road surface or stone set pavement as shown in Fig. 3.7 is another way of reducing 
speed. By changing the surface texture, speed get reduced due to discomfort. The kind of 
accidents generally occur with speed breakers and speed humps with vertical shift generally 
do not occur that with uneven road surface or that with stone set pavement.
Fig. 3.7 Uneven Road Surface in IIT Delhi
3.2 	
Horizontal Deflections
Horizontal shifts in the carriageway are less effective than vertical ones in achieving reductions 
in speed, however their impact is significantly increased when used in combination with a 
vertical shift. Horizontal shifts are generally gained through chicanes. The speed reducing 
impact of chicanes is reduced if the measure has to allow for the passage of Heavy Good 
Vehicles (HGVs), wherein the wider carriageway catered for HGV allows car drivers to take a 
“racing line”. The use of stone sets or similar treatment can be useful in allowing the passage 
of large vehicles while discouraging cars. Chicanes significantly reduce parking spaces and 
should therefore be avoided if spaces are at a premium. Additionally, they should not be 
dependent upon parked cars for their effect. Horizontal deflection by chicane shall always be 
provided with hazardous markings and retro-reflective hazard markers to make the chicane 
conspicuous at all time as shown in Fig. 3.8

3.3	
Road Narrowing
Road narrowing may be considered as another supportive measure to vertical deflections. 
Although it cannot be considered as a speed reducing device; it acts as a reminder or 
encouragement to drive slowly or calmly. Narrowing the carriageway at specific locations, 
for example in combination with speed tables, is an effective way of combining measures to 
increase their effect. The extra space created by road narrowing is generally used to provide 
widened footpath.
3.4	
Central Islands
Providing Central Island in a undivided carriageway in an urban street is an effective measure, 
which would not only reduce the speed, but serve as refuge space for pedestrian. However, 
care shall be exercised to provided reasonably bigger and wider island at centre to place a 
hazard marker sign and shall be protected with marking.
Fig. 3.9 Road Narrowing from Center
3.5	
Supporting Measures
A number of supporting measures are commonly used to back up the speed reducing 
techniques. The use of different surface materials, the planting of trees and the use of street 
furniture falls into this category. However, as independent measures they generally have little 
effect on traffic speeds.

Traffic Calming at Road Junctions
3.6.1	
Vertical Deflections
Raised junction areas, and flat top road humps are effective speed reducing measures at 
junctions. Treatment of junction corners by the use of an uneven road surface is useful for 
slowing down turning traffic, particularly HGVs, however this has no effect on vehicles going 
straight ahead.
3.6.2	
Changes in Slignment
This technique involves narrowing the carriageway in the vicinity of a junction so that all 
moves through the junction have to deviate from a straight-ahead path. This measure is 
effective in reducing the speed of straight through traffic; however junction priorities may 
become confused, when the boundaries of the junction are less recognizable.
3.6.3	
Reduction of the Junction Area
The area of a junction may be reduced by building out the footways. This is carried out on 
junction corners at crossroads or T-junctions. In addition, the footway may be built out along 
the straight at a T-junction. In an urban junction having considerable pedestrian crossing, 
built out can be provided to prevent free left turn as many times, turning traffic generally do 
not give way for pedestrian to cross.

3.6.4	
Pedestrian Refuge
The provision of islands on the approaches to a junction has only a limited effect on vehicle 
speeds. They will however improve the situation for pedestrians by creating a refuge, although 
by reducing the amount of carriageway they may hinder large vehicles when turning.
3.6.5	
Special Junction Forms
Roundabouts and mini roundabouts may be useful in reducing traffic speeds at junctions. 
The latter is suitable when available space is limited, however, if no vertical elements are 
placed on the island the speed reducing effect will be more limited. A ramped area around a 
central island allows large vehicles more turning space.

Traffic Calming on Main Roads
In a main road, changes in (surface) level are often regarded as unacceptable, thereby 
eliminating the use of vertical shifts. Without vertical shift, the potential for achieving 
slower traffic and reduction in accidents is significantly reduced. Transverse bar marking 
an alternative in such main road, where vertical deflection might lead to speed breaker hit 
accidents. Fig. 3.14 gives alternatives with traverse bar markings of 5 mm and Fig. 3.15 
with transverse bar marking of 15 mm at the boundary of speed zone. Since bar marking 
with 15 mm demands speed reduction, a set of “SLOW” marking shall be given immediately 
before markings, at 20 m and 40 m from bar marking.

Common techniques employed on main roads in urban areas include:
	
•	
Road narrowing
	
•	
Islands
	
•	
Tree planting
Techniques used to control traffic using traffic signals include holding back traffic on a radial 
to avoid saturating downstream junctions. Applying this technique to a main radial as part 
of an area wide traffic calming scheme could be used to reduce queuing along the calmed 
length of road. Physical speed reducing measures would be required to prevent traffic from 
speeding up once the restraining effect of the congestion was removed. In addition, this 
technique may increase rat running.
When signaled junctions are relatively close together they may be linked to provide a “green 
wave” for main traffic movements. This linking may also be used to achieve a “calm” driving 
speed of 40 km/h. Drivers exceeding the linking speed would hit a red light and would have 
to wait for the other traffic to catch up. Regular road users would soon realize the benefits of 
driving at the appropriate linking speed.

Traffic Management Measures
3.8.1	
Traffic Management on Links
As a traffic calming measure, road closures and one-way streets are regarded as a last resort 
as they restrict the choice of routes available for local access traffic. However, they can be 
very effective in removing through traffic. Problems may arise if turning heads become used 
as parking areas. If the link is too narrow to allow the construction of a turning head, a road 
closure would be generally inappropriate.

Several measures are available to create road closures for general traffic while retaining 
access for buses and/or cyclists. Raised or lowered cushions allow buses to pass unhindered, 
while the latter will prevent the passage of narrower vehicles.
3.8.2	
Traffic Management at Junctions
In general, these measures all allow access for cyclists to be retained. Techniques include 
local road narrowing in the vicinity of the closure, the use of different surface materials, and 
adequate provision of posts at the closure to prevent motorists driving across the islands.

4 Traffic Calming on Rural Roads (Highways)
National and State Highways together carry more than 70 per cent of the total road traffic in 
India and safety has become a major concern on these roads. This challenge is accentuated 
when these highway roads pass through villages and towns. The local traffic and activities 



======================================================================
PAGE 43 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:99-2018
35
around the highways slow down the speeds of the through traffic and often cause congestion 
during the day. However, low levels of local traffic allow the through traffic to move at much 
higher speeds, thereby create safety hazard for the locals.
In light of this, any intervention aimed at upgrading the NH & SH sections in such areas must 
balance the seemingly contradictory objectives - safe environment for the vulnerable road 
users within local communities as well as unhindered and swift movement for through traffic. 
Towns and villages in these areas are of different sizes and densities (depending the local 
region) and the local traffic typically comprises of slow moving vehicles like bicycles, animal 
carts, tractors and pedestrians. The volume and speeds of these modes are at huge variance 
and have to interact with long distance high speed inter-city traffic. Since the highways are 
accessible through local roads, intersection create situations for conflicts and accidents.
4.1 	
Demarcation of Traffic Calming Zones on NH and SH
NH-SH may pass through urban or rural area which demands different treatment due to 
variation in density and land use patterns as listed below:
4.1.1 	
Rural Areas
Villages are characterized by low density scattered development. Only a few roads intersect 
or meet the highway. However, if the highway passes through the village, there is bound 
to have pedestrian movement across and along the highway. The low volume of cross 
movement does not give enough inducement to the speeding traffic on the highway to slow 
down. Hence, there is a justification for traffic calming measures in rural areas. Length of the 
corridor needing traffic calming measure may vary from 100 m to 1 km in case of villages.
4.1.2 	
Special Area Zoning
Areas within a built up areas may require special traffic calming measures for additional safety. 
Areas near a school or a hospital require absolutely low speeds. School children are more 
prone to commit mistakes while negotiating with highway traffic. Hence, it is recommended 
that vehicles should travel at maximum speeds of 25 kmph near schools and 30 km/h near 
hospitals.
4.1.3 	
Urban Areas
Cities and towns are characterized by high-density built-up area with commercial development 
along the major roads and highways. There is an official boundary defined by the municipality. 
However, for the purposes of traffic calming on the section where cross movements on the 
highway are caused by the density of roadside development, there is a need to define the 
boundary where the density falls abruptly. There may be several city roads intersecting the 
highway. Several intersections, both signalized and non-signalized, may be present inside 
the urban area. The volume of local traffic and the traffic management at intersections 
itself act as a deterrent to high speeds. Hence they largely contribute to traffic calming by 
themselves. The most important issue in urban area is to ensure smooth flow of through 
traffic at an acceptable speed of 30-40 kmph. Often the volume of local traffic and road side 



======================================================================
PAGE 44 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:99-2018
36
activities do not permit this at peak hours and the section becomes very unsafe at night 
when traffic moves above 70 kmph. This problem exists in small towns also where the urban 
corridor can be 1-5 kms long. The NH-SH section passing through such urban areas has 
to be treated like an urban arterial having service roads for local traffic and safe pedestrian 
crossing including pedestrian refuge areas at every 100-200 m as per the local need to 
ensure safety of pedestrians.
4.2 	
Demarcation of Zones for Traffic Calming Measures
The areas where the NH & SH roads pass through the villages typically have a scattered 
patterns of development and the low and erratic levels of pedestrian crossing movements 
do not produce enough signals for the approaching vehicles to slow down in time. In order 
to deal with this, there should be buffer zones with a demarcated boundary and the vehicles 
should decelerate gradually as they come near the zone. The extent of this zone may vary 
from 100 m to 1 km depending on the local density and intensity of the land use in the area.
Speed breakers have not proven to be effective in such situations. These have zones of 
influence of not more than 70-80 m around them and hence are ineffective in maintaining 
low vehicle speeds in the entire conflict zone. In case these are not well designed, they can 
seriously damage the vehicles at night especially the ones with lower chassis heights.
The approach would for gradual and informed deceleration of vehicles to safe speeds and 
then sustaining those speeds through visual and tactile warning signs. The total length 
wherein potential conflict is high should be kept optimum to command respect from through 
traffic. On approach at a distance 500 m to 750 m, the transition speed limit sign could be 
installed, which could be repeated and also with other warning sign as shown in Fig. 4.1. The 
Table 4.1 gives recommended speed from boundary of speed zone.

Demarcation of Traffic Calming Zones at Road Junctions
In case of minor roads joining the highway, it is not financially feasible to provide a signalised 
intersection. Often, yellow or red warning lights are not respected by the fast through traffic 
on low volume roads. Traffic-calming measures offer appropriate solutions for such sections 
because these are self-enforcing and comparatively cheaper than signalization.
Traffic calming measures at junctions (NH-SH, NH-ODR etc.) should be recommended in the 
context of appropriate road hierarchy. Smooth flow of traffic should be maintained at a safe 
speed on the higher category of road. The junctions may be categorized into two different 
types:
	
I.	
T-junctions
	
II.	
4-armed intersections
The status of the minor road vis-à-vis the major road is an important parameter in determining 
the zone of conflict. The hierarchy of the minor road calls for different traffic calming measures. 
Three cases are discussed below:
4.3.1 	
Case I: NH/SH Meeting NH
Most of the times this would be a major intersection point with either traffic police or 
signalization equipments installed to control the traffic flow. The presence of a large volume 
of traffic itself gives rise to several commercial activities which requires adequate visual and 
tactile queues for the driver on the highway to slow down. Nevertheless, it is still advisable 
to treat the minor road with adequate traffic calming measure so that the speed of approach 
is considerably reduced. The area of influence on the main road needs to be demarcated for 
appropriate treatment to reduce the speed to acceptable limits.
4.3.2 	
Case II: MDR Meeting NH/SH
Such roads usually connects important villages, village mandis (markets) and other important 
nodes in the region. Further they are often unmanned and rarely signalised. It is important 
that traffic-calming measures are installed on the minor road leading to the national highways 
or the state highway. The major road should also be treated visually to sensitise the drivers 
about the approaching intersection.



======================================================================
PAGE 46 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:99-2018
38
4.3.3	
Case III: ODR Meeting NH/SH
This junction is more vulnerable to conflicts. Having a low traffic volume on the minor road 
results in fewer activities at the intersections. Thus such junctions remain inconspicuous from 
a distance on the major road. Hence, vehicles approaching from the minor road need to slow 
down to “dead speed” before they can find gaps on the major road. The visibility of the major 
roads should also be high. This helps the driver to make appropriate decisions on the gaps. 
The measures to reduce chances of conflict would include visual warning on the major road 
with rumble strips and pre-warners and speed breakers on the minor roads. Since these 
crossings could be far more in number than the other two mentioned above, it is not feasible 
to cause a substantial speed reduction on the major road instead it is important to reduce the 
speeds of the vehicles on the minor roads and suggest zonal speeds of 45-50 kmph on the 
major road. This would be enough for the vehicles travelling on the minor road to manoeuvre 
and find gaps in the traffic stream.
4.3.4	
ODR meets Highway in a T-junction
In this case the vehicle on the major road is made to gradually decrease its speed to 45-
50 km/h before it resumes to a higher speed on the major road.

Checklists for Traffic Calming Treatment
Traffic calming treatment on NH and SH corridors passing through towns and villages is 
dependent on the following factors:
	
•	
Variation in day time and night time traffic volume
	
•	
Variation in local traffic activities in day time and night time
	
•	
Day time speeds vs night time speeds of vehicular traffic
	
•	
Local needs of pedestrian crossings and other activities



======================================================================

Seven different situations can be identified to address the TC requirement on NH and SH 
corridors.
4.4.1	
Safety Management on Highway Corridors passing through Desolate Areas
	
•	
Apart from providing delineators and paved shoulders, no special treatment 
needs to be provided to improve safety of straight corridor highway stretches 
passing through desolate areas. However, at intersections (of these 
highways) with village roads, visual and physical warning signs in the form 
of speed limit signs and rumble strips should be provided to drivers in those 
areas.
	
•	
Speed breakers should be provided on intersecting village roads to bring 
down the vehicular speeds to 30 km/h or below at the intersection.
	
•	
In case of undivided highways in junction, splitter and channelizing islands 
shall be provided with hazard signs and markings. Junctions shall be provided 
with information sign and markings with road studs. The visibility funnel shall 
be kept encumbrance free.
4.4.2	
Speed Management on Highways passing through Agricultural Fields
Vehicular traffic on highways passing through agricultural fields conflicts with crossing of 
pedestrian, cattle and farm-vehicle traffic.
	
•	
Service lanes should be provided on both sides of the highway to segregate 
this traffic from the traffic on the highway. Warning and speed limit signs 
should be provided on the highway before each opening in the service lane. 
	
•	
In case of undivided highways, where space does not permit construction of 
segregated service lanes, 1 to 1.5 m wide mountable median and a minimum 
of 1.5 m wide footpath on both sides of the highway may be provided 
throughout the corridor, to act as refuge for crossing pedestrian and cattle 
traffic, along with sign posts enforcing a speed limit of 50 km/hr.
	
•	
At intersections with minor roads, warning signs should be provided on 
intersecting roads, indicating, speed limit of 50 km/hr on highway and 
30 km/hr on the minor roads along with ‘intersection ahead’ warning signs. 
Apart from these, physical devices such as rumble strips on highway and 
speed breakers on the minor roads should be used to warn the driver of 
the approaching intersection. For visual impact, the intersection may be 
provided with a change of texture and color. The visibility funnel shall be kept 
encumbrance free.
4.4.3	
Speed Management on Highways passing through Industrial Areas
Industrial areas generate a lot of demand for parking of heavy goods vehicles.
	
•	
Highways passing through these stretches should be provided with a 
minimum 6 m wide service lane, segregated from the main carriageway by a 
footpath/median and/or paved shoulders on both sides of the road.



======================================================================
PAGE 48 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:99-2018
40
	
•	
In case of undivided highways, mountable median may be provided 
throughout the corridor with gaps aligned with the openings in the service 
lane. Highway traffic should be warned in advance of crossing vehicular 
traffic at these openings in the medians and the service lane. Speed limit 
and warning sign boards should be provided and also rumble strips and 
rumble areas. Wherever space constraint does not permit the construction 
of service lanes, a minimum of 2.5 m wide paved shoulders and 1.5 m wide 
footpath should be provided on both sides of the highway.
	
•	
Raised pedestrian crossings should be provided on highways (along with 
warning signs for vehicular traffic) wherever high cross pedestrian traffic is 
expected.
4.4.4	
Traffic Calming Treatment on Highway Corridors passing through Residential/
Commercial Areas
Residential and commercial areas, generate a lot of demand for cross-pedestrian, cattle and 
vehicular traffic.
	
•	
Highway traffic approaching such an area should be warned, using gates at 
the entry of the zone, with the name and length of the village/town corridor 
marked on it. Speed limit signs (40 km/hr) should also be posted at these 
locations along with rumble strips as a physical warning measure.
	
•	
In case of undivided highways, a 1.2 m wide mountable median may be 
provided throughout the length of the corridor, with gaps wherever required. 
These gaps at intersections with minor roads or service lane entries should be 
treated distinctly from the rest of the carriageway. Texture and colour change 
treatment should be applied (along with flashing beacon where cross traffic 
is more). To alert drivers of cross traffic at these locations, advance warning 
signs should be posted along the highway indicating change of speed limit 
to 30 km/hr. Rumble strips may also be provided on the roads approaching 
the intersections along with advance warning sign boards indicating ‘rumble 
strips ahead’.
	
•	
In addition, minor roads should be provided with road humps to bring down 
vehicular speed to 30 km/hr at the intersection, along with advance warning 
signs indicating ‘road hump ahead’.
	
•	
All schools, hospitals and institutional areas along the highway, should 
be provided with raised pedestrian crossings at every 100-150 m. These 
crossings should be accompanied by advance warning signs stating ‘speed 
breaker ahead’, ‘school/hospital area’ and 30 km/hr speed limit.
	
•	
In case of high-density corridors where setback from the highway is less 
than 6 m, traffic calming devices should be used to restrict corridor speed 
between 30 to 50 km/hr.
	
•	
2.5 m wide continuous paved shoulders should be provided along with 
minimum 1.5 m wide raised footpaths on both sides of the highway.

4.4.5	
Traffic Calming Treatment of Rail-Road Intersection on Highways
	
•	
Highway traffic approaching a rail-road intersection be warned, visually, 
using 30 km/hr speed limits signs, ‘rail-road crossing ahead’ warning sign as 
well by bright street lighting at the intersection, and physically, using rumble 
strips and speed breakers on both sides of the crossing.
	
•	
In case of undivided highways, a 100 to 200 m long (based on queuing 
length at the location) mountable median should be provided on both sides 
of the crossing.
	
•	
The gates at the rail road crossing should be provided with a retro-reflective 
signs along with flashing beacons for better visibility at night.
4.4.6	
Traffic Calming Treatment of Bridges on Highways
	
•	
Highway traffic approaching bridges on highway should be warned through 
sign posts, indicating ‘Bridge Ahead’. Apart from these, advance indication 
should also be given using signposts and road markings, of 50 km/hr speed 
limit, and ‘no overtaking zone’.
	
•	
Rumble strips should be used to physically warn the drivers on approach to 
the narrow bridges.
	
•	
Reflective studs should be used to highlight lane markings on the bridge.
4.4.7	
Traffic Calming Treatment on Hill Roads
Bends on hill roads may be provided with delineators. A continuous lane marking should 
be maintained throughout the corridor, using thermoplastic paint as well reflective studs. 
Signposts indicating corridor speed limit of 30-40 km/h should be provided at regular intervals. 
Hazardous locations should be provided with advance warning signs.
