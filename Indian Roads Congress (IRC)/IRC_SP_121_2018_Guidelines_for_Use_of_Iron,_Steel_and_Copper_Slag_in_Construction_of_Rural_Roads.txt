Guidelines for use of Iron, Steel and Copper Slag 
In Construction of Rural Roads
PART A : IRON AND STEEL SLAG
1 INTRODUCTION
The challenges related to the utilization of Steel Making Slag (SMS) slag were discussed 
during the meeting of NITI Aayog and it was decided that Indian Roads Congress (IRC)/
Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) need to look into the matter and include 
processed SMS slag in Indian standards for road making in line with the practices adopted 
in other countries. Accordingly,the task of preparation of IRC:SP:121-2018 “Guidelines 
for Use of Iron, Steel and Copper Slag in Construction of Rural Roads” was taken up by 
the Rural Roads Committee (H-5). The draft was prepared by the sub-group headed by 
Dr. I.K. Pateriya, comprising of Prof. (Dr.) U.C. Sahoo, Prof. (Dr.) K. Sudhakar Reddy, Dr. Vasant 
G. Havanagi, Shri Satish Pandey, Prof. (Dr.) G.J. Joshi and Prof. (Dr.) Mahabir Panda. Further, 
inputs were received from Shri Sunil Singal (Representative of SAIL), Shri S.M.R. Prasad 
(Representative of JSW Steel), Shri Ujjal Chakraborty (Representative of Tata Steel) and 
Shri R.N. Bhattacharya (Representative of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant). This draft was deliberated 
in several meetings of H-5 Committee and was finalized in its meeting held on 4th October, 2017. 
The revised draft was considered by the Highways Specifications and Standards Committee 
(HSS) in its meeting held on 13th October, 2017. The Council in its 213th meeting held on 3rd 
November, 2017 at Bengaluru considered and authorized Executive Committee to take final 
call about printing of this document. The Executive Committee deliberated this document in its 
various meetings and approved the same for printing in its meeting held on 26.06.2018.

India is the 3rd largest producer of steel in the world with a production of 101 MT and a capacity 
of 125 MT in 2017. Iron and steel slags are by-products generated during manufacturing of pig 
iron and steel respectively. Apart from the iron or Blast Furnace Slag (BFS) that is obtained 
from the production of pig iron, based on the process of production, the major categories of 
steel slags produced in India are Basic Oxygen Furnace Slag (BOFS) and Electric Arc Furnace 
Slag (EAFS). In an integrated steel plant, 2-4 tonnes of wastes are generated for every tonne 
of steel produced in different forms (i.e. solid, liquid and gas). The amount of slag depends on 
composition of raw materials and the type of furnace. Typically, ore containing 60 to 65% iron, 
BF slag production ranges between 300 and 540 kg per tonne of pig iron produced, whereas up 
to 200 kg of slag is generated per tonne of liquid steel. Lower grade ores yield much higher slag 
fractions. Fig. 1 presents a flow diagram of slag production process.
Fig. 1  Typical Slag Production Process (Yildirim and Prezzi, 2011)
For an eco-friendly environment, the major concerns of today are to pay adequate emphasis 
on minimisation of waste generation, recycling and re-use of waste, and minimise the adverse 
impact of waste disposals. The amount of slag generated from these plants is so large that its 
management has become a critical component. With increasing capacities, the mechanism for 
disposal of large quantities of slag has also gained traction for steel makers. Over the last few 
years, due to better understanding of various properties of slags, its use in different forms has

led to significant reduction in the volume of slag generated. However, slag generation remains 
inevitable and its utilization remains one of the most serious concerns that need redressal.
1.1	
Blast Furnace Slag
The slag produced from the blast furnace during production of pig iron is called blast furnace slag. 
This is a non-metallic product consisting primarily of silicates, alumina-silicates, and calcium-
alumina-silicates. The molten slag comprises about 20 per cent by mass of iron production. In 
the blast furnace, the slag floating over molten pig iron is flushed out and then cooled. Depending 
on the cooling process, different types of slags are generated as required for various end-
use consumers. Although, the chemical composition of slag may remain unchanged, physical 
properties vary widely with the changing process of cooling. Three types of slags are generated, 
namely, air-cooled slag, granulated slag and expanded slag as shown in Fig. 2.
Fig. 2  Production of BF Slag Based on the Cooling Method
1.1.1	
Air-Cooled Blast Furnace Slag (ACBFS)
ACBFS is produced by cooling the molten slag under atmospheric conditions. Under controlled 
cooling, the slag tends to be hard and dense and it develops pozzolanic properties, which is suitable 
for use in granular base, hot mix asphalt, Portland cement concrete, and other applications. Using 
conventional aggregate processing equipment, this material can be crushed and screened to meet 
the specified gradation requirements. Special quality control measures may be required to address 
the lack of consistency in some properties such as gradation, specific gravity, and absorption. ACBFS 
does not require weathering as it does not contain free lime. Fig. 3 shows the crushed ACBFS.

IRC:SP:121-2018

1.1.2	
Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GBFS) and Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag 
(GGBFS)
GBFS is produced by sudden cooling or quenching of the molten slag using high-pressure 
water jets. This process results in the formation of sand size fragments (as shown in 
Fig. 4), usually with some friable clinker like material. The physical structure and gradation of 
granulated slag depends on the chemical composition of the slag, its temperature at the time of 
quenching, and the method of production.
Fig. 4  Granulated Blast Furnace Slag
When crushed or milled to fine powder, it is called ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), 
which has cementitious properties that makes it suitable for partial replacement for or additive 
to Portland cement.
1.1.3	
Expanded Blast Furnace Slag
Expanded slag is formed through controlled cooling of molten slag in water or water with 
combination of steam and compressed air. Formation of steam and other gases enhances 
the porosity and vesicular nature of slag, resulting in light weight aggregate suitable for use in 
lightweight concrete masonry, lightweight ready-mix concrete and lightweight precast concrete 
besides cement manufacturing. This type of slag is not usually preferred for road construction.
1.2	
Steel Slag
Steel slag is produced from the steel making process. The calcined lime used as flux combines 
with the silicates, aluminium oxides, magnesium oxides, manganese oxides and ferrites to form 
the steel slag. This is cooled in a cooling yard with air and sprinkling of water. Depending on 
the type of furnace used for manufacture of steel, the major categories of steel slag produced in 
India are Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) and Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) slag. Steel slag contains 
about 10 to 20 per cent by mass of metallic iron, and is recovered by magnetic separation. The 
metal free slag is crushed and screened to different sizes for use as aggregates. The vesicular 
nature of surface of slag particles promotes good particle interlock and high shear strength.

1.2.1	
Basic Oxygen Furnace Slag (BOFS)
In basic oxygen furnace, the carbon-rich molten pig iron is converted into steel by blowing 
oxygen through the molten pig iron that lowers the carbon content of the alloy and changes into 
low carbon steel. The steel slags are processed through series of steps involving cooling, metal 
recovery, crushing, screening, weathering and stockpiling. This is finally referred as “Processed 
Steel Slag” as shown in Fig. 5.
Fig. 5  Processed Basic Oxygen Furnace Slag
Volumetric stability in the BOFS is a major concern, which occurs mainly due to the presence of 
free magnesium oxide (MgO) and lime (CaO) that hydrates expansively in presence of water. 
Therefore, before utilizing as road making aggregate, this slag needs to be treated or weathered 
(natural or accelerated) to decrease the volume instability. In natural weathering process, the 
steel slag is stockpiled for a period up to six months under normal atmospheric conditions before 
use as road aggregates.
1.2.2	
Electric Arc Furnace Slag (EAFS)
EAFS is a strong, dense and non-porous aggregate that is cubical in shape. This type of slag 
bears good resistance to polishing and has an excellent affinity to bitumen. This makes it an 
ideal aggregate for bituminous surface materials and road surface treatments as it produces 
materials that are resistant to deformation (rutting), safe and durable. Fig. 6 presents an image 
of processed EAFS.

1.3	
Chemical Composition and Engineering Properties
BF slag and steel slag can be primarily differentiated by the iron content. In BF slag, FeO is 
around 0.70%, whereas in case of steel slag, total iron content varies from 16 to 25%. The 
chemical composition of GBFS and steel slag generated from various steel plants in India are 
given in Table 1.

value is found to be marginally higher in some of the samples. However, it is expected to have no 
adverse effect on performance of road pavement made using ACBFS. Water absorption is found 
higher than the prescribed limit but ACBFS slag aggregates were found satisfying soundness 
test requirements.

Slag Utilization
Slags, based on their types, have a wide scope for use in different areas. The ACBFS is usually 
crushed, screened and mainly used as aggregate in subbase, base and asphalt layers and as 
concrete aggregate. GBFS is mainly used in sub-base and base layers as fine aggregates and 
also as replacement of natural sand on many occasions. GGBFS is mostly used as a pozzolanic 
material in production of Portland Slag Cement (PSC). In conjunction with lime (as an activator), 
this can also be used as a soil stabiliser.
2 SLAG AS PAVEMENT MATERIAL
Pavement materials must meet the desired specifications to ensure adequate performance. 
Unbound materials develop (shear) strength through particle interlock and have no significant 
tensile strength. The usual distress modes are deformation through shear and densification 
and also disintegration through particle breakdown. Performance of pavements using slag in 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:121-2018
10
unbound layers is highly dependent on the angularity and shear resistance of the constituent 
particles. Bound materials develop shear strength through chemical bonding as well as particle 
interlock and have significant tensile strength. For design parameters, refer IRC:37.
Slag in different forms has potential to be used in pavement construction for rural roads. Various 
slag products may be used in different pavement layers (either bound or unbound) as:
i)	
Aggregates for Unbound Granular Layers (i.e. Granular Subbase and Base)
ii)	
Aggregates for Asphalt Layers
iii)	
Aggregates for Concrete Pavement
iv)	
Stabiliser for Bound Subbase and Base

Note 2: Dimensions indicated above are for illustration only. 
Actual dimensions should be as per design of pavement
Fig. 7  Typical Cross Section of Rural Road with Steel and Iron Slag in Different Layers
2.1	
Slag as Sub-base Material
ACBFS and weathered steel slag can be used as coarse aggregate for the construction of 
subbase after crushing and screening to meet the gradation requirements. Crushed slag should 
meet the specifications given in clause 405 of MoRD Specifications. Some industries are now 
producing processed BOFS, which can be readily used for subbase construction. A typical 
gradation of the processed steel slag is given in Fig. 8.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:121-2018
11
GBFS can also partially replace the fine aggregates to meet the specified gradation for sub base 
construction. GBFS alone can also be used as sub base material provided that it meets the 
strength requirement. GBFS possesses pozzolanic property and, therefore, can be stabilised 
along with lime for construction of stabilised subbase layers. Fig. 9 presents use of slag in 
subbase layer in a PMGSY road in Odisha, whose performance is found to be very good.
Fig. 9  Use of Steel Slag in Subbase Course in a PMGSY Road
2.2	
Slag as a Base Material
For construction of granular base layer, ACBFS can be used as coarse aggregates after crushing, 
screening and adding fines to meet the specified gradation. Crushed slag usually contains very 
few fines to meet the particle size distribution specified for dense graded bases, which can be 
complied by the addition of stone dust from another crushing operation. Alternatively, a blend of 
20 mm down crushed ACBFS (80%) and 20% GBFS can be used for base course construction. 
An activator such as lime (1–3%) or lime/fly ash (1–3%) can be used for a more rapid initial set. 
Processed steel slag manufactured by some industries can also be used in the base course.
2.3	
Slag Materials in Asphalt Construction
Both steel slag and blast furnace slag have been successfully used in asphalt constructions. 
For low volume roads, slag aggregates satisfy the requirements for use in surface dressing 
and premix carpet applications. Steel slag is preferred due to its better strength, abrasion and 
impact resistance compared to blast furnace slags. Some of the important characteristics of slag 
aggregates are given below:
●	
Better skid resistance due to a higher friction value
●	
Higher density of steel slag (typically 20% denser than traditional material)
●	
Cubical shape and high percentage of fractured faces ensuring good mechanical 
interlock
●	
Higher affinity to bitumen and therefore lower stripping value
For materials selection in case of surface dressing reference may be made to the MoRD 
Specifications. Table 5 gives a broad indication of the uses of blast furnace, steel slags in 
construction and maintenance of rural roads.

Iron and steel slag being vesicular material (as shown in Fig. 10) requires higher binder content 
for surface coating. Therefore, whenever it is used for bituminous surfacing, the binder content 
should be increased by 0.5 % over the normal quantity given in MoRD Specification for different 
applications.

3 STABILISATION USING SLAG
GBFS and GGBFS can be used as binders for chemical stabilisation of soils, gravel and 
crushed rock. This may be used for construction of lightly and heavily bound structural layers 
for the pavements. One of the major benefits of using slag in stabilisation is the slow rate of the 
cementation process. The pavement material can be reworked up to two days after initial mixing, 
without much affecting the final strength. This enables the user to go for longer hauling distances 
and temporary stockpiling of the material before use.
Elastic Modulus and Poisson’s Ratio are important input for mechanistic design of the pavements. 
Modulus for these bound materials is usually determined using a relationship between Unconfined 
Compressive Strength (UCS) and Modulus as given in IRC:37 (Eq.1).
	
E = 1000 × UCS
… (1)
Where,	
E = Elastic Modulus (MPa), and
	
UCS = Unconfined Compressive Strength (MPa) after 28 days of curing.
For cementitious sub base and base, the minimum UCS value after 7 days of curing, specified by 
IRC:SP:72 are 1.7 MPa and 3.0 MPa respectively. Eq. 1 results in a modulus values in the range 
of 2000 to 3000 MPa for sub base and 4000 to 5000 MPa for base. Since, the sub-base acts as a 
platform for the heavy construction traffic, low strength cemented sub-base is expected to crack 
during construction and a design value of 600 MPa is recommended for the stress analysis. For 
base course, the long term modulus of the cemented layer may be taken as fifty per cent of the 
initial modulus due to shrinkage cracks and construction traffic. A value of 0.25 may be taken as 
Poisson’s Ratio for such layers. Design of pavements with bound bases and sub bases for rural 
roads may be done following the guidelines given in IRC:SP:72.
Both GBFS and GGBFS require an activator such as lime or cement to achieve their strength potential. 
It is observed that UCS value increases with an increase in the lime/GGBFS ratio, increased curing 
period and temperature. A binder (GGBFS) content of 6% with replacement by lime of 20% or 30% 
(of the GGBFS content) results in optimum strength. Pavement layers/embankments constructed 
on floodplains can be made durable with the application of GGBFS activated by lime. BOFS fines 
are more effective in stabilising the coarser-grained, less hydrophilic soils.
4 SLAGS IN CEMENT CONCRETE PAVEMENTS
ACBFS aggregate is one of the most commonly used reclaimed construction materials, being 
used as coarse aggregate in cement concrete. It should be kept in mind that slag aggregate 
should not be directly substituted for conventional aggregate in an existing concrete mix, rather 
the mix should be specifically designed based on ACBFS’s lighter weight and higher water 
absorption. The higher the density, the higher the suitability of the aggregate for use as an 
aggregate in paving concrete. It may be added that the Japanese standards sets a minimum 
oven-dry density of 24 kN/m3 for BF slag aggregates to be used in normal concrete applications.
4.1	
Characteristics of Slag Aggregates
The characteristics of ACBFS in terms of particle shape, density, surface texture, durability, 
strength and hardness need to be understood for concrete mix design with slag aggregates.  It 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:121-2018

is important to pre-wet the aggregates as it absorbs water and this condition be maintained prior 
to batching.
IS:383 (2016) guidelines may be referred for use of slag aggregates in cement concrete. Maximum 
percentage of slag aggregate, which can be used for PCC and lean concrete are given in Table 6.

For slag aggregates, following additional tests shall be carried out:
a)	
Iron unsoundness- When chemical analysis of aggregates shows that the ferrous 
oxide content is equal to or more than 3 per cent, and sulphur content is equal to 
or more than 1 per cent, the aggregate shall be tested for iron unsoundness. The 
iron unsoundness of the slag aggregate when tested as per the procedure given in 
Annexure-I, shall not exceed 1 per cent.
b)	
Volumetric expansion ratio - It shall not be more than 2 per cent. The procedure shall 
be as given in Annexure-I.
c)	
Unsoundness due to free lime- Prior to use of iron slag (for production of aggregates) 
from a new source or when significant changes in furnace chemistry occur in an existing 
source which may result in the presence of free lime, the potential for pop-out formation 
shall be assessed by determining the free-lime content of the slag by petrographic 
examination or quantitative x-ray diffractometry on a representative sample.
Detailed test procedures are provided in Annexure-I.
If the number of particles containing free lime exceeds 1 in 20, then weathering of the slag 
stockpile (in moist condition or at/near saturated surface dry condition) represented by the test 
sample shall be continued until further testing shows that the level has fallen below 1 in 20.
4.2	
Mix Design
Due to the difference in various properties of blast furnace slag compared to conventional 
aggregates, standard mix design procedure should not be applied directly for slag aggregates. To 
improve workability of slag aggregate mixes, a larger proportion of fine sand may be incorporated.

Test Procedures as per IS:383-2016
A1	
DETERMINATION OF IRON UNSOUNDNESS FOR SLAG AGGREGATES
1.	
Some slags containing more than 3 per cent Ferrous Oxide (FeO) will disintegrate on 
immersion in water when the Sulphur (S) content of the slag is 1 per cent or more. Aggregates 
derived from such slags show iron unsoundness.
2.	
PROCEDURE
Take at random two test samples of not less than 50 pieces each of aggregate passing 40 mm 
and retained on 20 mm IS sieve. Immerse the pieces of first sample in distilled or deionized 
water at room temperature for a period of 14 days. Remove the pieces from the water at the end 
of the 14 days period and examine them.
3.	
CRITERIA FOR CONFORMITY
If no piece develops the following unsoundness during the storage period, the slag aggregate 
shall be deemed to be free from iron unsoundness:
	
a)	
Cracking (development of a visible crack),
	
b)	
Disintegration (physical breakdown of aggregate particle),
	
c)	
Shaling (development of fretting or cleavage of the aggregate particle), or
	
d)	
Craze cracking at the surface of the aggregate.
The second test sample shall be tested, if any of the pieces (in the above sample) shows cracking, 
disintegration, shaling or craze cracking at the surface of the aggregate. lf not more than one 
in hundred pieces (1 per cent) of the two test samples tested shows cracking, disintegration, 
shaling or craze cracking at the surface of the aggregate, the slag shall be regarded as free from 
iron unsoundness.
A2	
DETERMINATION OF VOLUMETRIC EXPANSION RATIO OF SLAG AGGREGATES
1.	
This test specifies the procedure to calculate the volumetric expansion ratio for the 
evaluation of the potential expansion of aggregates like steel slag due to hydration 
reactions. This method can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of weathering 
processes for reducing the expansive potential of such aggregate materials.
2.	
APPARATUS AND TOOLS
	
a)	
Moulds with base plate, stay rod and wing nut, perforated plate- These shall 
conform to 4.1, 4.3 and 4.4 of IS 9669.
	
b)	
Metal Rammer- As specified in 5.1 of IS 9198.
	
c)	
Curing apparatus - The curing apparatus shall be a thermostat water tank, 
capable of holding not less than two 15 cm moulds, and able to keep the water 
temperature at 80° ± 3 °C for 6 h.

PART B: COPPER SLAG
1 INTRODUCTION
Similar to Iron and Steel Slag, utilization of Copper Slag in road construction industry 
is gaining importance in India, considering the disposal, environmental problems and 
gradually depleting natural resources like aggregates. Copper units located at Dahej 
(Gujarat) and Tuticorin (Tamil Nadu) generate huge amount of copper slag, during the 
manufacture of copper. Huge mounds of copper slag are created occupying avoidable 
land space within or outside the plant premises. (Fig. 1).The total amount of the copper 
slag accumulated till date is about 10 million tonnes and around 2 million tonnes per 
year is generated currently. Detailed laboratory investigations have been carried out on 
coarse copper slags collected from Birla copper Industries, Dahej and Sterlite copper 
Industry, Tuticorin by studying physical, chemical, geotechnical and other engineering 
characteristics for coming to conclusions regarding its feasibility in Road construction. 
Fine copper slag from Dahej, Gujarat was also studied in depth to investigate its feasibility 
in road construction. Experimental test tracks were constructed using coarse copper slag 
collected from Sterlite industry along NH-45 B (Madurai to Tuticorin). The performance of 
the same was monitored for a period of two years. Based on the experience gained at the 
laboratory and field level, these guidelines have been prepared for the benefit of the rural 
road construction authorities/departments.

3 COPPER SLAG
Copper slag is an industrial by-product material produced from the process of manufacturing 
copper. It is produced by:
	
(i)	
Roasting, in which Sulphur in the ore is eliminated as Sulphur Dioxide (SO2);
	
(ii)	
Smelting, in which the roasted product is melted in a siliceous flux and the 
metal is reduced; and
	
(iii)	 Converting, where the melt is de-sulphurized with lime flux, iron ore, or a basic 
slag and then oxygen lanced to remove other impurities.
The general process diagram of the smelting of copper concentrates in a reverberatory furnace 
is shown in Fig. 2.

Geotechnical Characteristics
Detailed geotechnical characteristics need to be studied to investigate its feasibility for 
embankment construction. Different geotechnical tests which have to be carried out include viz. 
Grain size analysis, Standard Proctor compaction tests, Direct shear tests, California Bearing 
Ratio (CBR) tests, Permeability tests as per BIS standards.
3.2.1	
Grain size distribution
Typical grain size distribution curve of both fine and coarse copper slag is shown in Fig. 4. The 
grain size distribution is summarized in Table 2. Coarse copper slag is classified as SP (Poorly 
graded sand), while Fine slag is classified as ML (Fine sand with silts).

Compaction characteristics
Typical compaction characteristics of both fine and coarse copper slag in terms of Maximum Dry 
Density (MDD) and Optimum Moisture Content (OMC) are shown in Fig. 5 and different range 
of values is summarized in Table 2. Tests indicated insensitiveness of dry density with moisture 
content which is an added advantage for field construction.
3.2.3	
Shear strength characteristics
Slope stability of copper slag embankment depends on its shear strength characteristics. Typical 
values of cohesion and angle of internal friction of both fine and coarse copper slag are given in 
Table 2. High angle of internal friction justifies its suitability in embankment construction.

3.2.4	
Permeability characteristics
Permeability characteristics of copper slag play a key role in the development of pore water 
pressure (pwp) when used in embankment construction. Some of the typical permeability 
characteristics are shown in Table 2. Permeability values indicate the good permeability 
characteristics similar to conventional sand and the pore water pressure would be dissipated 
easily when used in embankment construction.
3.2.5	
California Bearing Ratio (CBR)
High values of California Bearing Ratio (CBR) indicate the suitability of both fine and coarse 
copper slag in embankment construction. The typical values of CBR for both fine and coarse 
copper slag are given in Table 2.

4 Design Specifications of Copper Slag Embankment
4.1	
Need for Mechanical Stabilisation of Copper Slag
Construction of road embankment using copper slag alone would not be feasible as these 
materials are cohesionless materials. Copper slag falls under the category of poorly graded 
coarse/fine sand and it may be difficult to compact in the field. It has therefore to be mixed 
with local soils or pond ash. It would not only improve the gradation but would also improve its 
density, shear strength and CBR etc. However, care shall be taken to see that the mixes satisfy 
the density and plasticity requirements as per MoRD Specifications. As per these Specifications, 
the embankment fill material shall have Plasticity Index (PI) less than 45 and dry density shall

not be less than 14.4 kN/m3 for use in embankment and should not be less than 16.5 kN/m3 for 
use as subgrade soil. Different methods of mechanical stabilisation which may be adopted in the 
field are given below.
4.1.1	
Mixing of copper slag with fly ash/other wastes
The feasibility of mixing copper slag (fine/coarse) in different proportions with fly ash/other 
wastes needs to be studied in the laboratory. Copper slag may be mixed with fly ash in the 
range 10-75%. The mixing can be optimized based on the results of laboratory geotechnical 
characteristics satisfying the design criteria as per MoRD Specifications.
4.1.2	
Mixing of copper slag with clayey/other local soils
Both fine/coarse copper slag may be mixed with clayey (expansive/non expansive) and other 
local soils in the typical range 10-75%. The mix may be optimized based on their laboratory 
geotechnical characteristics satisfying the design criteria as per MoRD Specifications.
4.1.3	
Mixing of fine and coarse copper slag
Depending on the availability of both fine and coarse copper slag in a particular industry, both can 
be mixed in different proportions for its improvement in gradation, dry density, shear strength and 
CBR characteristics. Detailed laboratory characterization needs to be carried out for optimizing 
the mix.
Table 3 summarizes some of the typical geotechnical characteristics of copper slag(fine/
coarse)-soil and copper slag(fine/coarse)-fly ash mixes, coarse+fine copper slag mixes.
The plasticity, compaction, shear strength and permeability characteristics indicating their

4.2	
Earth Cover for Protection of Slopes
Earth cover is needed to prevent erosion of copper slag-soil/fly ash stabilised layer. For 
embankment upto 3 m height, a 0.3 m thick (measured horizontally) cover of soil is provided. 
The cover soil used should have maximum dry density not less than 14.4 kN/m3. For more 
than 3 m height embankments, side cover thickness shall be increased to 0.5 m (measured 
horizontally, with min dry density 15.2 kN/m3). In such embankments, intermediate soil layers of 
0.2 m thickness may be provided every 2 m considering the practical feasibility.
5 Detailed Design of Copper Slag Embankment
5.1	
Site Investigation
The site on which copper slag embankment is to be constructed needs to be investigated 
for its in-situ characteristics. Apart from in-situ characteristics, additional information may 
be collected as discussed below.
Availability of local soils/wastes: As discussed in section 4.1, fly ash needs to be 
mixed with local soil/fly ash/other wastes for its use in embankment construction. The 
availability, quantity/lead/location details need to be noted.
Topography: Survey of the proposed copper slag alignment need to be carried out by 
total station to prepare the profile road map which would be beneficial for estimation of 
quantity of copper slag needed as an embankment fill material.
Hydrological data: The rainfall data and ground water data need to be collected from 
the alignment of copper slag embankment. This data would be very useful for drainage 
design and for evaluation of slope stability of copper slag embankment, if required.
Subsoil investigations: The nature and extent of soil and rock strata, at least for a 
depth of 2 times the height of copper slag embankment below the ground needs to be 
investigated. The in-situ characteristics viz. Bulk density, shear strength characteristics 
affect the stability of the embankment.
5.2	
Slope Stability Analysis
Slope stability analysis is normally required only when the height of copper slag embankment 
is more than 3 m height (Slope 2:1). But if the slopes are steeper, it is advisable to carry 
out the analysis for lower height of embankment also. In the analysis, different types of 
failure of embankment (a) Toe failure (occurring when foundation soil is stronger than fill 
material) (b) Slope failure (occurring in a layered embankment when a strong layer limits 
the extent of development of failure surface and (c) Base failure (occurring when the 
foundation soils beneath the base of the embankment have low strength). 
Stability analysis needs to be carried out by limit equilibrium methods as per IRC:75-2014. 
Circular failure is assumed in the analysis. The sub soil characteristics, fill characteristics, 
and the traffic loading conditions need to be considered in the design. The analysis has to 
be carried out under different moisture conditions and considering the seismic factors. The 
factor of safety along a critical circle needs to be determined to evaluate the safety of the 
copper slag in the embankment. The factor of safety shall be more than 1.25.

6 Specifications for Copper Slag in Subgrade/ 
Shoulder/Drainage Layer
6.1 	
Slag as Subgrade Material
The typical plasticity (NP), compaction (MDD>16.5 kN/m3) and CBR characteristics of copper 
slag-soil, copper slag-fly ash and mixes of fine and coarse copper slag (Table 2) indicated their 
suitability for  construction of subgrade. However, these mixes shall be confined with good earth 
(as discussed in section 4.2) to prevent possible erosion during the monsoon.
6.2	
Slag as Shoulder Material
As the shoulder is unconfined and also exposed to the atmosphere, there is every possibility 
of erosion copper slag- ash mixes of both fine and coarse copper slag. Hence these mixes are 
not recommended for shoulder construction. However, those copper slag-soil mixes having 
low plastic characteristics (PI<20, MDD>16.5 kN/m3) may be used as a shoulder material.
6.3	
Slag as Drainage Layer
The permeability characteristics of copper slag-soil, copper slag-fly ash and mixture of fine 
and coarse aggregates (Table 3) indicate their suitability as a drainage layer.
7 Specifications for Copper Slag in Granular Sub base Layer
Coarse and fine copper slag can be mixed in a definite proportion with the conventional 
aggregates (40 mm, 20 mm and 10 mm) to achieve the desired gradation of sub base 
material as per Table 400.1A & 400.1B of MoRD Specifications. Studies have indicated 30-
50% conventional fine aggregates can be replaced by copper slag for use in sub base layer. 
If fine slag is not available then stone dust shall be used along with coarse slag.
8 Specifications for Copper Slag in Sub base/Base Layer
Cement stabilised coarse copper slag, copper slag-fly ash/soil mixes can be used in 
sub base/base layer of a rural road. In the case of mixes, studies have indicated copper 
slag content is about 75%. The amount of cement content varied in the range 3-6%. 
Laboratory studies need to be undertaken by carrying out 7 day UCS tests on stabilised 
and cured specimens. As per MoRD Specifications, the achieved design UCS shall 
be 1.7 MPa for use in sub base and 3 MPa for use in base layer of road pavement 
(IRC:SP:72).
9 Specifications for Copper Slag in Wbm and Wmm Layer
9.1	
Water Bound Macadam
In Water Bound Macadam (WBM) layer, coarse copper slag may be mixed by about 50% with 
10 mm size aggregates for preparation of ‘Type B’ screenings. However, MoRD Specifications 
for gradation of screening shall be satisfied.



======================================================================
PAGE 36 of 44
======================================================================
IRC:SP:121-2018
28
9.2	
Wet Mix Macadam (WMM)
The constituent conventional materials/(aggregates) viz. 40 mm, 20 mm, 10 mm and stone dust 
can be mixed with copper slag (fine/coarse/fine+coarse) in the proportion 20-30% to arrive at 
gradation requirements of WMM as given in MoRD Specifications, Table 400.12. If fine slag is 
not available, stone dust shall be used.
10 Specifications for Copper Slag in Bituminous Surface Courses
10.1	
Bituminous Macadam
Bituminous Macadam (BM) is sometimes used as a surface course on a Rural road and can 
be laid over a primed granular base course like Water Bound Macadam (WBM) or Wet Mix 
Macadam (WMM). This type of mix can also be used in profile correction course and for overlay 
of existing rural roads.
Studies have indicated that fine copper slag is not suitable for bituminous construction. However, 
fine aggregates in the conventional mix can be replaced by coarse slag/mixture of fine and 
coarse slag by about 15- 20%, however shall satisfy the gradation criteria as per Table 500.4 of 
MoRD Specifications. Bitumen content and grade of bitumen that shall be used as per section 
504 of MoRD Specifications.
10.2	
Seal Coat
Seal coat can be used for sealing the voids in an Open Graded Premix Carpet/Bituminous 
Macadam used in rural roads. About 60-70% copper slag can be used as a replacement of 
conventional aggregates in Type B premixed seal coat, while its per cent utilisation in Type A 
(liquid seal coat) and Type C seal coat is about 20-25%.
11 METHOD STATEMENT
11.1	
Mechanically Stabilised Copper Slag Embankment
As discussed in section 4.1 copper slag needs to be mixed with local soil/fly ash for using it 
in embankment construction. The stepwise method statement for construction of copper slag 
embankment is given below.
11.1.1	
Clearing and grubbing
Clearing and grubbing work shall be undertaken for cutting, removing and disposal of all trees, 
bushes, roots, rubbish, etc, from the area of road land containing road embankment, drains, 
cross-drainage structures. It shall include necessary excavation, backfilling of pits resulting from 
uprooting of trees and stumps to required compaction, handling, salvaging, and disposal of 
cleared materials. Clearing and grubbing shall be performed in advance of earthwork operations. 
The site clearance is as per section 201 of MoRD Specifications.



======================================================================
PAGE 37 of 44
======================================================================
IRC:SP:121-2018
29
11.1.2	
Setting out
After the site has been cleared, the limits of embankment shall be set out true to lines, curves, 
slopes, grades and sections as shown on the drawings or as directed by the Engineer. The limits 
of the embankment shall be marked by fixing batter pegs on both sides at regular intervals as 
guides before commencing the earthwork. The embankment shall be built sufficiently wider than 
the design dimensions so that surplus material may be trimmed, ensuring that the remaining 
material is to the desired density. The setting out is as per section 301.5.1 of MoRD Specifications. 
11.1.3	
Dewatering of foundation of embankment
In road stretch, where stagnant water is encountered, the vegetation in stagnant water shall 
be first removed. Stagnant water shall then be bailed out using pumps. Care shall be taken 
to discharge the drained water so as not to cause damage to adjacent embankment or other 
private/public property. The foundation shall be kept dry before receiving the first layer of the 
embankment. Dewatering is as per section 301.5.2 of MoRD Specifications.
11.1.4	
Stripping of top soil
Before laying first layer of mechanically stabilised copper slag, the top soil should be stripped to 
specified depth not exceeding 150 mm as per section 301.5.3 of MoRD Specifications.
11.1.5	
Compaction of ground supporting proposed embankment
The ground shall be levelled, watered if necessary and rolled to a well compacted surface for 
placement of the embankment. In case where the difference between the top of the subgrade and 
the ground level is less than 600 mm, the ground shall be loosened to a minimum depth of 150 
mm and compacted in accordance with clauses 301.5.5 and 301.5.6 of MoRD Specifications. Any 
unsuitable material occurring in the embankment foundation shall be removed to the required 
depth and replaced with suitable soil and compacted as directed by the Engineer.
11.1.6	
Materials for construction of copper slag embankment
Copper slag needs to be collected from the stacks inside the plant. Soil has to be collected 
from the quarry already identified during the experimental stretch construction. The soil used for 
mixing shall have Plasticity Index value between 10-20 and shall also satisfy the requirements 
as per section 301 of MoRD Specifications. Fly ash collected from the ponds in the thermal 
power plant shall be dried in the sun till the ash becomes suitable for mixing. The totally dry Fly 
ash may be conditioned with 1-2% moisture before laying and mixing to avoid air pollution and 
dust nuisance.
11.1.7	
Spreading of embankment material
After preparation of the ground supporting the embankment, conditioned fly ash/dry soil shall 
be spread using dozers/graders to the required loose thickness. The copper slag is then spread 
over the same to the required loose thickness. The loose thickness of each of the fill materials 
has to be determined for the specified proportion (by weight) and for a compacted thickness of 
150 mm.

11.1.8	
Spreading of side cover soil
The side soil cover of specified width (as per drawing) and loose thickness shall be spread along 
with the copper slag-soil/fly ash fill material (core of the embankment). The addition of side earth 
cover subsequent to the construction of the core is prohibited. The side cover soil shall have 
Plasticity Index between 10-20, shall also satisfy the requirements as per section 301 of MoRD 
Specifications. The dry density of the cover soil shall not be less than 14.4 kN/m3, when used for 
embankment of height upto 3 m. However, when it forms the subgrade, its dry density shall not 
be less than 16.5 kN/m3.
11.1.9	
Mixing/compaction of fill and cover material
The loose layers of copper slag and soil/Fly ash are then dry mixed using a tractor towed tiller 
or Rotavator till a uniform mix is achieved. The number of passes of tiller in either direction 
(perpendicular) may be two to three passes sufficient to achieve uniform mixing. The required 
amount of water is then added as per the Optimum Moisture Content (OMC) obtained from the 
Standard Proctor compaction tests. Water shall be sprinkled from a water tanker fitted with a 
sprinkler capable of applying water uniformly without any flooding. The moisture content may 
vary within the range of +1% and -2% of OMC. Wet mixing is then carried out using the same 
equipment. The number of passes shall be the same as in dry mixing. However, the number 
of passes for both dry and wet mixing shall be determined by an experimental field study or as 
per the decision of the site engineer. The wet mix material shall then be spread by mechanical 
means, finished by motor grader. Compaction shall be carried out preferably by vibratory rollers 
of dead weight of 8 to 10 tonnes to achieve a compacted thickness of 150 mm.
The cover soil has to be simultaneously compacted along with fill material in the embankment. 
This would provide confinement to copper slag/soil/pond ash mix.
11.1.10	
Earth for intermediate soil layers
Intermediate soil layers are proposed only for copper slag-Fly ash fill material. The 
same soil which was used for mixing/cover soil may be used as an intermediate layer. 
An intermediate layer of compacted thickness 150 mm is proposed, after every 2 m 
raise in the height of embankment. This has been proposed for ease of construction and 
to provide adequate confinement for the fill material. This would also protect the copper 
slag-Fly ash material from erosion during possible rainfall at the time of construction.
11.2	
Mechanically Stabilised Copper Slag Subgrade and Sub Base 
When copper slag-soil mix is used as an embankment material, the same shall form the 
subgrade material. Black cotton soil and other expansive soils shall be used in subgrade 
construction judiciously considering the swelling characteristics of such soils. However, 
when copper slag-pond ash is used as a fill material a separate subgrade of thickness 
300 mm of good earth/copper slag+soil shall be laid. The material shall be the same as used 
conventionally throughout the road section.
In general, the physical and other requirements of embankment fill material, subgrade shall be 
constructed as per sections 301 and 303 of MoRD Specifications.

11.3	
Mechanically Stabilised GSB and WMM Layers with Copper Slag
The design mix of copper slag with conventional aggregates for use in GSB and WMM may be 
prepared in the conventional WMM plant. The computer controlled plant shall be adjusted till 
a uniform mix satisfying the design gradation is achieved. The wet mix (@OMC) is non plastic 
and needs to be compacted immediately with conventional rollers which would be helpful 
to achieve the required degree of compaction. Also, addition of water to the dried mix at a 
later stage may result in segregation of the mix. However, the physical, gradation and other 
requirements of GSB and WMM shall be as per section 400 of MoRD Specifications.
11.4	
Construction Methodology for Bituminous Mixes with Copper Slag
The hot bituminous mix, Bituminous Macadam (BM) may be prepared in conventional drum 
mix plant (IRC:27). After ensuring the gradation, and physical requirements of aggregates, 
construction shall be carried out as per section 504 of MoRD Specifications. For mix seal 
surfacing, section 507 of MoRD Specification shall be referred.
12 Quality control TESTS
12.1	
Copper Slag Embankment and Subgrade
The material used as an embankment fill material shall be controlled through periodic checks 
by carrying out different tests with  the required frequency. Compaction control and acceptance 
criteria are also very essential. Section 1803.2 of MoRD Specifications may be strictly adhered 
to.
12.2	
Copper Slag GSB, Cement Stabilised base/Sub base, WMM and Bituminous Mixes
Quality control tests of coarse aggregates, fine aggregates, filler, bitumen and their testing 
frequencies should be carried out as per section 1803.3, 1803.5,1803.7,1803.10 and 1803.13 of 
MoRD Specifications.
13 Environmental Aspects
Leachate characteristics of both coarse and fine copper slag shall be evaluated by Toxicity 
Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP). Though the research studies, indicated that 
leachability of toxic heavy metals from the copper slag is below the regulatory limits and is 
considered non-hazardous, a certificate from the Industry regarding the same shall be obtained 
before using copper slag (coarse/fine) in road construction.
14 Typical Cross Section of Rural Road with Copper Slag
As discussed in different sections, mechanically stabilised copper slag viz. copper slag (fine/
coarse)-fly ash, copper slag (fine/coarse)-soil, mixture of coarse and fine slag can be suitably 
used for construction of embankment, subgrade, shoulders, as a part replacement in GSB, 
WMM and bituminous mixes. Typical cross section of a rural road with usage in different layers

ANNEXURE-II
CASE STUDY
CSIR-Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) carried out detailed laboratory and field study 
to investigate the feasibility of coarse copper slag in the construction of embankment and in 
bituminous concrete mix. About 0.5 km stretch of bridge approach embankment on Madurai-
Tuticorin Highway (NH-45B) (Fig. A1) was constructed with coarse copper slag and its 
performance was monitored for a period of two years. The height of copper slag embankment 
varied from 1 m to 4 m. As the construction of 100% copper slag was not practically feasible, 
the material was mixed with locally available pond ash/local soil by 50% (Fig. A2(a,b), 
Fig. A3(a,b)). The slope of the embankment was protected with 2 m thick selected good earth. 
Copper slag was also used as a replacement of fine aggregates in bituminous concrete layer (wearing 
course) and a test section was laid on the same highway for a length of 350 m towards Madurai.

Copper slag embankment was evaluated during construction by Core cutter/Sand replacement 
tests, Plate load tests, and Dynamic Cone Penetrometer tests (Fig. A4). Pavement performance 
study on the finished embankment was carried out quarterly for a period of two years by measuring 
rebound deflection using Benkelman beam (Fig. A5), surface roughness using dipstick. To find 
out the settlement behavior of copper slag embankment, surface level was recorded at different 
cross sections using auto level. All the results indicated that the copper slag is suitable for 
construction of embankment and for bituminous concrete mixes.
