RECOMMENDED PRACTICE FOR RECYCLING OF  
BITUMINOUS PAVEMENTS
1  INTRODUCTION
1.1	
The Flexible Pavement Committee (H-2) of IRC felt the need to formulate the document 
on Recycling of Bituminous Pavements. The draft “Recommended Practice for Recycling of 
Bituminous Pavements” prepared by Dr. Sunil Bose was discussed in a series of meetings 
of H-2. Committee.The H-2 Committee finalized the draft document in its meetings held on 
3rd January, 2015 for placing it before the Highways Specifications & Standards Committee 
(HSS). The HSS approved the draft document in its meeting held on 12th January, 2015. The 
Council of IRC in its 204th meeting held at Bhubaneshwar on 19th January, 2015 approved the 
draft “Recommended Practice for Recycling of Bituminous Pavements” after taking on board 
the comments offered by the members.

1.2	
Recycling of Pavement
Recycling of pavement is the process in which the existing pavement materials are reclaimed 
and re-used after reprocessing for either (a) resurfacing, or (b) repaving, or (c) reconstruction of 
pavement depending upon the condition of the existing pavement, the nature of the reclaimed 
materials, the method of reprocessing, and the treatment that the pavement requires. The 
justification for reclaiming the pavement materials, consisting mainly of aggregates and 
bituminous binders, is both environmental as well as economic. The aggregates existing 
in the pavement are part of natural resources drawn from the environment and should not 
be simply dumped at dump sites if a pavement fails or becomes unserviceable because it 
will cause damage to the environment, which will be further accentuated by extracting more 
virgin aggregates from the environment in replacement of the wasted materials. Economic 
justification comes from the utilization of the bitumen already existing in the pavement, which 
reduces the requirement of expensive virgin bitumen.
1.3	
Reclaiming and Reprocessing of Pavement Materials
The reclaiming and reprocessing of pavement materials involve both design (how the pavement 
should be designed using reclaimed materials with the given properties) and technology (the 
methods to reclaim and reprocess, equipment, knowhow and quality) issues. Once both 
the issues are satisfactorily handled, there should be evidence of good performance of the 
recycled pavements in terms of strength, durability, and serviceability. If the three factors 
(design, technology and performance) combine, recycling of pavements is environmentally 
and economically better option for pavement repair, rehabilitation or reconstruction compared 
to one which uses fresh or virgin materials.
1.4	
Variability in terms of Aggregate Gradation and Binder Content
The reclaimed materials usually have lot of variability in terms of aggregate gradation 
and binder content depending upon the location they come from (i.e. the project site and/
or stockpiles), the layers they are drawn from (surfacing, bituminous base, or the granular 
bases), the method used for reclaiming (milling, ripping, breaking). This variability, which is 
required to be accounted for in designing a mix of uniform quality meeting the standards, is 
the designer’s nightmare.

1.5	
Overview of Reclamation and Recycling
The complete technology package requires consideration and provision of all the processes, 
viz. reclamation of the pavement materials (milling, ripping, breaking) handling the reclaimed 
materials (in-place or off site), the processing of the reclaimed materials (to achieve the 
design gradation including by adding fresh aggregates and to produce the new mix with the 
graded aggregates including by adding fresh binder) and construction. There are essentially 
two types of recycling technology, viz. (1) In-place and (2) In-plant, each having two variants, 
viz., (a) Cold and (b) Hot. Cold recycling technology has three options, viz., (i) Foam bitumen, 
(ii) Emulsion, (iii) Stabilization. Hot technology has two options depending upon the manner 
of reclamation by (i) hot process, or (ii) cold process. This is explained in the Fig. below.

1.6	
In-place Handling of Reclaimed Materials
The in-place handling of reclaimed materials is usually combined with mixing, laying and 
construction each in a close sequence. Off-site handling involves independent processes, 
such as re-crushing, segregation into different size fractions and stockpiling. Mixing (with 
or without heating and/or addition of fresh or virgin materials) is a separate off-site process, 
which is to be followed by transportation, laying and construction. 
1.7	
Performance of Recycled Pavements in India
As for performance of recycled pavements in India, the evidence is only anecdotal and 
no systematic documentation is available though it has been sporadically used in several 
projects in the country. The absence of Guidelines on the subject may be one of the reasons 
for lack of its widespread use. There are many documented evidences from abroad for good 
performance of the recycling technology subject to fulfilment of certain site specific and 
material specific requirements.

1.8	
Different Aspects of Recycling
These Guidelines are framed to cover the following five aspects of recycling:
1.	
Reclamation (hot and cold processes)
2.	
Hot in-place recycling (HIR)
3.	
Cold in-place recycling (CIR)
4.	
Hot in-plant recycling (HIP)
5.	
Cold in-plant recycling (CIP)
1.9	
Reclamation
Hot process reclamation is applicable only in HIR, while Cold Process reclamation can 
apply to all other recycling processes. In Hot Process reclamation, the existing pavement is 
heated by radiation and then milled or scarified while the hot bituminous surface is soft due 
to heating. The reclaimed material is invariably used in-place. In Cold Process reclamation, 
the pavement material is reclaimed by Cold Milling, breaking or ripping. In cold milling the 
pavement surface is milled to the required depth, the reclaimed material is discharged into 
a tipper truck and stockpiled at some designated site. The reclaimed materials are of the 
same size or lower compared to what had gone into in the original construction. Where 
ripping or breaking is done for reclamation, materials retrieved are in large chunks, which 
have to be crushed and then stockpiled. Before stockpiling the materials could be sieved 
and segregated and stockpiled into various size fractions. In any case, the dust produced by 
milling process should be separated. The milled material is stockpiled at some designated 
place after further crushing (if the reclamation process is by ripping or breaking the pavement 
instead of milling). Other reclamation processes, which are also cold processes, may involve 
ripping and pulverizing the non-bituminous bases/ sub-bases.
1.10	
Hot in-place recycling (HIR).
In HIR, a train of equipment is used with capabilities to perform different functions such as 
infrared heating of the pavement surface to soften it, milling  the softened hot pavement 
surface, transferring   the milled materials into  Pug mill mixer of the Recycling equipment 
through a belt conveyor, adding fresh mix/binder/rejuvenator as per requirements of design 
into the pug mill, discharging the remixed materials into integrated paving screeds for paving 
the re-mixed output, rolling and compaction of the paved material. In HIR, 100 per cent of 
the reclaimed material is utilized. However, its limitation is that no more than 50 mm thick 
bituminous layer can be satisfactorily recycled (maximum 75 mm if softer binder was used in 
the original construction). If the pavement needs to be overlaid from structural consideration, 
a second layer of Hot mix overlay may have to be done on top of the recycled surface and 
in such situations (also called repaving), HIR has to be done in two layers (or multiple 
layers).

1.11	
Hot in-plant recycling (HIP)
This process involves production and laying of hot mix materials but not with virgin aggregates 
and binder but with a combination of reclaimed stockpiled aggregates already coated with 
binder and additional virgin aggregate and fresh binder to meet the requirements of the 
design. Usually, some rejuvenator is used to soften the old hardened binder in the reclaimed 
aggregates. Heating the reclaimed binder coated aggregates may release unacceptable 
fumes while feeding them cold directly into the pug mill may reduce the mixing temperature. 
The hot mix production process, therefore, has to be suitably modified. In all other respects, 
hot in-plant recycling is just like normal hot mix construction. Not more than 50% of the 
reclaimed material is used, though a widely accepted percentage is only 30) and the thickness 
in which it can be laid is typically 100 mm.
1.12	
Cold in-place recycling (CIR)
In this process, milling and mixing are simultaneous processes accomplished by a single 
equipment or a train of equipment capable of milling and conveying the milled material to be 
fed to a pug mill, with parallel supply line for feeding fresh aggregates also, and separate 
feeding lines to the pug mill for bitumen emulsion, and rejuvenator. Where foam bitumen 
is to be used, there has to be separate feeding line for hot bitumen and water to produce 
the foam bitumen and then feed into the pug mill. The mixed material is discharged into the 
paver hopper closely following the recycling equipment or train of equipment, then paved and 
compacted. This type of recycling is considered suitable for depth upto 150 mm and the use 
of reclaimed material is also of the same order (typically 30 to 50%) as in HIP. 
Another variant of cold in-place recycling is Full Depth Reclamation, where the thickness 
of pavement to be recycled is greater than typically 150 mm. The pavement is ripped, the 
material pulverized and stabilized with lime, cement or cementitious materials and compacted 
into base layer of the required strength. 
1.13	
Cold in-plant recycling (CIP)
The process involves production of the mix in a plant using either emulsion or foam bitumen 
and laying and compaction in the usual manner. A rejuvenator is to be added in the mixing 
process to soften the hard binder in the reclaimed material. The application range in terms 
of depth of recycling and use of reclaimed materials is typically the same as for cold in-place 
recycling.

Structural evaluation
(4)	
Existing Pavement Material properties 
3.1	
Pavement Condition
Pavement condition will be investigated for identifying all the defects as listed out in IRC 
82: 2014. In addition, cores of 150 mm diameter should be taken along the width of the 
carriageway on the severely distressed section at 0.75 m, 3.85 m and 6.95 m from the inside 
edge of the shoulder. Cores should be taken in a staggered manner along the length of the 
pavement at locations such that one core sample every 300 m length of the road is available. 
Depth of the core should be at least equal to the depth of bituminous thickness. In case the 
crack is observed over the entire depth of the bituminous layer, the investigation through core 
or test pits should be carried out through the granular/ bound bases of the pavement as well 
to ascertain if full depth reclamation would be needed.
The cores should be referenced and photographed, and the observation recorded in terms 
of crack depth, crack width and other visual observations on the core such as deficient 
or uneven bitumen coating, signs of shear (diagonal or transverse cracking) or any other 
observation.
The cores should be used for testing the material properties of the existing pavements.
Pavement roughness should be measured by running the Bump Integrator and stretch-wise 
data should be recorded.
Skid resistance measurements should also preferably be recorded. 
3.2	
Pavement Composition and History
Composition of the pavement including the type of pavement layers, the layer thicknesses, 
year of construction, history of interventions (resurfacing/renewal/reconstruction) and time of

such intervention, the aggregate source (if possible), job mix formula, binder content and the 
type of binder should be gathered from records and documented. 
3.3	
Structural Evaluation
Structural evaluation of pavement should be carried out with Falling Weight Deflectometer 
in accordance with IRC 115 (2014) and the residual life of the pavement and the overlay 
requirements for various time horizons (5, 10, 15 years) should be determined.
3.4	
Existing Pavement Material Properties
The material of core samples should be used for determining the properties of aggregate and 
binder in the existing pavement. Most relevant properties to be tested are
(i)	
Bulk density of the existing mix 
(ii)	
Aggregate gradation
(iii)	
Binder content
(iv)	
Viscosity of the binder in the core samples
4.   General criteria for Investigation to determine Recycling option
The results of the investigation of the existing pavements should be analysed in terms of 
(i)	
Serviceability of the pavement 
(ii)	
The extent of surface defects
(iii)	
Structural strength 
4.1	
Serviceability of Pavement
Serviceability of the pavement is usually a subjective assessment of the users’ needs 
in terms of riding quality and comfort. One would not like to drive on a cracked, ravelled 
bumpy road. To what extent the surface deterioration of pavement can be tolerated is the 
decision which Road Authorities have to take within the constraints of their resources. 
When the serviceability of the pavement deteriorates beyond a point, one of the options 
available is recycling apart from many other maintenance and repair measures like 
sealing, patching, micro-surfacing, surface renewal, etc. In order to objectively assess the 
acceptable serviceability level beyond which recycling should be considered an option, 
these Guidelines recommend that where (a) the distresses can be categorised as “High 
Severity” distress as defined in IRC 82:2014, or (b) road roughness exceeds 3000 mm 
per km, or (c) rut depth exceeds 20 mm, should be considered for recycling. All surface 
renewals could be a candidate for recycling.

4.2	
The Extent of Surface Defects
 It would be necessary to know whether the defects appearing on the surface are confined to 
the surfacing course itself or have progressed in the lower layers of pavement as well, such 
as bituminous bases or granular or bound bases/sub bases. This would be determined by 
examining and analysing the cores taken during investigation. Pavement should be recycled 
to the depth of distress. If the distress extends into the bituminous bases, this is a clear 
indication of failure of the base as well. A strengthening overlay would be called for and 
recycling combined with overlay would be a solution. If the distress extends into granular or 
bound bases, the bituminous pavement material should be reclaimed and the base pulverized, 
stabilized and relayed while the bituminous layers could be built using reclaimed and fresh 
materials. 
4.3	
Structural Strength
 If the structural evaluation of the pavement reveals that the residual life of the pavement is 
sufficient to take the wheel load repetitions for the next five years, the pavement should be 
considered as adequate for the time being and recycling of only surface layers should be 
considered if the surface condition warrants it. Otherwise, recycling should be combined with 
overlaying.

Recycling Options
The Table below suggests which of the five recycling options would be suitable in different 
situations. Where depth of recycling is limited, in-place methods (both Hot and Cold) would

be suitable because these utilize the reclaimed materials to the maximum extent. There is 
not much merit in using in-plant methods in such cases as only 30 per cent of the reclaimed 
materials can be used. When recycling in deeper depth is required, in-plant methods are the 
only options. As far as choice between hot or cold processes, for both in-plant and in-place 
methods, is concerned, the choice would depend upon economic, environmental and the 
capability (of producing the mix meeting the design requirements) factors.

Limitations as to Depth of Recycling
The following are the maximum recommended depths of recycling
	
HIR: 50 mm 
	
HIP: 100 mm 
	
CIR: 75 mm 
	
CIP: 100 mm 
In case the thickness required as per design is more, the balance thickness should be made 
up by hot mix materials, the recycled layer acting as levelling course.
4.6	
Limitations as to Proportion of Reclaimed Materials in the Recycled Mixes
In HIR or CIR 100 per cent of the reclaimed materials can be used. In HIP and CIP not more 
than 30 per cent of the reclaimed material should be used.

Some Illustrations on Selecting a Recycling Option
Photo 1 illustrates a ravelled surface. 
Ravelling must have been preceded by 
cracking. If the cracks are only in the surface 
layer, HIR is a suitable recycling option. 
The ravelled portion should be applied with 
thin coat of emulsion to restore the lost 
bitumen before HIR mix and prevent dust 
contamination of the HIR mix.
Photo 2 is a typical example of fatty surface 
giving poor serviceability in terms of riding 
quality and skid resistance. HIR should be a 
suitable option
Photo 3 shows a polished aggregate surface. 
This is not suitable for any type of recycling 
because the polished surfaces would not 
allow bitumen to stick on the aggregates. 
Chip seal, surface dressing, Micro surfacing 
would be a better option to increase friction. 
With or without overlaying

Photo 4 shows a corrugated surface giving 
very poor serviceability. If the corrugations 
are not present in the base layer (which can 
be ascertained by digging test pits across the 
pavement), it could be due to faulty mix design 
using softer binder and HIR or CIR could be 
an option. If the top of the granular base also 
shows corrugation, it would be indicative of 
subgrade failure of the pavement and Full 
Depth Recycling would be an appropriate 
solution
Photo 5 shows rutting and slippage, which 
could be due to faulty mix design and use of 
softer binder. This type of surface could be 
treated with HIR
Photo 6 shows longitudinal and diagonal 
cracks. Longitudinal cracks may be due to 
faulty construction (lack of bond at cold joints) 
while the diagonal cracks are indicative of 
shear failure of the mix. Subject to further 
investigations proving otherwise, HIR or CIR 
could be a suitable option.

Photo 7 shows alligator cracks on the 
surface. Too much dust contamination and 
loss of binder, HIR would not be a suitable 
solution and HIP or CIP could be a better 
option provided cracks have not progressed 
deeper than the surface course.
5.  Design Considerations
5.1	
Managing the Variability in Properties of Reclaimed Materials to make them 
Compatible with Fresh Materials
The objective of design of recycled mixes is that they should meet the same requirements as 
expected of mixes with virgin materials and their performance should be equal to or better 
than virgin mixes. The in-situ bituminous materials, which are reclaimed for use in recycling, 
have the following characteristics:
(1)	
The bitumen is aged, oxidized and hardened and hence the viscosity of the reclaimed 
binder is much higher than the fresh binder of the same grade as used in the original 
construction
(2)	
The aggregates get crushed during the process of reclamation, particularly when the 
reclamation is by the process of cold milling, and hence their grading changes from 
those of the original mix.
(3)	
In case the reclaimed bituminous material is stockpiled, drawing up materials from 
the stock pile may have variability with regard to physical properties and aggregate 
gradation and source, bitumen grading and source.
The main design consideration is to manage these variabilities and make the reclaimed and 
fresh materials compatible.
5.2	
Method of Improvement of Binder in the Reclaimed Material
Hardened bitumen in the reclaimed materials has to be made softer. This can be done mainly 
in two ways,
(i)	
By adding rejuvenating agents to bring the combined viscosity of the binder 
to acceptable level. Rejuvenating agents are commercially available patented 
products. The manufacturers of the materials should be required to demonstrate the 



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 72
======================================================================

IRC:120-2015
13
effectiveness of their application and assure against any harmful ingredients therein. 
If the rejuvenating agents do not penetrate into the hardened bitumen properly, they 
would lubricate the mix and would be counter-productive.
(ii)	
By adding softer grade bitumen to mix with the hard bitumen extracted from the 
reclaimed mix to soften it to the acceptable level. Extraction of old bitumen should be 
done by Abson Recovery Method (ASTM D 1856-95 A) What is the acceptable level 
of softening can be decided in the following ways:
	
(a)	
By the combined Viscosity of the mixed binder: This can be done by a standard 
blending chart. One such chart developed by FHWA is shown in the Fig. 3 
below.
	
(b)	
By the combined Softening point: The softening points of the old and new binder 
combined in various percentages are determined to arrive at the target softening 
point. 
 
Fig 3. Blending Chart (Source NCHRP Synthesis Report 421)
5.3 
Rectification of Aggregate Grading
Aggregate grading of the reclaimed material has to be determined and the missing fractions 
have to be added to arrive at the appropriate grading as per IRC:111 (for Hot mix application) 
and IRC:SP:100 (for cold mix application).
5.4	
Mix Design Considerations
All other design considerations such as Stability, Va, VMA, VFA, etc. would be the same as 
those applicable for normal bituminous mixes prescribed in the relevant guidelines, codes or 
specifications.

Photo 8. Milling in Operation
5.5 	
Mix Design Procedure using Foam Bitumen 
In recycling where recycling agent is foam bitumen, the design procedure is given in Annex 1.
6.  Reclamation 
Reclamation normally involves three processes viz milling, demolition and full depth 
reclamation. In situations where recycling is to be done in place (HIR, CIR), reclamation and 
recycling are combined processes.
6.1	
Milling
Milling is the control removal of an existing pavement to a desired depth, using specially 
designed equipment having replaceable tungsten carbide cutting teeth mounted on a rotor 
drum driven by the power supplied by the milling machine. It is the most common way of 
reclaiming the bituminous pavement material. It is mostly used following a cold process, and 
hence commonly known as cold milling, though milling is done following hot process also in 
HIR. This section deals with cold milling only.
Important aspects to be considered in cold milling are the depth of milling, appropriate milling 
tools to govern the size of milled material, control of dust, collection and transportation of 
milled material, and stockpiling. Milling processes should be closely examined to make 
sure that the milled material is not contaminated with soil, base material, paving geotextiles, 



======================================================================
PAGE 23 of 72
======================================================================

IRC:120-2015
15
or other debris. This is particularly important for deep mills or milling on shoulders or 
widened roadways. Milled materials that become contaminated should be used only as 
shoulder material and should be stockpiled separately. A recommended maximum limit 
of 1% deleterious material should be used to evaluate reclaimed bituminous materials. 
The milled surface should also be inspected for “scabbing,” where thin, weakly bonded 
layers are left in place. If this is observed, the milling depth should be adjusted to remove 
the scab layer because, if allowed to remain in place, the performance of overlay will be 
poor.
The milled surface should be inspected for uniform texture. A non-uniform texture resulting 
from worn or broken tips on the milling drum can cause problems with compaction of 
thin overlays. It may also cause an unsafe surface for motorcycles if the milled surface 
remains open to traffic. In such cases, it should be ensured that riding surface is safe 
for motorcycles, by having a reasonable limit on peak to valley distance of the milled 
surface.The finished milled surface should be within 6-8 mm of a true profile grade both 
in transverse and longitudinal directions, when measured with a 3-m long straightedge 
(Photo 9).
If the milled surface is to be the final surface of the pavement, it should have either continuous 
or intermittent striations or any other pre-approved pattern which will provide an acceptable 
level of skid resistance. If pavement is to be constructed over the milled surface, it shall have 
a texture which will provide good bonding.
 
Photo 9: Good surface after milling
Milling machines transfers maximum energy on to milling drum in removing pavement 
layers by impacting the pavement with milling teeth mounted on a drum rotating at about 
200 rpm. The impacts break up the pavement by ripping through the mastic and aggregate 
particles. Crushing of aggregate particles causes the gradation of the millings to be finer 
than the gradation of the pavement layers in place. The final gradation required of the 
reclaimed bituminous materials (RBM) by milling can be obtained by controlling depth of 
milling cut, and speed of machine .Also Gradation bar on milling machine helps to control 
the cut size.

Photo 10. Different types of milling teeth on rotar
6.2	
Pavement Demolition
RBM may also be obtained from demolition of an existing pavement using a bulldozer or 
backhoe. This process is typically limited to small areas of pavement. It is slow and results in 
large chunks of pavement that may be more challenging to process into a useable recycled 
material. When pavement rubble is contaminated with underlying layers and soil, it is better for 
this material to be crushed and used as a shoulder or base material than used in bituminous 
mixture.
The limitation of backhoe loader or excavator is that there is a possibility of damage to 
the layer below the bituminous layer besides the retrieved materials, being in the form of 
lumps, cannot be used without re-crushing. While disposal of unusable material lumps is 
environmentally damaging, making them usable by re-crushing is also fraught with some 
problems as the lumps instead of breaking may tend to become stickier due to presence of 
bitumen, especially in hot weather. Thus, it is not easy to get a proper grading out of such 
materials even after re-crushing. 
6.3	
Full Depth Reclamation (FDR)
In Full depth reclamation (FDR) all the reclaimed materials of the pavement, with or without 
fresh materials, is stabilized in-situ with suitable stabilizers to produce the base course of the 
pavement to be overlaid by bituminous course(s). If economically feasible, it is preferable to 
reclaim the bituminous layer and other granular or bound layers separately to retrieve as much 
useful and high value bituminous materials as possible. In the latter situation, reclamation 
and recycling would be in two stages.
6.4	
Management of Reclaimed Material Stockpile
Reclaimed material should be stockpiled and managed as per the details given in Appendix 
III to Annex 1.

7.0  Cold recycling
Cold recycling involves reuse of the existing pavement materials without the application of 
heat. The recycling agent in cold recycling can be emulsion, foam bitumen, rejuvenator, 
and cementitious materials, either alone or in combination. Cold recycling offers three 
options,viz.,Cold In-place Recycling (CIR), Cold In-Plant (CIP) and Full Depth Reclamation 
(FDR). 
7.1	
Cold in Place Recycling (CIR)
A CIR plant or Recycler should be equipped with 
(a)	
Cold milling equipment to mill the existing pavement,
(b)	
A system to carry the milled materials to vibrating screens with a separate line for 
fresh aggregates
(c)	
A system for proportioning and weigh batching of different size fractions
(d)	
A Pug mill for mixing with separate material feed lines for aggregates, binder and 
rejuvenators 
(e)	
Vibrating screeds for tamping and profiling the mixed materials discharged from Pug mill
(f)	
Compaction equipment for compacting the mix
(g)	
Appropriate arrangements for controlling dust and noise pollution
The machines should have electronic controls for inputs, processes and outputs. A single 
machine can have all these features or there can be a train of equipment for performing 
different functions. Schematic diagrams for the cold in-place recycling plants are presented 
in Photos 11 to 14 below.

7.2	
Cold in Plant Recycling (CIP)
In the cold in-plant recycling, the RBM is transported to a mobile cold mixing plant located 
in the vicinity of the job site. Measured quantities of RBM and fresh aggregates are cold 
fed into a twin shaft pug mill and metred quantities of binder, either in the form of bitumen 
emulsion or foam bitumen, is injected. All the ingredients are mixed and blended for a certain 
duration to produce a homogeneous mix, which is transported to the work site, paved and 
compacted. The requirements of CIP, therefore, involve proper control on material feed and 
mixing process, including the mixing time.
Photo 14: View of a twin shaft pug mill of a cold mixing unit
Precise control on the mixing time is important because over-mixing can cause premature 
breaking of emulsified bitumen; under-mixing may result in insufficient coating of aggregates. 
Similarly, the rate of injection of hot bitumen and water to produce the foam bitumen should 
be so regulated that the bitumen foam uniformly coats the aggregates.The CIP plant should 
have all the features and controls as described in para 7.1 above. A view of the twin-shaft 
pug mill is given in Photo 14.
8.  Hot in plant Recycling (HIP)
Hot in-plant recycling involves the usual Hot mix production process with three main 
differences, viz (i) instead of all fresh aggregates and bitumen in the usual Hot Mix production, 
HIP uses RBM to the extent of 30 %, (ii) rejuvenators are required to soften the oxidized 
binder in RBM, and (iii) unlike normal hot mix production process the RBM cannot be directly 
heated as it would generate fumes. These factors have to be adequately managed by brining 
modifications in the Hot Mix Plants, especially the material feed system, and changes in the 
production process. Subject to these modification and changes, the Plant can be a Continuous 
or Batch type.

IRC:120-2015
22
In Hot In-place recycling (HIR) the existing pavement is heated and softened, and then 
scarified/milled to a specified depth. The critical issues involved in HIR plants and processes 
are the heating of the pavement surface, scarification, collecting and conveying the RBM 
to the mixer, addition of rejuvenators and fresh mixes into the mixer, proper mixing of all 
the ingredients, laying and paving of the mat and compaction. The HIR plants, therefore, 
should have all these facilities in one plant or should have a train of equipment performing 
different functions in a synchronized manner. Heating, material feed, mixing and laying are 
the processes to be strictly controlled. For example, heating of the surface has to be uniform 
and for that the number of preheating units is not as important as the length of the heating 
areas/hoods on each preheater. Similarly, the rejuvenator doses have to be metered and 
controlled. Where fresh mixes are added, its input quantities have to be controlled. HIR can 
be a single pass or multiple pass process. In single pass operation, the scarified in-place 
material is compacted and that is the end of the process. In multiple pass operation, the 
compacted mix is overlaid by fresh mix. The depth of treatment varies between 20 to 50 mm 
and the temperature of the mix in the range of 110-150 deg C. Schematic arrangement for an 
HIR plant is given in Photo 15.
10.  Full depth reclamation (FDR)
Full Depth Reclamation (FDR) is basically a cold mix recycling process in which different 
types of additives such as foam bitumen, bituminous emulsions and chemical agents such 
as cement, fly ash, and lime, including commercially available cementitious stabilizers are 
added, mostly in-situ, and compacted to obtain an improved base. The four main steps in this 
process are pulverization, introduction of additive, mixing, compaction, and application of a 
surface or a wearing course. If the in-place material is not sufficient to provide the desired 
depth of the treated base, new materials may be imported and included in the processing. 
New aggregates can also be added to the in-place material to obtain a particular gradation 
of material. 
	
●	
Pulverization should produce minus 40 mm size and should conform to the 
gradation as per IRC 37 for the purpose of stabilization.
	
●	
The Sand Equivalent (SE) value from the combined materials should not be less 
than 30%.
	
●	
Emulsion content, in case of bitumen stabilization should be such that indirect 
tensile strength in dry and wet conditions (100 mm specimen) is more than 
225 KPa and 100 KPa respectively and voids in the range of 6–8%.
	
●	
Resilient modulus for all stabilized material should be in accordance with the 
IRC 37.
	
●	
Stabilization should be done in-situ with suitable plants and equipment. Where it 
is not possible to have these plants and equipment (for smaller jobs), WMM plant 
can be used for mixing.

This method of recycling is normally performed to a depth of 100 mm to 300 mm.The 
train of equipment consists of recycling machine hooked to a water tanker and steel drum 
roller with pad foot shell. The advantages of full depth reclamation are that most pavement 
distresses are treated, hauling costs are minimized, significant structural improvements can 
be made (especially in base), material disposal problems are eliminated, and ride quality is 
improved.

11.  List of Recycling Projects in India
The lists of some of the projects executed in India is at Annex 2.
12.  Important parameters to ensure success of recycling.
The success of recycling projects would depend upon appropriate choice of the recycling 
option, proper design, and selection of recycling agents, capability of plants and equipment, 
and logistics of operation.
	
i.	
Choice of a suitable option: Recycling option has to be selected on the basis of 
strengths and weaknesses of each option. In-place option has a depth limitation 
of 50 mm (HIR) and 75 mm (CIR). In plant option is suitable for larger depths and 
multi- layer construction combining an overlay.
	
ii.	
Design: To arrive at a design and Job Mix Formula involves much more effort and 
many more tests and trials with different combination of RBM, fresh aggregates 
and recycling agents than are required in conventional design of hot or cold mixes 
because the design is highly sensitive to the properties of the RBM.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:120-2015
26
	
iii.	
Plant capabilities: The controlled addition of the JMF ingredients for preparing 
the mix is extremely important and the user of this technology should look for 
these capabilities in the plants and equipment proposed to be deployed on the 
project. Mechanical or hydraulic controls should be insisted upon as appropriate for 
components feeding the ingredients and the latter should be weighed or metered 
using electronic sensors. The processing parameters like heating, mixing, mixing 
time should have electronic controls, whereby these can be preset, and auto shut 
off facility when the set limit is exceeded (e.g. thermostatically controlled heat 
transfer with electronic heat sensors). The plants and equipment should have 
capabilities to ensure synchronized operation of various components, all controlled 
from a central control panel.
	
iv.	
Logistics of operation: This is another important consideration in the use of this 
technology, particularly in the in-place processes where the process has to be 
carried out at the site without disturbing the traffic. Each activity from production 
to completion should have a logistic planning so that the production process runs 
smoothly and after the mix is produced; there is arrangement for paving and 
compacting the mix within appropriate time limit.
While deciding upon Recycling treatment under any project, each of these aspects need 
detailed consideration. A complete technology package should be asked to be offered by the 
agency undertaking the work.

Annex 1
Guidelines for Mix Design, Construction and Quality Control for 
Cold in plant and Insitu Recycling using foam Bitumen Mixes
Annex 1 deals with various aspects of Recycling using foam bitumen. Appendix I to this Annex 
deals with design procedure, Appendix II with the Quality Assurance issues and Appendix III 
with how the Reclaimed Bituminous materials (RBM) should be managed. 
Bitumen for Foaming:
Bitumen used for foamed bitumen stabilisation shall be penetration grade bitumen complying 
with Indian Standard Specification for “Paving Bitumen IS: 73”. The grade of penetration 
bitumen shall be between 60 and 150. It is desirable to specify the grade in the contract. The 
bitumen should be free of any anti-foaming agent and should have the following minimum 
foaming characteristics (refer Appendix I):
	
Expansion ratio:	
8-10 times
	
Half-life:	
6 seconds
The temperature of the bitumen at the time of foaming should be between 160°C and 
190°C.
Water: Water used in the cold in-situ recycling process should be potable, clean and free of 
harmful matter.
Mixture Design
The mixture design procedure to be followed for foamed bitumen stabilised material is 
described under Appendix I to this Annex. Separate mixture designs shall be carried out for 
each different material combination that will be encountered in the construction. The results 
for each mixture design shall include:
●	
the temperature range at which the bitumen is to be foamed;
●	
the amount of water to be injected into the bitumen to achieve the required foaming 
characteristics;
●	
details for any blending with imported material requirements (material specification 
and blend ratio in volumetric terms);
●	
the application rates for foamed bitumen and filler as a percentage (by mass) of the 
material being treated;
●	
target strengths in terms of Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS) tests carried out on 
specimens prepared for Quality Assurance testing (as described in AnnexureII).
Tests specific to foamed bitumen stabilised materials are included in Annexure II. The following

additional tolerances shall apply to the foamed bitumen stabilised layer:
i)	
Consumption of stabilising agents and filler:
	
Application rates specified in the relevant mixture design ± 0.2%
ii)	
Strength of briquette or core specimens
	
Indirect Tensile Strength:	 	
ITSDRY value > 90% of the ITSDRY value specified in 
the relevant mixture design
	
Tensile Strength Retained:	
TSR > 80% of the TSR value specified in the 
relevant mixture design.
iii)	
Density: Densities shall be measured for the full layer thickness and related to the 
maximum dry density determined as per IS 2720 (Part 8) for the relevant blend of 
stabilised material. The average density of a “Batch” shall be related to the thickness 
of the layer and the underlying support conditions, as detailed in Table 1.

No individual density test result shall be less than that specified minus 2%.
Opening to Traffic
All traffic shall be kept off the completed layer of foamed bitumen stabilised material until 
the surface has dried out. Whilst under traffic, the surface of the completed shall be kept 
continuously damp during daylight hours by frequent light watering for at least three days. 
Thereafter and until the surfacing is applied, the surface shall be continuously monitored 
for signs of deterioration caused by the action of traffic. Where ravelling is detected, the 
surfacing shall be applied without delay, provided the moisture content of the stabilised layer 
has reduced to the required level. Alternatively, a temporary seal consisting of diluted emulsion 



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:120-2015
29
(as described in Section 510) shall be applied to protect the surface until the Bituminous is 
paved.
Delay before Covering
Application of the surfacing (surface dressing or Bituminous) or subsequent layer shall 
be delayed until the moisture content of the upper 10 cm horizon of the foamed bitumen 
stabilised layer, checked in accordance with IS 2720 (Part 2), has reduced to below 50% of 
the Optimum Moisture Content (OMC) determined as per IS 2720 (Part 8) for the relevant 
blend of stabilised material.
Dealing with Unforeseen Circumstances
Excess moisture: Where the in-situ moisture content of the material in the recycling horizon, 
checked in accordance with IS 2720 (Part 2), is in excess of the Optimum Moisture Content 
(OMC) determined as per IS 2720 (Part 8), the existing pavement shall be pulverised without 
any additives to a depth 5 cm above the required recycling depth (i.e. recycling thickness 
minus 5 cm). The pulverised material shall be left open to the atmosphere to dry. This drying 
process can be accelerated by frequently cross-blading the pulverised material with a motor 
grader, or with a plough.
After drying sufficiently (to below 75% of the OMC), the shape of the original surface shall 
be reinstated by grader and compacted to achieve a nominal 95% of the maximum dry 
density determined as per IS 2720 (Part 8). Thereafter, the recycling/stabilisation work may 
proceed.
Sub-grade instability: Where sub-grade instability is identified during the recycling process, 
it shall be treated by:
●	
recovering the material in the pavement layers overlying the unstable material 
by either milling or excavating and loading into trucks for transport to temporary 
stockpile;
●	
excavating the unstable material to the depth directed by the Engineer and disposal;
●	
treating the exposed roadbed, as directed by the Engineer; and
●	
backfilling the excavation using material from both temporary stockpile and imported. 
Backfilling shall be undertaken in 15 cm (nominal) thick layers, compacted to the 
relevant density target that will be directed by the Engineer. Successive layers shall 
be constructed until the level of the existing road is reached. The top two layers 
(30 cm) shall be constructed with stockpiled material, a portion of which shall then be 
recycled and stabilised.
Where the measures described above are deemed necessary, the Engineer will detail the 
requirements for the depth of excavation, treatment of the exposed roadbed, the quality of 
material to be imported as backfill and density requirements.

======================================================================
IRC:120-2015

Stockpiling the Treated Material: The mixed product may be transported to site and paved 
immediately or placed in stockpile for later use. Where it is placed in stockpile, care shall be 
taken to ensure that the following minimum requirements are met:
–	
the area on which the material is stockpiled shall be carefully prepared to avoid 
contamination from any source;
–	
the maximum height of stockpiled material shall be 3 m;
–	
moisture loss from the material in stockpile shall be prevented, either by covering the 
entire stockpile with an impervious sheet, or by spraying the surface of the stockpile 
with water every two hours between sunrise and sunset;
–	
no vehicles, front-end loaders or other equipment shall be permitted to drive on 
stockpiled material. Stockpiled material shall be maintained in as loose a state as is 
practical;
–	
samples shall be extracted from the stockpiled material seven (7) days after being 
placed in stockpile and, thereafter, every seven (7) days whilst the material remains 
in stockpile. Such samples shall be tested for moisture content and indirect tensile 
strength. Samples shall be taken from each 500 mm horizon below the surface of the 
stockpile to a maximum depth of 2 m;
–	
no material shall remain in stockpile for more than thirty (30) days unless the contractor 
can show by means of laboratory tests that keeping the material in stockpile for 
longer periods is not detrimental to the performance expectations of the final base 
course; and
–	
loading material from stockpile shall be undertaken by front-end loaders running on 
a thin layer of sacrificial mix on the stockpile floor. Loading shall be done in such 
a manner that the material is extracted from the base of a vertical face, thereby 
promoting mixing as the face collapses. All due care and diligence will be required by 
the contractor regarding the safety of plant and personnel during loading operations 
and to ensure that the stockpile is “made safe” at the end of work each day.

Appendix I to Annex 1
Mix Design Procedure for Foamed Bitumen Stabilisation
A1.1	
Equipment Requirements
The mix design procedure for foamed bitumen stabilisation requires a laboratory unit capable 
of producing foamed bitumen at a rate of between 50 g and 200 g per second. The method 
of production shall closely simulate that of full scale production of foamed bitumen on the 
recycling machine. The apparatus shall have a thermostatically controlled kettle capable of 
holding a mass of 10 kg of bitumen at a constant temperature between the range of 160ºC 
and 200ºC, ± 5ºC. The unit shall have an expansion chamber similar to that on the recycling 
machine in which cold water is injected into hot bitumen. Water injection shall be variable 
from 0 to 5% (by mass of the bitumen) with an accuracy of 0.25%. The plant shall capable 
of accurately discharging a predetermined mass of foamed bitumen directly into the mixing 
bowl of an electrically driven laboratory mixer with a minimum capacity of 10 kg.
A1.1.1	 Calibration of the Bitumen Flow Rate
For each different bitumen type and at each selected operating temperature, the rate at 
which bitumen is discharged into the expansion chamber shall be determined for pre-set 
discharge times ranging from 1 second to 10 seconds in 2 second intervals. This is achieved 
by discharging bitumen through the expansion chamber and into a sized bucket at each 



======================================================================
PAGE 40 of 72
======================================================================
IRC:120-2015
32
different pre-set time interval. The mass of bitumen for each time interval is determined by 
weighing and a graph of discharge vs. time plotted. This graph is used later to determine the 
time required to inject a specific amount of bitumen into a mix.
A1.1.2	 Checking the Water Flow Rate
The water flow rate is controlled by a manometer that is pre-set at the required flow rate (in 
litres/hr.). This is checked by setting the manometer at different flow rates and weighing the 
water that is discharged through the expansion chamber for a fixed period of time (normally 
30 seconds).
A1.2	
Determination of the Foaming Characteristics of Bitumen
The foaming properties of each bitumen type are characterised by:
Expansion Ratio. A measure of the viscosity of the foamed bitumen, calculated as the ratio of 
the maximum volume of the foam relative to the original volume of bitumen; and
Half Life. A measure of the stability of the foamed bitumen, calculated as the time taken in 
seconds for the foam to collapse to half of its maximum volume.
The objective is to determine the temperature and percentage of water addition that is required 
to produce the best foam properties (maximum expansion ratio and half-life) for particular 
bitumen. This is achieved at three different bitumen temperatures as follows:
Laboratory scale foam bitumen plant
Step 1	
Heat the bitumen in the kettle of the laboratory unit with the pump circulating the 
bitumen through the system until the required temperature is achieved (normally 



======================================================================
PAGE 41 of 72
======================================================================

IRC:120-2015
33
starting with 160°C). Maintain the required temperature for at least 10 minutes 
prior to commencing with testing.
Step 2	
Set the water flow-meter to achieve the required water injection rate (normally 
starting with 2% by mass of the bitumen).
Step 3	
Discharge foamed bitumen into a preheated (± 75 °C) steel drum (27.5 cm in 
diameter) for a calculated spray time for 500 g of bitumen. Immediately after the 
foam discharge stops, start a stopwatch.
Step 4	
Using a calibrated dipstick, measure the maximum height the foaming bitumen 
achieves in the drum. This is recorded as the maximum volume.
Step 5	
Use the stopwatch to measure the time in seconds that the foam takes to dissipate 
to half of its maximum volume. This is recorded as the foamed bitumen’s half-life.
Step 6	
Repeat the above procedure three times, or until similar readings are achieved.
Step 7	
Repeat steps 3 to 6 for a range of at least three water injection rates. Typically, 
values of 2 %, 3% and 4% by mass of bitumen are used.
Step 8	
Plot a graph of the expansion ratio versus water injection rate and half-life versus 
water injection rate on the same set of axes (see the example in Fig. A1.1). The 
optimum water addition is chosen as an average of the two water contents required 
to meet the minimum specified foaming properties.
Step 9	
Repeat steps 1 to 8 at two other bitumen temperatures (normally 170  °C and 
180 °C).

An example.
The temperature and the water injection rate selected shall be the lowest that produces foam 
with properties in excess of the minimum specifications. 
Notes.
1. 	
The temperature range for bitumen (prior to foaming) shall be a minimum of 160°C to a 
maximum of 200°C.
2.	
The maximum water injection rate shall be 5% by mass of bitumen.
3. 	
The minimum foaming properties that are acceptable for effective stabilisation are:
	
Expansion ratio:	
8-10 times
	
Half-life:	
	
6 seconds
	
If these minimum properties cannot be achieved within the limits stated in Notes 1 and 2, the 
bitumen shall be deemed to be unacceptable for use in foamed bitumen stabilisation.
A1.3	
Sampling and Preparation
A1.3.1	 Field Sampling
A1.3.1.1 In-situ Treatment: Where the depth of recycling is fixed, bulk samples (± 200 kg) of 
material from the recycling horizon are to be obtained from site using a recycler operating at 
normal speeds and settings. Where the depth of recycling is not known, field sampling shall 
follow the procedures described below for In-plant Treatment.
A1.3.2	 In-plant Treatment: Bulk samples shall be obtained during field investigations and test 
pit excavations. The layers in the upper pavement (± 300 mm) shall be sampled separately. 
A milling machine or recycler shall be employed for sampling layers of bound material 
(Bituminous and previously bound layers). At least 150 kg of material shall be sampled from 
each layer that may be included in the mix design.
A1.3.2.1	
Sample blending
Where necessary, blend the materials sampled from the different layers or from different 
sources to obtain a combined sample representing the material that will be stabilised. The 
in-situ density of field samples from different layers must be considered when blending 
materials, as illustrated in the boxed example below. Repeat the tests described in A1.2.1 
above to determine the grading and plasticity index of the blended sample.

A1.3.3	 Preparation of Samples for Mix Design Procedure
A1.3.3.1	
Standard soil tests
Determine the grading (IS 2386 Part 1), plasticity index (IS 2720 (Part 5)) and moisture/density 
relationship (IS 2720 (Part 8) for the sampled or blended material that is to be stabilised.
A1.3.3.2 	
Representative proportioning
Separate the material into the following four fractions:
	
Retained on the 19.0 mm sieve;
	
Passing the 19.0 mm sieve, retained on the 13.2 mm sieve;
	
Passing the 13.2 mm sieve, retained on the 4.75 mm sieve; and
	
Passing the 4.75 mm sieve.
Reconstitute representative samples in accordance with the grading (determined in A1.3.2.1 
above) up to the portion passing the 19.0 mm sieve. Substitute the portion retained on 
19.0 mm sieve with material that passes the 19.0 mm sieve, but is retained on the 13.2 mm 
sieve. The example in the table below explains this procedure:

If there is insufficient material for substituting that retained on the 19.0 mm sieve (i.e. material 
passing the 19.0 mm sieve but retained on the 13.2 mm sieve), then lightly crush the material 
retained on the 19.0 mm sieve to provide more of this fraction.
A1.3.3.3	
Sample quantities
The guidelines shown in the table below should be used for estimating the quantity of material 
required for the respective tests:
Test
Sample Quantity Required
Gradation (IS 2386 (Part1)) and Plasticity Index  
(IS 2720 (Part 5))
2 kg
Moisture/density relationship (IS 2720 (Part 8))
5 x 7 kg
Bituminous stabilisation design (100 mm diameter 
Marshall briquettes)
Minimum 10 kg per stabiliser content
Moisture contents
Approximately 1 kg
A1.3.3.4	
Hydroscopic moisture content
Two representative air-dried samples, each approximately 1 kg, are used to determine the 
hygroscopic (air dried) moisture content of the material. (Note: Larger sample size should 
be used for more coarsely graded materials.) Weigh the air-dried samples, accurate to the 
nearest 0.1 g, and then place them in an oven at a temperature of between 105ºC and 110ºC 
until they achieve constant mass. The hygroscopic moisture content is the loss of mass 
expressed as a percentage of the dry mass of the sample.
A1.3.3.5	
Active Filler Requirements
Bitumen stabilisation is normally carried out in combination with a small amount of active filler 
(cement or hydrated lime) to improve dispersion of the bitumen. The improved dispersion 
contributes to increased soaked strengths. 
Although the use of active fillers is recommended, in parts of the world, these agents are not 
readily available. In such cases, the use of crusher dust (minus 6 mm crusher tailings) or 
similar material can be used. 
For good quality materials, with retained strengths in excess of 80%, additional tests without 
active filler should be carried out during the mix design process. The results of these tests will 
allow a decision to be made as the whether the addition of an active filler is warranted. 
The following application rates (by mass) of hydrated lime or cement should be used as a 
guide.
Plasticity Index < 10
Plasticity Index 10 – 16
Plasticity Index > 16
Add 
1% 
ordinary 
Portland 
cement
Add 1% hydrated lime
Pre-treat with 2% hydrated 
lime



======================================================================
PAGE 45 of 72
======================================================================

IRC:120-2015
37
Pre-treatment requires that the lime and water be added at least 4 hours prior to the addition 
of the foamed bitumen. The treated material must be placed in an air-tight container to retain 
moisture. However, due to the hydration process, the moisture content should always be 
checked and, if necessary, adjusted prior to adding the bitumen stabilising agent.
A1.4	
Mixing the Prepared Samples with Foamed Bitumen
Step 1	
Place the required quantity of sample into a suitable mixing container 
(capacity > 10kg).
Step 2	
Determine the dry mass of the sample using equation A1.1

Mix the material, active filler and water in the mixing bowl until uniform.
Note:	 Inspect the sample after mixing to ensure that the mixed material is not packed against the 
sides of the mixer. If this situation occurs, mix a new sample with a lower moisture content. 
Check to see that the material mixes easily and remains in a “fluffy” state. If any dust is 
observed at the end of the mixing process, add small amounts of water and remix until a 
“fluffy” state is achieved with no dust.

sample, manufacture briquette specimens as soon as possible.
Repeat the above steps for at least four different foamed bitumen contents.
A1.5	
 Manufacture of 100 mm Diameter Briquette Specimens
Step 1	
Prepare the Marshall mould and hammer by cleaning the mould, collar, base-plate 
and face of the compaction hammer. Note: the compaction equipment must not be 
heated but kept at ambient temperature.
Step 2	
Weigh sufficient material to achieve a compacted height of 63.5 mm ± 1.5 mm 
(usually 1.15 kg is adequate). Poke the mixture with a spatula 15 times around the 
perimeter and 10 times on the surface, leaving the surface slightly rounded.
Step 3	
Compact the mixture by applying 75 blows with the compaction hammer (taking 
care to ensure the continuous free fall of the hammer).
Step 4	
Remove the mould and collar from the pedestal and invert (turn over).
	
	
Replace it on the pedestal and press down firmly to ensure that it is secure 
on the base plate. Compact the other face of the briquette with a further 75 
blows.
Step 5	
After compaction, remove the mould from the base-plate and extrude the briquette 
by means of an extrusion jack
Note:	 With certain materials lacking cohesion, it may be necessary to leave the specimen in the 
mould for 24 hours, allowing sufficient strength to develop before extracting.
A1.6	
Curing the Briquette Specimens
Place the briquettes on a smooth flat tray and cure in a suitable oven at 40°C until a constant 
mass has been achieved (normally 72 hours in a properly-packed forced-draft oven is 
required). Remove from oven after curing and allow to cool to 25°C.

A1.8	
Strength Test Procedures
A1.8.1	 Determination of Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS)
The ITS test is used to test the briquettes under two different moisture conditions: dry and 
soaked. The ITS is determined by measuring the ultimate load to failure of a briquette that 
is subjected to a constant deformation rate of 50.8 mm/min on its diametrical axis. The 
procedure is as follows:
Step 1	
Place the briquette onto the ITS jig. Position the sample such that the loading 
strips are parallel and centred on the vertical diametrical plane.
Step 2	
Place the transfer plate on the top bearing strip and position the jig assembly 
centrally under the loading ram of the compression testing device.
Step 3	
Apply the load to the briquette, without shock, at a rate of advance of 50.8 mm per 
minute until the maximum load is reached. Record the maximum load P (in kN), 
accurate to 0.1 kN.
Step 4	
Immediately after testing a briquette, break it up and take a sample of approximately 
1000 g to determine the moisture content (Wbreak).

for 24 hours. Remove briquettes from water, surface dry and allow to stand on 
a draining board at 25 °C ± 1°C for 30 minutes. Repeat steps 1 to 5 for each 
briquette.
Step 7	
Determine the Unsoaked ITS (ITSDRY) and Soaked ITS (ITSSOAKED) for each batch 
of briquette specimens by calculating the respective averages.

Interpretation of Test Results
To determine the “optimum foamed bitumen content”, plot the ITSDRY values, the ITSSOAKED 
values and the TSR values (three curves) versus the added foamed bitumen (see example 
below in Fig. A1.2).
The foamed bitumen added value that best meets the desired properties is regarded as the 
optimum foamed bitumen content. The desired properties are project specific, taking into 
account the type of material that is stabilised with foamed bitumen and the moisture regime. 
As a guideline, the minimum ITSDRY value for all pavements with a structural capacity 
in excess of 0.3 million ESALs shall be 225 kPa and Soaked ITS should be 100 kpa.

characteristics of each tanker-load of bitumen that is consumed. A quantity of foamed bitumen 
is injected from the test nozzle into a straight-sided container (normally a 5-second sample). 
The half-life is measured by taking the time for the foamed bitumen to reduce in volume 
to half the height of the maximum expansion noted in the container. The container is then 
set aside for at least 30 minutes or until the foamed bitumen has subsided completely and

sand replacement method (IS 2720 (Part 28)).
A2.3.4	 Strength Characteristics from Field Samples
The quality and uniformity of the foamed bitumen stabilised layer shall be assessed from 
samples taken on site, before compaction is applied. At least one bulk sample (±100 kg) shall 
be taken from the full depth of the layer for every 1500 m² of treated material. All samples 
must be retained in sealed bags for immediate transport to the laboratory. Field samples 
shall be taken to the laboratory within two hours of sampling and 100 mm diameter briquette 
specimens manufactured within four hours of being sampled. The procedures described 
below shall be followed.
A2.3.4.1	
Determination of the Moisture/Density Relationship
The Maximum Dry Density and Optimum Moisture Content (OMC) are determined from 
a representative sample as per the moisture-density relationship test (IS 2720 (Part 8)). 
(Generally one test per day is undertaken, unless a significant change in the material blend 
is noted, demanding that one test per material blend is carried out.)
A2.3.4.2	
Manufacturing Briquette Specimens
The material for manufacturing the briquette specimens shall be prepared as follows;
i)	
Determine the moisture content of the field sample.

19 mm sieve.
iv)	
Using a portion of the remaining field sample, extract the material retained on the 
12.5 mm sieve but passing the 19 mm sieve.

density of each briquette.
A2.3.4.5	
Determination of the Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS)
The procedures described under Item A1.8 in Annexure 1 shall be followed for determining 
the ITSDRY and ITSSOAKED values and the resulting TSR value. These values are then 
used to determine whether the material has met the minimum specified requirements.
A2.3.5	 Strength Characteristics from Core Specimens
Not sooner than 21 days after completing the foamed bitumen stabilised layer, 100 mm 
diameter core samples may be extracted from the full thickness of the layer and tested for 
ITS values
A2.3.5.1	
Extracting Core Samples
Only core barrels in good condition shall be used to extract samples of foamed bitumen 
stabilised material. A minimum amount of water shall be added whilst drilling and the rate 
of penetration of the barrel will be sufficiently slow to prevent damaging the sample. After 
extraction, core specimens shall be handled with care to prevent breakage.
A2.3.5.2	
Cutting Core Specimens
A rotary saw fitted with a large diameter diamond-tipped blade shall be used to cut 63 mm 
high specimens from the portion of the core that suffered least damage during extraction and 
handling. Where possible, more than one specimen should be cut from each core sample.
A2.3.5.3	
Curing the Core Specimens
The procedures described under Item A1.6 in Annexure 1 shall be followed for curing the 
core specimens.

core specimens to determine the ITSDRY and ITSSOAKED values and the resulting TSR value. 
These values are then used to determine whether the material has met the minimum specified 
requirements.
Note.	 Where the ITS results for briquette specimens are in conflict with those obtained from core 
specimens, the core specimen results after drying sufficiently (to below 75% of the OMC), 
the shape of the original surface shall be reinstated by grader and compacted to achieve a 
nominal 95% of the maximum dry density determined as per IS 2720 (Part 8). Thereafter, the 
recycling / stabilisation work may proceed.

Appendix III to Annex 1
Managing the reclaimed bituminous materials (RBM)
A 3.1	
Managing the Reclaiming Process
RBM may be obtained from several sources. The most common method is through cold 
milling operations, also known as cold planning/ Milling. Two other sources of RBM are full-
depth pavement demolition and bituminous plant waste. This section discusses the different 
types of RBM sources.
A 3.2	
Plant Waste
All bituminous plant operations generate some waste during plant start-up, transition 
between mixes, and clean-out. Generally, start-up and shut-down plant wastes have 
very low bituminous contents. Another form of waste is mix rejected from a project due 
to incomplete coating or due to the mix temperature being too high or too low for the job. 
Other situations that may result in wasted mix include trucks loaded with too much mix 
to finish the job or mix that could not be placed due to inclement weather. These waste 
materials are often stockpiled for later processing into a recyclable material. Since these 
waste mixes have not been subjected to environmental aging from years of service, the 
bituminous binder is less aged than RBM recovered from a road. Waste materials also 
have fewer fines than other sources of RBM since it was not milled or broken up during 
demolition. However, waste materials must be thoroughly mixed and processed to make 
them into uniform, recyclable materials. Waste materials are often combined with other 
sources of RBM in multiple-source stockpiles. Processing RBM from multiple sources is 
discussed in greater detail in the next section.
A 3.3	
Contamination
It is important that stockpiles be kept free of contaminants from the beginning. It easy to 
understand how bad perceptions of RBM form when there is dirt, rubbish, or vegetation 
in RBM stockpiles, or when trash is found in the mix when it shows up on the job site 
or pops out of the pavement a few days after paving. Treat RBM stockpiles as the most 
valuable material on the plant yard—because they are. Truck drivers bringing materials 
onto the plant yard must be clearly instructed where to dump their loads so that unwanted 
construction debris does not end up in the RBM stockpile and instructed that they should 
clean the truck beds before hauling millings or useable RBM. The plant QC personnel 
and the loader operator should also continuously monitor unprocessed and processed 
RBM stockpiles to make sure they do not contain deleterious materials. If contaminants 
are found, dig them out immediately so that they are not covered up with other RBM 
brought onto the yard.
A 3.4	
Processing and Crushing RBM
The basic goals of processing RBM are to

from various sources,
2)	
separate or break apart large agglomerations of RBM particles to a size that can be 
efficiently heated and broken apart during mixing with the virgin aggregates,
3)	
reduce the maximum aggregate particle size in the RBM so that the RBM can be 
used in surface mixes (or other small nominal maximum aggregate size mixtures), 
and
4)	
minimize the generation of additional P 200 (i.e., dust).
A 3.5	
Processing Milling Material.
Milled Material stock pilled after Milling
Millied Material. from a single project are usually very consistent in gradation, bituminous 
content, aggregate properties, and binder properties. Therefore, processing millings may 
only be necessary to achieve Goals #2 or #3. However, as noted previously, a common 
limitation to increasing RBM contents in bituminous mixtures is the dust content in the RBM. 
Since milled RBMs already contain appreciable amounts of P 200 (typically between 10% 
and 20%) due to the milling of the material from the roadway, it is best to minimize further 
crushing of milled RBM whenever possible. Therefore, when a contractor obtains a large 
quantity of millings from a single project, it is considered a best practice not to further crush 
this material, but rather to use it “as-is” in mix designs or to screen the millings to remove 
larger particles.

Millings: Recommended Processing Options
1.	
Receive millings from project.
2.	
Sample and test a few locations of the millings stockpile to determine the as-received 
gradation and check the maximum aggregate size.
3.	
If the maximum aggregate size of the as-received millings is small enough to use in 
the desired mix design(s), do not further process the millings. 
4.	
If maximum particle size is too large for desired mix(es), then either fractionate the 
RBM over a screen equal to or smaller than the NMAS of desired mix(es). Stockpile 
the fine RBM (portion passing through the screen) and test for properties, as described 
in Section
	
a.	
Stockpile the coarse RBM fraction(s) into separate stockpile(s) for use in other, 
larger NMAS mixes, or 
	
b.	
crush the millings so that they will pass the desired screen size.
This is the least desirable option because it will result in more uncoated faces of RBM 
particles and generate additional dust, which can severely hamper how much of the crushed 
RBM can be used in mix designs. When a contractor wants to increase RBM contents but is 
often limited by VMA requirements or the dust-to binder ratio during mix designs, Para 4 must 
become a primary consideration in his RBM-processing plan.

A 3.7	
Processing RBM from Multiple Sources
RBM materials from multiple sources that have different compositions must be processed to 
create a uniform material suitable for use in a new bituminous mixture. All around the world, 
contractors have found that they can make a very uniform and high quality RBM from a 
combination of pavement rubble, millings, and wasted mix. The key to achieving a consistent 
RBM from multiple sources is careful bending as part of the processing operations. A bulldozer, 
excavator, or similar equipment should be used to blend materials from different locations in 
the multiple-source RBM stockpile as it is fed into the screening and crushing operation. This 
will tend to “average-out” variations in the RBM from different sources. The site WMM Plant 
should be used for effective blending of the RBM to obtain homogeneous mix.
A 3.8	
Screening RBM during Processing
Since crushing RBM will create more aggregate fines, it is best to set up the crushing 
operation so that the RBM is screened before it enters the crusher. This will allow the finer 
RBM particles that pass through the screen to bypass the crusher. Fig. 8 shows a portable 
RBM crushing unit that is equipped with a screen deck in line before the crusher. Only the 
RBM particles retained on the screen will pass through the crusher.
Some RBM crushing units are set up so that all of the RBM is conveyed from the feeder bin 
into the crusher, followed by a recirculation circuit after the crusher. The recirculation circuit 
is designed to return larger particles that do not pass through the screen back to the crusher. 
However, since all of the material must go through the crusher in the first pass, there is a 
good chance that breakdown will occur for some smaller particles that did not need to be 
reduced in size.
A 3.9	
Crusher Types
A variety of crusher types are used for crushing RBM. Many contractors have found that the 
best type of RBM crushers are Track Mounted / horizontal-shaft impactors (HSI) with inbuilt 
pre-screen and inbuilt product screen so that desired over size product can be sent back to 
the crusher for further crushing to produce desired aggregate gradation. 
The speed and clearance of hammer mill crushers can be adjusted to reduce aggregate 
crushing. Some contractors have used milling machines to crush stockpiled RBM. There may 
be a risk of the milling machine overturning since the stockpile is uneven and may not provide 
stable support for the heavy machine. No data are available regarding the effectiveness of 
this method of processing in terms of size reduction or consistency of the RBM. However 
these are subject to the following conditions:
Compression-type crushers such as jaw crushers, and cone crushers also are found effective 
for fine sizing RBM. Hammer mill crushers tend to generate more fines due to the retention 
of the material in the chamber. The speed and clearance of hammer mill crushers can be 
adjusted to reduce aggregate crushing. Some contractors have used milling machines to 
crush stockpiled RBM. There may be a risk of the milling machine overturning since the

stockpile is uneven and may not provide stable support for the heavy machine. No data are 
available regarding the effectiveness of this method of processing in terms of size reduction 
or consistency of the RBM. However these are subject to the following conditions:
A 3.10	 Weather
Moisture and temperature can affect crushing and screening of RBM. When the RBM 
is wet and/or temperatures are hot, RBM will be stickier and tend to build up in feeders 
and crushers, blind screens, and RBM fines will stick to belts and accumulate under 
conveyors. Not only does this require more maintenance of RBM processing units and 
RBM feeder systems for mix production, it can also affect the gradation and bituminous 
content of the RBM.
A 3.11	 Fractionating
Fractionating is a process gaining popularity in which RBM is screened into typically two 
or three sizes. The sizes are typically 20 mm x 10 mm, 10 mm x 4.75 mm, and less than 
4.75 mm. In some cases, the plus 20 mm size material is returned to a crusher, and the 
crushed material is then returned to the screening unit. The primary advantage of fractionating 
RBM is that having stockpiles of different RBM sizes provides more flexibility in meeting mix 
design requirements.
The decision of whether or not to fractionate RBM into different sizes should be the mix 
producer’s choice and not a specification. Some agencies have recently begun to require RBM 
fractionation for higher RBM contents. This type of method specification is not appropriate; 
a better approach to assure consistency of RBM is to set limits on the variability of the RBM 
stockpiles.
A 3.12	 Moving the Processed RBM Stockpiles
In most cases, processed RBM will be moved from the location it is screened and/or crushed 
to another location more convenient to feed into the bituminous plant. This is another 
opportunity to remix the material and improve its consistency. Using the loader to dig into 
the RBM stockpile at the processing unit at different locations around the pile and remixing 
loads while building the stockpile at the final location can again be used to average out 
variations.
A 3.13	 Stockpiling to Minimize Segregation
As with virgin aggregates, there is a potential for RBM materials to become segregated in 
stockpiles. This is a common problem when stockpiles are built using fixed conveyors that 
allow the RBM particles to drop long distances to the stockpile. Larger particles have more 
kinetic energy and will tend to roll down toward the bottom of the stockpile. This results in 
more coarse particles with a lower bituminous content at the base of the stockpile and finer 
higher bituminous content RBM in the top of the stockpile. This problem can be minimized 
by using indexing-type conveyors that extend and raise the end of the conveyor as the size 



======================================================================
PAGE 62 of 72
======================================================================
IRC:120-2015
54
of the stockpile increases. If segregation is evident, a front end loader can be used to remix 
the stockpile.
A 3.14	 Stockpiling to Minimize Moisture
Moisture content of aggregates and RBM is a primary factor affecting a bituminous plant’s 
production rate and drying costs. Some contractors have implemented creative approaches 
to reducing moisture content in stockpiles. The best practice to minimize the accumulation of 
moisture in stockpiles is to cover the stockpile with a shelter or building to prevent precipitation 
from getting to the RBM. Second to that, it is a good practice to use conical stockpiles to 
naturally shed rain or snow, and to place the stockpile on a paved and sloped surface to help 
water drain from the pile. Irregular-shaped stockpiles with surface depressions that will pond 
water should be corrected by shaping the pile as it is being built with the front-end loader or 
a small dozer. However, the use of heavy equipment on the top of RBM stockpiles should 
be minimized to avoid compaction of the RBM. Likewise, it is also recommended that RBM 
stockpiles be limited to 3 m in height to reduce the potential for self-consolidation of the 
stockpile.
A 3.15	 In-line RBM Crushers or Crusher Circuits
RBM crushers or crushing circuits that are built into the bituminous plant’s RBM feed line can 
change the gradation of the RBM material being fed into the mix. Gradation test results on 
the stockpiled RBM then become meaningless, and the quality control personnel will have to 
make unnecessary, and probably substantial, mix adjustments to get the mix gradation and 
volumetric properties in specification during production start-up. In many cases, this could 
require a reduction in the RBM content in order to meet the quality control tolerances for the 
mix.
In-line roller crushers (also known as lump-breakers) and reduced-speed impact crushers 
designed to break up agglomerations of RBM rather than change the gradation are used 
by some contractors. It is recommended to conduct a simple extracted gradation check of 
RBM samples before and after the in-line crusher to determine if it is breaking down the RBM 
aggregate.

A 3.17	 Sampling and Testing the RBM
This section provides guidance on the best methods and practices for sampling and testing 
RBM as part of a quality management program. A well-executed sampling and testing 
plan for RBM is necessary to assess the consistency of the RBM stockpiles and to obtain 
representative properties for use in mix designs.
A 3.18	 RBM Variability
A common misconception exists that RBM stockpiles are highly variable and, thus, using 
higher RBM contents in new bituminous mixes will lead to more variability in the mixtures. 
However, well-managed RBM stockpiles have a more consistent gradation than virgin 
aggregates considering that RBM obtained from a single milling project in which the pavement 
was constructed of mixtures subject to high quality assurance standards, it is no surprise 
that the millings would have a consistent gradation, bitumen content, and binder properties. 
Less expected is how consistent RBM processed from multiple sources can also be just as 
consistent in gradation and bitumen content as millings. 
Sampling and Testing Frequency
Sampling for at least one set of tests per 1,000 tons of RBM is considered a best practice. 
This is generally more frequent than is required for virgin aggregates, but is appropriate for a 
component that will comprise a large portion of a bituminous mixture. A minimum of 10 tests 
should be performed on a RBM stockpile to yield good statistics for consistency analyses.
A 3.19	 Sampling Method
It is recommended that RBM stockpiles be sampled as they are being built at the location 
where they will be fed into the bituminous plant. Samples from the different locations should not 
be combined since the results from the different locations will be used to calculate variability 
statistics. Sampling at the time the stockpile is built will be easier and more representative 
of the stockpile compared to samples taken later, after a crust forms on the RBM stockpile. 
When a RBM stockpile has been in place for a while, it is generally difficult to dig into with 
a shovel. The best way to sample existing RBM stockpiles is with the assistance of a front-
end loader, as described in Section X1.2 of AASHTO T2 or ASTM D 75-03. This method is 
described and illustrated below.
1.	
Use a front end loader to dig into to the ready to use RBM stockpile.
2.	
Empty the bucket on a clean surface to form miniature sampling stockpile
3.	
Use the loader to back blade across the top of the mini stockpile to create a flat 
surface
4.	
Mini stockpile ready to be sampled 
5.	
Use a square-end shovel to obtain samples from the surface of the mini stockpile

6.	
Sample from three locations over the surface of the mini stockpile
7.	
Combine samples taken from the same mini stockpile. This sample will later be 
divided into test portions
8.	
Repeat this process to obtain samples at other locations around the RBM stockpile. 
Do not combine samples from different locations.
A 3.20	 Test Methods
For mix designs using RBM, the data needed from tests on the RBM are
1)	
bituminous binder content of the RBM,
2)	
gradation of the aggregate recovered from the RBM,
3)	
bulk specific gravity of the RBM aggregate,
4)	
consensus properties of the aggregate recovered from the RBM, and
5)	
(for high RBM contents) the RBM bituminous binder properties.
6)	
more than 35% RBM cannot be used if fine milling has been carried out at site.
In some cases, additional aggregate tests may be necessary. For example, if the RBM is to 
be used in a surface mix for high-speed traffic, some agencies may require tests to evaluate 
the polishing or mineralogical composition of the RBM aggregate. Typically, source properties 
such as LA abrasion and sulfate soundness tests are not necessary since it is unlikely that 
the coarse aggregates in the RBM would have come from sources not originally approved by 
the state agency.
A recent joint study by the University of Nevada Reno and NCAT examined several options 
for testing RBM to determine the best methods for determining many of the properties noted 
above. Three methods were used to determine bitumen contents and recover the aggregates 
for aggregate property tests: the ignition method, the centrifuge extraction method, and the 
reflux extraction method. Trichloroethylene was used as the solvent in the centrifuge and 
reflux methods. The results of the study indicate that
•	
The ignition method yielded the most accurate bitumen contents for the RBM and 
provided the lowest testing variability compared to the solvent extraction methods.
•	
The centrifuge extraction method had the smallest affect on the gradations of the 
recovered aggregate.
•	
The combined bulk specific gravity of the aggregates recovered by the ignition 
method was closest to the original materials, except for the soft limestone aggregate. 
In that case, the aggregate recovered from the centrifuge extraction was closest to 
the original material.



======================================================================
PAGE 66 of 72
======================================================================
IRC:120-2015
58
•	
The sand-equivalent and fine-aggregate angularity values for aggregates recovered 
from all three methods were different from the original materials. No consistent biases 
were evident to warrant making adjustments to the tested results.
•	
LA abrasion values for aggregates recovered from the centrifuge extraction were 
closest to the original values.
Additional tests on the extracted and recovered bitumen binder from the RBM may be required 
for mix designs that will contain more than 25% RBM. Current best practices for determining 
RBM binder properties are described in Chapter 3 of NCHRP Report 452. Several research 
studies are currently in progress to develop alternative procedures for determining RBM 
binder properties and methods for selecting the grade of the virgin binder for high RBM 
content mixtures:
A 3.21	 Methods for Determining RBM Bitumen Contents and Recovering Aggregates
Two options are recommended for determining RBM bituminous content and recovering 
aggregates: the ignition method and solvent extractions. Both methods have advantages and 
disadvantages. The following sections discuss the associated advantages and disadvantages 
of these methods. 
A 3.22	 Ignition Method
The most popular method for determining RBM bitumen contents and recovering aggregates 
for other tests is the ignition method, AASHTO T 308 or ASTM D 6307. Advantages of the 
ignition method include quick results, little testing time, and no solvents are needed. One 
issue with this method is that in order to obtain an accurate bituminous content for a sample, 
it is necessary to know the aggregate correction factor. For virgin materials, the aggregate-
correction factor is determined by testing samples with a known bitumen content. The 
difference between the known bitumen content and the test result for the prepared samples 
is the aggregate-correction factor. However, for RBM, it is not possible to have a sample with 
a known bitumen content and, therefore, not possible to determine the aggregate-correction 
factor. Fortunately, aggregate-correction factors are typically consistent over time when the 
aggregate materials used at the location are from the same quarry or deposits. Therefore, a 
historical average aggregate correction factor of the materials at a location can be used as 
the aggregate correction factor for the RBM.
RBM aggregates recovered from the ignition method can be used for gradation analysis and 
some other aggregate-property tests, but not all. Some aggregate types (e.g., dolomites) 
can have significant changes in mass when heated to 1000°F in an ignition oven. Small 
natural variations in the mineralogy of these aggregates create large variations in aggregate-
correction factors in the ignition oven (as high as 1% to 2%). Some agencies have altered 
the test to reduce the ignition oven temperature to minimize this problem. However, in some 
cases, agencies have elected simply to use other methods for determining bitumen contents 
and recovering aggregates for bitumen mixes in their jurisdiction. In these locations, the 
bitumen content for RBM samples should be determined using solvent extractions.

IRC:120-2015
59
Solvent Extraction
Solvent extractions with trichloroethylene or other solvents have been used for many decades 
to determine bitumen contents of bitumen mixtures and as a method of recovering aggregates 
for additional tests. However, use of the method has declined due to health and environmental 
concerns with the chlorinated solvents. Normal-propylene bromide and some non-halogenated 
(terpene or d-limonene based) solvents were found to be acceptable alternative solvents and 
are permitted in AASHTO T 164, but some problems were reported with the effectiveness 
of these solvents to remove polymer-modified bitumen binders. However, some agencies 
and contractors continue to use solvent extractions due to problems with highly variable 
ignition furnace aggregate correction factors or with the breakdown of certain aggregate 
types. Depending on aggregate characteristics, solvency power of the solvent, and hardness 
of the binder, solvent extractions may not remove all of the absorbed bitumen binder from the 
aggregate. Based on the published precision information, the repeatability and reproducibility 
of the ignition method are more than four times better than the solvent extraction method.
Aggregate Bulk Specific Gravity
An alternate approach to estimating the bulk specific gravity of the RBM aggregate discussed 
in NCHRP Report 452 (6) was also evaluated in the UNRNCAT study. This approach begins 
with conducting the maximum theoretical specific gravity tests (i.e., the Rice method) on 
samples of the RBM following AASHTO T 209. The effective specific gravity of the RBM 
aggregate is then calculated from the bitumen content and Gmm values determined from tests 
on the samples as follows.
The final step is to calculate the RBM aggregate bulk specific gravity using the formula:
where Pba (bitumen absorption) and Gb (binder specific gravity) have to be assumed. Historical 
values for Pba and Gb for the materials used at each plant location should be reviewed to 
determine if they have been consistent over time.
Advantages of this approach are that no solvent is needed (if the ignition method is used to 
determine the RBM binder content), and the method is much faster than recovering the RBM 
aggregate from the solvent extraction or ignition method and testing the aggregate specific 
gravities using AASHTO T84 and T85, like any other aggregate. However, the accuracy of 



======================================================================
PAGE 68 of 72
======================================================================
IRC:120-2015
60
this method is highly dependent on how well the percentage of absorbed bitumen can be 
estimated.
Due to the advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of the different methods for determining 
bitumen contents, recovering RBM aggregates, and determining their properties, it is 
necessary to have a couple options for testing. It is prudent for agencies and contractors to 
cooperate in establishing the best methods for the materials in their region or jurisdiction. The 
following flow charts present two reasonable approaches.
All test results should be recorded in a spreadsheet or software program to organize and 
summarize the data. The database should include stockpile name/description, date of samples, 
and for each sample, the results for bitumen content, gradation of recovered aggregate, and 
bulk specific gravity of the RBM aggregate. The spreadsheet should calculate the average 
and standard deviation of each property. It is necessary to collect and analyze test results of 
at least 10 RBM samples to estimate the statistics for the stockpile.
If more RBM is added to the stockpile, sampling and testing should continue at a frequency 
of one set of tests per 1,000 tons of RBM. Table 2 shows guidelines for standard deviations 
of key properties of RBM. The standard deviation statistic is a basic measure of variability. 
The median sieve is the sieve closest to having an average of 50% passing. Typically, this is 
the sieve with the largest standard deviation. In the example spreadsheet above, the median 
sieve is the 2.36 mm sieve.
These values are based on data gathered from contractors using many of the best practices 
in this document. Although excellent RBM-management practices are necessary to have 
standard deviations within these limits, published reports and recent surveys show indicate 
that they are attainable. If the variability of one or more properties exceeds the values in 
Table 2, the stockpile management guidelines in this document may be helpful in reducing 
the standard deviations. Also keep in mind that sampling practices can have a significant 
effect on variability results.
