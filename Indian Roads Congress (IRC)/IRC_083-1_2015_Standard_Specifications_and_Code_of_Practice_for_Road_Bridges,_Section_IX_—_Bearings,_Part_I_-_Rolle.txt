The “Standard Specifications and Code of Practice for Road Bridges: Section IX: Part-1: 
Metallic Bearings”, was first published in 1982. Its first revision was brought out in 1999 
based on Working Stress Design Method. The Second Revision of this publication based 
on Limit State Design Method was undertaken by the Bearings Joints and Appurtenances 
Committee (B-6). The B-6 Committee constituted a Sub-Committee to prepare the revised 
draft document.

The Sub-Committee prepared the revised draft document which was discussed in the 
meeting of B-6 Committee and the revised draft document was finalized for placing it before 
the Bridges Specifications & Standards Committee. The BSS Committee approved the 
revised finalized draft of “Standard Specifications and Code of Practice for Road Bridges: 
Section IX: Part 1: Roller & Rocker Bearings”, in its meeting held on 8th August 2014. The 
Executive Committee in its meeting held on 18th August 2014, approved the draft document 
for placing it before the IRC Council. The IRC Council in its 203rd meeting held at New Delhi 
on 19th and 20th August 2014, approved the document for publishing.
1  Scope
This part of the Code deals with the requirements for the design, manufacture, testing and 
maintenance of steel rocker and roller bearings for road bridges. The provisions of this Code 
are meant to serve as a guide to both the design and construction engineers. This Code 
covers single and multiple roller bearings and rocker bearings generally used in Highway 
bridges.
This part is not applicable to Segmental/Cut rollers or Sliding type bearings. Further, roller or 
rocker bearings made with material other than those specified in Clause 5 are outside the 
purview.
Bearings which are subjected to rotation greater than 0.050 radian under rare combination of 
action under SLS are outside the scope of this part of the Code.
1.1	
Usage
Although robust and durable, the usage of Steel bearings in road bridges is less common in 
India due to increased adoption of POT bearings or Disk bearings. However, they continue 
to be used in Steel bridges and in Rehabilitation works of old bridges.
The revised IRC:83-Part-1 is based on Limit State Design Philosophy. The design of the 
various components shall be based on serviceability and/or ultimate limit state, depending 
on the safety classification of the limit state in consideration.
 2  Definitions 
For the purposes this Code, the following terms and definitions apply.
2.1	
Anchor bolt
An Anchor bolt is an ordinary bolt anchoring the top and bottom plates to the structure.

8  Design  Considerations
8.1	
The design of rocker and roller bearings is based on the assumption that load 
passes through a Hertzian contact area between two surfaces of dissimilar radii. High 
stresses are induced when a load is applied to two elastic solids in contact. Hertz developed 
a theory to calculate the contact area and pressure between the two surfaces and predict 
the resulting compression and stress induced in the objects. Design verification with respect 
to vertical loading and, longitudinal forces  and resulting  rotation with or without movement 
under most critical combination of actions shall be done. The bearings shall be designed 
to withstand the maximum vertical reactions and longitudinal force under the most critical 
combination of Actions. Provision shall also be made against any uplift to which the bearings 
may be subjected under the action of the above forces.
8.2	
Loads and Forces
All the actions and their combination in accordance with Tables 3.1 to 3.3 of IRC:6 are 
considered for design of bearings.
The provisions in Para 8.4 of the Code for additional rotations and  movements, including 
those  of slender/tall  supporting structure shall be considered for reliability.
The provisions in Para 8.5 are considered for  minimum movements for strength analysis at 
ULS.
Performance and durability of bearings designed according to this part of the code are based 
on the assumption that requirements established as relevant, are complied with.
The design values of the effects (forces, deformations, movements) from the actions on all 
the supports of the structure shall be calculated from the relevant combination of actions 
according to IRC:6-2014.
8.3	
Movements
Roller bearings accommodate translation in longitudinal direction only. Single rollers permit 
rotation about line of contact but multiple rollers require additional elements to accommodate 
rotation.
In addition to design movements and rotations, increased movements for reliability and 
minimum movements for strength analysis are considered as follows:
8.4	
Increased Movements for Reliability
	
a)	
Rotation
	
	
± 0.005 radians or ± 10/r whichever is the greater (r is radius measured in 
mm);
	
b)	
Translation
	
	
± 20 mm in both directions of movement with a minimum total movement of 
± 50 mm in the direction of maximum movement and ± 20 mm transversely 
unless the bearing is mechanically restrained.



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 37
======================================================================
IRC:83-2015 (Part-I)
14
These requirements only apply for the design of movements capacities. They shall not be 
used where stresses are being calculated. 
Note 1 :	
Where movements are small their calculation tends to be approximate. This applies 
	
to most rotational movements and to small translational movements. The purpose of 
	
this clause is to ensure that in such cases there is an adequate margin in the bearing 
	
design to ensure that a small error in calculation or setting does not lead to a serious 
	
malfunction of the bearing.
	
c)	
Temperature
	
	
While specifying the magnitude of the translation and rotation for bearing 
design,  the bridge designer shall account for the contingency factor viz. 
construction tolerances, variation with respect to the mean temperature at 
the time of installation.
	
d)	
Creep and Shrinkage
	
	
Appropriate assessment as per Clauses 6.4.2.6 and 6.4.2.7 of IRC:112 are 
to be considered.
8.5	
Minimum Movements to be Considered for the Strength Analysis at ULS
For the strength analysis of the bearing at ULS the resultant rotational movement shall be 
taken as not less than ± 0.003 radians and the resultant translational movement  not less 
than ± 20 mm transversely unless the bearing is mechanically restrained.
Note 2 :	
Particular care should be taken when calculating bearing movements if the result is 
	
obtained from two large movements of opposite direction (difference between large 
	
numbers). The most adverse combination of factors should be assumed to give the 
	
maximum possible movement. Special care should also be taken to account for the 
	
reversing movements such as those due to thermal expansion/contraction and 
	
seismic effects.
9  Dimensioning  of  components
9.1  	
Dimension of Roller
The ability of curved (rocker and roller) surfaces and plates to withstand deformation under 
load is dependent upon the hardness of the material of which they are made. Although, 
there is no constant relationship between hardness and yield stress of steel, but one exists 
between hardness and ultimate strength. Consequently the following expressions are based 
on the ultimate strength of the material.
The design axial force per unit length of roller contact N’Sd shall meet the following condition 
under the fundamental combination of actions:
	
N’Sd ≤ N’Rd 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
where,
	
N’Rd = N’Rk/γ2 
m is the design value of resistance per unit length of roller contact.
	
N’Rk is the characteristic value of resistance of the contact surface per unit length
	
N’Rk = 23 x R x fu

Rotational eccentricity 	
Eccentricity caused by the rotational movement of the bridge e2,d = αd R
Note:	 Other eccentricities can co-exist with those detailed in this clause and designers should be 
aware of the possibility of their existence. In general their effects are small compared with the 
above and can be ignored.
9.9.2.4	
Eccentricity due to rotation movement of multiple rollers
Multiple roller bearings have no inherent rotation capacity. Design rotation moment, MSd, is 
therefore determined by the characteristics of the additional rotation element designed in 
accordance with the appropriate part of this part of the code the design eccentricity resulting 
from the action of this rotational element shall be calculated in accordance with the relevant 
part of this part of the code.
Design eccentricity e2,d  shall be considered when determining the individual roller design 
loads and in determining the total design eccentricity on the structure.
	
e2,d = MSd/NSd

Transverse eccentricity
In the absence of any transverse rotation capability a transverse eccentricity of L/10 shall be

eccentricities.

Length of Rollers
The length of a roller shall not be less than twice its diameter nor greater than six times its 
diameter. The minimum diameter of roller is 100 mm
9.10.2	
Multiple Rollers
Where a bearing has more than one roller an additional element in accordance with other 
parts of this code shall be included to accommodate rotation. The effects of any rotation 
movements from this element shall be included when calculating the roller forces by taking 
into account the corresponding eccentricities. The load per roller shall be calculated at the 
extreme of the expected movement. In addition where a bearing has more than two rollers 
the limiting values for design load effects shall be taken as two-third of the value.
9.10.3	
Corrosion in the contact line
If the materials used for the roller and roller plates are not intrinsically corrosion resistant then 
other provisions shall be made in the design to prevent corrosion in the area. These measures 
may take the form of grease boxes, oil baths, flexible seals or other methods which can be

shown to be effective or which have been found satisfactory during use. Where dissimilar 
materials are used in combination the effects of electrolytic corrosion shall be considered.
9.10.4	
Alignment of components
Provision shall be made to ensure that bearing components remain correctly aligned with 
each other and clamped together between manufacture and installation. Temporary transit 
devices and devices intended to maintain alignment during installation shall not be used to 
locate the structure.
9.10.5	
Alignment of bearings
It is particularly important that the axis of the rolling element is correctly aligned in the structure 
and accurate alignment marks defining the axes of the roller shall be indelibly scribed on 
outer surfaces of accessible plates.
9.10.6	
Design coefficient of friction
The design friction coefficient μd shall be taken as 0.02 for steel with a hardness ≥ 300 HV 
and 0.05 for all other steels.
Note: The coefficient of friction for rolling contact surfaces of rollers used for structural design 
purposes can be determined by test. Test results should be increased by a factor of 2 to give 
a design coefficient of friction to allow, for the long-term effects of wear, corrosion protection 
and accumulation of debris. 
9.10.7	
Anchor Bolt
All the longitudinal forces from the super-structure are transmitted to the supporting structure 
through the fixed end of bearing. Any friction between the bed block and base plate or saddle 
plate and bottom chord/soffit is completely ignored and the entire horizontal force is assumed 
to be transmitted by the connecting bolts. The bolts are thus checked against shear failure 
and also for safe bearing stresses. The permissible shear or bearing stresses for different 
grades of steel.
9.10.8	
Combination with Other Elements 
When a roller bearing is combined with elements from other parts of this code the characteristics 
and kinetics of all elements and their interaction, together with their stiffness, movement and 
eccentricities of the adjacent structural components shall be considered.
10  WORKMANSHIP  AND  TOLERANCES

All surfaces of the major components like top plates, saddle plate, base plates, 
rollers of the bearings shall be machined all over for correct alignment, interchangeability,

Testing
11.2.1 
The manufacturer has to produce test certificate from original producers of 
raw materials used in the manufacture of the bearings. Irrespective of the producers test 
certificates, the manufacturer will carry out the detailed tests on raw materials (both physical 
and chemical) for different types of raw materials used in the manufacture of the bearings as 
per relevant codes for such raw materials. For this purpose they will identify stock materials 
with certain batch number and draw samples from such stock materials and mark the same 
with same batch numbers. For each batch, 3 sets of samples will be drawn separately for

Guidelines as per IS:7666 with acceptance standard as per IS:9565 could be referred to. To 
ensure the reduction ratio, macro-etching test will be conducted on the integral test piece 
(per heat) attached to anyone of the forging.
11.2.4	
All bearing shall be tested to 1.25 times design load. Recovery should be 
100 percent. Contact surfaces and welding shall be examined by illumination 
source/ultrasonic test/DPT for any defects/cracks etc.

bearings supplied for conformity of test results submitted.
11.2.6.1	
In case there is any major discrepancy regarding materials, Engineer may declare 
the whole lot of bearings as unacceptable.
12  INSTALLATION  OF  THE  BEARINGS
12.1	
General Considerations
Bearings are positioned between lower and upper cover plates which are anchored/connected 
to the sub-structure and super-structure. The cover plates remain fixed to the structure while 
the bearings are replaced.
12.1.1	
The area below bearing shall be levelled by a thin 1:1 cement mortar layer or non 
shrink pre-packed type ( of thickness < 12 mm) just before placing of bearing assembly or 
bottom plate on the concrete seat. On supporting structures, pockets shall be provided to 
receive the anchor bolts. Appropriate method for leveling / grouting of the bearing to both 
beams and pedestal structure shall be adopted. The pocket shall be filled with non-shrink 
grout.
12.1.2	
Positioning of Bearings 
12.1.2.1	
Roller and rocker bearings shall be placed so that their axes of rotations are 
horizontal and normal to the direction of movement of the members they support, upper and 
lower bearing plates shall be set horizontal in both directions.
12.1.2.2	
During installation the bearings shall be positioned with respect to the bearing axis 
to account for the movements due to the following :
	
i)	
Temperature variation between the average temperature prevailing at the 
time of installation and the mean design temperature.
	
ii)	
Shrinkage, creep and elastic shortening.

12.1.2.3	
For bridge in gradient the bearing plates shall be placed in a horizontal plane.
12.3	
Precautions During Construction 
12.3.1	
In Segmental construction where  launching of girders is employed, it is likely 
that slipping or tipping of rollers occur due to vibrations or jolts, It is suggested that the roller 
bearings be provided after launching operations or otherwise adequate measures taken 
to ensure that the roller assembly is not disturbed. It is normal practice to provide rocker 
bearings on the launching end and place the beam on the rocker end slightly in advance of 
placing on the roller.
12.3.2	
During concreting of girders, the bearings shall be held in position securely by 
providing temporary connection between the top and bottom plates in case of fixed bearings, 
and between top plate, saddle plate and base plate in case of a roller-cum-rocker bearing or by 
any other suitable arrangement which prevents the relative displacement of the components. 
The bearing plate shall be kept level during concreting.
12.3.3	
In pre-stressed pre-cast girders where recesses are left on the underside of girders 
to receive the anchor bolts, grout holes extending to the beam sides or to the deck level shall 
be provided. The grout shall have a cement mortar mix of 1:1.
13  INSPECTION,  MAINTENANCE  AND  REPLACEMENT  OF  BEARINGS 
13.1	
Inspection 
Each bearing assembly and the adjacent members in contact shall be inspected at least 
once a year by qualified Bridge Inspectors to ascertain their actual condition. A provision for 
access to the bearings seat on sub-structures shall be made during the design of the bridge 
for inspection and maintenance.
The following aspects shall be inspected
	
a)	
Adequacy for free movement
	
b)	
Correct positioning
	
c)	
Uncontrolled movements
	
d)	
Fracture, cracks and deformations of parts of bearings
	
e)	
Cracks in pedestals and in adjacent locations of Sub and Super-structure
	
f)	
Condition of anchorage, sliding and rolling surfaces
	
g)	
Corrosion of components
	
h)	
Seizure due to dust and non-lubrication
 
i) 
Special inspection after unusual occurrences like heavy traffic movement, 
earthquakes, and impacts from floating debris during high floods.
Necessary records of inspection shall be maintained as per standard format

13.2	
Maintenance
The bearings shall be cleaned, lubricated and coated with paint after each monsoon season. 
Provision shall be made for jacking up of the super-structure so as to allow for adjustment 
repair/replacement of rollers of the bearing.
Suitable remedial measures are taken immediately, if defects are noticed and replacement of 
bearings done in the event of irreparable damage to any part.
13.3	
Replacement
To replace any bearing, the superstructure of the span has to be lifted by one or more hydraulic 
jacks. Stiffening of diaphragm at the jack point may be needed to prevent splitting tension of 
concrete. Steel girders may need additional stiffeners. The construction drawings must show 
the jacking locations, maximum lifting force and the level upto which the deck may be safely 
lifted. More than one jack would be needed to evenly lift the super-structure. Flat jacks are 
also used when the clearance between diaphragm and pier/abutment top is less.
The hydraulic jacks have to be equipped with a sliding device if replacement of a bearings takes 
a long time which result in displacements of moveable bearings. Particular care is required 
when replacing bearings which transmit horizontal forces. A restraint to the movements is 
provided by appropriate devices.
