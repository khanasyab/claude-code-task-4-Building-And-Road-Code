A  Policy  On  Roadside  advertisements
1.  INTRODUCTION
Lack of control on hoardings or display of advertisement 
panels (including wall panels on roadside structures) leads 
not only to creation of traffic hazards but often also causes 
serious detriment to local amenity and the general aesthetic 
characteristics of a neighbourhood.
1.2	
At present the desired measure of control is either 
not exercised or is only partly exercised.
1.3	
Advertisements can often effectively distract the 
attention of drivers of motor vehicles and in that case are a 
public hazard or nuisance. They may also obstruct the view 
of the drivers of fast moving vehicles and are then a public 
danger.
1.4	
When they become an eyesore or otherwise are an 
"injury to amenity", they interfere with public rights and can 
be logically prohibited on that ground.
1.5	
As such, control of roadside advertisements 
is justified on the multiple grounds of protecting public 
investment in highways, ensuring safety of the road users 
and preserving local amenity. In addition to enforcement, it 
is desirable that there should be a voluntary acceptance of 
this principle.
1.6	
This standard was originally prepared by the 
Specifications and Standards Committee and published 
in 1953. Partly for conversion into metric system, and 
partly for making other changes in the light of comments 
received from different agencies such as the State Public

Works Departments, Municipalities, Institute of Town 
Planners and Indian Standards Institution, a review of the 
Policy was taken up by the Committee at its meetings held 
in 1966 and 1967. Later on, the Policy was revised in the 
light of the discussions at a number of meetings of the 
committee and the final draft was approved by them in their 
meeting held on the 29th and 30th September, 1972 and the 
Executive Committee approved it in the meeting held on 
25th November, 1972. Later on, it was finally approved by 
the Council in the 79th meeting held at Gandhinagar on the 
same date. This revised standard takes into account the 
different foreign Practices.
2.  ADVERTISEMENT  CONTROL
2.1	
"ADVERTISEMENT", in the following paragraphs, 
means any word, letter, model, sign, placard, board, notice, 
device or representation, whether illuminated or not, in the 
nature of, and employed wholly or in part, for the purpose 
of advertisement, announcement or direction (excluding 
any such thing employed wholly as a memorial, road sign 
or railway signal).
2.2	
"Advertisement" 
includes 
any 
hoarding 
or 
similar structures used or adapted for the display of 
advertisements.
Note:-	Any sign-post, bus sign, name plate, warning sign, etc., 
not being on a vehicle, will be included under the head 
"Advertisement", the dictionary meaning of the word 
being "public announcement".
2.3	
The following paragraphs discuss the principles 
which should be applied before consent is given to the 
erection of advertisements on road lands or on structures

adjoining the roads. They also cover the cases where 
advertisements on private land adjoining a road may 
destroy amenity or endanger public safety.
3.  PRINCIPLES  OF  ADVERTISEMENT  CONTROL
3.1	
What may be Considered as Objectionable
3.1.1	
In 
general, 
advertisements 
should 
not 
be 
permitted: 
(1)	
at or within 100 m of any road junction, bridge or 
another crossing. In urban areas, this distance may 
be reduced to 50 m, provided there is no conflict 
with the requirements stated further on;
Note:-	The safe stopping distance for a vehicle travelling 
at a speed of 50 km/hr. is 60 m. This should be the 
''uninfluenced distance" for a driver approaching a 
junction. Assuming that 3 seconds is the time during 
which the influence of an advertisement board persists, 
the distance travelled in this time will be about 40 m. The 
sign should, therefore, be more than 100 m away from 
the junction. Hence 100 m is suggested.
(2)	
in such manner and at such places as to obstruct or 
interfere with the visibility of approaching, merging 
or intersecting traffic:
(3)	
within 10 m of the edge of a carriageway;
Note:-	A distance of 10 m may be taken as the normal minimum 
setback from the edge of the carriageway, the maximum 
area of the advertisement being 0.3 sq.m. for every metre 
of setback.
(4)	
within 50 m along the road, of any sign board erected 
for the regulation of traffic under the orders of a 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:46-1972
4
Public Authority such as a Traffic Authority, a Public 
Transport Authority, or a Local Authority;
(5)	
in such a form as will obscure or hinder interpretation 
of any sign, signal or other device erected for traffic 
control by the Public Authorities. For instance, the 
advertisements should not imitate or resemble, in 
colour or shape, the standard legal traffic signs, or 
employ such words as "STOP" in the same manner 
as used on traffic signs;
(6)	
on boards, placards, cloth banners or sheets hung 
across a road as they distract the attention of the 
driver and are, therefore, hazardous;
(7)	
in such form as will obstruct the path of pedestrians 
and hinder their visibility at crossings;
(8)	
within right-of-way of the road;
(9)	
when these will affect local amenity.
3.1.2	
Illuminated 
advertisements 
of 
the 
following 
description are objectionable from the angle of traffic safety 
and should not be allowed:
	
a)	
advertisements which contain, include or 
are illuminated by any flashing, intermittent 
or moving light or lights except those giving 
public service information such as time, 
temperature, weather or date;
	
(b)	
Illuminated advertisements of such intensity 
or brilliance as to cause glare or impair vision 
of the driver or pedestrians, or which otherwise 
interfere with any operations of driving.
	
(c)	
advertisements illuminated in such a way as 
to obscure or diminish effectiveness of any 
official traffic sign, device or signal.

3.2	
What may be Considered as Affecting Amenity
3.2.1	
From aesthetic considerations, the display of 
commercial advertisements should be strictly controlled 
where either the general characteristics of the locality are 
predominantly those of a residential neighbourhood or 
where natural scenery or public improvements are thereby 
likely to be depreciated.
3.2.2	
The frontage of buildings of a dignified and 
subdued character such as hospitals, educational 
institutions, 
public 
offices, 
memorials 
of 
national 
importance, places of worship, etc., should be protected 
from the vandalism of commercial advertisements.
3.3
