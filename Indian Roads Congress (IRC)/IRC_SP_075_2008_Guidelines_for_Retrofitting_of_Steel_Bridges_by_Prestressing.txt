GUIDELINES FOR RETROFITTING OF STEEL BRIDGES
BY PRESTRESSING
1. INTRODUCTION
1
. 1
The Guidelines for Prestressed Steel Bridges has been under the consideration of Steel
Bridges Committee since March, 2003. A Sub-cgmmittee under the Convenorship of Shri B.C.
Roy with Dr. H. Subba Rao, Dr. B.P. Bagish and Shri S. Chatterjee was constituted to draft the
Guidelines. The draft Guidelines prepared by the Sub-committee was extensively deliberated in
the various meeting oferstwhile Steel Bridges Committee (B-7) till December, 2005.
1 .2
The Steel Bridges Committee was reconstituted in January, 2006 and retitled as Steel and
Composite Structures Committee (B-5) ofthe Indian Roads Congress with following personnel:

1 .3
The newly constituted Steel and Composite Structures Committee (B-5) in its meeting
held on 12.5.2007 at Kolkata has finalised the draft "Guidelines for Design of Prestressed Steel
Road Bridges" and recommended its placement before the Council through BS&S Committee.
1.4
The draft document "Guidelines for Retrofitting of Existing Prestressed Steel Road
Bridges" was approved by the Bridges Specifications and Standards Committee in its meeting
held on 3^^ June 2007 and Executive Committee in its meeting held on 7^^ June, 2007. The
document was approved by the IRC Council in its
1 82^^ meeting held on
1 8^^ August, 2007
NITHE, Noida for printing subject to minor modifications and also changed the title of the
document as "Guidelines for Retrofitting of Steel Bridges by Prestressing"
.
1.5
Most of Steel Bridges
in India have been and are being constructed by the
local
authorities, State PWDs, National Highway Divisions, Indian Railways by using steel bridge
code ofIndian Railways and recommendations ofIRC:24 Section V-Steel Road Bridges.
1.6
With the increasing requirement of large span superstructures over rivers, gorges or
other locations where no intermediate support is available, prestressed steel bridge system may
offer fast and economic solutions for vehicular as well as pedestrian bridges.
1.7
In view ofthe above it is felt necessary to develop a design guideline for prestressed steel
bridges. Guidelines are intended to lay down the requirements for design and construction of
prestressed steel road bridges.
1.8
Taking into consideration the fact that Prestressed Steel Road Bridges have not been
used widely internationally and there are only few case studies available in the country,
it is
intended that this guideline be used only for retrofitting of existing steel road bridges, which are
found to be in distress or which require further augmentation of capacity due to changed design
consideration. Wide use of this guidelines for new bridge work will only be permitted after
successftal use ofthese guidelines for some more time.
2. DEFINITION OF PRESTRESSING
The term 'prestressing' in the text denotes application of predetermined concentric or
eccentric force to a steel structure/member so that the state of stresses in the members resulting
from the applied force counteracts the stresses due to other external loads and keeps the resultant
stresses in all the members within specified limits.
3. SCOPE
Prestressing of steel bridges can be done by various means such as by pre-deflecting the
structure, imposing intentional deflection at the supports, by lack of fit, and other methods
mentioned in references (2) & (3).
However, these guidelines deal mainly with specific requirements of simply supported
superstructures
of prestressed
steel
bridges
using
prestressing
tendons.
These
shall
be
considered as complementary to the requirements contained in IRC:24-2001. The types of
bridges covered in this documents are:

15. COMBINED STRESSES
15.1
In
addition
to
the
usual
load
combinations (as periRC:6-2000) the
following load combinations shall also be checked
:

16. LATERAL STABILITY
A prestressed steel member behaves like a beam-column and shall be treated
as
a
column
loaded
by
an
eccentric
axial
force.
Column
stability
of
the
member
and
lateral torsional
buckling
of
the

regard
shall
be
paid
to
all
the
losses and
variation
of
stress
resulting
from
relaxation
of
tendon,
friction,
slip,
anchorage
and
elastic
shortening/elongation of member between anchorages

18.1
Loss of prestress due to relaxation of tendon shall be considered as per
Clause 11.4 of IRC:18-2000.
18.2
Loss
of prestress due
to
friction
shall
be considered
only
in case of
cun/ed/bent
tendons
at
the
point
of
mechanical
guide
provided
to
maintain the
inclination and change of direction.
Suitable mechanical
diverters/pulleys/guides
are
to
be
fixed
to
the
structure
to
provide
smooth curves at bends of tendons.
18.3
For
angular
change
in
profile,
the
loss,
which
depends
on
the
configuration,
type,

material
of the
cable,
shall
be
taken
into
account.
19. FATIGUE
In addition to standard requirements' of fatigue checking and fatigue detailing
applicable to steel
bridges as per IRC:6
, IRC: 24 & IS:800, special attention
shall be paid to stress raisers in tension zones such as corners, sharp notches,
abrupt changes
in thickness of flange/web plates, anchorage
locations, web
adjacent
to
deviators
where
the
prestressing
cables
do
not
extend
the
complete
span
length
to
bearings,
and
other
such
locations
of
stress
concentration.
Cables may
be
prone
to
fretting
fatigue
at
deviator
locations.
In
general,
cables are prone to fatigue over time due to the continuous variation
in
self
stressing force with passage of vehicles.

prestressed
by
a

DETERMINATI0^4 OF A BENDING MOMENT
Considering those parameters for an optimum girder cross section, wliich may take a maximum

Equations (Al,23) and (A1.24) indicate that from a bending moment M due to an external load,
it follows that the force due
to
prestressing X and increment of stress
at the top edge and
bottom tendon are equal to an allowable stress F.
By introducing into equations (A1.23) through (Al".25) a factor p

We solve equations (A1.26) and (A1.27) with respect to the design bending moment M after
eliminating

using
equation
(Al,28) and
expressing
their geometric

An analysis shows that by assuming w = 0.55

The above assumptions produce an error in the maximum value of the bending moment of less
than 1%.
If the assumed value

flexibility of the web k

to calculate with the aid of equation (A1.35) the required

EFFECT OF VARIOUS LOADINGS ON OPTIMUM

We now consider three types of girder loadings as follows: the moments acting at supports, an
uniformly distributed load, and a concentrated load at mid-span (Fig. Al 4.01),
The
general
expression

a

OPTIMUM DESIGN OF PLATE GIRDERS
Optimum design of prestressed plate girders may be summarized as follows;
1,
2.
3.
4.
5.
Tne choice of girder cross section should be made considering
its maximum
carp/ing
capacity under total loading.
The tensioning
of the tendons should be maximum
to
realize the complete
carrying
capacity of the girder.
Considering the effective prestressing, the magnitude of the additional prestressing AX
under live load
is very Important. Keeping the same cross section of girder will increase
the capacity of the whole system.
The increase of AX depends on the tendon configuration and
its length- AX
increases
with the straight and shorter tendons installed along bottom flange of the girder.
An increase
in girder height and reduction of web thickness leads
to the reduction of
girder weight.
25



======================================================================
PAGE 34 of 74
======================================================================
IRC:SP:75-2008
6.
It
is advantageous to design prestressed girder as an asymmetric section, using a larger
top
flange.
This
is
because
at
the
prestressed
girder
top
flange
participates more
intensively
and
the
resulting
displacement
of the
neutral
axis upward
increases
the
eccentricity of the tendon.
7.
The load carrying capacity and the
rigidity of the structure may be increased by use of
multistage
prestressing,
in which the
prestressing and
the
loading
of
a
structure
are
carried out in several steps.
A1.6
DEFLECTION
Prestressed
girders are more prone
to deformation
in
their elastic range of behavior than are
conventional
girders
as
they
generally have
a
smaller
sectional
area and
therefore
a
lesser
moment of inertia, hlowever, the positive characteristics of prestressing are as follows:
•
The stiffness of the girders are increased
»
Prest: essed girders usually have substantially smaller deflections
•
A girder may have a smaller construction depth, although
its stiffness
will be the same
as that for a girder without prestressing
The design deflection of a prestressed girder in bending
is calculated as follows:
^ = ^D.
/, --1-4/
(A1.58)
where
zl^^.^
=
a non-prestressed girder deflection under dead and
live loads
and
A'^i
-
the reverse deflection of a girder due to prestressing of the tendon
1.
The deflection due to dead and
live loads
will be determined by conventional formulas
from statics considering a non-prestressed girder.
2.
When a tendon
is placed at the bottom cross sectional area of a simple span girder and
is prestressed, a deflection originates
in an upward vertical deflection. A deflection due
to dead and
live loads
is then produced
in the opposite direction.
The deflection due
to prestressing
is calculated by applying the virtual work method using the
general equation
r_^_A^//+ \-^k-dl
(A1.59)
where
and
A',
are
the
moments
and
axial
loads,
respectively,
produced
by
the
corresponding
loads
on
the
statically
determinate
structure. The
term
nij^
represents
the
moment under the virtual
unit force applied
in the direction
in which the deflection
is sought.
The second term
in equation (A1.59)
is applied when parabolics of polygonal tendons are used.
However,
it is usually neglected because
its order of magnitude is relatively small.
The determination of a prestressed girder deflection
is shown for a simple span girder,
havin<
Its tendon shorter than
its span,
in Fig. Al.6.01
The bending moment due to force
, as shown
in fig. Al. 6. 01(a),
is
M^,^-X^e
(A1.60)
where
X, =
X + AX ,\hQ total tendon force
X and AX = the prestressing and increment of prestressing force in a tendon, respectively
e =
the eccentricity of a tendon force with respect to beam centroidal axis x-x

BUCKLING STRENGTH OF PLATE GIRDERS
Stability of Plate Girder Bottom Chord during Prestressing
Analysis of the behavior of a steel member prestressed by a tendon installed along the center of
gravity of the member and connected to
it at separate points proved that the member loses its
stability only between tendon connections. The tendons are usually connected to the girder at
certain intervals by means of diaphragms,
ribs, clamps and other types of grips which allow a
longitudinal
displacement
of
the
tendon
but
prevent
the
girder
from
buckling
during
prestressing.
The safety may be calculated by checking the bottom chord for buckling using formula
cy^<(pcT
'
(A1.64)
where
cp
is the coefficient of lateral bending or buckling determined based on the flexibility of
the girder chord with respect to the vertical axis with the free length of the bottom chord equal
to the spacing between points of connection of the tendon to the bottom chord.
Determination of the coefficient of lateral bending
According to the Euler formula the critical stress of buckling
is
n^E
rc^E
"
^c. = —-r
—T-
•
(A1.64)
X
The ratio of critical stress to the allowable stress of given steel may be expressed as follows
. ^ = -^ and a,,=(pcj^ii
(A1.65)
However, the Euler formula
is valid only until stress a^^ remains within the proportionality limit.
For. structural
steel with a proportionality
limit of 30x10^
psi and E = 30x10^
psi, we find from
equation (A1.64)
- = VlOOO;r^ = 1 00
(Al .66)
Hence, for ///-< 100
Euler's formula
is not valid.
In this case the values of coefficient
cp
are determined on the basis of empirical data given by
the Navier formula
(p =
,
(A1.67)
l + 0.00008(//r)^
The diagram

Fig. Al.7.01

Length of the Tendon in Girders Stressed by a Live Load
The length of the tendon
in girders stressed by a
live load
is established as a function of the
distance a from the bearing to the beginning of the tendon. This distance depends on the two
requirements as follows.
The Maximum Distance, ^max
The maximum distance
a^^^
is found from the condition that the cross section of the. girder at
the point of tendon anchoring
is required to withstand the acting bending moment. At this point
the girder cross section is considered without the tendon.
Before,
a^^^
is attained, the strength of an asymmetric cross section
Is checked on the value of
stresses in the bottom chord
The
admissible value
of moment
may
be
calculated and the maximum
value
of amax
determined graphically, provided that the envelope of the diagram of moments are available
if
the cross section as given by formula (A1.73)
is l^nown.
If the cross section has not yet been
selected, the value
of the moment
at the anchor
location may be found
in terms of
maximum desian moment M
a.s follnw?.

The Minimum Distance,
The minimum distance
a„„.„
is found considering that the increment of stresses
in the bottom
chord at the end point of tendon should be tensile for any position of live load. The stresses are
then checked for safe values.
If the tendon
is anchored near the bearing, the live load may be positioned on the girder so as
to produce a greater increment of stresses
cr^
in the bottom chord of the girder due
to the
compression increment of the tendon than the increment of tensile stresses
o-^ due to live load.
In this case the compressive stresses due to prestress X
(generally equal to
cr ) add up with
the resultant compressive stresses due to the action of external
load, with the effect that the
bottom chord
is overstressed.

ANALYSIS AND DESIGN OF A PRESTRESSED TRUSS
(Notations used are different from those in text)
Introduction
Statrc Truss
arrsiysis may be performed
in two
cases, namely,
individually
prestressed
truss
members and those trusses with tendons that prestress several members individually,
A2.1
Prestressing of Individual Members
In the first stage, the truss
Is analyzed under a given loeding without considering prestressina.
In
the
second
stage,
those
members
acting
in
tension
are
designed
considering
their
prestressing.
The
cross
section
of the
prestressed members
is designed by applying the
intensity of the
calculated force as follows. Assuming that the member
is not loaded by external forces (owri
weight and live load), the general expressions faetvveen the prestress and cross-sectionai areas
of the member and tendon ay be.written as follows:
X^-Af^AJ',
(A2.0i)
where X

From equation (A'l-Ol), the stresses in the member and tendon are:

A,
The stresses given by equation (A2.03) are only those stresses v/ithout an external
load. By
applying an external axial tensile load,
I'
, the stresses in the member and tendon become
where
=
the axial force in a member due to external load
=
the axia! force in a tendon due to external load
The following condition should be satisfied
F-^ F^ + F^
(A2.04)
The'eiangat^ons' of the pmstressed member and tendon should be equal. According to Hook'f
law, we have
m

By designating with a = EAjE^A^

F and

Due to external tensile force F
s tensile stress originates
in the member which reduces the
magnitude of force

In the tendon, the stresses do not change signs, but rather increase
due
to
the
tensile force

Since the member and tendon elongation should be
equal, we
obtain

By substituting
tlie expression for X from equation (A2.10) into equations (A2.11) and (A2.12)

A check

is
prestressed under such conditions that the- member is loaded by external loading.
To obtain the minimum amount of material, the cross-sections of the prestressed members and

b.
Coefficient of overloading,

is used
in following two cases:
•
during checking of the member under prestressing, without external loading;
•
during checking of the member when the tresses under externa! loading coincide by
sign with the prestressing.
c.
The coefficient «2 = ^-9
is used during checking of the member under external loading,
when the stresses are greater and have the reverse sign of the prestressing.
d.
In the case of safe and direct control of the prestressing,
= «2 = 1
.
e.
During design of the member having a tendon of steel cable, and safe and direct control
is assured, the values of these coefficients are
~ 1.05 and
^2 = 0,95
.
II.
Basic Design Assumptions
Th3 rigid member and tendon working together are a statically indeterminate system. For their
analysis
it
is necessar/
to assume the
distribution
of the material between
rigid member and
tendon as follows;
(\-K) = ^-
Y^A = ,l^A,„
{ALU)
where A,
arid ^„ are the cross sectional areas of the tendon and member, respectively.
The required total cross sectional area
is
(l„^)+A-A

is

(A2.24)
where
(p
is the coefficient of the longitudinal bending of the member, used
in the range 0.9-
0.95.
The force in the tendon acting under total design force under external loads
is

where

are the moduli of elasticity of the tendon and member, respectively.

n^

coefficients of overloading and underloading

With the above design method, optimal use of metal or cost of the prestressed member requires
repetition
of design
procedure.
However,
it
is
possible
to
eliminate
repetitive
design
by the
following method. Considering the total design carrying capacity of the member and tendon, we
may write
Zn,+AF,^,=f,A,

.
(A2.30)
Equation
(A2,29)
relates
to the tendon and equation
(A2.30)
to the member. By solving the
system of equations (A2.29) and (A2.30), we obtain the following formulas for the design of a
prestressed truss member

prestressing force.

A2.2 A TRUSS HAVING A BOTTOM CHORD STRENGTHENED BY TENDONS
A2.2.1
General
Prestressed trusses are considered as statically indeterminate systems where an increase of the
tendon force
is tal<en as an additional unknown. Applying the usual prestressing method with a
straight tendon, the magnitude of the tendon force depends on the -assumed cross section of a
truss member,
its external load, and the tendon cross section (Fig. A2,01)

To calculate the optimum
carrying
capacity, the tendon
is located underneath of the tpottom
chord. In this case for many members of the truss, the required cross-sectional areas may be
reduced.
Irrespective of slight stiffness of truss members and irrespective of large loading, the
total deflection of one prestressed truss
is generally smaller than the deflection of the equal but
not prestressed truss.
