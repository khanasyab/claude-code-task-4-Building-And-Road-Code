PROFORMA FOR RECORD OF TEST  
VALUES OF LOCALLY AVAILABLE  
PAVEMENT CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS
1.  INTRODUCTION
1.1	
There is need for carrying out extensive surveys 
of locally available pavement construction materials with a 
view to their optimal utilisation in road projects and achieving 
greater economy in construction costs. For making best 
use of information from such surveys, it is essential that the 
sampling anti testing of materials, as also recording of test 
results, be done in a systematic manner without omitting 
any important aspect.
1.2	
Towards this end, the Soil Research Committee 
(now called Soil Engineering Committee) personnel given 
below, had developed certain standard Proforma for 
recording test results and other relevant particulars of the 
pavement construction materials. These have been vetted 
further by the Specifications and Standards Committee 
in their meetings held on the 8th December, 1970 and 
18th & 19th November, 1971 and approved by the Executive 
Committee in their meeting held on the 26th and 27th April 
1972. Later, the Standard was approved by the Council at 
their 78th meeting held at Nainital on the 10th July, 1972.

The Proforma are intended for application at the 
pre-specifications stage by way of guidance to the survey 
and design staff and not for purpose of quality control during 
construction.
2.  SCOPE
2.1	
The Proforma recommended relate to locally 
available pavement construction materials such as road 
stones, slag, low-grade aggregates and soil-gravel 
mixtures. There are three separate Proforma, I to III, as 
under:
Proforma I:	 For record of test values of hard aggregates; 
Proforma II:	For record of test values of low-grade/soft 
aggregates; and
Proforma III:	 For record of test values of naturally occurring 
soil-gravel/moorum mixtures.

3.  NOTES  ON  THE  USE  OF  PROFORMA
3.1	
The Proforma are meant essentially to aid the 
design engineer in evaluation of locally available materials 
for incorporation in different pavement courses and, in 
addition, framing of realistic cost estimates. Accordingly, 
these have been developed with an eye on the 
specifications generally in use.
3.2	
For proper correlation, the Proforma should be 
accompanied by an index map drawn to a suitable scale. 
On this map, the material sources should be distinctly 
marked. The map should also show existing haul roads for 
working out costs.
4.  SAMPLING  AND  TESTING
4.1	
Before extracting samples, the material source 
should be closely examined and subdivided into groups 
as necessary, depending on variability of the material, so 
that representative samples may be obtained from each. 
For each class of material three specimens should be 
taken from each sample, preferably by quartering, and the 
requisite tests performed for completing the Proforma.
4.2	
To have uniformity in testing, reference has been 
drawn in the Proforma to relevant Standards of Indian 
Standards Institution, British Standards Institution or Indian 
Roads Congress as applicable.
