Standard  Letters  And Numerals  Of  
Different  Heights  For  Use  On   
Highway  Signs
1.  Introduction
1.1	
Letters and numerals of different heights are 
required for use on various high way signs such as the 
kilometre stones, route marker signs, informatory signs, etc. 
To meet this need, charts for standard letters and numerals 
given herein had been prepared by the Specifications and 
Standards Committee which were approved by the Executive 
Committee at their meeting held on 24th September, 1968 
and finally by the Council at their meeting held at Bombay on 
2nd November, 1968, for general adoption on a national 
basis. The size range for which dimensions of letters and 
numerals are given is 5-30 cm.
2.  SHAPES  OF  LETTERS/Numerals
2.1	
The shapes of standard letters and numerals are 
shown in Plates I and 2 respectively. The dimensions of 
different components of standard letters, for various sizes, 
are indicated in Table 1. Similarly the dimensions for 
standard numerals are given in Table 2.
2.2	
All characters having an arc at top or bottom are 
extended slightly above or below the line of the other letters. 
This is in accord with the accepted practice for rounded 
letters and numerals.

Table 3  Spacing between Standard Letters or  
Numerals of Different Heights
Note:	 To determine the proper spacing between letters or numerals, 
obtain the code number from Tables 3 (a) and 3 (b) and enter 
Table 3 (c) for that code number to desired letter or numeral 
height. Spacing is measured horizontally from the extreme 
right edge of the preceding letter/numeral to the extreme left 
edge of the following letter/numeral.

3.  SPACING  BETWEEN  ADJACENT   
LETTERS/NUMERALS
Table 3 gives the recommended spacings between 
adjacent letters/numerals of different sizes. The space 
between any combination of letters/numerals may be 
obtained through a two-step process described in the 
footnote to the Table. This space is the distance measured 
horizontally between the extreme right edge of the preceding 
letter/numeral and the extreme left edge of the following 
letter/numeral. No part of any letter/numeral may extend 
into this space.
4.  USE  OF  STANDARD  LETTERS/NUMERALS
4.1	
Most Public Works Departments and sign 
manufacturers should find it advantageous to make up a 
set of templates of light metal or other suitable material for 
letters/numerals of different sizes to simplify the laying out 
of signs.
4.2	
In some cases design of a particular letter or 
numeral in a given size may be found incompatible with the 
manufacturing process involved in the production of signs. 
When that happens, minor modifications to shape/spacing 
may be made within reasonable limits.
