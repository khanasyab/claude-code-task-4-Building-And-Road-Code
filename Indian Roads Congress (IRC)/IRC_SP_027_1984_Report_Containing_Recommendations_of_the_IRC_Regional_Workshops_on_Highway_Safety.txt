FOREWORD
It
is
unfortunate
that
the
accident
rate
in
our country
is
one of the highest in the world.
It is also rather disturbing that the
percentage
of
fatal
accidents
is
also increasing steadily and now
stands
at
more
than
15
per
cent
as
compared
to
10 per cent
only
a
de'cade
back.
Over
20,000
lives
are
lost every year on
our
roads
besides
injuries
to
thousands
of people
and
huge
economic
losses
in
terms
of damage
to
vehicles
and property.
The need for ensuring greater
safety
on
our
highways
is,
there-
fore, of the utmost importance.
The
Indian
Roads
Congress
have
been
deeply concerned
with the subject of Highway
Safety.
In
pursuance
of
a
decision
of
the
Council
in
their
85th
meeting held at Hyderabad on the
3rd January, 1976
the Indian
Roads
Congress
organised
Work-
shops
on
Highway
Safety
in
six
regions
of
the
country
at
Chandigarh,
Trivandrum,
Lucknow,
Bombay,
Calcutta
and
Gandhinagar.
With
a
view
to
have
interaction
between
the
various
disciplines
necessary
for
tackling
problems
of
highway
safety,
specialists from other walks of life, such as administrators, planners,
professors,
police
and
transport officers and scientists apart from
highway engineers, were invited to participate in these
workshops.
A number of useful suggestions were thrown up in these workshops
which
are now
being
brought
out
in
the
form
of
a
Special
Publication.

INTRODUCTION
1.1.
The
rapid
socio-economic
development
taking
place
in
the
country
since
Independence
has
brought
in
its
wake a
large
expansion
of
the
transportation
system.
Of
the available
modes
of transport,
road
transport,
because
of
its
easy
avai-
lability,
flexibility
in
operation,
adaptability to individual needs,
door
to
door
service
and
reliability,
has become
increasingly
popular
and
its
share
in
the
total
transportation load has been
steadily increasing. Over the past 30 years,
the
number
of
regis-
tered
motor
vehicles
has
increased
by
14
times,
the
freight
traffic
by
4.6
times
and
passenger traffic by 5 times as could be
seen from Tables
1.1. and
1.2. According
to the projections of the
National
Transport
Policy
Committee,
the
mechanised
road
transport is poised
to
handle freight
and
passenger
traffic of the
order
of
185
billion
tonne km
and
800
billion
passenger km
respectively by
the
turn
of
the
century.
In
a situation like this,
it is
becoming
increasingly important
to
ensure
that
all
possi-
ble
measures
are
taken
for
making
road
transport
safe
and
free-flowing.

1.2.
Accident Scenario
The
phenomenal
growth
of road
transport
has
brought
along
with
it
the
serious
problem
of
traffic
accidents.
There
has
been
an
increasing
trend
in
the
number of road accidents
as well as casualties from year to
year.
Over
the
last
20
years,
the number
of
accidents
has gone
up
by
1.8 times, the number
killed
by
4.2 times and the number injured by 2.5
times
as
indi-
cated in Table
1.3. On an average, over 400 reported road accidents
take
place
every
day
leading
to
about
70
persons being killed
and
300
injured.
Besides
this,
a
sizeable number of accidents,
mostly of minor nature go unreported each day.
1.3.
A
further
analysis
of
the
data
reveals certain speci-
fic features of road accidents in the country.
The
five
metropoli-
tan
cities
of Bombay,
Banglore,
Calcutta,
Delhi
and
Madras

account
for about 30 per cent of the total accidents in the country
as could be
seen from Table
1.4. As regards the
types
of persons
killed,
occupants
of motor vehicles
constitute about 41 per cent,
pedestrians
40
per
cent
and
cyclists
7 per
cent.
If data for the
metropolitan cities alone are considered,
the
proportion
of pede-
strian and
cyclist
casualties
are much higher. Fault of driver of
motor
vehicles
has
been
found
to
be
responsible
for about 50
per cent of the accidents while the corresponding
figures in respect
of pedestrians and cyclists are about 9 per cent and 4 per cent res-
pectively. Another revealing feature
is
that
majority
of the
fatal
accidents are due to fault of drivers of heavy vehicles.

Note
: Figures in parenthesis indicate percentage
1.4.
Compared
to
some
of
the
developed
countries, the
number
of
accidents
in
India in absolute terms may be low, but
the accident rate in terms of unit
number
of motor
vehicles
bri-
ngs
out
a
disturbing
picture.
For
example,
in
the years 1979,
the number of fatalities
per
10, 000
vehicles
ranged
between
2
and
5
in
countries
like
Japan,
U.K.
and
U.S.A., while in the
case of India,
it was as high as 55 as indicated in Table 1.5. Looking
from
another
angle,
while
there
were
only 2
to 5 fatalities per
100
accidents
in
these
countries,
the
figure
was
as
high as 16
for India, a matter of serious concern indeed.

Introduction

1.5.
The
high
and
growing
accident
rate
in
the country
and the consequent loss to life
and
property
have
a
serious im-
pact
on
the
national
economy. A
detailed analysis of road acci-
dent
cost
recently
completed
as
a
part
of the Road User Cost
Study
in
India*
showed
that the overall cost
of road accidents
in
the
country
during
the
year
1978
amounted
to
Rs.
2367
million,
based on an estimated cost of Rs 49,804 per fatal accident
and Rs 29,510 per accident leading to serious injuries - see Table 1.6.
This
works
out
to
roughly
0.35
per cent of the GDP.
If under-
reporting
of accident
cases
and
limited
demand
on
claim Tri-
bunals are taken
into
account,
the
actual
accident
cost
would
be
much
higher.
This
is
a
serious
matter
which
the country
can
ill afford to neglect.

Accident Causative Factors
'*Road accidents do not just happen
but
are
caused"
is
a
common
cliche
in the area of traffic safety.
Thus, if accidents are
caused by some agents, surely they could be identified and appro-
priate remedial
measures
developed and implemented
for
their
prevention to the extent feasible and for
the
reduction
of the
ill
effects and trauma of the accidents
still happening. As brought out

s
Introduction
earlier,
analysis
of
the
data
on accidents in the country exemp-
lify that driver of the
motor
vehicle
is
the
single
major
factor
responsible
for
the
accidents.
This
must
be
the
result
of
his
misjudgement,
or
his
inattentiveness
to
perceive
the
situation
ahead
because
of his poor reflexes, fatigue, inexperience or being
under
the
influence
of
intoxicants.
There
are,
however,
other
factors
which
contribute
directly
or
mdirectly
to the accidents.
These are:
(i)
the road,
(ii)
the vehicle, and
(iii)
the road users
1.7.
If road
factor
is
analysed,
it may
be
seen
that
it
has
several
ramifications.
First
is
the
planning
of
the road in
relation
to
the
land
use
pattern,
and
here
the
town
and
eountry
planners
have
an
important
role
to
play.
Second
is
the
geometric
design
of the road and provision of skid-free pave-
ment surfacing for safe movement of vehicles which fall under
the
purview
of highway
engineers. Third
is the provision of suitable
traffic guidance and control
system
like
signs
signals,
pavement
markings
and
delineators
which
concern
traffic
engineers
and
traffic management
specialists.
Fourth
is
the landscaping of the
road environment and
provision
of
resting
facilities
for
vehicle
drivers
so
that
they
are
kept alert while driving and this aspect
is looked after by landscaping engineers and architects.
1.8. As regards the
vehicle,
its
fitnesss
or
roadworthiness
is
most
important
from
traffic
safety
angle.
Control
over
its
fitness
and
its
conformity
with
the
legal
provisions is exercised
by transport officials and
the
police.
1.9.
The
road
user
group can be
broadly
classified
into
three
categories,
namely,
the
pedestrians,
the
drivers
of non-
motorised
vehicles
and
the
drivers
of motorised
vehicles. The
first two catogories are not governed by
any
specific
traffic
regu-
lations
and
generally
drivers
of slow
vehicless do not feel obli-
ged to
acquire
any
formal
knowledge
of
the
traffic
rules
and
regulations.
For
these
groups
of people, concerted effort is war-
ranted in educating them of the
correct
behaviour
on
the road,
and
on
this
educationists
and
mass
media
have a vital
role to



======================================================================

play. As regards the drivers of motor vehicles,
it
is
a
question
of
adherence
to
he
stringent
licensing
procedures as prescribed by
law
and
enforcement
authorities
responsible
for
the
driving
rules
and
regulations.
Here,
licensing
authorities and the police
come into the picture.
1.10.
Thus, the problem of traffic
safety
cannot
be
looked
at
in
isolation but as a system requiring attention at several fronts
and involving action by several disciplines.
1.11.
Highway
Safety
Workshops
Organised by the
Indian
Roads Congress
Traffic
accidents
having
grown
into
serious dimensions as
brought
out
earlier,
the
Indian
Roads
Congress,
the
national
body
of highway
engineers,
has
been looking into this
problem
with deep concern and has been taking a
series
of
actions
on the
professional front directed towards bringing an awareness amongst
politicians,
administrators,
engineers
and
other
concerned
authorities,
developing
recommendations
and
measures on acci-
dent
prevention,
and
dissemination
of knowledge
in the
field.
A
panel
discussion on
"Highway
Safety Through
Engineering
Techniques"
was
organised
during
the Annual
Session
of the
Congress
held
at Madras
in
December,
1970.
Another
panel
discussion
on
highway
safety
was
held
at Amritsar in January,
1982. However, the major thrust on
the
subject
was made
with
the
organisation
of
a
series
of inter-disciplinary Highway Safety
Workshops in different parts of the
country.
Six
such Workshops
were
held,
the
first
at
Chandigarh
in January, 1977 the second
at Trivandrum in October, 1977 the
third
at Lucknow
in
Nove-
mber
1978
the
fourth
at Bombay
in December, 1979 the fifth at
Calcutta
in
November,
1980
and
the
sixth
at
Gandhinagar
(Gujarat)
in
September-October,
1982.
The
most
important
feature
of
these
workshops
was
the
active
particpaction of the
operating officials and
specialists
of the
various
disciplines
con-
nected
with
traffic
operation and traffic safety such as the police,
transport and licensing officials, town
planners,
research
workers
and
highway
engineers.
The
idea
was
that
the safety problem
which requires attention and
action
of
the
various
departments
and
organisations
should
be
discussed
in
all
its facets
so that
effective
and
workable
solutions
could
be
evolved
for
direct

Introduction
application.
As
envisaged,
these Workshops generated very use-
ful
discussion,
and
a number
of
important
recommendations
arising
therefrom have been circulated amongst the State Govern-
ments and other concerned authorities from time to time.
1.12.
Scope of this
Publication
This
Publication
is
intended
to
serve
as a ready reference
book for guidance of adminstrators,
engineers
and
other
officials
who are concerned with traffic safety and
in the implementation of
the
traffic
safety
programmes.
Section 2 gives the consolidated
summary
of
the
recommendations
of
the
six Highway Safety
Workshops
organised
by
the
Indian
Roads Congress.
Some of
the
recommendations
are
self-explanatory in
nature and can be
implemented
directly.
For many others,
explanatory notes have
been
included
in
Section
3 of
this publication
for providing a
detailed
discussion
of the
related aspects and guidelines on
the
actual
implementation
of the corrective measures.
This Section
has been prepared
from the
current knowledge
on
the
subject
and from what is considered as good engineering practice.
As the
experience
grows,
this
section
would
need to be reviewed
and
updated in the years to come.

CONSOLIDATED SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE IRC
HIGHWAY SAFETY WORKSHOPS ORGANISED AT CHANDIGARH,
TRIVANDRUM, LUCKNOW, BOMBAY, CALCUTTA AND
GANDHINAGAR
2.1.
Engineering Measures to Improve Road Safety
2.1.1.
Boad geometries
(i) Uniform
design
standards recommended by the Indian
Roads
Congress
for
planning
and
designing the align-
ment of roads should be adopted.
(ii) While designing
the
alignment,
kinbs in the
horizontal
and
vertical
directions
should
be
avoided,
horizontal
curves
provided
with as
large radii as
feasible, and the
alignment
both in the
vertical and
horizontal directions
sulitably co-ordinated so as to provide aesthetically pleas-
ing profile with
built-in safety.
(iii) Necessary
sight
distance
as appropriate to the situation
should
be
provided at horizontal/ vertical curves and at
intersections.
Availability of the required
sight distance
should
be
periodically
checked
for
removal
of all
obstructions.
(iv) On existing roads, locations/sections having
substandard
geometries
such as
narrow pavement,
inadequate sight
distance,
sharp
curvature, etc. should be identified and
effective steps taken for
their
rectification.
Besides spot
improvements
of
the
defective
locations,
a thorough
study
of
these
should
be made while taking up major
improvements
to the
road/pavement, and the correction
of the geometric deficiencies should be made as a part of
the project itself.
2.1.2.
Road intersections
(i) In the design of road intersections, adequate care should
be taken
to
minimise
the
number of conflict points for
increasing safety.
(ii) As
3-arm
intersections
are
generally
safer than 4-arm



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 124
======================================================================
Summary of Recommendations
intersections, while laying new
roads,
it will be desirable
to design the road network in such a way
that the inter-
sections, by and large, will have three arms.
(iii) Wherever a new
road is built, the intersections with the
existing roads should be properly designed and executed
as a part of the new road project
taking
into
considera-
tion the traific flow requirements.
(iv) Islands
provided
within
the intersection area and else-
where should be suitably painted
and in rural areas they
should be of the mountable type.
(v) Approaches
to
intersections
should
be
provided
with
properly
laid
out
guidance
system in the form of signs
and pavement markings.
(vi) Traffic
signals,
where
provided,
should
be
properly
co-ordinated to minimise
delays,
as such a coordination,
besides
reducing
overall
fuel
consumption
results
in
better behaviour of drivers.
The signals
should also be
maintained in good working order.
(vii) The
lighting
of road
intersections
should be of higher
intensity than along straight stretches so as to provide the
necessary
visual
warning
to
approaching
road
users.
Street lighting in urban areas should be so provided and
maintained
that
pavements
always
remain
well-lit
so
as
to
make
driving
possible
only
with
parking
lights.
2.1.3.
Pedestrian facilities
(i)
Pedestrians
should
be considered
as a traffic unit in the
design of roads in urban areas.
(ii) As
pedestrians
are
often involved
in fatal traffic accid-
ents, footpaths of adequate width with suitable surfacing
should
be
provided
on
all
busy
urban roads, kept
free
from
encroachment
by
hawkers
and maintained
properly.
(iii) Wherever
necessary,
railing
barriers
for
pedestrians
should
be
provided
to
control the movement of pedes-
trians.



======================================================================
PAGE 29 of 124
======================================================================
Summary of Recommendations
15
(iv) Pedestrian
crossings
should be made adequately conspi-
cous
through
the provision of
zebra
crossings prefera-
bly
with
flashing beacons.
Such crossings near schools
should be given spd^ial
attention.
(v) On busy roads having heavy volvme of pedestrian traffic
across
the
road,
pedestrian
underpasses/overbridges
should be provided.
2.1.4.
Separate tracks for slow moving vehicles
(i) Cycle traffic on important
urban roads should be segre-
gated
from
other fast traffic by providing separate cycle
tracks/lanes.
These
tracks/lanes should be continuous
and should be maintained in good order.
(ii) Cycle
traffic
should be properly segregated at junctions
also.
(iii) Separate tracks for other slow
vehicles
should be provi-
ded wherever possible, and
so warranted.
2.1.5.
Bus bays and terminals
(i) Lay-byes
of appropriate
designs
recommended by the
Indian
Roads
Congress
(IRC
: 80-1981
for
rural high-
ways
and
IRC
: 70-1977
for
urban
roads)
should be
provided at pick-up bus stops on all busy roads.
(ii) Properly
planned
bus
terminals
should be provided in
the cities at suitable locations.
(iii) The
bus
terminals
should
be
planned in an integrated
manner
keeping
in
view
the
various
demands of the
passengers.
2.1.6.
Medians
(i)
Physical
separation
of opposing
traffic streams greatly
facilitates
reduction
of
accidents.
For
this
purpose
medians should be provided, wherever
appropriate
and
possible.
(ii) Medians
should
be
wide
enough
to enable povision of
pocket lanes for right turning traffic.



======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 124
======================================================================
Summary of Recommendations
(iii) Median openings should be provided judiciously
keeping
in
view
the
problem
of road safety (see IRC
: 62-1976
for guidance on access control and median openings).
#
2.1.7.
Shoulders
(i) Shoulders of adequate width and
suitable
specifications
should
be
provided
and properly maintained to ensure
smooth flow of traffic.
(ii)
In
black
cotton
soil
areas
hard
shoulders,
at least on
main highways to start with, should be provided.
2.1.8.
Embankment of roads
(i) Side slopes of embankments should not be very
steep
as
otherwise serious accidents are likely to occur
(see IRC
:
36-1970 for guidance on safe side slopes).
(ii) At
hazardous
locations
such
as
approaches to narrow
bridges,
high
embankments
etc.
guard rails of suitable
design should be provided for better safety.
2.1.9.
Speed-breakers
Speed
breakers
of
the steep hump type now being pro-
vided
on
some
of
the
roads are dangerous and should
be done away with.
2.1.10.
Bridges and culverts
(i) Approaches
to
bridges
and
culverts should be laid out
carefully so that these could smoothly join
the
roadway
on the structure.
(ii) The width of bridges upto 30 m length should preferably
be kept equal to width of roadway as the
sudden
reduc-
tion in the width of bridge leads to traffic hazards.
(iii) Wherever widening of single lane
to
two-lane
carriage-
way
is
undertaken,
the
widening/reconstruction
of
narrow culverts equal to full formation width
should
be
simultaneously taken up.
For this purpose,
it would
be
preferable
to
include
the
provision
for culverts in the
estimate for widening of road itself.
However, wherever



======================================================================
PAGE 31 of 124
======================================================================
Summary of Recommendations
17
this
is
not
possible,
bold
warning sign boards on both
sides of narrow culverts should be installed.
2.1.11.
Road-rail grade crossing
Unmanned road-rail grade crossings should be provided with
automatic
audio
visual
signals
such
as the one developed by the
RDSO of the Railways.
Such
devices
would
increase
the safety
at these places.
2.1.12.
Flood level indicators
Flood level indicators should be installed and
maintained
at
all
submersible
bridges
and
causeways
for
providing
adequate
information to the road users at such locations.
2.1.13.
Repair of roads
(i) Prompt maintenance under condition of flood
and
land-
slide should be planned in advance and adequate
equip-
ment and personnel made available.
(ii) Repairs
to
roads
in
urban
area
should be carried out
during the non-peak hours.
(iii) Repair to potholes, shoulder drop-offs, etc. caused during
rainy season should be done soon after the
rainy
season
so
that
minimum
inconvenience
is
caused
to
traffic.
The financing procedures to meet the cost of such repairs
should
be
streamlined
by
the
State
Governments,
so
that these repairs can be attended to without
delay.
2.1.14.
Service road
Provision
of
service
roads
with
controlled
access
to
the
arterial
road
should
be
provided
to
enable
the
reduction
of
numerous
road
intersections
and
thereby
increase
safety
(see
IRC
: 62-1976 for guidance on access control).
2.1.15.
Skidding/surface characteristics
(i) Road
pavements
on
horizontal curves and intersections
are subject to large centrifugal
forces,
and
vehicles
on
such sections are prone to skidding.
Also, skidding
can
occur
due
to
polishing
of aggregates and at locations
where
bleeding
of bitumen
shows up due to the use of



======================================================================
PAGE 32 of 124
======================================================================
Summary of Recommendations
excessive biUimen.
Such locations
should
be
identified
and
necessary measures such as provision of skid-proof
surfacing
should be taken.
Guidance in this regard can
be had from
the IRC Highway
Reseasch Board
State-
of-Art
Report
on
"Pavement
Slipperiness
and
Skid
Resistance".
(ii) Skid—prone
locations
yet
to
be
corrected
should be
notified to the motorists by posting
appropriate
warning
signs.
2. 1.16.
Traffic control devices
(i)
TraflSc
control
devices
such
as
signs, signals, and road
markings of the required standards should
be
employed
to
regulate
and
control
the
traffic
to promote greater
safety (see IRC
: 67-1977 for traffic
signs
and IRC
: 35-
1970 for road markings).
(ii) Delineators
of
scientific design and preferably of reflect-
five
type
should
be
used wherever necessary in such a
manner that these can
guide
the
traffic
efficiently
(see
IRC
: 79-1981).
(iii) Suitable control devices must be made
available
to
the
enforcement authorities for the purpose of better
control
of traffic on road for temporary diversions.
(iv) Warning signs and devices should
be
installed
well
in
advance
at
both
ends of the road section under repair/
improvement in order to reduce
accident risks.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
3.1.
Road Condition and Traffic Safety
3.1.1.
It is generally accepted that road accidents do not just
happen, but are caused. The causative factors may be the road, the
driver,
the
vehicle,
other
road users and the environment, either
singly
or
collectively.
The
evaluation
of
the contribution of the
individual factors to an accident
is
difficult,
and
quite
often
it is
the easiest
and the
quickest way to
conclude
that
the
accident
was
caused
by
the
driver,
who,
as
is
expected
should
have
instantaneously reacted to the changes in the other elements of the
entire
complex
and
adjusted
his
manoeuvre
correspondingly
to
compensate
for
the
changes.
This
is
one
reason
that
the
available
statistics
on
road
a ccidents
in
the
country
attribute
a
majority
of the
accidents
to
fault of drivers. This is
not to say that all drivers are entirely
faultless.
There
are
cases
of
driving
under
the
influence
of
intoxicants,
or
drivers
with
poor
sensory
reflexes
and
driving
skills who
normally
should
not
have
been permitted to drive, or arrogant drivers not abiding
by the traffic rules or driving recklessly for sheer thrill, etc.
where
the
drivers
should
be
held
solely
responsible
for the accident.
However,
there
can
be many
other
cases
where
situations are
allowed to exist on the
rodway
which
are
conducive
for
drivers
to
commit
mistakes,
e.g.,
presence
of
a
sharp
curve following
a long tangent section, poor
lighting,
hidden
dip
in
the
profile,
sudden
narrowing
of
the
roadway
because
of a cross-drainage
structure
in
an
otherwise wide
road,
or
aspects distracting or
weakening
the
attention
of the
drivers
and
creating
a
delusive
notion of traffic condition, etc.
3.1.2.
The above situations may not
by
themselves
consti-
tute
the
basic
cause
of
accidents, but by the elimination of such
unfavourable roadway features
and by creating safe driving condi-
tions,
traffic
safety
can
be
improved
considerably.
In
other
words,
the
road
design
should
rather
be to
assist
disci-
plined drivers and
to make
their
work easier so that there
is the
least possibility of their making
mistakes
than
to
force
them
to

3.1.3.
Valuable data on
the
effect
of
the
various
road
parameters
on
accident
rate
relating
to roads in India have now
become available from the Road User Cost
Study*
completed
by
the
Central Road
Research
Institute
in
collaboration
with
the
Ministry of Shipping &
Transport and
the
World
Bank.
The
data
pertain
to
two
studies, one on a 114 km length of Bombay-
Pune
road
(two-lane
black-topped
highway
traversing
plain,
rolling
and
hilly
terrains, and carrying ADT
of 4747 vehicles),
and the other on 34 routes in different parts of the
country
(cove-
ring
a
good
range
of
the
variables).
Regression equations have
been developed relating the accident rate to the different geometric
variables.
The
more
generalised
equations
derived
from
the
second study have been:
AR(1) = — .0.9134 + 0.0545RF -f 0.5560J — 0.222W
+ 0.001177 QADT
(R* = 0.766)
(1)
AR(1) = 0.2171
+ 0.002884CV +0.4126J — 0.3447W
+ 0.001274 QADT
(R2 = 0.759)
(2)
Where AR (1) = Accident rate per km per annum
RF
= Rise and fall in metres per km
CV
= Average horizontal curvature in degrees/km
J
= Number of junctions per km
W
= Pavement width in metres
QADT = Average traffic volume in vehicles/day
These
equations
can
be
used
for
predicting the accident rate of
a road section or for
comparing
the
accident
potentialities
of a
number
of
alternatives
having
different
geometric
and
traffic
features
bound
by
the
same
limits
as
those
used in developing
these
equations.
These, however, cannot
be
used for micro level
analysis,
for
example,
what
will
happen
to
the
accident
rate
when a sharp curve of radius 100 m
is flattened to 350 m.

Geometric Design for Improved Safety
3.2.1.
In
this
para,
the
. following
aspects
of road design
influencing traffic safety are discussed:
(1) Road alignment
(ii) Road cross-section; and
(iii) Sight distance
These aspects which generally fall
under
geometric design should
be
regarded
as
integral
part of road design right from the initial
construction
of
the
road.
For
existing
roads,
the
approach
should
be
to
identify the defects and deficiencies and take appro-
priate remedial action in
a
systematic
manner.
Where
the
cor-
rective
action
is
expected
to
be
delayed,
the
presence
of the
deficiency
should
be
notified
to
the
motoring
public
through
appropriate signs.
3.2.2.
Road
alignment
General
(1)
The
alignment
of
a
road
pre-determines
the
path
taken
by
a
vehicle
in moving
from
one point to the other and
comprises the elements of horizontal
curve
for
effecting
changes
in
direction
and grade for negotiating the differences in elevation.
These elements are determined on the
basis
of
the
design
speed
and
the
type
of terrain
traversed. From safety angle, the effort
should be to design and
develop
the
alignment
in
such
a way
that
it
is
like a free flowing ribbon tied to the natural topography
and unfolding the different features of the road and the
landscape
to
the
drivers
sufficiently
in
advance so that he
is least fatigued



======================================================================
PAGE 51 of 124
======================================================================
Explanatory Notes
37
and his interests are kept alive on the
roadways
ahead.
In
other
words,
the
alignment
affording
pleasant
driving
and
devoid
of
surprise
elements
will
not tax the driver to make him commit
mistakes,
and
this
is
conducive
to
safe
driving.
Considerations
needing attention in this regard are discusesd here in under.
Uniformity in design
(2)
The alignment should follow uniform design
standards.
Drivers
get
conditioned
by
the road on which they are travelling
and from past experince
they
expect
certain
things
ahead.
For
example,
a
driver
on
a good alignment will expect flat and free-
flowing curves, and in case an
isolated
sharp
curve
is
present
it
will
be
a surprise element which will prove to be more dangerous
than a curve of same radius in a generally
poor
alignment.
Con-
sistency in
road alignment is, therefore, an important pre-requisite
for traffic safety.
In places where change in standard
is
unavoid-
able,
such
as
where
a
hill
road
emerges
on
to the plains,
it is
desirable to eftect
the
same
gradually
by
providing
successive
sections
of gradually
increasing
standards
till
the road users get
adjusted to the new conditions.
At unavoidable
locations
having
sharp
changes
in
standards, safety can be improved by providing
adequate warning about
the same through installation
of relevant
warning signs and posting of speed limit restrictions.
Horizontal curves
(3)
Horizontal
curves
are
generally
associated with high
accident rates.
The accident rate
is
influenced
not
only
by
the
sharpness
(curvature)
of
the
curves
but also by the frequency of
their occurrence.
Sharper
the
curve,
greater
is the proneness to
accidents.
A road section
with
an
isolated
sharp
curve
has
a
greater accident rate than one with more number
of
curves.
The
accident
rate
shoots
up
with
increasing
curvature of an isolated
curve.
(4)
Hazard
at
horizontal
curves
arises
because of several
factors acting singularly
or
in
combination.
Important amongst
these
and
the
actions
that
could
be considered for improving
safety are briefly discusted below
:
(i) At
a
horizontal
curve,
the
driver
has
to act on his steering wheel
in time, and if he is not prepared for the
change
in
direction
or
is



======================================================================
PAGE 52 of 124
======================================================================
38
Explanatory Notes
taken
by
surprise,
his vehicle will leave the intended path and either
hit
a
stationary
object
or
trip
off
the
roadway.
This
surprise
element has already been discussed in the earlier paragraphs.
(ii) At
curves,
a
vehicle
is
subject
to centrifugal force the intensity of
which depends on the travelling
speed
and
the degree of curvature.
Design requirement warrants that a portion
of
this
force
(equal
to
the
force developed
at
75
per
cent
of the design speed) should be
counteracted by superelevation (superelevation rate should be subject
to maximum of 7 per cent for
plain and
snow-bound
hilly
terrains,
and
10
per
cent
for
non-snow-bound hilly terrain) and the balance
by side friction subject to a maximum ratio of
0.15.
Absence
of,
or
inadequate superelevation will mean greater pressure on side
friction
which may
lead
to skidding, particularly where the pavement is wet
or has a smooth and slippery surfacing.
From
these
considerations,
therefore,
it
should
be
ensured
that
the
curves are provided with
proper
and
adequate
superelevation and skid-free surfacing.
(iii) On
curves,
compared
to
straight
sections,
vehicles occupy more
space
in
the
lateral
direction, and
it is also more difficult to judge
the clearance between opposing vehicles.
Any misjudgment
in
this
regard
will mean
serious head-on
collision.
On curves, therefore,
suitable system for
guiding
the
vehicles
in
their
respective
paths
should
be
provided, and
this
can be in the form of centre line and
edge line pavement markings.
Reflective studs will be advantageous
particularly on un-lit rural highways.
The edges of roadway on
the
curves
should
also
be
notified
by means
of delineators or white
washed guard stones.
(iv) The problem of inadequate visibility may arise on
the
inside
of the
curve in case any obstruction to sight like building, wall,
high
crops,
etc. exists.
This aspect is discussed in more detail in para 3.2.4.
(5)
Some of the safety problems arising at horizontal
curves
are illustrated in Fig. 3.2.
Long tangent sections
(6)
Long tangent sections exceeding
3 km
in
length
should
be avoided as far as possible.
Such sections make
distant
objects
in
the
line
of
the
road appear nearer and consequently create a
psychological
feeling
in
the
driver
to
speed
up, thus creating a
hazardous situation.
Vertical profile
(7) The most important
feature of
vertical
profile
affecting
safety
is
the
availability
of
adequate
sight
distance.

Explanatory Notes
engineering practice
requires
that
the
summit
curves
should
be
designed to provide the needed sight distance
(safe
stopping
sight
distance being the absolute minimum), while the valley curves should
be designed
for headlight distance required for safe
driving during
hours of darkness (see
para
3.2.4. for
more
details).
The
other
factors
affecting
safety
are
(a) the rate of grade, (b) the length of
grade,
and
(c)
the
frequency
of grade
changes.
The first two
factors influence the extent of
speed
differential
between
trucks
and cars travelling upgrade since speed of trucks
is
more
affected
by grades exceeding 3 per cent.
Accident
rate
increases
and
the
capacity
reduces
as
the
speed
differential increases.
Where the
speed differential
is expected to be more than
about
25 km/h
on
two-lane
highways,
it
wtll
be
desirable
to
provide
a separate
climbing
lane
in
the
upgrade
direction,
particularly where the
proportion of trucks
is
high.
Some
of the
problems
arising
in
vertical profile and the manner of
their
correction
are
illustrated
in Fig. 3.3.
Alignment Co-ordination
(8)
A
driver
gets
a
three-dimensional
view
of the road
ahead in the landscape and,
therefore,
from
angles
of safety and
providing confidence in driving, the horizontal
alignment
and
the
vertical profile should be co-ordinated to provide
for aesthetically
pleasing
view
of
the road besides full information on the features
(ups and downs, direction changes,
etc.) of the
road
ahead.
An
alignment not so co-ordinated and which presents a warped appear-
ance
or
conceals
important
features
of the road ahead (e.g. a
hidden dip or similar visual discontinuity) makes
driver judgment
difficult and increases the chances of accident.
Some of the
guide-
lines in alignment co-ordination are
:
(i) The degree of curvature should be properly balanced with the gradient,
e.g., flat horizontal
curve
should not
be at the expense of steep and
long grades, and vice-versa.
(ii) Vertical
and
horizontal
curves
should cioncide
as far as possible,
and where
this is
difficult, the
horizontal curve should be somewhat
longer than the vertical curve.
(iii) Sharp
horizontal
curves
should
be
avoided
at or
near the apex
of a pronounced
summit/valley
vertical
curve from safety consider-
ations.

3.2.3.
Road cross-section
(1) The elements involved in road cross-section are the width
and the number of traffic lanes, the width of median where provi-
ded, the type and
width
of shoulders,
the crosfall,
the
embank-
ment side
slopes and
the
side
drains.
The
design
criteria and
values
for all
these
elements for
adoption under different situat-
ions have been standardised by the Indian
Roads
Congress which
should
be
followed
in
all
cases.
However, the points requiring
specific attention from safety angle are highlighted below
:
(i) The
facilty
with which
a vehicle can move freely and safely along a
road is influenced by the
width and number of traffic lanes, and the
volume and
composition
of
traffic.
The
carriageway
widths have
been
standardised
as
3.75 m for single lane, 5.5 m for intermediate
lane,
7 m for two lanes and
3.5 m per lane for multi-lane highways,
and each type of cross-section
has been assigned
a capacity value in
terms of
P.C.Us.
For all
rural
highways
having
traffic volumes
within the
capacity
of two-lanes,
it
will be preferable to go
in for
7 m wide carriageway instead of the
intermediate
lane, particularly
where the
proportion
of commercial
vehicles
is more than 50 per
cent.
Further, safety can be improved by widening the road sections
with traffic volumes close to or exceeding the capacity.
(ii) At
locations where
the
carriageway
is widened from single to two
lanes, two to four
lanes, or
vice versa, an
important requirement is
that the increase or decrease in
width should be brought about grad-
ually with a splay of 1 in 15 to
1
in 20 for rural
highways and
1 in 10
to
1 in 15 in the case of urban
roads.
Also,
the
transition
should
be
provided
with
guidance
system
in the form of signs and pave-
ment markings.
Typical cases are illustrated in Fig. 3.5.
(iii) Approaches
to a
narrow
bridge
in an otherwise wide road creates
hazardous
situation.
Such
cases require
special attention, and the
treatment to be given is discussed in detail in para 3.4.3.
(iv) The type and
condition
as also
the
level and crossfall of shoulders
relative
to
the
carriageway are important from the point of view of
traffic safety.
On single lane roads, the outer side
wheels of
vehicles
generally travel for
considerable
distance on
the shoulders for over-
taking crossing manoeuvres.
On
two-lane
roads, vehicles may have
to use the
shoulders
in
emergencies,
or drive
along the pavement
edges.
Soft
earthen shoulders have been found to be responsible for
overturning of many
heavily
loaded
trucks due
to wheels sinking
into
the
shoulders
during
the
rainy
season.
Further, the slushy
condition
causes
the mud
from the surface of the wheels to spread
on to the
pavement
surface
presenting
a constant
threat for skid-
ding.
A
good
design
practice,
therefore,
calls
for
provision of
hard shoulders
upto
a
width
of
atleast
one
metre and regular

maintenance
thereof.
Quarry
spalls, gravel, hard moorum,or ether
locally
available
granular
material can be used for the purpose of
improving
safety
at
low cost.
Another
aspect is that the space to
a distance of at
least 1.5 m from
the edge of the carriageway should
be kept free of all obstructions so that drivers
feel confident to make
full
use
of
the carriageway width and thus contribute to improved
capacity
and
safety.
Some
of
these
points
are
illustrated
in
Fig. 3.6.
(v) Medians
improve
the capacity
and safety on high volume roads by
physically
separating
the
opposing
traffic
streams, reducing head-
light
glare
(by
planting shrubs in the median space), and providing
positive
delineation of the right
edge of the
carriageway.
Medians
also
protect
right
turning
traffic
at
crossings.
Asa
general rule,
rural
highways
of
four
or
more lanes and urban roads of six or
more
lanes
should
be
provided with median.
For four lane urban
roads,
provision of
median should be judicious taking into account
such
considerations
as
safety,
directional
distribution
of
traffic
(medians
not
advisable
when
tidal
flows of
traffic are
present),
proportion of slov; vehicles roadside
developments, etc.
Medians should
be
highly visible
both during day and
at night from
safety
considerations.
For this
purpose,
median kerb and
surface
area
in-between
should
be
provided
with
an
effective
contrast
in colour
and tex-
ture.
The number
of median
openings
is an important factor
affecting
safety;
the
higher the number of openings per
unit length the higher is the accident rate.
Median open-
ings,
should
generally
be
limited to
intersections
with
public
roads,
and the distance between successive open-
ings
should
not be
less
than 750 m for rural highways
and 500 m fcr urban arterials.
(vi) In cut sections,
for
draining
the
roadway,
it is a general practice
to provide open
drains on the
hillside just at the edge of the shoul-
ders.
For
such cases,
*v' shaped drains
(with a slope not exceeding
3:1), though
hydraulically
not as efiicient as the
trapezoidal section,
is advantageous
from
safety
angle
since
out
of
control vehicles
can make use of the drain and get retrieved
from an
otherwise dang-
erous situation
- see Fig. 3.7.
(vii) It will be desirable to have
embankment slopes as flat as
possible so
that any
wayward
vehicle
leaving
the
roadway will have a better
chance
of
survival.
From
safety
considerations
IRC:36-1970
recommends side slopes of 4:1 for low embankments upto 1.5 m height

Where

involve
extra

to provide such

critical
locations such as sharp curves.

Sight distance
(1)
Sight distance, or ability to see ahead
is one of the
most
important
factors
affecting safe and efficient movement of vehicles
on
roads.
The
road
must
provide for sufficient sight distance in
which a driver can control
his
vehicle,
or come
to stop to avoid
striking
an obstacle on the roadway, or safely complete the mano-
euvre of overtaking a slower vehicle without hitting
an
on-coming
vehicle
in
the
opposite lane.
IRC
: 66-1976 explains the types of
sight distances and
lays
down
minimum
standards
for
various
design speeds.
(2)
Obstruction to sight or reduced
visibility
arises
in
two
cases,
(i) along
the
alignment
where
there
is break in the grade
line,
and
(ii)
in
the
lateral
direction
along
inside of horizontal
curves due to obstructions like walls, cut slopes, buildings, wooded
areas, high farm crops, etc.
These cases are illustrated in Fig.
3.9-
(3)
The needed visibility in the longitudinal direction can
be
ensured by providing suitably designed vertical curves.
For 2-lane
highways,
the
effort
should be to provide visibility corresponding
at least to intermediate sight distance.
In cases where
the
terrain
is
characterised
by
a
series
of ups and downs, a profile closely
following
the
natural
ground
surface
which
creates a "roller-
coaster" kind of profile should
be
avoided.
Similarly,
on
long
straight sections, local hidden dips which merge with the continuity
of
the
road
when viewed from a distance should be avoided.
A
vehicle stopped in such a dip for repairs
or
other
reasons
can
be
seen only at the last moment, thus creating a
hazardous
situation.
Fig. 3.3. shows some typical cases.
(4)
On valley curves visibility is not a
problem
during
day
time.
But for night travel the design must ensure that the roadway
is illuminated by vehicle headlights for
sufficient length
to
enable
the vehicle to brake to a stop, if necessary.
(5)
On the
inside
of
horizontal
curves,
visibility
can
be
improved
by
cutting
back
the
obstructions to sight, lowering the
height of hedges, replacing solid compound walls by
see
through-
grills, cutting back the hill slope or benching as considered approp-
riate.

Where a horizontal and summit curve overlap,
the
line

Design in such cases should
provide

direction
along
the
pavement and in horizontal direction on the inside of the curve.

Road Intersections
3.3.1.
General picture of accidents at intersections
It
is generally accepted that road
intersections
are
a
major
cause
of
accidents.
Statistics
both
for the country and abroad
show that roughly one-third of all road
accidents
occur
at
inter-
sections.
The
recent
study
of accidents on Bombay-Pune Road
(N.H. 4) and on a number of other highways conducted
as
a
part
of
the
Road
User
Cost
Study showed that the presence of inter-
sections
is highly significant as an accident causative factor.
Table
3.1. highlights this fact making use
of
the
equation
derived
for
Bombay-Pune Road.

3.3.2.
Factors affecting safety at intersections
(1)
Safety at an intersection results from the operation
of
a
complex
system of variables.
Quite often, an accident takes place
because of the interaction of a number
of
contributing
variables.
To have an objective study of accidents and for finding the approp-
riate remedial measures,
it
is
necessary
to
identify
the
variables
and the possible contribution of each variable.
The variables can
be
grouped
under
two broad headings, namely, human variables
and physical variables.
Human variables
(2) The behaviour
of road users follows a three-phase pro-
cess of perception, decision
and
action.
These
phases
not
only
succeed each other but
are
also concurrent.
A
fault
in
one
or
more of these phases often
foretells
the
occurrence
of accidents.
Risk arises when
wrong
actions
are
performed either because of

52
Explanatory Notes
incorrect or incomplete information leading to wrong
decisions, or
wrong decision in spite of proper
information
implying
incorrect
judgment.
(3) For driving correctly
at intersections,
the
drivers
must
perceive certain
essential
information
such as
:
(i) the
need
for
changes in speed, choice of
lane/route across the intersection
area
and anticipation
about
possible
approach
of
other
road
users;
(ii) the traffic control devices
setting
out
guidance
or
regulation
about speed, turning,
etc;
(iii)
traffic on the other approach roads
covering the types
and
their
positions
with
regard
to the inter-
section area and to himself, their speed, the lanes/routes the
other
road users will use and signals given by other road
users
concern-
ing slowing down, stopping or turning;
(iv) the position and speed
of the road user
himself;
and
(v)
special
circumstances
such
as
slippery pavement, diversion, etc.
(4) Generally, the total quantity of information
that
can
be
picked up or absorbed by a road user in a given
period
of time is
limited. The chances of obtaining complete
information
decreases
when a situation becomes complicated,
such
as
in
difficult
road
situation with various
kinds
of
traffic,
crossing
pedestrains
and
numerous
traffic
signs.
Besides
this,
there
could
be
external
situations imposed
by
objects
obstructing
visibility, or decreased
visibility because
of
insufficient
lighting,
or glare, or the driver's
attention being diverted
by
irrelevant
information like advertise-
ments, shop window displays, etc.
Instances are not
far
to
seek
where intersections overload
the
driver with information with the
result that drivers disregard significant information such
as
warn-
ing signs.
(5) Another important factor in safety at intersections
is
the
familiarity of the
situation.
Generally,
chances
of
a
road
user
missing the crucial information or
under-estimating
the
risks
are
greater for those who are new or unfamiliar with
local
situations.
Under-estimation of risk may also occur when a familiar
situation
has changed and
if
this
situation
is inconspicuous and not clearly
notified.

Physical variables
(6)
Basically,
hazard
at
an intersection arises as a result of
coriflict between two or more traffic streams, or between a
vehicle
and other road users, or
between
vehicles
in
the
same
stream
Several physical factors influence
the
type
and
intensity
of
the
conflicts
A clear understanding of the different types of conflicts
IS, therefore, essential not only for
safety
evaluation
of an
inter-
section but also
for
developing
appropriate
remedial
measures.
The types ofconflicts and influence on trafiic safety
are
discussed
in para 3.3.3.

3.3.3.
Traffic conflicts at intersections
(1) Movement of a vehicle
along
or
across
an
intersection
area invariably involves
a
conflict.
The
conflicts
are
of varied
types, and the intensities of collision produced
by them
are
also
diff*erent.
The
attempt
in any
safety improvement programme
should, therefore, be not only to reduce
the number
of
conflicts
but also convert more intense conflicts into ones of minor
nature.
It should be understood that it is not possible to
remove
all
con-
flicts since even interchanges have merging/diverging conflicts,
and
in some cases (e.g. cloverleaf design) weaving conflicts.
(2) The
diff'erent types
ot
vehicular
conflicts
at
an
inter-
section are illustrated
in Fig. 3.11.
alongwith the possible types of
collision produced by each
of
these.
Of
these,
conflicts
arising
out of merging, diverging or
weaving manoeuvres can be conside-
red to be of minor nature
(since
the resulting
collision
is
not
of
serious type) while those from
straight
moving
and
right
turning
movements
are
of more
serious
type.
Compared
to
straight
moving, right turning movements are
more
potential
for
serious
collisions since the vehicles will have to take a longer curved
path
within the intersection area, have to look for
potentially conflicting
vehicles in all directions, and are involved
in
greater number
of
conflicts in their path.
A closer attention and necessary provisions
for right turning movements are therefore important for
improved
safety at intersections.
Table 3.2. brings out the
parameters to be
considered for reducing the intensity of vehicular
conflicts.
(3) The
number of conflict
points
at
an
intersection
area
aff'ects traffic safety, the larger the number of conflict points greater
is the probability of collision.
Fig. 3.12.
brings
out
the number
and type
of conflicts at typical
intersections.
This highlights the
point that having intersections
with
fewer legs or making one
or
more of the crossing
roads
one-way
can
drastically
reduce
the
conflict points for improved safety.
(4)
The occurrence of conflict points
at
close
sequence
as
shown in Fig. 3.12 (a) creates hazardous situation of serious nature,
and this can also psychologically affect the capabilities
and judge-
ment
of
drivers.

Explanatory Notes
the lateral direction for carrying out
a
manoeuvre,
if more
than
necessary,
can
add further dimensions to the problem.
A driver
negotiating a manoeuvre adjusts his speed and position in
anticipa-
tion
of
a
particular path for a potentially conflicting vehicle, and
in case the latter has a large area to
manoeuvre,
the
calculations
of the former will get seriously
upset,
and
this may
result
in
a
serious
accident.
From
safety
angle, therefore,
it is essential not
only to separate the possible conflicts but also to reduce the
poten-
tial
conflict
area.
This
can
be achieved through channelisation.
This point
is illustrated in
Fig. 3.13 (a to d)
with
the
progressive
development of a 'T' intersection.
Even where traffic volumes
do
not demand channelisation, the principle can be applied to
reduce
the
non-functional
intersection
area
for
obviating
the possible
wavering of vehicles.
Such cases arise at oblique
intersections
of
a minor road with a major road as illustrated in Fig. 3.13 (e).
3.3.4.
Measures for improved safety at intersections
(1)
Risk of accidents at
intersections
can
be
reduced
and
their
consequences
minimised
by
taking
suitable
engineering
measures
discussed
in
the
following
paragraphs.
While some
apply to new intersections others apply to
both
new
and
existing
ones.
In all cases,
it will be a good practice to examine the design
in the light of a check
list,
a
sample
of
which
is
suggested
in
Table 3.3.
(2)
In the development of road network
for
an
area,
due
attention should be paid to the following points from
traffic
safety
angle:
(i) The roads in the network should follow
an
hierarchical
pattern with respect to function so that priorities of each
arm of the intersection could be understood and suitably
provided for by way
of introducing *GIVE WAY'
or
'STOP'
signs
for
traffic
entering
the
intersection from
minor roads.
(ii) The number of intersections should
be
reduced
to
the
barest minimum.
On
rural highways, the intersections
should
not
be
spaced
closer than 750 m.
On urban
arterials, the corresponding minimum distance should be
500 m.

(iii) Having more
of
*T'
intersections
which
have
fewer
number of conflict points in place of 4-way
intersections.
Choice of type of intersection
(3)
A variety of designs
are
possible
from
simple
layouts
having only left turning
curves
to
complex
channelised
layouts,
or
rotary,
or
signal
control.
Each type is appropriate to a parti-
cular situation of traffic and environmental parameters.
A
wrong
choice may mean congestion and delay
at
one
end
to
confusion
and
inconvenience
on the other, and this means greater proneness
to accidents.
For example,
a
signal
controlled
junction
on
a
lightly
trafficked
road
or
an
isolated
signal or rotary on a high
speed highway will be a
cause
for
increasing
the
accident
rate.
Also,
a
complex
channelised
layout
should
be avoided oji unlit
rural highways.
Intersection geometry
(4)
Geometric features include the location and direction of
the
intersecting
arms,
the location, size and shape of channelising
islands, the turning
radius,
etc.
Some
of
the
satisfactory
and
unsatisfactory
geometric
design
features
at intersections are illus-
trated in Fig. 3.14.
(5)
Very often the intersection area
is
flared out
to
accom-
modate
the
diff'erent
manoeuvres and channelising islands.
The
angle of flaring to suit the approach speeds, the
delineation
of the
path or channels right from the approaches in logical sequence
are
important.
Leaving
a
large
unmarked
area
at the junction will
cause wavering of vehicles
and
increase
accident
potential.
No
traffic island should come on the normal vehicle path, and
if used
should
be
of
sufficient
size (minimum
6 m^ area) and their faces
painted
in
black
and
white
bands
to make
them
adequately
conspicuous.
(6) The left turning curves should follow the path of the inner
rear wheel
and
should
not
be so sharp as
to cause the turning
vehicle to encroach on the lanes intended
for other vehicles.
This
can be achieved by
providing
2-centred
or 3-centred compound
curves.
For high speed
rural
highways like
National Highways,
2-centred
designs of
17-23 m and 20-30 m
(with
left
infiltration
lanes) have been successfully used in many places.

(8) Proper treatment at the branching
points of byepasses of
major highways is very important
from
safety angle.
The section
byepassed
should
invariably
be flexed and
subordinated to the
byepass so that the fast through traffic on the major highv^^ay is not
misguided into the byepassed or abandoned road.
Fig. 3.16. illustr-
ates the case.
(9)
Acceleration and deceleration lanes are intended to avoid
acceleration or
deceleration
by
the entering and leaving vehicles
taking place on the lanes meant
for through traffic.
These should
be provided only where
at least one
of
the
roads
is a high speed
highway, and there are at least 200 turning vehicles per hour.
On
low-volume intersections, if
provided,
these lanes will only serve
to increase
the
meandering
area
for
vehicles
and
add to the
hazards.
However,
the
right
turning
pocket lane carved out of
the median has been found to be very
useful in reducing the acci-
dent rate.
Visibihty
(10) A major
factor
affecting
safety
at intersections
is the
visibility
or
sight
distance.
There are two considerations which
are
important
to the
driver
as
he approaches
an intersection.
First
is
the overall
visibility
of the junction layout to provide the
driver with a clear
picture of the
type of intersection, the facilities
provided for the
various movements, the
presence of channelising
islands
and
other
traffic
control devices.
Poor alignments can
produce
'hidden,
intersections with
erroneous visual impressions
which may lead to incorrect decision by
the users.
(11) Locations
with straight alignment and
near-level grades
are the best
for
intersections.
Locations
on long
and flat valley
curves have superior overall visibility, but the
down grades should
not
be
steeper
than
1
per
cent to cause vehicles to accelerate.
Locations
at top
of
summit curves
have poor visibility but have
the advantage
of reduced
speeds
of approaching
vehicles.
At
such
locations,
rotaries
are preferable.
However,
locations on
either side of a summit curve will prove to
be
highly
dangerous.
Where such a situation cannot be avoided, the junctions
should be
located at a distance equal to at least the safe stopping sight distance



======================================================================
PAGE 79 of 124
======================================================================
Explanatory Notes
65
away from the summit and where the grade is the flattest and
not
steeper than 2 per cent.
(12) The second improtant
requirement
towards safe negoti-
ation
of an
intersection
is
the
right
triangle visibility.
After a
driver becomes aware of approaching
an intersection, he must be
able to observe and comprehend the speed and direction of appro-
aching traffic to his right and
left.
The driver must
be able to see
sufficient distance along
the cross
road to allow him to judge if he
can
make
a
crossing by suitably
adjusting the speed or he must
come to a stop.
(13) There
are two
specific
conditions
that are relevant to
minimum sight triangle.
These are
:
(i) *Uncontrolled intersections' where the intersecting roads are of more
or less equal importance and there is no established priority.
(ii) 'Priority intersections*
like an intersection between major and minor
roads where the major road has the priority
for movement while the
entry from the minor road
is controlled by 'STOP' or 'GIVE WAY'
signs and stop line markings.
Sight distance requirements in both these
cases
are
illustrated
in
Figs.3.17 and 3.18.

Roadside Developments, Roadside Hazards and Road
Appurtenances
3.4.1.
Ribbon development
(1) Ribbon
development
along
highways
i.e. development
of commercial
business
and
residential
activity on either side of
the
highway
close
to the road boundaries generates a lot of local
traffic and
throws
up pedestrians and slow-moving
traffic on to
the
highway
resulting
in criss-cross
movements,
restriction
to
sight distance, distraction to
drivers
of through
traffic, all leading
to utter
confusion
and
serious
hazard.
Encroachment
of road
land, sometimes
even the roadway
area by hawkers, vendors and
petty
shops,
and parking of trucks and other vehicles on the road-
way for long periods add further dimensions to the problem.
The
problem
is
particularly
acute and highly hazardous at sections of
highways approaching
major
cities
and
towns.
This
aspect is
dealt with in greater detail in para 3.4.2.

(2) Measures for the prevention of ribbon development along
highways is
discussed
at
length
in
I.R.C.
Special
Publication
No. 15-1974 'Ribbon Development Along Highways and its Preve-
ntion'.
Some of
the
measures
which
can
pay
quick
dividends
are
:
(i) Construction
of
parallel
service
roads
for segregating
local and
slow traffic from the main highway.
(ii)
In
the
absence
of
adequate
land,
provision
of railing barriers
and maintaining
the
footpaths in good order for encouraging pede-
strians to use them.
(iii) Development
of
off-road
facilities
like
truck
parks
at intervals
for the
purposes
of rest,
refreshment,
vehicle
repairs,
etc.,
for
truckers.
(iv)
Strict
enforcement
of no-parking
restrictions on the roadway and
removal of encroachments on the road land.
(v) Proper location
of bus
stops
on
lay-byes
(see
para
3.4.5)
or in
ofT-road
terminals.
(vi) Controlling
the
location and
frequency
of
fuel-filling
stations
in
accordance
with
IRC:
12-1983
-Recommended
Practtice
for
Location and
Layout
of Roadside
Motor-Fuel
Filling & Motor-
Fuel Filling-cum-Scrvice Stations (Second Revision)",
(vii) Check
barriers
for
various
purposes
should
as
far
as possible be
combined into
single
ones
so as to control their proliferation where
constructed these should conform to the
type
designs recommended
in IRC: 41-1972 'Type Designs for Check
Barriers'.
3.4,2.
Highway sections approaching cities and (owns
(1)
Sections
of highways
approaching
cities and towns are
more
vulnerable
to
ribbon
development
and
encroachment.
This
is
for
the
reason
that
such locations generate a lot of busi-
ness
with
vehicles,
drivers
and
passengers
coming
from
long
distances.
The
local
developments
drastically
reduce
the
free
passage
of
vehicles,
and
such
situations
will prove to be highly
hazardous for drivers who
till
then
have
been
driving
at
high
speeds on the rural sections of the highway.
(2)
For
such
sections,
besides
taking
action
on
the pre-
vention
of ribbon
development, removal of encroachments,
etc.
as
discussed
in
para
3.4.1., the roadway itself should be suitably
widened
and
provided
with
safety
measures
(like
pedestrian
crossings
and
railing
barriers).
The
widening
treatment
will
depend on the available right-of-way, the proportion
and
type
of
local
traffic, etc. Fig. 3.19. shows a few typical cross-sections along-

These may
be
taken

only,
and may

In the design of the main carriageway,

guidance
can
be
had
from
IRC:86-1983 'Geometric Design Standards for Urban Roads

3.4.3.
Approaches to bridges
(1)
The present practice in India is to
curtail
the shoulders
at
all
bridge
structures
except
culverts.
However,
there
are
numerous
locations
on
the
highways where bridges do not have
even the widths equal to the flanking road carriageways.
(2) A
motorist
driving
along
an open highway (presence of
shoulders and
absence
of
lateral
obstructions
gives him
confi-
dence
to
drive
fast and even along the carriageway edges), when
he suddenly meets with a bridge structure
(absence
of shoulders,
and
presence
of
lateral
obstructions
like kerbs and parapets) he
has
to
adjust
his
speed and lateral position quickly, as otherwise
he may
collide
with
the
kerb
or
parapet
or
other
protruding
members
of the
structure.
The
situation
becomes more critical
and highly hazardous if the bridge roadway
is
narrow and
there
is
already
a
vehicle
on
it.
Failure
to comprehend the situation
and make adjustments in position and speed has
quite
often
been
the
cause
of
serious
accidents
including tripping of vehicles into
the
water
course
below.
Some
of the
measures
for
avoiding
such critical situations are:
(i)
Ensuring
adequate
visibility
of
the
bridge
structure
from
the
approaehing
roads
for
a
distance
equal
to at least
1.5
times
the
safe stopping sight distance.
(ii)
Avoiding
road
intersections
for
a
distance
of at least 200 m from
either end of the bridge.
(iii)
Providing
suitable
transitions
to
the roadways where their widths
differ.
Ihree common
cases
occur:
(a) road
built
to single lane
while
the
bridge
is
of
two-lanes;
(b)
road
built
to 2-lanes while
the
bridge
is
of 4-lanes;
and (c) road built to 4-lane divided cross
section
while
the
bridge
is
of
2-lanes
in
the
first instance to be
widened
at
a
future
date.
Suggested
treatments
for
these cases
are shovn in Fig. 3.20,

Railway level crossings
There
are
a
large
number
of railway level crossings along
the highways in the country, and a
good
proportion
of
these
are
still
unmanned.

should
be
accelerated,
all
possible
measures
should
be
taken
for
improving
safety at
the crossings still existing at level. The measures should include:
(i)
Provision
of adequate
visibility
including
clearance
of the
sight
triangles as at road intersections.
(ii)
Removal
of obstructions
or
irrelevant
information
like advertise-
ments from the immediate vicinity of the crossing.
(iii)
Provision
of warning
signs
including advance warning
signs
in
accordance with IRC:67-1977 'Code of Practice for Road Signs'.
(iv)
Provision
of
flashers
or
automatic stop signals linked with railway
signals
to
give
warning
of approaching
trains.
At
unmanned
crossings
automatic
audio-visual
signals
as
the one developed
by
the RDSO should be
provided.
(v)
The
design
of the
crossing and
the approach
roads should be in
accordance
with
IRC:39-1970
'Standards
for
Road-Rail
Level
Crossings'.
3.4.5.
Pick-up bus-stops
(1)
Bus
system
is
an
important means
of transportation
both
in
the
rural
and
urban areas in the country. People swar-
ming the roads near the
bus
stops
is
a common
sight.
Besides
risks
arising
out
of passengers
alighting
or
boarding
a moving
bus which can be
controlled
only
through
discipline,
there
can
be
other
factors
causing
serious
accidents
at
bus
stops.
These
may be as a result of:
(1)
Visibility
obscured
by
standing
vehicles, and
a
through
vehicle
running over waiting or alighting bus passengers.
(ii)
Bus
stopping on
the main
carriageway
itself thus
blocking
part
of the
roadway and
causing
serious obstruction to other vehicles;
and
(iii) Bus stop located too
near
and
preceding an
intersection, and the
bus not having
sufficient
distance
to merge with the main traffic to
negotiate turning movements.
(2) For avoiding these hazards, certain measures are
necess-
ary both in
the
design
and
operation
of bus
stops.
Important
among these are
:
(i) Bus stops should be located at places where there is adequate
visibi-
lity and the grades are flat or gentle;
(ii) There are two ways of providing bus bays, viz.
one
by carving
out
an additional width adjoining the main carriageway, and
the
second



======================================================================
PAGE 86 of 124
======================================================================
72
Explanatory Noils
by having an exclusive lay-bye separated from the main carriageway.
As far as possible, except for very lightly trafficked roads, the
second
alternative
of having a
separate
lay-bye should be adopted.
This
will provide
for
safe
refuge
area
for passengers and
obviate
the
possibility of waiting people swarming the main carriageway;
(iii) The bus bay
area
should
be
properly drained and
maintained in
good order;
(iv) The bus stops and
bays
should
be
sufficiently away
from an inter-
section, and should have
easy
entry and exit.
Guidance in location
and design
of pick-up
bus
stops can
be
had from
IRC
: 80-1981
'Type Designs for
Pick-up
Bus
Stops on
Rural (i.e. Non- urban)
Highways'! and
(v) No-parking regulation for a
distance of
100 m
from
cither
side
of
bus bay turning curves should be strictly enforced.
3.4.6.
Avenue trees
Roadside trees have been a traditional complement of all old
roads including main highways in the Qountry.
Planted
with
an
eye on the provision of shade to pedestrain and animal-cart
traffic,
they have been accepted as a
part
of the
road.
However,
with
the advent of fast motorised traffic, trees too close
to
the roadway
are proving to be a serious traffic hazard.
Experience shows
that
the trees should be
located
at
a minimum
distance
of
10-12 m
from the centre of extreme traffic
lane
to
provide
recovery
area
for any wayward vehicle
running
off
the
road.
This
clearance
distance for planting trees should be adopted
for
all new
roads.
For
existing
roads,
there should
be
a
phased
programme
for
removing trees falling within the clearance area with
side
by
side
plantation of new trees beyond the clearance zone.
First priority
for removal should be for trees falling along outside
of horizontal
curves (since
vehicles
are
more
prone to trip
off the roadway at
these places) and those on inside
of curves obstructing
visibility.
Trees allowed to remain
should
be
painted in white colour for a
height of 1.25 m above roadway level with
300 mm
middle
band
in black
colour
to warn road users of their persence.
For
better
night visibility,
it will also be preferable to
fix on their face a piece
of red reflectorised tape, disc or paint.
3.4.7.
Kilometre stones, sign posts and utility poles
(i)
Position of kilometre stones, sign posts and
utility
poles
is another factor relating to road accidents.
Vehicles going off the



======================================================================
PAGE 87 of 124
======================================================================
Explanatory Notes
73
carriageway may strike them resulting in accident.
(2)
Kilometre stones on embanked roads should be fixed
at
the
edge
of the roadway outside the shoulder on specially erected
platform.
In cutting, they should be fixed
clear
of the
shoulder
and the side drain.
For
more details, reference may be made
to
IRC
: 8-1980.
(3)
For road
signs,
the minimum
lateral
clearance
from
carriageway edge should be 600 mm for kerbed roads and
2 m for
unkerbed roads (see also para 3.6.4.).
(4)
For
utility
poles,
the
clearances
should
be
as
per
IRC
.• 32-1969.
3.4.8.
Guard-rails
(1)
Guard-rails are used where vehicles accidentally leaving
the roadway
would be subjected to considerable danger or where
there are abrupt changes in roadway widths as
at
approaches
to
bridges,
or
for
protecting
the
components
of subway structures
like piers and abutments located in the proximity of the
travelled
way.
The
purpose
is
to
restrain
and
redirect
out-of-control
vehicles away from the danger zone and opposing traffic flows.
(2)
Warrants
for
installation
of
guard-rails
have
been
developed
in
countries
like
the
U.S.A., and if these are applied
directly to roads in the country it will be
found
that
most
of the
highways will require guard-railing for most of their lengths.
This
is neither feasible, nor necessary
since
speeds
of
vehicles
in
the
country are relatively low.
At the same time, there are vulnerable
areas where guard-rails have
a
very
useful
role
to
play.
The
approach
should,
therefore, be to identify the critical areas or the
combination of critical parameters, and prepare a
priority-wise
list
for phased action.
(3)
The critical parameters
are
the
high
probability
of a
vehicle
leaving
the
roadway
(e.g. at
outside of sharp horizontal
curves, approaches to a
narrow
bridge, etc.)
and
the
degree
of
danger
awaiting
such
a
vehicle
(e.g. deep
valley,
deep water
course
or
ditch,
etc.).
This
means that outside of a sharp hori-
zontal curve falling on the valley side, and
high
approaches
to
a



======================================================================
PAGE 88 of 124
======================================================================
74
Explanatory Notes
narrow bridge will claim a high priority.
Another way of accord-
ing priority is to analyse the locations where accidents
are
caused
due to vehicles tripping off the roadway.
(4)
Common designs of guard-rails are shown
in
Fig. 3.21.
In their installation, they should be located somewhat away
from
the
useful
shoulder
line
and
at
about the same elevation.
It is
desirable to flare the guard-rails outwards for a
short
distance
at
the end of tariffic approach and anchor the ends of guard-rails
in
order to lessen possible direct impact and to provide a full view
to
the driver.
A typical guard-rail treatment
at
a
bridge
approach
is shown in Fig. 3.22.
3.4.9.
Roadside facilities
(1)
Long distance drivers need rest and recreation
enroute.
A driver who has rested will be fresh and alert, and
is
less
likely
to
commit
mistakes.
From
safety angle, therefore,
it is desirable
to provide the necessary facilities on all through highways.
(2)
The facilities may be in the form of
:
(i) Roadside lay-byes at scenic spots
for
the
travellers
to
park
their
vehicles and relax
for sometime
with
provision
for drinking water
and light refreshments;
(ii) Off-road
rest
areas for night halt.
Such places should have facili-
ties for over-night halt, food and vehicle repair; and
(iii) Truck
parks
with
facilities
for night halt, food, vehicle repair; and
parking for long distance truckers.
Detailed
guidelines
on
the
provision
of these facilities are
contained in the IRC Special Publication No. 21
"Landscaping
of
Roads".
(3)
Besides providing rest and recreation for road travellers,
the
above
mentioned
facilities
will
help
traffic
safety from the
following angles
:
(i) Discourage
parking
of
vehicles
on the roadway itself;
and
(ii) Discourage the mushroom growth of roadside tea/eatable
shops and vendors.

Arrangements for traffic at construction sites
(1)
On occasions
it may become unavoidable to suspend
or
direct traffic from a section of a
highway
for
improving/repairing
the highway or cross-drainage structures, or a
breach
caused
by
floods.
Disproportionately large number of accidents
are known
to
have
occurred
at
such
sites due to poor geometries or inade-
quate guidance to the motorists.
(2)
Basic
principles
to
be
kept
in
mind at such locations
from the point of view of safety are
;
(i) Traffic must be guided properly if it is required to follow
an alternate path;
(ii) Display of clear warning about any hazards that may
be
present, including posting of advance warning signs;
and
(iii) Geometries of alternative facility or diversion should
be
such as to allow smooth and safe flow of traffic.

(4)
Another
important
requirement
from
safety angle is
that
at
the
end
of
day's
work, all the construction equipment
should be parked outside the main roadway.
If this
is
not
possi-
ble,
they
should
be
parked
at the extreme edge of the shoulders
and
provided
with
red
lamps
on both sides during the hours of
darkness.
3.5.
Road Surface Characteristics
3.5.1.
General
The two important attributes of road
surface
characteristics
affecting
traffic
safety
are
the
riding quality and skid resistance.
The riding quality refers to the surface evenness of the
pavement
which in conjuction with the characteristics of the vehicle
and
the
quality of driving determines the riding
comfort.
Skid
resistance
is
the
frictional
force
developed at the tyre—pavement interface
when a tyre on being prevented from rotating, skids on
the
pave-
ment
surface.
Longitudinal
friction
is
needed
for acceleration
and deceleration whereas lateral friction becomes important
while
negotiating horizontal curves.
3.5.2.
Riding quality
(1)
Riding
quality
has
a
direct
impact on traffic safety in
the sense that an uneven surface or a road with poor riding quality
causes undue jerks and vibrations and this
leads
to
early
fatigue
of the driver and impairs his judgment
manoeuvrability,
all
lead-
idg to hazardous situations.
(2)
Riding
quality
of
a road pavement can be assessed by
a number of ways.
These are
:
(i) Subjective
assessment
by
a
panel of raters on a 5-point scale while
riding on a vehicle at constant speed;
(ii) Measurement of surface irregularities under a straight edge; and
(iii) Measurement
of
unevenness by special equipment like profilograph
which
plots
the
road
surface
profile,
or a bump integrater which
cumulates the unevenness in terms of cm/km while riding
at
a
cons-
tant speed employing a fixed diameter
wheel.
Besides
safety,
since
riding quality is an important factor affecting vehicle operating
cost.



======================================================================
PAGE 93 of 124
======================================================================
Explanatory Notes
79
it will be a good practice to assess the riding quality at least
once
in
a year for planning maintenance and other remedial measures.
(3)
Surface unevenness of a pavement, to a great
extent
is
influenced
by
the
unevenness
built in at the time of construction.
It
is,
therefore,
important
that
all
care
is
taken about surface
regularity at the time of construction/reconstruction.
For guidance
in
this
regard,
reference may
be
made
to
IRC
: SP
: 16-1977
^Surface Evenness of Highway
Pavements*
which
lays down
the
norms and makes suggestions on their achievement.
3.5.3.
Skid resistance
(1) Skid
resistance
has
not
been
a
major factor for roads
in
the
country
in
view
of
the
predominant use of open graded
surfacings
and
relatively
lower
speeds.
However,
this
aspect
is
gaining
importance in view of the progressive use
of smoother
surfacings and the development of high speed highways.
(2)
Identification of potential slick spots can be
made
in
a
number of ways.
Some of these are
:
(i) Predominance
of
single
vehicle
accident
indicates skidding possi-
bilities:
(ii) Higher proportion of accidents during wet weather indicates skidding
potential;
(iii) Absence or inadequacy of superelevation at
horizontal
curves may
lead to skidding accidents;
(iv) Bleeding bituminous surfaces have high skid-risk potential;
(v)
Horizontal curves on heavily trafficked roads provided with
asphaltic
or
cement
concrete
surfaces,
particularly attended with oil spillage
from vehicles have high potential for skidding.
(3)
Measures for correcting the slick spots include the provi-
sion of skid-proof surfacing, correction to superelevation at horizon-
tal
curves,
sand
blotting
of bleeding
surfaces,
etc.
For more
details, reference may be made to I.R.C. Highway Research Board
Special Report No. 2-1976 *State-of-the Art: Pavement
Slipperiness
and Skid Resistance*.
3.6.
Traffic Regulation and Control
3.6.1.
General
(1)
Traffic regulation
is concerned with
matters
relating
to



======================================================================
PAGE 94 of 124
======================================================================
80
Explanatory Notes
the
control
of
vehicles,
drivers
and
other
road
users, and the
manner of their using the road space.
In India, the traffic is mixed
in character, and the spectrum of vehicles range from
fast
moving
passenger
cars
to slov^^ moving animal carts, hand carts, etc. each
competing for the available road space.
Well thought-out
regula-
tion
and
control measures are therefore of paramount importance
for the safe and efficient
movement
of
vehicles
and
pedestrians
having different physical and speed characteristics.
(2)
Traffic regulation and control
measures
can
be
dealt
with under three broad heads, namely
:
(i) Legislative measures;
(ii) Engineering measures; and
(iii) Traffic control devices.
For best results,
ii is important that all these measures should
complement and
supplement
one another, and should be backed
by effective enforcement.
3.6.2.
Legislative measures
(1)
In India, the Motor Vehicles Act 1939 as amended
from
time
to
time
along with the locallegislations provide the basis for
regulating vehicles, drivers, and
traffic movement.
Under
these,
adequate
provisions
have
been
made
to
control
and manage
vehicular traffic through traffic laws covering different aspects such
as dimensions and weights of vehicles, speed limits,
restrictions
on
the
use
of
certain
vehicles
on
specified routes, parking places,
traffic signs, etc.
Some of
these
measures
are
discussed
in
the
following paragraphs.
Regulation of speed
(2)
Imposition of speed limit is
a
powerful
tool
in
traffic
regulation
and
safety, and the general experience has been that it
brings down the number of those who
drive
at
high
speeds
and
reduces
accident
rate.
Regulation of speed may be warranted
in
the following situations
:
(i) In urban areas, because of ihe mixed
traffic,
too
frequent
intersec-
tions
and
large pedestrian flows, particular care
is warranted in the
vicinity of schools and colleges.
(ii) In rural areas for the control of heavy commercial vehicles.

for
the
protection
of
pedestrians and other slow
traffic.
(iv) At locations
where
geometric
deficiencies
do
not
permit
higher
speeds,
such
as
at
sharp horizontal curves and at locations having
restricted visibility.
(3)
A variety of factors influence the value of speed
limit
to
be applied.
Important among these are
:
(i) Running speed of traffic—normally,
the
85th
percentile
speed
of
vehicles
is selected for speed limit.
Speeds survey v^ould yield data to
determine this.
(ii) Road conditions—the geometry of the road, gradient,
sight
distance,
street
lighting,
safety
measures for pedestrians, etc. are some of the
aspects that should be studied before selecting the speed
limit.
(iii) Environment of the road— the extent
of roadside
development,
the
frequency
and
nature
of access points, the presence of schools, play
fields, cinema houses, and places of worship
attracting
large crowds
are some of the conditions governing the speed limit.
(iv) Traffic -the volume and
mixed
nature
of
traffic
also
govern
the
speeds
limits.
For
heavy
commercial vehicles, lower speed limits,
should be applied
because
of
iheir
potentiality
for
more
serious
accidents.
(v) Accident rates— Analysis of
past
accident
rates
will
give
positive
indication whether there
is any need of imposing speed limits,
and
if
so the actual limit.
(4)
The speed limits suggested in the Motor Vehicles Act for
rural areas are reproduced in Table 3.4.
The speed limits recom-
mended by the Indian Roads Congress (IRC
: 70-1977
'Guidelines
on
Regulation
and Control of Mixed Traffic in Urban Areas') for
application to mixed traffic conditions in urban
areas
are
given
in
Table 3.5.
(5)
Posting of speed limits alone
is
not just
sufficient,
and
there should be strict enforcement.
A
variety
of equipment
like
enoscope
and
radar speed meter are available for detecting speed
violation, and these have
become
popular
with
the
enforcement
authorities.

Regulation concerning the driver
(7)
Regulations concerning the
driver
as
provided
in
the
Motor Vehicles Act cover the following aspects
:
(i) Licensing of the driver
(ii) Requirements of physical fitness
(iii) Age of driver
(iv)
Disqualification and endorsement of licences.
The present regulations
are
adequate
to
ensure
physical
fitness
and driving ability on the part of the
driver,
but
what
is
crucial
is
the
strict
enforcement.
The
drivers are expected not to drive
in a rash
and
negligent manner
and
failure
to
observe
this
is
deemed
to
be
an
offence.
Driving under the influence of liquor
or drugs, and driving when mentally or
physically
unfit
are
also
punishable offences.
Regulation of non-motorised traffic
(8)
Cyclists constitute a large number amongst those
driving
a
non-motorised
vehicle
in urban areas.
By and large no licence
is required to ride a bicycle, and the
cyclists
do
not
feel
obliged
to
acquire
any
formal
knowledge of traffic rules and regulations.
The result is that a large number
of
accidents
have
been
taking
place
in
the
city streets which can be attributed to the cyclists not
having
proper
traffic
sense
or
the
bicycles
not
fitted
with
the
necessary
safety equipment like bell,
light, reflector or brake.
For
ensuring smooth and safe flow of cycle traffic under
mixed
traffic
conditions as obtaining on
our
roads,
the
following
rules
could
be considered for enforcement
:
(i) Making it compulsory
for
the
bicycles
to
be
provided
with
head
lamp, back reflector, bell and brakes;



======================================================================
PAGE 98 of 124
======================================================================
84
Explanatory Notes
(ii) Making it obligatory for the cyclists to use the separate
cycle
tracks,
where provided;
(iii) Prohibiting
the
cyclists from
carrying
any
other
person
on
the
vehicle, or loads other
than what can
safely
be accommodated
in
the front basket or the rear carrier;
(iv) Prohibiting the cycles from being towed by any other vehicle;
(v) Ensuring that not more than 2 cycles remain abreast except
on
cycle
tracks; and
(vi) Making
it obligatory for the cyclists to keep
to
the extreme
left
of
the carriageway where no separate cycle tracks have been provided.
(9)
As
regards
hand-pulled
and
aniinal-drawn
carts,
the
following regulations,
if
enforced,
would
be
useful
from
safety
angle
:
(i) Making
it obligatory for them to carry a lantern at night
and
to
fix
red reflectors at the rear;
(ii) Prohibiting
the
use
of any
cart from carrying pipes or rods longer
than 5 m.
Ends of these loads
should
be
provided
with
red
flags
during day time and red lamps during hours of darkness;
(iii) Making
it
obligatory
for
the carts to ply only on the slow carriage-
way wherever provided.
Where such a facility is not there,
the
carts
should be made to keep to the extreme left of the carriageway; and
(iv) Prohibiting the plying of the carts on fast busy roads
at
least
during
the hours of peak traffic.
Regulations of pedestrians
(10)
In urban areas,
a
substantial
nuinber
of
fatalities
in
accidents
pertain
to
pedestrians.
It
is,
therefore,
important
to
regulate the movement of pedestrians for
which
purpose
enforce-
ment of the following may be helpful
:
(i) Making
it obligatory for
the
pedestrians
to
walk on
the
footpaths
where such facilities have been provided; and
(ii) They must be made to cross the roads by subway or pedestrian over-
bridges where such facilities have been provided.
At other
locations
they
should
be
permitted
to
cross
the
road
only
at
pedestrian
crossings.
Prohibiting certain types of vehicles on certain roads
(11)
Most
of the
problems
of congestion arises during the
peak hours, and
it
will
be
worth
considering
the
prohibition
of
the
vehicles
which
create
the maxiinum congestion.
This, how-

ever, will be
successful
only
where
a
suitable
alternative
route
is available.
The measures can be
:
(i)
Prohibiting the plying of heavy commercial vehicles and
slow-moving
carls dui ing the peak hours; and
(ii) Prohibiting
the
plying
of heavy commercial
vehicles
along routes
where schools
are
located,
during
the
opening and
closing
hours
of the schools.
Parking regulation
(12)
The
phenomenal
growth
of motor
vehicles
in towns
and
cities
has
brought
into
sharp focus the problem of parking.
A vehicle parked on the
road
occupies
some
road
space
which
could
otherwise
have
been
used
by
a moving vehicle, and also
causes
obstruction
to
visibility
which
is
particularly
crucial
at
intersections.
Safety,
comfort
and
convenience
of
road
users
demand a proper and effective regulation of parking.
(13)
The
parking
problem
which
is becoming acute parti-
cularly in the CBD areas can be looked at from two angles:
(i)
Controlling the parking demand
through
town
planning measures
and augmenting the parking supply
through
engineering
measures;
and
(ii)
Regulating
the
effective
utilisation
of
the
available
parking
spaces.
As
regards
the
first
aspect,
the measures include control on the
construction of multi-storeyed
commercial
and
office
complexes,
cinema halls, etc.,
which
generate
huge
parking
demand,
and
insisting
on
providing their own parking spaces. Guidance on the
need for parking spaces
for
different
types
of
buildings
can
be
had from IRC: SP: 12-1973 'Tentative Recommendation on the Pro-
vision
of Parking
Spaces
for
Urban
Areas'.
Side
by
side, the
supply-demand
position
of parking
spaces
should
be
assessed
periodically
by
parking
surveys,
and
further
augmentation
in
the
form
of
off-street
parking
spaces,
multi-storeyed
parking
garages, etc. should be thought of.
(14)
For
the
effective
utilisation
of
the
available parking
spaces
with
traffic
safety
in
view,
the
following regulations are
normally imposed:

3.6.3.
Engineering measures
(1)
Engineering
measures
of
traffic
regulation
include
segregation
of
traffic by their operational characteristics, provision
of suitable facilities for the safe movement
and
crossing
of pede-
strians
and
cyclists,
measures
for
safe
and
quick movement of
vehicles,
etc. Some
of
these
are
discussed
in
the
following
paragraphs.
Segregation of traffic
(2)
Movement
of mixed
traffic
in
the same stream causes
friction between
vehicles
of
different
operational characteristics,
and
reduces
the speed and capacity.
Further, in a mixed stream,
motor vehicles are subject
to
frequent
stop-start
or
deceleration
-acceleration
operations
resulting
in
wastage of fuel and
intense
atmospheric
pollution.
All
this
can
be
obviated by segregating
the slow moving vehicles from the fast moving
ones.
Segregation
can
be
effected
by providing separate carriageways, atleast 5.5 m
wide,
for
slow
traffic.
The
actual
cross-section
to
be
adopted
will
depend on the
available
land width. Where land
is limited,
it
will
be
worthwhile
to
combine
the
space
for bicycles, other
slow-vehicles and
local
traffic
into
a single carriageway on each
side with separate
lanes
for
fast
moving
through
traffic
instead
of
a common
carriageway
for all.
Fig.3.19, shows a few typical
cross-sections effecting traffic segregation.
One-way streets

Adoption

streets

has proved to be successful in many cases. One-way street
system
results
in
better
utilisation
of
the
available
streets,
improved
safety
because
of reduced conflicts at intersections, elimination of
head-on collisions and headlight
glare
from
on-coming
vehicles,
higher operating speeds for vehicles, and involves
least
cost
com-
pared to other alternatives.
This system
is eminently suited v^^here
grid-iron pattern of roads exists, and for other cases should be consi-
dered only where parallel streets of adequate capacity are available
at
intervals
not
exceeding
200 m
and
it is possible to merge the
two one-way streets at a suitable point into two-way streets.
Provision for through traffic passing through cities and towns
(4)
In
cities
and
towns
falling
in
the
route
of
through
highways
like
the
National
Highway,
a major safety problem
is
created because of the
through
traffic
moving
on
the
congested
urban streets. There are two ways of tackling this problem:
(i)
Segregating
the
local and
slow-moving
traflSc
by
constructing
service
roads,
footpaths
etc.,
so
that
the through traffic can flow
unhindered.
This however
is
possible
only when
the
urban
link
has a land width of at least 30 m, and
(ii)
Constructing a byepass for the through
traffic.
In
either
case,
it will be desirable to carry out an economic anal-
ysis for
choosing the best alternative.
Facilities for commercial traffic
(5)
Many of the busy arterial roads
in
the
heart
of
cities/
towns
are
dotted
with
warehouses, wholesale markets and com-
mercial establishments where loading/unloading of goods
constitu-
tes
an
important
activity.
In
the
absence
of any lay-byes, the
trucks
park
on
the
main
carriageway
for
long
periods,
thus
usurping
the
precious
space
of the moving traffic.
Further, the
unloaded goods and those waiting to be loaded are stacked on
the
footpaths intended for pedestrians.
All this contributes
to
serious
congestion,
confusion
and
traffic
hold-ups
leading to hazardous
situations.
Some of the
measures
for
obviating
these
problems
are
:
(i) Restricting the loading/unloading of trucks only during the night
time
when the traffic
is low;
(ii) Shifting wholesale markets generating a lot of
inflow/outflow
traffic
to outskirts of the city with in-built facilities;



======================================================================
PAGE 102 of 124
======================================================================
88
Explanatory Nous
(iii) Providing liuck terminals far away from llic city ccnirc wiih
suilablc
approaches, thereby decentralising the bulk of loading and
unloading
activities from the congested areas of the city; and
(iv) Insisting at construction stage on all new business premises to provide
for off-slreet loading/unloading facilities.
Bicycle traffic
(6)
In the recent past, there has been a phenomenal
growth
of
bicycle
traffic
in
and
around
cities
and towns, and cyclists
constitute one of the major groups of accident victims.
The move-
ment of cyclists on the main carriageway along with the fast
traffic
gives rise to traffic conflicts at intersections as well as along narrow
congested
streets'
Some
of the solutions for alleviating the situa-
tion are
:
(i) Segregating the cycle traffic
by
constructing
separate
cycle
tracks.
IRC: 11-1962 'Recommended
Practice
for
the
Design and Layout
of
Cycle
Tracks',
provides
guidelines on the warrants, design and
construction of cycle tracks.
(ii) At intersections, particularly
the major
ones,
necessary
provisions
should
be made
for
the
safe movement of cycle traffic.
This may
be in the form of separate phase for cyclists at multi-phase
signalised
intersections; provision of cycle boxes ahead
of
the
stop
line
and
separate
turning
lanes
for
them; and
posting of police with loud
speakers for warning erring cyclists and motorists.
Pedestrian traffic
(7)
Pedestrians constitute the single
largest
group
of
acci-
dent
victims
in
urban
areas.
This
is
for
the
reason that the
pedestrian volumes are increasing leaps
and
bounds,
and
that
a
substantial
proportion
of
them
are
not familiar with the traffic
rules
and
regulations.
Apart
from
education
and enforcement,
certain engineering measures will be
highly
helpful
in
improving
the safety of pedestrians.
'
(8)
Tlie requirements of pedestrians are sufficient
space
for
walking along the road and earmarked areas for crossing the
road
with
safety.
^ Raised
footpaths
of adequate width, provided with
uniform
surface
and
kept
free
of vendors, hawkers and other
encroachments will provide safe passage for pedestrians along
the
road and discourage them from spilling on
to
the
main
carriage-
way.
IRC
: 86-1983 provides guidelines on the design of footpaths



======================================================================
PAGE 103 of 124
======================================================================
Explanatory Noies
89
under different situations.
Where the streets are narrow
and
the
pedestrian
flows
are heavy due to commercial/shopping activity,
it
will be advantageous to reserve
these
for
the
exclusive
use
of
pedestrians or as pedestrian precincts.
(9)
For the safe crossing of roads by pedestrians, all
impor-
tant
intersections
should
provide
for
pedestrian
cross-walks.
Besides this, pedestrian crossings should also be provided
at
loca-
tions
which
generate
pedestrian
traffic such as cinemas, schools,
etc.
The crossings should be visible
for
adequate
distance
from
either
side
and
provided
with "Zebra" markings and pedestrian
crossing signs so that the driver of an approaching
vehicle
will
be
alerted about the pedestrians crossing
the
road.
The
cross-walk
can also be made priminent by providing flashing beacons.
(10)
Crossing of a busy and wide
arterial
road
by
a
large
number
of pedestrians may necessitate the provision of pedestrian
sub-ways or over-passes.
Such facilities are expensive and
should
therefore, be provided only when there is sufficient justification
for
the
same.
The
justification
could
be
the
combined eff'ects of
pedestrian
accidents,
and
delay
to
both
vehicular
traffic
and
pedestrians.
When
such
facilities
are
constructed,
it
will
be
desirable
to
post
policemen at these locations atleast to guide the
pedestrians to cross the road only through these and not otherwise.
(11)
Provision of railing barriers at the footpath
edges
will
be helpful in preventing pedestrians from
spilling on
to
the
main
carriageway, particularly on busy
roads
and
intersections.
They
also help in preventing pedestrians from crossing the road
at
their
will and force them to cross only at pre-determined and
well
noti-
fied
cross-walks.
The
railings
should be of aesthetically pleasing
design and should not be too low to permit easy cross-over.
3.6.4.
Traffic control devices
(1)
A traffic control device
is any
sign,
signal,
marking
or
device
placed
or erected for the purpose of regulating, warning or
guiding traffic.
Basic requirements of
traffic
control
devices
are
to
:
(i) compel attention;
(ii) permit lime for easy response;



======================================================================
PAGE 104 of 124

Explanatory Notes
(iii) makes its meaning clear at a glance; and
(iv) command respect.
The basic requirements are achieved by
appropriate
design,
placement,
maintenance
condition,
visibility,
and
uniformity
of
application.
Road
signs
(2)
A road sign
is a device mounted on a fixed or a portable
support to give, in the form of symbols and/or
descriptions,
warn-
ing, direction or giiidence to traffic.
Road signs have
a
profound
influence on road safety.
It has been often found
that
posting
of
an appropriate sign has improved safety at an
accident-prone
spot
to a great extent.
(3)
The Ninth Schedule of
the
Motor
Vehicles
Act,
1939
has been amended to introduce the new system
of symbolic
signs
in conformity with the international signs.
Complete details of the
signs
including
guidelines
on
their
erection
are
contained
in
IRC
: 67-1977 'Code of Practice for Road Signs'.
The new system
of signs should become fully operational by
first
June, 1985.
For
new
roads,
the
complete
sign
system
should
be planned at the
design stage and installed before opening the roads to
traffic.
On
existing
roads,
a
careful
survey
should
be
done
to assess the
requirements and the signs should be installed
and
maintained
in
good condition without loss of time.
On rural highways and
unlit
roads,
increasing
use
of
reflectorised
signs
should
be made for
improved
visibility
at
night.
It
is
also important to educate the
road users of the new system of signs
and
the
message
given
by
them for easy recognition and compliance.
(4)
Road Signs are
classified
into
three
categories
given
below
:
Mandatory/
...These inform the road users of laws and
regulations.
Regulatory
Violation of these
is a legal offence.
Cautionary/
...Warn road users of the existence of certain hazardous
Warning
conditions.
Informatory
...For information and guidance of road users.
So far traffic safety is
concerned,
mandatory
signs
are
the
most
important
followed
by
cautionary
signs, while informatory



======================================================================
PAGE 105 of 124
======================================================================
Explanatory Notes
signs although not directly connected
with
safety,
provide
useful
information
for
the
road
user.
It
should
be understood that a
wrong or wrongly placed sign
is more dangerous
than
no
sign
at
all.
(5)
It is very important that the road user
is
able
to
recog-
nise
the
signs
easily and in time.
These should be placed on the
left hand side of the road in plain/rolling terrain and on the
valley
side of the road in hills.
Care should also be taken that these
are
not
placed
in
such
a way as
to obstruct vehicular
traffic.
On
kerbed roads, the edge of sign should be atleast 60 cm
away
from
the
edge
of the
kerb whereas on unkerbed roads the edge of the
signs should be at a distance of 2 m from the edge of the
carriage-
way.
(6)
The signs should be properly oriented for the
drivers
to
see them at proper time.
On horizontal curves, the signs should be
placed at right angles to
the
line
of
travel
of
the
approaching
traffic.
On grades,
it is desirable to tilt the sign forward
or
back-
ward to improve the viewing angle.
Traffic signals
(7)
Traffic signals fall under two broad
categories,
namely,
fixed time signals and vehicle actuated signals.
The Indian Roads
Congress
is
in
the
process of finalising detailed guidelines on the
design and installation of fixed time traffic signals.
(8)
Traffic signals are eminently suited for
control
of
traffic
at intersection on heavily trafficked urban roads.
Where a number
of signals fall on the same roads, all these should
be
synchronised
for easy movement of through traffic without delay.
(9)
Traffic signals should be installed only
where
they
are
warranted.
Their use should be avoided on high speed
highways
or in the proximity of pronounced down grades.
Road markings
(10)
Road markings are lines, patterns
and
words
applied
on the carriageway or kerbs, on to objects within or adjacent to the
carriageway for control, warning, guidance or information of road-
users.
Because of their position in the
normal
field
of
attention

HXPLANATORY NoiES
and visual focus, they serve as a very effective means in
conveying
the intended message to the drivers without diverting their attention
from the roadway.
Detailed guidelines on the
design
and
appli-
cation of road markings are contained
in IRC
: 35-1970
'Code
of
Practice for Road Markings (with Paints)'.
(11)
From safety angle, the most crucial locations for
appli-
cation
of pavement
markings
are
at intersections, and at summit
curves
with
limited
visibility
for
marking
no-passing
zones.
Examples of these are illustrated in Figs. 3.24.
and
3.25.
respec-
tively.
(12)
The road markings should be
periodically
renewed
to
maintain their functional efficiency.
Road delineators
(13)
The role of delineators
is
to
provide
visual
assistance
to
drivers
about
alignment of the road ahead, especially at night.
Delineators are classified under three types
:
(i) Roadway indicators
:
Located at the edge of usable shoulder,
these
are
intended
to
delineate
the
edges of the roadway so as to guide
drivers about the alignment ahead.
(ii) Hazard markers
:
These are to define obstructions
lilce
guard-rails
and abutments
adjacent
to the carriageway, for instance at culverts
and
bridges which
are narrower than the roadway width at approa-
ches.
(iii) Object markers
:
These are used to
indicate
hazards and
obstruc-
tions
within
the
vehicle
flow path, for example channelising islands
close to intersections.
For details on the design and placement of road
delineators,
reference may be made to IRC
: 79-1981 "Recommended
Practice
for Road Delineators",

General
Accidents are incidents
on
the
road
involving
damage
to
property,
injuries
to people, or less of life, or a combination of all
these.
Accidents
have
been
happening
and
will
continue
to
happen
as
long
as there is movement on the roads, but the major
concern of the people as well as the concerned
authorities
is how

to
reduce
the number of accidents, and even if they happen, how
to reduce their intensity and the resulting trauma.
This calls for a
clear understanding as to why
the
accidents
happen,
how
they
happen,
the parameters involved alongwith their relative contribu-
tion, etc. and will require properly recorded
accident
information
as a first step in the analysis.
The importance of accurate accident
information and its objective analysis
in
any
traffic
safety
pro-
gramme either at the macro or the micro level, therefore, needs no
special emphasis.
It
should
also
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
correctness
or
appropriateness
of any remedial measure derived
from accident analysis will, to
a
great
degree,
depend
on
the
correctness and completeness of the accident information.
In view
of the voluminous data to be processed,
it
will
be
advantageous
for the authorities concerned with accident
analysis
to
make
use
of computer facilities.
3.7.2.
Accident recording
(1)
In India, the Police are primarily responsible for
record-
ing
road
accidents.
Details
of
individual
road
accidents
are
recorded by them on
Road
Accident
Form A-1 which was origi-
nally introduced in 1939.
On the basis of Form
A-1,
the
Police
prepare a summary of road
accidents
occurring
during
the
year
in the Road Accident Form-4.
These summaries are subsequently
utilised by the State and Central Statistical Cells to develop overall
accident statistics.
(2) However, the information emenating
from
these
Forms
have not been complete
or
sufficient to make a
scientific analysis
for the
cause
of
the
accidents.
To
improve
the
situation,
the
Indian
Roads
Congress
has
finalised
revised Forms
A-1 and 4
with a view to collecting
more
specific and
detailed information,
vide IRC
:
53-1982 'Road
Accident Forms
A-1
and
4'.
These
forms, if filled in properly,
provide the
necessary
information on
the drivers,
vehicles
and
others
involved
in
the
accident,
the
geometric and surface features of
the
road,
environmental
para-
meters at the time of the accident, etc.
for
facilitating
parametric
analysis.
The format of the Forms has been designed to
facilitate
computer processing.
For ensuring proper filling of
these
forms,
the IRC has plans to organise training courses for police personnel
on all-India basis.

Accident analysis
General
(1)
A major objective of accident analysis
is to
discern
the
factors
that
have
been
responsible
for
the
accident
and
their
relative contribution so that appropriate corrective
action could be
taken.
(2) The
analysis
will
depend on the purpose for which it is
made, and the quality and completeness of the
data.
Generally,
the analysis is done for any of the following purposes:
(i) Review of administrative and policy regulations at the macro level;
(ii) Identification of hazardous road sections/locations; and
(iii) Spot improvement of individual
locations.
Analysis for a administrative and policy purposes
(3) Here, the analysis may be for the following purposes:
(i) Keeping an eye on the accident
trend
from year to year, comparing
accident
rate
with
other
countries,
or
between States or between
cities
so that
any
alarming
situation
can
be dircerned for further
investigation and
corrective
action.
For this purpose, the accident
or fatality rate can be expressed in terms of the number
of accidents
or
fatalities
for
every
100,000
population
or
10,000
registered
vehicles.
(ii) For policy decisions
including
making amendments
to
the Motor
Vehicles Act for tightening control over or correcting any
deficiency
as the major accident causative factors.
For this purpose,
it
will be
necessary to make an analysis for the dominant causes
of
accidents.
For instance, if human failure
has been
the major cause,
concerted
attention could be directed towards education,
stricter
control
over
driver licensing and better enforcement.
Similarly if vehicle
failures
contribute to a good proportion
of
the
accidents,
attention
could
be paid to stricter control over fitness of
vehicles and
measures
for
improving vehicle equipment.
If road factors happen to be dominant,
standards
for
geometric
design and road
surface
characteristics,
and policy on traffic control devices may warrant a review.
(iii) For
planning
decisions and
further
investments
with
regard
to
improving
safety
measures
relating
to
major
target
groups
of
accident victims.
For
this
purpose,
the
analysis should be for the
• type
or types of
persons
(e.g.
pedestrians,
cyclists, etc.)
killed
or
injured in road accidents.
For example, if it
is found for a city
that
pedestrians constitute the major group of
victims,
concerted
action
could be taken to improve
pedestrian
facilities and educate them on
road safety through mass media.

Analysis for identification of hazardous road sections/locations
(4) The main
objective
of
this
analysis
is
to
identify
and
locate road sections or locations which
have
shown
to
be
nnore
prone to accidents than others.
The idea
is
that
once
such
sec-

are
identified,
further
detailed
studies
including
spot inspections could be made
to find out the causes of accidents
and
the
deficiencies
in
the
roadway
for
evolving
appropriate
remedial measures.
The
analysis
can be on the lines of one
or
more of the following:
(i) Comparison of
accident
rates
of a
series
of road
sections in the
network carrying relatively uniform traffic flow, in terms of accidents
per km.
The example in Table 3.6. illustrates the analysis.
(ii) Comparison of accident rates of road sections in the network
carry-
ing different traffic
intensities, in terms of accident
rates per million
vehicle— km.
The example in Table 3.7. illustrates
the analysis.

(iii) On-spol investigation
of hazardous

be
highly
useful
in
the
identification
of adverse road and
environmental
features
which can be related to the driver's reactions
and
the
difficulties
he
possibly
encounters
so
that
appropriate
corrective
measures could
be developed.
The
investigation
should
also
include
observations
for
conflicts
(i.e.
situations
involving one
or more vehicles where
there is an imminent danger of a
collision).
This may
be done by
a study of traffic flows at site
or
by making
fast
runs
through
the
area
under
investigation.
Such
a
study
can
help
to
identify the
high risk vehicle manoeuvres and
the
locations where they would
occur so that appropriate remedial measures could be thought of.
3.8.
Education
3.8.1.
General
(1)
Statistics
of road
accidents in the country clearly bring
out that in majority of the cases, human failure has been
the
main
cause.
This human
failure may be due to ignorance, carelessness,
downright callousness or indifferent
attitude.
For
correcting
the
situation
in
this
crucial
area,
education
and propaganda or any
measure
to
inculcate
a
better
road
sense
in
the minds of road
users have a vital role to play.
(2) The objective of education concerning road traffic
should
be
to
impress upon the minds of all road users the complexities of
modern day traffic and the dangers underlying the
simple
process
of moving
from
one
place
to
another. Obviously different types
of road
users
require
different types of instructions and guidance
though the basic discipline and an understanding of the rights
and
privileges
of other
road
users
should be common. But one thing
is certain that the earlier a person begins
his education in
life,
the
better road user he will prove to be in
future.
The
best way
to
begin educating a person, therefore,
is in the
beginning
itself,
i.e.
at the primary school
level
when
the
mind
of the child
is
still
impressionable, and whatever discipline or attitude
is
imbibed
at
that time will
last him for his
life.
3.8.2.
Education of the
children
(1)
Education
of
children
should
start from
the primary
classes. Their text books should contain a chapter
or
two
on
the
rules
of the road and the correct methods of crossing and walking
along the streets. Coloured illustrations depicting both

correct

and wrong methods besides leaving a lasting impression will create
the
curiosity
to know why
a particular method
is right or wrong.
This
may
be
supplemented
by
showing them occasionally short
films covering various aspects of traffic problems and accidents.
(2)
As
the
children grow up, they should be encouraged to
get
themselves
enrolled
in
the
School
Safety
Patrols
wherein
they
will
be
required
to
take
training
in
controlling
tralfic at
various
intersection-s
and
pedestrian
crossings
with the
help
of
traffic
police.
This
will help them to come at grips with the reali-
ties
of the
traffic
problems,
and
these
will
leave
an
indelible
mark on their personalities.
(3)
Another
very
effective
method
to
teach
the
children
about
tralfic
problems
is
the
traffic
Training
Park.
This
park
simulates
the
traffic
conditions on the roads and the children are
required to go from one point to another on
their
cycles
or
other
conveyance.
On
the
way,
all
sorts
of
traffic conditions such as
right turns, left turns, etc. are met with and
the
child
is
required
to
negotiate
them,
giving
proper
signals,
etc.,
as per rules and
conventions. The instructor
watches
the
competents,
and
marks
are
allotted
with
the
winners
getting
acclamations
and prizes.
In
this
way,
game
is
combined
with
education,
and very soon
the children acquire proficiency in traffic rules and regulalions.
(4)
As
a
part
of
the national effort in the traffic education
of children, the Indian Roads
Congress
will
shortly
be
bringing
out
two
publications,
one
an
illustrated booklet on Road Safety
For Children, and the other on 'Guidance to teachers
involved
in
road safety education.'
3.8.3.
Education
of
adults
- other
than
drivers
of
motor
vehicles
This
group
includes
pedestrians,
cyclists
and
drivers
of
non-motorised
vehicles.
The
difficulty
with
this
group
is
that
there
are
no
adequate
laws
to regulate them, and by and large,
they
are
ignorant
of
the
existing
traffic
rules
and
regulations.
They
also
require
no
licence
to make
their
presence
on
the
roads.
What
is required
is that they should be educated about the
traffic rules and regulations, the safe way of their
using
the
road
facilities
and
better
road
behaviour.

in this
regard.
3.8.4.
Education of adults-drivers of motor
vehicles
(1)
Drivers
of motor
vehicles,
whether
light
or
heavy,
know
or
atleast
they
are expected to know the rules and regula-
tions
pertaining
to
traffic.
Their
problem
generally
is rashness,
sometimes
drunkenness
and
lack
of
respect
for
the
life
and
safety
of more
vulnerable
people
like
pedestrians and cyclists.
Many
accidents
can
be
avoided
if the
motorists were less impe-
tuous and were trained the art of
'defensive
driving'
i.e.
driving
with
a
very
watchful
eye
on
the
mistakes
that may be or are
likely
to
be
committed
by
the other road users.
For their edu-
cation,
it is desirable that every aspirant for driving
licence
should
be
required
to
undergo
training
in
a recognised driver training
school, and the instructor should inculcate in
him
the
desirability
of adopting
an
attitude
of
defensive
driving
and extending due
courtesy to other road users.
It will also be helpful if a few
model
driving
schools
are
set
up
by
the
Government
to
serve as an
example for others.
(2)
Among the drivers of motorised vehicles, drivers of two-
wheelers (motor cycles, scooters and mopeds)
constitute
the
most
vulnerable
section
because of their instability against even a small
impact.
Some studies have shown that this group of drivers/riders
is 14 times more vulnerable to fatal accidents than
a
traveller
by
any other mode of conveyance, and also that almost all deaths and
most of the severe injury accidents are caused
by
injuries
on
the
head
and
face.
This category of road users should, therefore, be
educated about their greater
vulnerability
and
the
necessity
of
their wearing safety helmets.
3.8.5.
Road safety propaganda
All available types of mass
media,
e.g.,
leaflets,
hoardings,
cinema
films
and
slides,
radio/T.V.
talks, lectures or advertise-
ments, etc. can be utilised for the purposes of road
safety
propa-
ganda.
Audio* visual
media
such
as
cinema and television have
definitely more impact and reach a larger number of persons
than
other
avenues.
For
children,
besides
a
chapter or two in their
text books, comics can
be
very
profitably
utilised.
Commercial

advertisements
in-between
popular programmes in radio/T.V. will
also
have
a
better impact and can reach larger bodies of people.
Similarly, short films on the
tragedy
of road
accidents
with
the
participation
of well-known
personalities from the show-business
can be made and shown in cinema halls-and television
for
greater
impact on the people.
3.9.
Enforcement
3.9.1.
Enforcement of traffic
laws
and
regulations
has
to
cover
a
wide spectrum of people with different backgrounds, etc.,
and for best results the methods adopted should not only
create
a
deterrent to violators or potential violators of traffic laws
but
also
attempt to raise the level of voluntary compliance among the
road
users.
To
achieve
this
objective,
the
great
mass
of road users
should be made to believe that the traffic laws are
reasonable
and
intended
for
the overall welfare of the society, and that in case of
their breakage, court action will be prompt and result in
adequate
and uniform penalties.
3.9.2.
Bulk of the responsibility for enforcement and control
of traffic
lies with the
traffic
police.
The
mere
presence
of
the
policemen induces people to behave in a better way.
The enforce-
ment measures adopted by
the
police
should
be
of
two
kinds,
namely,
(i) punitive measures based on challans, fines,
arrests and
prosecutions
Tor major oftences, and
(ii) non-punitive measures such as active and conspicuous patrols, warn-
ings, education, etc.
As regards the punitive measures, the prosecution should be
quick
and the punishment uniform.
This can be achieved with the
help
of mobile courts which have proved to be very useful in Delhi and
a few other cities.
3.9.3.
Among the non-punitive actions, the following innova-
tive ones which are being adopted
in some cities can have a positive
impact
:
(i)
Instead of challaning or imposing lines on cyclists for the
absence
of
essential
equipment
like
bell
or
light,
it will be more purposeful to
take a vendor of these equipment along with
the
police
squad
and

Explanatory Notes
compel the cyclists to purchase the missing pari.
Similar action
can
be considered for scooterists driving without helmet.
(ii) Similarly, for other minor offences,
the
offenders can
be made
to
compulsorily
attend
traffic
training
classes
to
be
run
by
social
workers.
These are some of the examples which show how
police
enforce-
ment
can
be based upon persuation rather than on force and
still
be more purposeful than imposition of fines.
