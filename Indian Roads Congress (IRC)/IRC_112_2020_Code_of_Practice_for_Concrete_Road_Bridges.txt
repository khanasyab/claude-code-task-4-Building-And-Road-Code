SECTION 2
INTRODUCTION
The Design Criteria for Prestressed Concrete Road Bridges (Post-Tensioned Concrete); IRC:18 and 
Standard Specification and Code of Practice for Road Bridges Section III, Cement Concrete (Plain and 
Reinforced); IRC:21, both based on working stress method, was first published in December 1965 and 
October 1966 respectively. These codes were based on linear elastic theory. The last revisions of these 
two WSM documents were carried out in the year 2000.
Further, considering unprecedented growth of knowledge in the field of concrete bridge technology, 
development of new structural forms, new methods of computer-based analysis and design and 
development of high strength materials, IRC decided to revise the bridge codes using the Limit State 
Method (LSM). Accordingly, it was decided to rationalize all Indian bridge codes, to the Limit State 
approach, in line with international practices. The B-4 Committee worked on this task from the year 
2001 and finally the first concrete code on LSM was published in 2011. This is a unified code covering 
various types of concrete bridges, using plain concrete, reinforced concrete, and prestressed concrete, 
constructed by cast-in-place precast method. This LSM philosophy is an advancement over the 
traditional design philosophies. It allows us to check that the structure remains fit for use throughout its 
design life by remaining within the acceptable limit of safety, serviceability and durability requirements 
based on the risks involved.
Subsequently, IRC also published an explanatory handbook as Special Publication IRC:SP:105 
with the aim to help users and provide guidance on the interpretation and use of IRC:112 along 
with worked-out examples. In addition, numerous special publications on subjects like Voided Slab 
Construction (IRC:SP:64), Segmental Bridges (IRC:SP:65), Continuous Bridges (IRC:SP:66), Use 
of High Performance Concrete (IRC:SP:70), Precast Pre-tensioned Girders (IRC:SP:71), were also 
changed to LSM philosophy and published by IRC for the use and benefit of engineers. The publication 
on External and Unbonded Prestressing Tendons in Bridge Structures is currently under updation to 
LSM (IRC:SP:67).
With the publication of this new concrete LSM code, the existing IRC:18 and IRC:21, both the working 
loads/allowable stress method codes have been withdrawn by IRC. However, considering the need for 
a smooth transition and gradual acquaintance of practicing engineers with the new LSM Code, as 
an alternative, the working stress method design was also allowed and was given in an annexure to 
IRC:112 with a rider that the option of using Annexure-4 was to be exercised by the owner, and that it 
would be available till it was withdrawn.
After receiving feedback on the usage of IRC:112 till 2016 from various stakeholders and also 
considering the policy circular of Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH) No. RW-NH-
35075/9/2006-S&R (B) dated 2nd September 2016 vide which it was decided that all bridges to be 
constructed on National Highways, shall be designed as per IRC:112 following the ‘Limit State Design 
Philosophy’ except those components for which IRC codes and standards based on limit state approach 
were not available. Accordingly, Annexure-4: Structural Design by Working Loads/Allowable Stresses 
Method was withdrawn vide amendment No. 4 to IRC:112 was published in monthly periodical Indian 
Highways in August 2017.

Subsequently, numerous feedbacks/suggestions were received from practicing engineers, designers, users, 
etc and rapid development has been done in the field of concrete technology, other construction material. 
Subsequently about 21 numbers of major amendments, and editorial errata were notified from time to time 
till the year 2019. As the practicing engineers found it difficult to cope up with these amendments, it was 
decided to bring out the revised edition of IRC:112 incorporating all these amendments.

The BSS Committee, in its meeting held on 06.12.2019, while considering proposed amendments, 
also decided that the first revision of IRC:112 should be published incorporating all the proposed 
amendments and approved the amendments in the meeting. Thereafter, at the 219th meeting of the 
IRC Council held in Patna (Bihar) on 19.12.2019 while considering the proposed amendments, it was 
decided that the proposed amendments should also be incorporated in the print version of IRC:112 and 
it should published as the first revision of IRC:112. Hence this revised edition is being brought out.
This publication is meant to serve as a guide to both design and construction engineers, but compliance 
with the provisions therein does not relieve them, in any way, of the responsibility for the stability, 
soundness, durability and safety of the structures designed and constructed by them.
The design and construction of road bridges require an extensive and thorough knowledge of the science 
and technology involved and should be entrusted only to specially qualified engineers with adequate 
experience of bridge engineering, capable of ensuring correct design and execution of bridge works.

structure and which has a high probability of occurrence.
Note:	 A transient design situation refers to temporary conditions of use or exposure of the structure, e.g. during 
construction or repair.
Persistent Design Situation
Design situation that is relevant during a period of the same order as the design working life of the 
structure.
Note:	 Generally it refers to conditions of normal use.
Accidental Design Situation

explosion, impact or local failure.
Seismic Design Situation
Design situation involving exceptional conditions of the structure when subjected to a seismic event.
Design Life

maintenance but without necessity of major repair.
Load Arrangement
Identification of the position, magnitude and direction of a free action.
Load Case
Compatible load arrangements, sets of deformations and imperfections considered simultaneously 
with fixed/variable actions and permanent actions for a particular verification.
Limit States
States beyond which the structure no longer fulfills the relevant design criteria.
Ultimate Limit States
States associated with collapse or with other similar forms of structural failure.
Note:	 These generally correspond to the maximum load-carrying resistance of a structure or structural member.

will remain when the actions are removed.
Serviceability Criterion
Design criterion for a serviceability limit state.
3.1.3	
Terms relating to actions (Also refer Annexure A-1)
Action (F)
a)	
Set of forces (loads) applied to the structure (direct action);
b)	
Set of imposed deformations or accelerations, caused by for example temperature changes, 
moisture variation, uneven settlement or earthquakes (indirect action).
Effect of Action (E)
Effect of actions (or action effect) on structural members, (e.g. internal force, moment, stress, strain) 
or on the whole structure (e.g. deflection, rotation).
Permanent Action (G)
Action that is likely to act throughout a given reference period and for which the variation in magnitude 
with time is negligible, or for which the variation is always in the same direction (monotonic) until the 
action attains a certain limit value.
Variable Action (Q)
Action for which the variation in magnitude with time is neither negligible nor monotonic.
Accidental Action (A)
Action, usually of short duration but of significant magnitude, that may rarely occur on a given structure 
during the design life.
Note:	 An accidental action can be expected in some cases to cause severe global consequences on structures 
unless appropriate measures such as provision of alternative load path are taken.
Seismic Action (AE )
Action that arises due to earthquake ground motions.
Geotechnical Action
Action transmitted to the structure by the ground, fill or groundwater.
Fixed Action
Action that has a fixed distribution and position over the structure or structural member, such that 
the magnitude and direction of the action are determined unambiguously for the whole structure or 
structural member, if this magnitude and direction are determined at one point on the structure or 
structural member.



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
6
Free Action
Action that may have various spatial distributions over the structure.
Single Action
Action that can be assumed to be statistically independent in time and space of any other action acting 
on the structure.
Static Action
Action that does not cause significant acceleration of the structure or structural members.
Dynamic Action
Action that causes significant acceleration of the structure or structural members.
Quasi-static Action
Dynamic action represented by an equivalent static action in a static model.
Characteristic Value of an Action (FK )
Principal representative value of an action considered in the design process.
Note:
(1)	
Insofar as a characteristic value can be fixed on statistical basis, it is chosen so as to correspond to a 
prescribed probability of not being exceeded on the unfavourable side during a ‘reference period’ taking 
into account the design working life of the structure and the duration of the design situation.
(2)	
In absence of data for arriving at value as per (1), a nominal value is used which conceptually performs the 
same function as that of characteristic value but is not associated with any probability number.
Nominal Value
Value fixed on non-statistical bases, for instance, on acquired experience or on physical conditions, 
which may be used in place of characteristic value.
Reference Period
Chosen period of time that is used as a basis for assessing statistically variable actions.
Combination Value of a Variable Action (ΨoQK)
Value chosen, insofar as it can be fixed on statistical basis, so that the probability that the effects caused 
by the combination will be exceeded, is approximately the same as by the characteristic value of an 
individual action. It may be expressed as a determined part of the characteristic value by using a factor

are in equilibrium with a particular defined set of actions on the structure, and depend on geometrical, 
structural and material properties.

SECTION 4 
GENERAL
4.1	
Scope
The Code of Practice for Concrete Road Bridges, hereinafter referred to as the ‘Code’, strives to 
establish common procedures for the design and construction of Concrete road bridges, foot bridges 
and culverts.
The requirements specified in the Code aim at achieving construction of safe, serviceable, durable and 
economical bridges. It covers design principles, detailed design criteria and practical rules, material 
specifications, workmanship, quality control and all such aspects which affect the characteristics/
ability of the bridge to meet the aims.
This Code deals with the structural use of plain cement concrete, reinforced concrete, prestressed 
concrete and composite construction using concrete elements in bridges and is applicable to all 
structural elements using normal weight concrete (density in the range of 24 ± 4 kN/m3) and made 
using cements, aggregate, mineral admixtures, chemical admixtures and water, as given in the Section 
dealing with material specifications in the Code.
All provisions of the Code may not be applicable for hybrid structural systems, or for structures using 
other types of concrete. However, for concrete portion of hybrid elements/structures and for other type 
of concrete, relevant provision of this Code may be used. The term “other types of concrete” includes, 
but is not restricted to:
(1)	
Light Weight Concrete (density <20 kN/m3) and Heavy Weight Concrete (density >28 kN/m3).
(2)	
Concretes using cements, aggregates, mineral and chemical admixtures other than those 
covered in Section 18.
(3)	
Concretes with specially modified properties.
Such uses shall be based on the specialist knowledge, specialist literature and/or experimental data at 
the discretion and responsibility of owners/designers.
Requirements of blast resistance and fire resistance are not covered in the Code.
4.2	
Underlying Assumptions
The applicability of this document rests on the following assumptions:
(1)	
The choice of structural system and the design of the structure are made by appropriately 
qualified and experienced personnel.
(2)	
Execution is carried out by personnel having appropriate qualification, skill and experience.
(3)	
Adequate supervision and quality control are provided during all stages of design and 
construction.
(4)	
The construction materials and products are provided and used as specified by relevant 
national standards.
(5)	
The intended levels of properties of material adopted in the design are available.
(6)	
The structure is used as intended and is maintained adequately.

SECTION 5
BASIS OF DESIGN
5.1	
Aims of Design
5.1.1	
General performance requirements
The bridge, as a complete structural system and its structural elements should perform their functions 
adequately and safely, with appropriate degrees of reliability during design life and during construction. 
It should withstand all actions, consisting of applied and induced loads as well as environmental 
influences liable to occur, retaining its structural integrity, and also withstand accidental loads (e.g. barge 
impact/vehicular impact) and earthquake loads without causing damage, which is disproportionate to 
the causative event. Adequacy of performance is defined in terms of serviceability, safety, durability 
and economy.
5.1.2	
Reliability aspects and codal approach
The term ‘degree of reliability’ is used to indicate the acceptably low level of probability of failure in 
meeting the expected performance during a specified period of time.
Determination of the reliability measured in terms of statistical probability requires knowledge of 
statistical parameters which define loading and material strengths. This data together with knowledge 
of structural models of resistance enable evaluation of structural performance in probabilistic terms. 
At the present state of knowledge, determination of reliability is possible only in limited load cases 
for simple structures. The Code, therefore, strives to achieve the desirable degree of reliability by 
approximate methods based upon a combination of the following:
(1)	
Known statistical parameters describing properties of materials and actions.
(2)	
Deterministic models of structural behaviour.
(3)	
The international practices and past experience of acceptable/unacceptable performance of 
structures.
(4)	
Partial factors for actions and resistance models based on calibration and rationalisation of 
existing international practices.
5.1.3	
Safety, serviceability, durability and economy
The requirements of the Code directly address safety, serviceability and durability aspects.
Economy is indirectly addressed by:
(1)	
Allowing maximum exploitation of materials and specifying use of technologies which are 
consistent with the minimum/desirable standards of safety, serviceability and durability,
(2)	
Accepting appropriate levels of economic risks while specifying performance levels by 
taking into consideration different design situations, load combinations (events), importance 
of structure in view of consequences of failure, and by specifying different intended design 
lives for replaceable and non-replaceable parts.

======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
16
5.2	
Limit State Philosophy of Design
(1)	
The response of the structure when subjected to different magnitudes of loads lies in 
different states (domains). ‘Limit States’ are defined as limits of domains beyond which the 
structure does not meet specified performance criteria.
	
In ‘Limit State Philosophy’ of design, various boundaries of acceptable/unacceptable 
performance are defined together with the circumstances in which such performances are 
expected.
(2)	
Two basic groups of limit states are considered:
	
(a)	
Ultimate Limit States (ULS): These limit states cover static equilibrium and failure 
of structural elements or structure as a whole, when acted upon by ‘ultimate design 
loads’.
	
(b)	
Serviceability Limit States (SLS): These limit states deal with the condition of the 
structure subjected to influence of ‘serviceability design loads’. These conditions 
include level of internal stress, fatigue failure, deflection, damage to structural element 
such as cracking and discomfort to users due to vibrations.
(3) 	
The representative values of actions and combination of actions representing different 
design situations are defined. The representative values of loads are modified by using load 
factors for each of the basic limit states, which are then combined using combination factors. 
The combination factors take into account the probability of simultaneous occurrence of 
loads.
(4) 	
The response of the structure is calculated using principles of mechanics and simplified 
established models describing behavior of concrete members. These methods also account 
for inherent geometric variations which are kept within acceptable construction tolerances.
(5)	
The response of the structure is required to lie within acceptable domain for different 
combinations of actions.
(6)	
The structure designed by following this philosophy, and constructed by satisfying other 
stipulations of the Code are deemed to meet the general performance requirements stipulated 
in Clause 5.1.1.
5.3	
Limit States
The structure shall be designed for the following limit states:
5.3.1	
Ultimate limit states (ULS)
5.3.1.1	
Limit state of equilibrium
When subjected to various design combinations of ultimate loads, the bridge or any of its components 
considered as a rigid body, shall not become unstable.
5.3.1.2	
Limit state of strength
The bridge or any of its components shall not lose its capacity to sustain the various ultimate load 
combinations by excessive deformation, transformation into a mechanism, rupture, crushing or 
buckling.



======================================================================
PAGE 27 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
17
5.3.2	
Serviceability limit states (SLS)
5.3.2.1	
Limit state of internal stress
The internal stresses developed in the materials of structural elements shall not exceed the specified 
magnitudes when subjected to combination of serviceability design actions. The stresses are to be 
estimated using resistance models to represent the behaviour of structure, as stipulated in the Code.
5.3.2.2	
Limit state of crack control
(1)	
The cracking of reinforced, partially prestressed, and prestressed concrete structures under 
serviceability load combinations is kept within acceptable limits of crack widths in such a 
way as not to adversely affect the durability or impair the aesthetics.
(2)	
Alternatively, the control of cracking is deemed to be satisfied by following restrictions on 
amount and spacing of reinforcement.
5.3.2.3	
Limit state of deformation
(1) 	
The deformation of the bridge or its elements when subjected to combination of design 
actions shall not adversely affect the proper functioning of its elements, appurtenances, and 
riding quality. 
(2) 	
Deformations during construction shall be controlled to achieve proper geometry of finished 
structure.
5.3.2.4	
Limit state of vibration
(1)	
For footbridges or component of bridges specifically designed to carry footway loading, 
the direct verification of vibration limits is required, for which specialist literature may be 
referred.
(2)	
For special types of bridges and their components dynamic effects under action of wind 
are required to be calculated and verified to be within acceptable limits. Model tests are 
required under certain circumstances.
(3)	
For other types of bridges, the limit state of vibration under serviceability load combinations 
is deemed to be satisfied by limiting deflection of elements.
5.3.2.5	
Limit state of fatigue
The bridge or any of its components shall not loose its capacity to carry design loads by virtue of 
its materials reaching fatigue limits due to its loading history. For carrying out fatigue verification, 
specialist literature may be referred.
However, fatigue verification is not necessary for the following:
(a)	
For Reinforced concrete structures when the stress in the tensile reinforcement is less than 
300 MPa under Rare Combination of Serviceability Limit State as against 0.8 fy specified in 
clause no. 12.2.2.
(b)	
For prestressed concrete structures under the frequent combination of action and prestressing 
force, only compressive stresses occur at the extreme concrete fibres, under Serviceability 
Limit State.

5.4	
Actions and their Combinations
5.4.1	
Types of action
(1)	
An action is:
	
-	
Direct action, i.e. force (load) applied to structure.
	
-	
Indirect action, i.e. forces arising from imposed or constrained deformation, such 
as that caused by settlement, temperature changes, seismic acceleration and impact 
loads.
(2)	
Actions are classified:
	
(a) 	 By their variation in time (duration of application) :
	
-	
Permanent Actions (G), e.g. self-weight,
	
-	
Variable Actions (Q), e.g. imposed live loads,
	
-	
Accidental Actions (A), e.g. barge impact load.
	
	
Some variable actions, acting for long durations are treated on par with 
permanent actions. These are called ‘Quasi-Permanent’ actions.
	
(b)	
By their nature and/or by response of the structure to them:
	
-	
Static actions are those which do not cause significant acceleration of members 
on which they act.
	
-	
Dynamic actions are those which cause significant acceleration of members on 
which they act.
	
	
Some dynamic actions can be represented by ‘Quasi-Static’ actions, which 
are 	 the static values producing equivalent or representative response (stress/
deformation) in the structure caused by the dynamic action.
(3)	
Prestressing force (P) is a permanent action with time-dependent variation.
5.4.2	
Characteristic and combinational values of actions
5.4.2.1	
Characteristic value
The characteristic value of an action is generally the main representative value, which can be based 
upon the statistical distribution of magnitudes of action (e.g. a mean value, or upper or lower fractile 
value). Alternatively, a representative ‘nominal value’ is specified which is treated as a characteristic 
value.
A single value is generally specified, except where the design is sensitive to variation of magnitude in 
which case lower and upper values (also referred to as ‘inferior’ and ‘superior’ values respectively) are 
also specified in addition to mean value. These may be specified as absolute values or as a multiple of 
characteristic value.
5.4.2.2	
Combinational value
(1)	
A structure during its construction and service life is acted upon by various direct or indirect 
actions at different times in different combinations, representing various design situations. 
Some of these situations are represented by a few combinations chosen for design checks, 
for which the response of the structure is calculated and verified not to exceed the limit states.



======================================================================
PAGE 29 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
19
(2)	
The combinational value is represented by characteristic value multiplied by a factor, 
which takes into account the probability of simultaneous occurrence of the most likely 
unfavourable values of several independent actions.
(3)	
Various design situations (represented by various load combinations) for which different 
limit states are to be checked are given in IRC:6 and Annexure A-1. All components of the 
structure are not required to be verified for all limit states and all possible combinations. 
The requirements or exemptions are covered under relevant clauses of the Code dealing 
with such components.
5.5	
Representative Values of Properties of Materials
5.5.1	
General
The constituent materials of structure acting singly or in a composite action with other materials have 
certain properties which determine their own response and the behaviour of the structural elements 
when acted upon by various loads. Some of the material and structural properties depend upon the 
type of load, its duration, magnitude and the loading history. Some properties are time-dependent, 
while others are affected by environmental actions. Some properties depend upon the physical size 
(dimensions) of the structural member.
Almost all the properties exhibit statistical variation in their numerical values. Many of the properties 
show strong co-relations with other properties, which permit sufficiently accurate, if not exact, 
estimation of their value from the values of other properties by use of mathematical expressions. 
Correlations are based on laboratory or field observations and statistical regression analysis. A few of 
these properties are chosen as descriptive and/or representative properties of the materials (e.g. self 
compacting concrete). They are often used to define the material itself or its grade (e.g. concrete grade 
M40 and reinforcing steel Fe500). Standard methods of testing for measuring such values are specified 
by Bureau of Indian Standards or other national / international authorities.
5.5.2	
Representative values
Depending upon the purpose of carrying out the evaluation, one or more of the following three 
representative values are used in the design:
(1) 	
Average or statistical mean value.
(2) 	
A lower fractile value (inferior value) based on the statistical distribution function or the 
statistical mean value suitably reduced by a factor.
(3) 	
An upper fractile value (superior value) based on the statistical distribution function or the 
statistical mean value suitably increased by a factor.
The representative values of commonly used materials are defined in Section 6.
5.5.3	
Other methods of assessment of properties
When higher level of accuracy is desired in evaluating response of the structure, use of more 
accurate values of other properties than those obtained from co-relations used in Section 6 and 
Annexure A-2 are required. In such cases, these should be based upon one of the following:



======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
20
(1)	
More accurate and elaborate methods/expressions which incorporate more number of 
factors influencing the required values reported in specialist literature from established and 
reliable sources.
(2)	
Laboratory/field testing using standard methods of testing and measurements and based on 
sufficient number of tests as required by statistical methods of establishing desired accuracy 
(usually 95 percent confidence level). Normally, to establish mean and standard deviation, 
not less than 30 samples are required.
5.6	
Analytical Methods to Evaluate Behaviour of Structures
5.6.1	
Global analysis of structure
The purpose of this analysis is the verification of overall stability and establishment of effects of 
action on the whole or a part of the structure. These effects include the distribution of internal forces 
and moments as well as stresses, strains, curvatures, rotations and displacements in static or dynamic 
modes. To carry out analysis the geometry, boundary conditions, behaviour of the structure and its 
components need to be idealised. The structure is idealised by considering it as made up of elements 
which can be linear, two dimensional or three dimensional. Classical methods of mechanics or modern 
techniques such as finite element can be used for analysis. The mathematical model should be capable 
of evaluating the desired effect with sufficient accuracy.
5.6.2	
Local analyses
In addition to global analysis of structure or its elements, local analyses will be necessary particularly 
in the regions of stress concentrations and geometric discontinuities.
5.6.3	
Idealisation, modelling and adequacy
Behaviour of structure and its components can be represented to various degrees of accuracy. The 
general principles as well as normally used methods are covered in Section 7. The idealisation and 
modelling should be adequate to estimate the relevant action effects. The interaction of properties of 
constituent materials with heterogeneous properties should be appropriately taken into account.
Appropriate methods of analysis such as elastic analysis, non-elastic analysis with limited redistribution, 
plastic analysis with actual or idealised material properties are indicated depending upon the level of 
accuracy required. Necessity of including the second order effects in the analysis is indicated where it 
is important.
5.7	
Design Based on Full Scale Testing
Design of some elements like crash barriers, fenders, prestressing anchors, etc., can be based on full 
scale tests of the prototype. The failure load/capacity is defined as that causing either irreparable 
damage, or pre-defined limit of deformation.
5.8	
Durability Aspects
The durability recommendations of this Code are based on the strategies adopted regarding aspects 



======================================================================
PAGE 31 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
21
indicated in the following clauses. These strategic options/choices in design, detailing and construction 
are intended to ensure durability as well as serviceability and safety, for a period not less than the 
intended service life of the structure.
5.8.1	
Design life
For design life of structures, reference may be made to provisions of IRC:5. Unless otherwise specifically 
classified by Owner, all structures shall be designed for a design life of 100 years.
5.8.2	
Use of appropriate values of time-dependent material properties
Variation of strengths such as reduction of concrete strength by sustained loading as well as degradation 
of materials, effects of creep and shrinkage of concrete, relaxation of steel and fatigue are some of the 
time dependent design properties. The values of such time dependent properties to be used in the 
design shall take into account design service life.
5.8.3	
Specification of actions and action-effects
For actions of environmental origin, appropriate return period is specified depending on the design life. 
The probability of failure during life of structure depends on the return period of load, the design life 
and probability of failure in unit period for the specified design value of load (unit period of one year 
and return period expressed in years are normally used).
5.8.4	
Control of properties of materials
The permissible limits of known harmful elements in acceptable and durable materials are specified in 
Section 14.
5.8.5	
Control of attack on materials by aggressive elements under different atmospheric 
conditions
Certain aggressive chemical elements in the surrounding environment such as oxygen, carbon-dioxide, 
sulphates and chlorides penetrate concrete and cause corrosion of steel in concrete. The moisture 
content in concrete and temperature directly affect the process of corrosion. The depth of penetration 
of these harmful elements into concrete depends on the permeability of concrete and time.
The process of deterioration is mitigated by recommending suitable materials (such as concrete 
having certain qualities), cover to steel, improved corrosion resistant steel, etc., for different classes of 
environment.
Externally applied protective barriers are indicated in certain circumstances.
5.8.6	
Maintenance
Periodic inspection and adequate maintenance are prerequisites for ensuring durability of structure. All 
records of inspection and repairs should be available with concerned authority.

SECTION 6
MATERIAL PROPERTIES AND THEIR DESIGN VALUES
6.1 General
6.1.1	
The analysis and design of the structure and its elements require knowledge of the physical, 
chemical, mechanical, load-dependent, time-dependant and process dependent properties of its 
materials. The properties include those governing the composite action of materials acting interactively 
with one another as well as acting individually. Simplified rules describing these properties which are 
consistent with the analysis and design models permitted by this Code are given in the following 
Clauses.
6.1.2	
In special cases where more exact analyses and models of behaviour are to be considered, 
more representative rules describing these properties are needed, some of which are given in Annexure 
A-2. In addition, reference to international Codes, published literature, laboratory test reports or field 
tests, may also be made. However, the reliability of the referenced source and/or reproducibility of test 
values should be established.
6.1.3	
Some of the properties are strongly influenced by activities of construction and work 
procedures. Use of appropriate technological methods, deployment of qualified and trained work force 
combined with methods of quality assurance are requisite preconditions for realising in practice the 
properties assumed in the design. Minimum acceptable standards of workmanship are given in Section 
18.
6.1.4	
Specifications of structural materials to be used in construction of bridges shall conform to 
the Indian Standards given in Section 18.
6.1.5	
Materials conforming to other international standards can be used provided they meet 
the minimum requirements (lower or upper values as the case may be) given in the relevant Indian 
Standards and this Code.
6.2	
Untensioned Steel Reinforcement
6.2.1	
Specification and grades
Reinforcement shall consist of hot rolled, thermo-mechanical or heat-treated rods, de-coiled rods or 
cold worked steel of various grades given in Table 6.1.

The grade designations, definitive properties and other properties, as adopted by the relevant Indian 
Standards, are given in Section 18 (Table 18.1). The steel may be coated, or galvanised to improve its 
resistance to corrosion. Use of stainless steel is permitted subject to requirements stipulated in Clause 
6.2.3.3.
6.2.2	
Strength, stress-strain diagrams, modulus of elasticity and ductility
The minimum strength, as specified in relevant IS Standards, which is either the yield strength in case 
of mild steel or 0.2 percent proof strength in case of high yield strength deformed steel, is notionally 
taken as the characteristic strength fyk.
The stress-strain diagrams of mild steel and high yield strength deformed steel are typically as shown 
in Fig. 6.1 (a), (b) & (c), which also define various important stresses, strains and modulus of elasticity. 
The ductility requirements measured by ratio ft / fyk and minimum elongation are given in Table 18.1. 
The modulus of elasticity can be taken as 200 GPa for design purposes.

500S, εuk shall be taken as 8% (max.). For other grades it shall be taken as 2.5%(max.).
6.2.3	
Products with improved corrosion resistance
Reinforcing steel bars with improved corrosion resistance by any of the methods described in Section 
18 can be used as reinforcement provided they meet the minimum strength, proof stress and elongation 
characteristics as specified in Table 18.1. The design properties are considered to be the same as per 
Clause 6.2.2 except as given in Clause 6.2.3.2 for epoxy coated reinforcement.
6.2.3.1	
Galvanised reinforcement
The strength as well as elongation and bond properties of galvanised reinforcement are not adversely 
affected by galvanising.
6.2.3.2	
Epoxy-coated reinforcement
Reinforcing bars conforming to IS:1786 can be coated by fusion bonded epoxy conforming to IS:13620.
The bond of coated reinforcement is lowered by upto 20 percent of that of uncoated reinforcement. In 
detailing of steel the lap length and anchorage lengths given in Section 15 should be increased by 25 
percent.

6.2.3.3	
Stainless steel reinforcement
Stainless steel reinforcement shall conform to IS:16651:2017. The code covers requirements and 
methods of test for high strength deformed stainless steel bars/wires of the following strength grades 
for use as concrete reinforcement: 
	
(a)	
SS 500,

6.3	
Prestressing Steel
6.3.1	
Specifications, grades, strength, elongation and relaxation
Prestressing steel in the following forms, conforming to Indian Standards given in Section 18, Tables 
18.2 to 18.5 shall be used.
	
- Plain or indented wires
	
- Stress-relieved multi-ply strands
	
- High tensile steel bars
Steels conforming to other international standards but satisfying the minimum strength, elongation, 
and relaxation characteristics of Indian Standards may be used.
6.3.2	
Minimum sizes
The steels of nominal sizes and ultimate strengths having characteristics as mentioned in Tables 18.2 
to 18.5 are permitted for use in bridges designed for 100 years.
For bridges on temparary access roads or bridges for construction facility, steels having smaller 
diameters than those given in the Tables 18.3 to 18.5 but otherwise meeting the requirements of Indian 
Standards mentioned therein, can be used.
6.3.3	
Other properties
6.3.3.1	
Ductility
The requirements of ductility of steel are deemed to be satisfied by use of steel having the minimum 
elongations specified in Section 18, Clause 18.3.
The wires/strands shall also pass the bendability test (reverse bending) as specified in relevant Indian 
Standards.
6.3.3.2	
Tolerance on size/diameter
The relevant Indian Standards specify the manufacturing tolerances on diameters/size of various 
products which remain valid for general acceptance of the material and the source of supply.

6.3.4	
Coated wires/strands
The wires/strands conforming to Indian Standards can be provided with protective coatings, 
like galvanising or epoxy coating, carried out in specialised manufacturing units. However, if the 
technological processes affect any of the mechanical and physical properties, such modified properties 
should be taken into account in design.
6.3.5	
Stress-strain properties for design
Typical stress/strain and ultimate elongation of prestressing wires and strands are shown in Figs. 6.3 
and 6.4. The actual E value varies between 195 GPa and 216 GPa. For prestressing steels, the stress is 
to be taken as force divided by the nominal cross sectional area.
For the purpose of analysis and design, either the diagrams shown in Fig. 6.3 or the simplified bilinear 
diagram as shown in Fig. 6.4 (any one of shape A and shape B) can be used. The ‘E’ value of 200 
GPa for wires and 195 GPa for strands can be used in the design up to the elastic limit (first part of 
bilinear diagram unless more exact value is required, e.g. for verification of elongation during stressing 
operations, which should be taken on the basis of actual field tests).

data, fp0.1k can be taken as 0.87 fpk. 
For strands, stress values shall be based on the nominal cross-sectional area given in 
Table 18.4. The idealised design shape (A) is obtained by factoring idealised bi-linear diagram by 
1
s, 
and taking design strain not greater than εud which is equal to 0.9 εuk with corresponding value of design 
stress. εud shall be taken as 2% (max.), if more accurate values are not available.
For simplified bilinear design diagram shape (B), having horizontal branch, the strain limit need not 
be checked.
6.3.6	
Relaxation loss for design
In absence of actual testing, the design value of relaxation for long term losses may be taken as three 
times the 1000 hours value measured at initial stress of 70 percent of UTS, as specified in the relevant 
Codes in Section 18. For initial stress other than 70 percent of UTS, the values given in Table 6.2 may 
be used.

6.4	
Concrete
Cement, fine aggregates, coarse aggregates, mineral admixtures and water constitute the main material 
ingredients of concrete. Chemical admixtures are added to fresh concrete to improve its workability. 
For specification of constituents of concrete Section 18 and the relevant Indian Standards may be 
referred. For use of concretes designed to have special and different characteristics from those given in 
this Section, specialist literature may be referred.
6.4.1	
Grade designation
Concrete shall be designated by type and its grade-designation based on characteristic strength as 
described in Table 6.4, where:
(a)	
Ordinary Concrete is made on the basis of nominal mix proportioned by weight of its 
main ingredients - cement, coarse and fine aggregates and water.

Notes:
(1)	
Characteristic Strength is the lower 5 percent fractile value of the statistical distribution of strength at 28 
days, measured by samples prepared and tested as per Section 18.5.4, - each sample consisting of 3 cubes 
of 150 mm size. The grade designation is the nearest lower limit of the range in multiple of 5 MPa within 
which the actual characteristic strength falls.
(2)	
For concretes using mineral admixtures and those using high early strength cements, the properties of 
setting time and time dependent strength gain are different from those of standard and ordinary concrete. 
Cognisance of such modified properties should be taken in deciding de-shuttering time, curing period and 
early age loading.



======================================================================
PAGE 39 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
29
(3)	
Use of Strength other than 28 days Strength:
	
Actual strength achievable (or achieved) at other than 28 days strength, but not at more than 84 days in case 
of slow setting concretes, can be chosen to base the design/construction choices, if found more appropriate. 
This decision should be based on achievement of early/delayed strength, and the age at which the first 
design load, apart from the self-weight, is expected to be resisted by the structure.
(b)	
Standard Concrete is made on the basis of design mix proportioned by weight of its 
ingredients, which in addition to cement, aggregates and water, may contain chemical 
admixtures to achieve certain target values of various properties in fresh condition, 
achievement of which is monitored and controlled during production by suitable tests. 
Generally, concretes up to strength Grade M50 are included in this type.
(c)	
High Performance Concrete (HPC) is one, whose ingredients, proportions and production 
methods are specifically chosen to meet special performance and uniformity requirements 
that cannot be always achieved routinely by using only conventional materials, like, cement, 
aggregates, water and chemical admixtures, and adopting normal mixing, placing and 
curing practices. Use of mineral admixtures is required. These performance requirements 
can be high strength, high early strength, high workability (including Self-Compacting 
Concrete), low permeability and high durability for severe service environments, etc. or 
combinations thereof. Production and use of such concrete in the field necessitates high 
degree of uniformity between batches and very stringent quality control.
(d)	
Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) is a type of High Performance Concrete, that fills 
uniformly and completely every corner of formwork by its own weight and fluidity without 
application of any vibration, without segregation, whilst maintaining homogeneity. It is 
suitable in situations where;
	
•	
reinforcement is very congested,
	
•	
access to allow vibration is not available,
	
•	
complicated geometry of the formwork,
	
•	
pouring is possible only from a single point,
	
•	
speedy placement is required,
	
	
It has also the other advantages of no noise due to vibration and no requirement of 
finishing.
6.4.2	
Design properties of concrete
6.4.2.1	
General
(1)	
The recommended design properties are co-related to 28 days characteristic compressive 
strength, unless specified otherwise.
(2)	
Depending on the purpose of analysis, some of the properties are used either at their mean 
(average) value, or at lower characteristic value or at upper characteristic value based on 5 
percent fractile or 95 percent fractile respectively.
(3)	
Stress-strain relationship for overall analysis of structure, stress-strain relationship 
for sectional design, various moduli of elasticity, Poisson’s ratio, tensile strength, 
fracture mechanical strength, multiaxial strengths, etc., are the mechanical properties 



======================================================================

IRC:112-2020
30
needed for various purposes of design. Unless greater accuracy is needed justifying 
separate and direct testing for these characteristics, the values given in Table 6.5 may 
be used in design, which are based on their relation to the compressive strength. The 
co-relation equations are given in Annexure A-2.
(4)	
Some of the time-dependent behaviours of structure and time dependent effects are permitted 
to be evaluated by using simplified expressions, using appropriately modified values of 
some properties, (e.g. factored value of the modulus of elasticity to incorporate creep 
effects). Where greater accuracy is needed, specialist literature or relevant international 
codes may be referred.
(5)	
Relationship between Strength and Time:
	
The development of compressive strength of concrete depends on the type of cement, 
curing conditions and maturity of concrete. Maturity is measured as a sum of the product 
of time and mean temperature of concrete, measured in appropriate units as given below:
	
Maturity in day Celsius or hour Celsius = ∑ time in days (or hours) x (temperature in 
°C+11°C).
Eq. 6.1
	
In normal applications instead of the exact strength-maturity relationship simplified 
strength-time relationship is used, with limits of validity as given in Clause 6.4.2.2. For 
special applications, where temperature history deviates from the limits given, Annexure 
A-2 may be referred.
6.4.2.2	
Compressive strength and strength development with time
(1)	
Relationship connecting age in days to strength given by Eq. 6.2 and Eq. 6.3 can be used in 
place of strength-maturity relationship, which are valid for seasonal variation of temperature 
between (-)20°C to (+)40°C.

Notes:
(1)	
Strength designation of concrete, (based on characteristic strength) and corresponding properties to be 
used in the design are given above. The strains are expressed in per thousand by o/oo sign. The co-relation 
equations used are given in Annexure A-2.
(2)	
The tabulated values of Ecm are for quartzite/granite aggregates. For other aggregates, they should be 
multiplied by factors as given below:
	
limestone = 0.9, sandstone = 0.7, basalt = 1.2.
(3)	
Properties of materials to be used in bridge construction given in Section 18 and the acceptance criteria 
based on sampling theory of statistics are to be used for procurement purposes only.
(2)	
Effect of sustained loading and gain of strength with time
	
Although concrete gains strength with age due to continued chemical reactions, it also 
exhibits reduction of strength under the effect of sustained loading. This long term effect 
together with effect of the size of the structural element is taken into account while 
recommending design values of strength in this Code e.g. long term compressive strength 
in-structure is taken as 0.67 times of 28 days cube strength. (It is directly incorporated in 
formula for ultimate bending strength).
(3)	
Verification of early age strength by testing
	
To avoid irreversible damages like local cracking (eg. due to early age prestressing) the 
achievement of early age strength shall be verified by testing. Refer Section 18 for details.
(4)	
Use of strengths beyond 28 days strength
	
Gain of strength beyond 28 days should not be considered in new designs except as per 
Note No.3 below Table 6.4. For evaluation of strength/load carrying capacity of old existing 
bridges and for retrofitting purposes, strength at ages other than 28 days can be used after 
making allowance for age, sustained load effect, state of cracking and fatigue effects, for 
which specialist literature may be referred.

6.4.2.3	
Tensile strength & strength development with time
(1)	
Direct tensile strength
	
The tensile strength is the highest tensile stress reached under concentric loading. The 
tensile strength of concrete fctm is difficult to measure directly and hence is measured either 
by splitting cylinders/cubes under transverse strip loading, or by flexural tensile test of 
standardised beams obtained following standard test procedures.
	
The relation between mean tensile strength fctm, split cylinder strength and beam test are 
given in Eq.6.4 and Eq.6.5.
	
For standard 300 mm dia. cylinder tested as per IS 5876
	
	
	
fctm = 0.9 fct.split.cyl
Eq. 6.4
	
where
	
fct.split.cyl	
=	
mean value of cylinders tested
	
	
	
	
For standard beam sizes tested as per IS:516
	
fctm = 	
0.6 fb for beam size of 100 x 100 x 400 mm and
	
	
	
0.66 fb for beam size of 150 x 150 x 600 mm
Eq. 6.5
	
where
	
fb	 =	
modulus of rupture measured as per IS 516.
(2) 	
Co-relation to the 28 days cube compressive strength
	
In absence of tensile tests, the values of tensile strengths fctm given in Table 6.5 can be 
adopted.
(3)	
Flexural tensile strength for other sizes
	
The mean flexural tensile strength in solid beams depends on the mean axial tensile strength 
fctm and the depth of the cross-section. The following relationship may be used:

The relation given in Eq. 6.6 also applies for the characteristic tensile 
strength values.
(4)	
Direct tensile strength for use in elements fully in tension
	
For members fully in tension, having more or less uniform tension (like bottom/top slabs 
of box girders) fctk,0.05 given in Table 6.5 may be used.
(5)	
Strength gain with time
	
(a)	
The development of tensile strength with time is strongly influenced by curing and 
drying conditions as well as by the dimensions of the structural members. As a first 
approximation it may be assumed that the tensile strength :



======================================================================
PAGE 43 of 256

Eq. 6.7
	
where
	
βcc(t) follows from Eq. (6.3)
	
	
α	
= 1 for t < 28 days
	
	
α	
= 2/3 for t ≥28 days
	
The design values for fctm are given in Table 6.5.
	
(b)	
Where the development of the tensile strength with time is important (e.g. for control 
of cracking) it is recommended that tests are carried out taking into account the 
exposure conditions and the dimensions of the structural member.
6.4.2.4	
Multi-axial state of stress
The multi-axial compressive strength of concrete is higher than the uni-axial compressive strength. 
Normally, in bridge structures, this higher strength does not contribute significantly to design of 
main elements. However, in design of local zones, the increased strength is made use of (e.g. near 
concentrated loads, in design of concrete hinges and anchorage zones of prestressing anchorages). 
Annexure A-2 and specialist literature may be referred for the relevant design properties.
6.4.2.5	
Stress-strain relationship and modulus of elasticity
(1)	
The stress-strain relationship of concrete in compression and tension exhibits non-linearity 
and time-dependent changes. It also depends upon the rate of loading and loading history, 
creep and shrinkage. The contribution of creep to total strain is different at loading and 
unloading stages.
(2)	
In general terms, the total strain of concrete at time t subjected to sustained loading from 
initial loading at time t0 is given by:
	
εc (t) = εcσ (t) + εcn (t) = εci (t0 )+ εcc (t)+ εcs (t)+ εcT (t)
Eq. 6.8
	
where
	
εci (t0) = is the initial strain at loading.
	
εcc (t) = is the creep strain at time t > t0
	
εcs (t) = is the shrinkage strain
	
εcT (t) = is the thermal strain
	
εcσ (t) = is the stress dependent strain: εcσ (t) = εci (t0) + εcc (t)
	
εcn (t) = is the stress independent strain: εcn (t) = εcs (t) + εcT (t)
	
The creep co-efficient ø(t,t0) is defined as the ratio of creep strain at time (t) and initial 
elastic strain.

(3)	
However, for the purpose of analysis of overall structure under normal temperature 
variations and its response to loads for static, equivalent static or linear dynamic response 



======================================================================

to earthquake loads, approximate simplified values given in this Code are adequate. Where 
greater accuracy is desired and for non-linear elastic analysis Annexure A2 and specialist 
literature should be referred.
(4)	
The load-deformation characteristics of structure are dependent on duration of load, age 
at loading and stress level up to which the material of the structure is loaded. These are 
calculated by use of appropriate modulus of elasticity as under:
	
(i)	
For static and quasi-static loads acting for short duration, secant modulus of elasticity 
of concrete Ecm, (slope of line connecting the origin of stress/strain diagram to 0.33 
fcm) may be used. Values of Ecm are given in Table 6.5 for different grades of concrete.
	
(ii)	
The Poisson’s ratio for uncracked concrete may be taken as 0.2 and that for cracked 
concrete as zero.
	
(iii)	 In general, the effects of long term loading (due to creep) shall be obtained separately 
and added to those obtained from short term analysis. As a simplification for the 
overall analysis of structure (not for local analysis), the value of Ecm can be modified 
by a factor 
1
1 

  accounting for long term creep effects where φ is the creep co-
efficient defined by Eq. 6.9 and Table 6.9.
	
(iv)	 For calculating creep effects of shorter duration, either separate analysis should be 
done or Ecm can be modified by factor consistent with the creep of the same duration.
	
(v)	
The effect of shrinkage shall be separately calculated and added. It is taken as part of 
dead load analysis.
	
(vi)	 For calculating effects of seasonal temperature variation, value of 0.5 times Ecm may 
be used to account for temperature induced stresses as modified by creep effects. For 
diurnal variation of temperatures, value of Ecm may be used.
	
(vii)	 For elastic analysis of structure under dynamic loads (such as earthquake, wind etc 
where structures are not permitted to enter overall plastic range), Ecm given in Table 
6.5 may be used.
	
(viii)	For resistance to impact/shock loading dynamic modulus of elasticity can be taken as 
1.25 times Ecm in absence of tests.
	
(ix)	 For non-linear analysis, suitable techniques for representing non-linearity of material 
properties shall be used for which Annexure A-2 and/or specialist literature may be 
referred.
	
(x)	
Effect of early age loading on Ecm
	
	
Variation of modulus of elasticity with time (t) is given by Eq. 6.10. Relationship 
between fcm(t) and fcm is given by Eq. 6.2 and Eq. 6.3.

6.4.2.6	
Shrinkage
(1)	
The total shrinkage of concrete depends upon the constituents of concrete, size of the 
member and environmental conditions. For a given humidity and temperature, the total 
shrinkage of concrete is most influenced by the total amount of water present in the concrete 
at the time of mixing and to a lesser extent, by the cement content.
(2)	
The total shrinkage strain is composed of two components, the autogenous shrinkage strain 
and the drying shrinkage strain. 
	
The value of the total shrinkage strain εcs is given by :
	
ε cs = ε cd + ε ca
Eq. 6.11
	
where
	
ε cs is the total shrinkage strain
	
ε cd is the drying shrinkage strain
	
ε ca is the autogenous shrinkage strain
(3)	
The major part of the autogenous shrinkage strain develops during hardening of the concrete 
in the early days after casting. Autogenous shrinkage can be taken as a function of the 
concrete strength. It should be considered specifically when new concrete is cast against 
hardened concrete.
	
In absence of accurate field/laboratory data, the values given in Table 6.6 may be considered 
in design:

(4)	
The drying shrinkage strain develops slowly, since it is a function of the migration of water 
through the hardened concrete.
	
The final value of the drying shrinkage strain, εcd ∞ may be taken equal to kh.εcd where kh and 
εcd are taken from Tables 6.7 & 6.8.
	
(These are expected mean values, with a coefficient of variation of about 30 percent).
	
where
	
	
kh  is a coefficient depending on the notional size ho:
	
	
ho  is the notional size (mm) of the cross-section = 2Ac /u
	
where
	
	
Ac is the concrete cross-sectional area.
	
	
u is the perimeter of that part of the cross-section which is exposed to drying.

Creep
(1)	
Creep of concrete depends, on the stress in the concrete, age at loading and duration of 
loading in addition to the factors listed in Clause 6.4.2.6(1). As long as the stress in concrete 
does not exceed 0.36 fcm(to), creep may be assumed to be proportional to the stress.

SECTION 7
ANALYSIS
7.1	
General Provisions
7.1.1	
Response of structure to loads
The purpose of structural analysis is the verification of overall stability and establishment of action 
effects on the whole or a part of the structure. These effects include the distribution of internal forces 
and moments as well as the calculation of stresses, strains, curvatures, rotations and displacements in 
static or dynamic modes. To carry out analysis, the geometry, boundary conditions and behaviour of 
the structure will need to be idealized both for global and local behaviour. The structure is idealised 
by considering it as made up of elements which can be linear, two dimensional or three dimensional. 
Classical methods of mechanics or modern techniques such as finite element may be used for analysis 
depending upon the suitability of the mathematical model to evaluate the action effects with sufficient 
accuracy.
Since concrete is a heterogeneous material, its properties are not independent of the size of the 
member. These are also time dependent. For reinforced and prestressed concrete elements the structural 
behaviour depends on the location and amount of steel as well as the state of deformation and cracking 
of the element, which in turn, depends upon the level of load. In the analysis, appropriate simplified 
values of properties of constituent materials and properties representing composite action (e.g. bond) 
are made in order to represent the behaviour of these elements. The range of validity of these simplified 
properties and the level of accuracy in predicting the structural behaviour by analytical methods, has 
to be taken into account in the design process.
The in-service behaviour of structural elements as well as their ultimate strengths and modes of 
failure are determined by the material properties, load resisting mechanism of the structural elements 
and, the combined effects of axial forces, bending moments, transverse shears, in-plane shears and 
torsions. The interdependency of various strengths of a member; such as axial, bending, shear and 
torsion, has been established both by theory and by experiments. However, in most cases of practical 
design, bending combined with axial forces and shear combined with torsion are treated separately. 
In this approach, the design models used in different load resisting mechanisms are not completely 
compatible. Design of columns, beams and slabs are typically based on this approach. For elements 
having complex geometry – such as shells - and for some local zones of the elements (refer Clause 
7.1.2.2) design has to be based on the net effect of all forces acting together, ensuring compatibility of 
strains. Suitable model representing the element and appropriate method of analysis have to be used in 
the design process.
7.1.2	
Methods of analyses
7.1.2.1	
General
In terms of the behaviour of the structure, the following methods of analysis may be used:
(1)	
Linear elastic analyses for both static and dynamic response



======================================================================
PAGE 51 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
41
(2)	
Linear elastic analyses with limited redistribution of forces for static response
(3) 	
The ‘Strut and Tie’ method for achieving internal equilibrium within the elements in 
conjunction with overall elastic analysis of the structure, where stiffness of the structural 
elements is based on assumptions (a) or (b) as described in Clause 7.2(1).
(4)	
Non-linear analyses, (material and/or geometric non-linearity) for both static and dynamic 
response.
	
The solutions based on failure mechanisms of structure or plastic behaviour of elements shall 
not be used in design of bridges; except for the case of analysing response to earthquake. 
This shall be done only after adequate investigation of all significant modes of failure.
7.1.2.2	
Local analyses
In addition to global analyses of structure or its components, local analyses may be necessary, 
particularly where,
(1)	
Significant and rapid changes in stresses and strains in a particular region of the structure/
component are involved (e.g. regions around openings, junctions of elements).
(2)	
Local non-linear behaviour needs to be analysed, (e.g. locally near supports/bearings, 
formation of hinges).
(3)	
Assumption of linear strain distribution is not valid. (e.g. thick sections, deep beams, 
corbels, anchorage zones).
Where local effects are calculated separately, independent of global effects, the effects shall be 
combined.
7.1.3	
Second order effects
(1)	
Second order effects are the additional effects caused by structural deformations, e.g. P-∆ 
effect for column.
(2)	
Second order effects shall be considered in the analysis where they are likely to affect overall 
stability or the attainment of the ultimate limit state at critical sections, (e.g. buckling of 
slender members, redistribution of forces due to creep of concrete, settlement of supports 
in indeterminate structure).
7.1.4	
Modelling of foundations
Structural elements transferring loads to the foundation strata can be treated as rigid or flexible depending 
on their stiffness with appropriate end conditions. Settlement effects are to be treated as independent 
loading conditions. Where soil-structure interaction is considered as significantly influencing the 
behaviour of the structure, the foundation and stratum shall be appropriately modelled (e.g. by use of 
appropriate springs).
7.1.5	
Redistribution of moments
Redistribution of moments obtained by rigorous elastic analysis may be carried out provided:
(1)	
Reduction at one location is accompanied by increase in other location in such a way as to 
maintain equilibrium with applied loads.



======================================================================
PAGE 52 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
42
(2)	
Reduction is restricted to not more than 15 percent of the maximum moment in SLS and 20 
percent of that in ULS.
Redistribution shall not be carried out in circumstances where the rotation capacity and the section to 
which the redistributed moments are to be transferred, cannot be defined (e.g. in curved bridges and 
skew bridges with more than 15° angle of skew).
7.1.6	
Non-linear analyses
Non-linearity of material stress-strain relationship is taken into account for design of sections.
Non-linearity arising from member’s response (e.g. due to cracking, creep etc.) is considered in 
calculating the deflections.
Non-linearity due to formation of plastic hinges in linear members or yield lines in two dimensional 
elements, is not permitted except for demonstrating non-collapse condition in seismic event or impact 
loading.
7.1.7	
Plastic analysis
(1)	
Methods based on lower bound plastic solutions may be used provided appropriate measures 
are taken to ensure that ductility conditions are satisfied.
(2)	
Elements may be idealised as statically determinate trusses consisting of straight notional 
struts (carrying the compressive forces in the concrete) and ties (the reinforcement). The 
forces in the members of the truss are established from considerations of equilibrium. 
Sufficient reinforcement is then provided to carry the tension in the ties and a check is 
performed to ensure that the compressive stresses in the struts are not excessive. Detailing 
requirements should then be checked, with particular regard to anchorage of all reinforcement 
and to local bearing stresses due to concentrated forces.
(3)	
The location and orientation of the struts and ties should reflect approximately the 
distribution of internal forces resulting from an elastic analysis of the member.
(4)	
In checking compressive stresses in the struts, consideration should be given to a possible 
reduction in strength due to transverse tensile stresses or cracking or the influence of shear. 
The average design compressive stress in the struts may be taken as v.fcd. In the absence 
of other data, v may be taken as 0.6, including an allowance for sustained loading. Higher 
values for v (even v >1) may be justified based on a triaxial state of compressive stress, 
provided it can be shown that the complementary transverse compression can be realised 
in practice.
(5)	
The design stress in the ties is limited to fyd
(6)	
Detailing should comply with Sections 15 & 16.
7.2	
Analyses for Serviceability Limit States
(1)	
Elastic methods of analysis should be used to determine internal forces and deformations. 
The stiffness constants of discrete members or unit widths of slab elements may be based 
on any of the following:



======================================================================
PAGE 53 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
43
	
(a)	
Concrete Section: The entire cross-section of member, ignoring the presence of 
reinforcement.
	
(b)	
Gross Transformed Section: The entire cross-section of member including the 
reinforcement transformed on the basis of effective modular ratio, Es / Ec.eff
	
	
A consistent approach should be used to reflect the behaviour of various parts of the 
structure.
(2)	
For limit state checks of deformation, stresses and crack control of beams having wide 
compression flanges, a constant effective width should be used over the full span while 
working out the sectional properties. (Refer Clause 7.6.1.2). Where greater accuracy is 
required variation in the effective width along the spans should be considered.
(3)	
Modulus of elasticity and shear modulus of concrete should be appropriate for the type of 
action under consideration.
(4)	
For verification of steel stresses and control of cracks in discontinuity zones, strut-and–tie 
model as adopted in the ULS design may be used.
7.3	
Analyses for Ultimate Limit States
(1)	
Elastic methods may be used to determine the distribution of forces and deformations 
throughout the structure. Stiffness constants based on the section properties as used for the 
analysis of the structure at the serviceability limit state, may be used in the analysis.
(2)	
In seismic analysis, plastic methods of analysis may be used provided it can be shown that 
adequate ductility exists at sections/locations where successive hinges/yield lines form and 
these methods adequately model the global effects in combination with local plasticity.
(3)	
The application of elastic methods of analysis for factored loads for the ultimate limit 
state in general, leads to safe lower bound solutions. These may be refined and made more 
accurate and less conservative. For suitable methods, specialist literature may be referred.
(4)	
For longitudinal members effects due to temperature gradient may be neglected.
(5)	
Strut-and-tie model may be used in the analysis of discontinuity regions. Struts representing 
compressive stress field and ties provided by reinforcement, meet at connecting nodes forming 
statically stable truss system. The reinforcement carries full design force of the tie over its full 
length and hence is required to be adequately anchored beyond the node. Adoption of model 
developed on the basis of stress trajectories in compression and tensile regions, established 
from linear elastic analysis or following direct and simple load path method, should be 
preferred as it will help in achieving crack control at serviceability conditions. Specialist 
literature may be referred for details.
7.4	
Torsional Effects
7.4.1	
Where static equilibrium of a structure depends on the torsional resistance of its elements, 
full torsional design covering ULS shall be made.
7.4.2	
In general, where the torsional resistance or stiffness of members has not been taken into 
account in the analysis of the structure, no specific calculations for resisting torsion will be necessary. 
In such cases adequate control of any torsional cracking should be achieved by providing nominal 
reinforcement to resist torsion. However, in applying this clause it is essential that sound engineering 



======================================================================
PAGE 54 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
44
judgement is exercised in deciding whether torsion plays only a minor role in the behaviour of the 
structure; otherwise torsional stiffness should be used in the analysis.
7.5	
Combined Global and Local Effects
In addition to the design of individual elements to resist loading applied directly to them, it is also 
necessary to consider the loading effects due to global loading where these coexist in an element.
Analysis of the structure may be accomplished either by one overall analysis or by separate analyses 
for global and local effects. In the latter case, the forces and moments acting on the element from 
global and local effects should be combined as appropriate. The design of individual elements should 
take into account the combined effects.
7.6	
Structures and Structural Frames
7.6.1	
Beams
7.6.1.1	
Effective span
(1)	
The effective span of a simply supported member should be taken as the smaller of:
	
(a)	
The distance between the centres of bearings,
	
(b)	
The clear distance between supports plus the effective depth.
(2)	
The effective span of a member framing into supporting members should be taken as the 
distance between the centres of the supporting members.
(3)	
The effective span of a continuous member should be taken as the distance between centres 
of supports.
(4)	
In the case of beams framing into wide columns, the effect of column width should be 
included in the analysis.
7.6.1.2	
Effective width of flanged beams and box beams
(1)	
For analysis of section for ULS & SLS effective width shall be taken as given in Fig. 7.1 & 
Eq.7.1.

be taken as constant for the full span.
(3)	
For limit state check of vibration for footbridge the actual flange width may be used.
7.6.2	
Slabs
7.6.2.1	
Moment and shear forces in solid slabs
Moments and shear forces in slab bridges, in the top slabs of beam-and-slab bridges, and box girder 
bridges may be obtained from any rational and established method of analysis. The effective spans 
should be in accordance with Section 7.6.1.1.
7.6.2.2	
Special types of slabs
For analysis of special type of slabs such as skew slab, curved slabs, voided slabs and composite slabs, 
specialist literature may be referred.
7.6.3	
Columns
7.6.3.1	
Definitions
A reinforced concrete column is a compression member whose largest lateral crosssectional dimension 
is less than or equal to four times its lesser lateral dimension. A column should be considered as short 
if the ratio le /i in each plane of buckling is such that the failure takes place without involving secondary 
effects. In practice, the limits upto which the secondary effects can be neglected is given in Clause 
11.2.



======================================================================
PAGE 56 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
46
7.6.3.2	
Moments and forces in columns
(1)	
The moments, shear forces and axial forces in a column should be determined in accordance 
with Clauses 7.2 and 7.3, except that if the column is slender the additional moments induced 
by lateral deflection should be considered. The bases and/or other members connected to 
the ends of such columns should also be designed to resist these additional moments.
(2)	
In columns with moments it is generally sufficient to consider the maximum and minimum 
ratios of moment/axial load in designing reinforcement areas and concrete sections.
7.6.3.3	
Buckling of columns and overall structure
For rules regarding verification of safety against buckling, refer Section 11.0.
7.6.4	
Reinforced concrete walls
7.6.4.1	
Definition
A wall is a vertical load bearing concrete member whose larger lateral dimension is more than four times 
its lesser lateral dimension. A wall may be considered as short where the ratio of its effective length 
(height) to its thickness does not exceed 12. It should otherwise be considered as slender. Retaining 
walls, wing walls, abutments and other similar wall-like elements where ultimate axial load is less than 
0.1 fcd Ac may be designed as bending elements, neglecting axial load.
7.6.4.2	
Forces and moments in reinforced concrete walls
Forces and moments should be calculated in accordance with Clauses 7.2 and/or 7.3 except that if 
the wall is slender, the moments induced by deflection should also be considered. The distribution of 
axial and horizontal forces along a wall from the loads on the superstructure, should be determined 
by the type and location of the supports. For walls integral with deck, the moments/forces should be 
determined by elastic analysis.
The design moment per unit length in the direction at right angles to a wall should be not less than 0.05 
nwh, where nw is the ultimate axial load per unit length, 0.05h is the nominal minimum eccentricity and 
h is the thickness of the wall. Moment in the plane of a wall can be calculated from statical equilibrium 
required for the most severe positioning of the relevant loads.
Where the concentrated load is acting on a wall, dispersal of loads within the length and height of the 
wall shall be considered.
It will generally be sufficient to consider the maximum and minimum ratios of moment to axial load in 
designing reinforcement areas and concrete sections.
7.7	
Composite Concrete Construction
7.7.1	
General
(1)	
These recommendations apply to flexural members consisting of precast concrete units 
acting in conjunction with cast-in-situ concrete, where provision has been made for the 



======================================================================
PAGE 57 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
47
transfer of horizontal shear at the contact surface. The precast units may be of either 
reinforced or prestressed concrete.
(2)	
Differential shrinkage and creep of the component concrete members requires consideration 
in analysing composite members for the serviceability limit states. Differential shrinkage 
and creep need not be considered for the ultimate limit state.
(3)	
In general, the analysis and design of composite concrete structures and their component 
members should be in accordance with the principle defined earlier except that effects of 
differential shrinkage and creep should be treated as a primary action. Particular attention 
should be given in the design of the component parts and the composite section to take into 
account the effect on stresses and deflections arising out of the method of construction (e.g. 
whether props are used or not used).
(4)	
A check for adequacy of components/whole section should be made for each stage 
of construction. The relative stiffness of members should be based on the concrete 
or gross transformed section properties as described in Clause 7.2. If the concrete 
strengths of the two components of the composite member differ by more than 
10N/mm2, allowance for the difference in moduli of elasticity should be made in assessing 
stiffness and stresses.
(5)	
When at least one of the components is a prestressed member, the combined effect of 
shrinkage and creep movements of the prestressed member(s) with respect to other 
member(s) create time dependent variation of stresses, which may be more severe at 
intermediate stages leading to tensile cracking. The time dependent properties of shrinkage 
and creep given in Section 6 should be used in this evaluation.
(6)	
When only the shrinkage effects are involved, it is sufficient to analyse for the maximum 
value of differential shrinkage.
7.7.2	
Continuity of spans in composite construction
When continuity is obtained in composite construction by changing the statical system, consideration 
should be given to the secondary effects of differential shrinkage and creep on the moments in 
continuous beams and on the reactions at the supports.
7.7.2.1	
Effect of differential shrinkage
The hogging restraint moment, Mcs at an internal support of a continuous composite beam and slab 
section due to differential shrinkage should be taken as:
	
Mcs = (εdiff) (Ecf) Acf (δcent) α
Eq. 7.2
Where
	
εdiff	
is the differential shrinkage strain;
	
Ecf	
is the modulus of elasticity of the flange concrete;
	
Acf	
is the area of the effective concrete flange;
	
δcent	 is the distance of the centroid of the concrete flange from the centroid of the composite 
section;

Eq. 7.3
7.7.2.2	
Creep redistribution due to dead load and prestress in the precast Unit
When a concrete structure’s statical system is changed during construction, creep of the concrete will 
modify the as-built bending moments (and shear forces) towards the ‘instantaneous’ moments (and 
shear) distributions. The additional moment due to creep redistribution, Mcr should be taken as:
	
Mcr = (Minst - Mas- built )α
Eq. 7.4
where,
Minst      is the bending moment, which would have been set up in case the composite section as a 
continuous structure had been subjected to the dead load and prestress component, which was 
actually applied in the precast unit.
Mas-built is the actual bending moment set up in the structure as constructed.
Note:	 This will depend upon the time gap when composite action is established after casting pre-cast portion and 
whether in-situ concrete is cast while pre-cast beam is supported on props and decentred after achieving 
composite section or cast on the beam which takes full self-weight and weight of shuttering without help of 
composite action.
Values of reduction coefficient α1 are calculated from expressions below using φ value taken from 
Table 6.9.
	
α = [1-e-φ]
Eq. 7.5
Where, e is the base of Naperian Logarithms
7.8	
Structural Effects of Time-Dependent Properties of Concrete
(1)	
The inelastic strains due to creep and shrinkage of concrete may cause appreciable changes 
in the long-term state of deformation stresses in the structure and structural elements.
(2)	
The performance with respect to serviceability is of primary concern.
(3)	
In slender or thin sections where second order deformations are important, the increase 
of deflections due to creep reduces the longterm safety margin with respect to buckling 
instability and may lead to creep buckling. In such cases it should be treated as a primary 
effect.
(4)	
Shrinkage and creep act in a complex interdependent way. The creep of concrete reduces 
internal stresses induced by shrinkage. Where great accuracy is not required, this effect can 
be directly evaluated by using reduced value of modulus of elasticity of concrete [approx. 
Ecm / (1+ φ), refer Section 6] which corresponds to the stresses caused by the imposed 
strains.
(5)	
The restrained thermal stresses arising from seasonal variation in temperatures are similarly 
reduced by creep and can be directly evaluated by reduced E value of 0.5 times Ecm.

(6)	
For purpose of analysis of creep and shrinkage treated as acting independently, time-
dependent properties of concrete and relaxation of steel given in Section 6 can be used.
7.9	
Prestressed Members and Structures
Prestressing force applied by pre-tensioned steel or by post-tensioned steel and transferred to the 
structure through bond between steel and concrete or through mechanical anchorages, is covered in 
this Section.
7.9.1	
General
(1)	
Prestressing is considered as an action and its effect should be included in the forces/
moments and applied to the structure.
(2)	
Prestressing force is time-dependent. Its magnitude also varies from the intended value 
due to technological reasons. Both the effects should be considered in selection of design 
prestressing force.
(3)	
The contribution of prestressing tendons to the resistance developed by the member shall 
be limited to the additional forces mobilized by their further deformation, consistent with 
the ultimate deformation of the member.
7.9.2	
Maximum prestressing force
(1)	
The maximum force applied to tendon at active end during tensioning, shall not exceed 90 
percent of 0.1 percent proof load (or proof-stress).
(2)	
In exceptional conditions temporary overstressing during stressing operation is permitted 
up to 95 percent of 0.1 percent of proof load(or proof stress), provided that the accuracy of 
measurement is ensured to be within ±5 percent.
(3)	
Maximum prestressing force P0 applied to structure immediately after transfer (i.e. after 
losses due to elastic shortening and anchorage slip) shall not be greater than 75 percent of 
fpk or 0.85 of 0.1 percent proof load whichever is less (Refer Fig. 6.3).
7.9.3	
Loss of prestress
7.9.3.1	
Immediate losses in pre-tensioning
The following losses occurring during pre-tensioning shall be considered:

During the stressing process:
	
Loss due to friction at the bends (in the case of curved wires and strands) and losses due to

Loss due to relaxation of the pre-tensioning tendons during the period between the tensioning

steel should also be considered.

(a)	
Loss due to elastic deformation of concrete.
	
(b)	
Loss due to draw-in of tendon at two ends of concrete member, taking into account 
favourable/unfavourable bond condition.

Immediate losses of prestress in post-tensioning
(1)	
Losses due to the elastic deformation of concrete
	
Loss in tendon force corresponding to elastic shortening of concrete at the level of tendon 
shall be taken into account. The order in which the tendons are stressed shall be considered 
for calculation of loss.
(2)	
Losses due to friction and wobble
	
(a)	
The losses due to friction and wobble ∆Pμ are calculated by Eq.7.6 where P0 is the 
initial prestressing force which reduces by ∆Pμ (x), at distance x
	
	
∆Pμ (x) = P0 (1–e–(μθ + kx))
Eq. 7.6
where
	
θ	
Measured in radians is the sum of the angular displacements over a distance x 
(irrespective of direction or sign)
	
μ	
is the coefficient of friction between the tendon and its duct.
	
k	
is a coefficient for wobble effect (representing angular displacement per unit length 
of duct multiplied by μ ).
	
x	
is the distance along the tendon from the point where the prestressing force is equal 
to P0.
	
P0	
force at x=0. It is maximum force at active end during tensioning.
	
(a)	
The value of μ depends on the surface characteristics of the tendons and the duct, on 
configuration of the tendon profile, and on the presence of rust, if any. The value k for 
wobble (μ times unintentioned angular displacement per unit length) depends on the 
quality of workmanship, distance between tendon supports, type of duct or sheath and 
degree of vibration while compacting the concrete.
	
(b)	
In the absence of more exact data values for μ and k given in Table 7.1 may be 
adopted for design. The values of μ and k used in design shall be indicated on the 
drawings for guidance in selection of the material and the methods that will produce 
results approaching the assumed values.
	
(c)	
For external tendons, consisting of parallel wires or strands, the loss of prestress due 
to wobble effect between the deviators may be ignored.
	
(d)	
During construction the value of effective prestress obtained on basis of values 
assumed in design should be verified by stressing a few typical tendons. For this 
purpose, two jacks shall be used between the activities - one for pulling the tendon 
(active jack) and other as passive jack. The force in tendon should be measured at 
both ends by means of pressure gauges or load cells. The difference between forces 
at two ends will indicate the actual loss due to friction and wobble. If the loss is 
more than ±5 percent of that adopted in design, it should be referred to designer for 
corrective action.

Losses at Anchorage
	
(a)	
Losses due to wedge draw-in of the anchorage devices, during anchoring and due to 
the deformation of the anchorage itself, should be taken into account.
	
(b)	
Values of (a) as normally given by the manufacturer, shall be used in the design. If 
the manufacturer is not finalised at the time of design, values based on experience 
shall be used and stated on the drawing or on stressing schedule to enable proper 
adjustments to be made at site.

Long term losses in pre-tension and post-tension
Long term losses are due to creep and shrinkage of concrete and relaxation of steel. These should be 
taken into account including their time-dependency.
7.9.4	
Consideration of prestress in analysis
(1)	
For linear analysis both the primary and secondary effects of prestressing shall be applied.
(2)	
Full bond between steel and concrete may be assumed after grouting of bonded tendons. 
However, before grouting, the tendons shall be considered as unbonded.
(3)	
External tendons may be assumed to be straight between deviators.
7.9.5	
Partial factors for prestressing force
(1)	
Prestress in most situations, is intended to be favourable. However, under some load 
combinations the effect may become unfavourable.
(2)	
In case of bonded tendons, for ultimate limit state of strength, the design value of prestressing 
force shall be based on the mean value acting at that time, with partial factor γp=1.



======================================================================
PAGE 62 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
52
(3)	
In case of unbonded tendons and external tendons, the stress increase in ultimate limit state 
of strength may be calculated taking into account the overall deformation of the member. 
If no such calculations are made, the increase in stress in prestressing tendon shall be taken 
as nil, and partial factor γp=1.
(4)	
Where external/unbonded tendons are used for achieving stability and where decrease of 
force or increase of force becomes unfavourable for stability, partial factors of 0.8 and 1.25 
shall be used to decrease or increase the force, as required.
Note:	 These factors account for the possible adverse variation in prestressing force. This shall be over and above 
the overall safety factors against overturning and sliding required for global stability checks.
(5)	
In verification of local effects γp.unfavour =1.3 shall be used.
(6)	
In serviceability limit state, two characteristic values of prestressing force shall be used.
	
Pk.sup= γsup.Pm.(t) (x)
Eq. 7.7
	
Pk.inf  = γinf Pm (t) (x)
Eq. 7.8
Where
Pm (t)(x) is effective prestressing force at point ‘x’ at time ‘t’ and Pk.sup and Pk.inf are corresponding 
superior and inferior characteristic values. The values of γsup and γinf shall be as follows:
- for pre-tensioning or unbonded tendons γsup =1.05 and γinf = 0.95.
- for post-tensioning with bonded tendons γsup =1.10 and γinf = 0.9.
7.9.6	
Part prestressing of tendon
The requirement of minimum concrete strength behind the anchorages of post tensioned system, at the 
time of stressing, for full jacking force, designated as fc.str  shall be specified by the designer taking into 
account special requirements of the structure, if any, and the recommendations of the manufacturer of 
prestressing system.
If any individual tendon is stressed in stages before the specified strength fc.str of concrete is achieved, 
the relation between the stage stressing and specified minimum strength shall be as follows:
-	
For 100% jacking force, minimum concrete strength is fc.str .
-	
For 30% of jacking force minimum concrete strength = 0.5 fc.str
-	
Between 30% and 100% of jacking force minimum concrete strength shall be arrived at by 
linear interpolation between 0.5 fc.str and fc.str.
7.10	
Design and Detailing for Curved Tendons in Thin Sections
7.10.1	
Radial pressure from curved tendons
The curved tendons exert radial pressure on concrete. This introduces local compression on inner side 
of the curvature and tension on outer side of curvature in the plane of the tendon. When this pressure 
acts on thick sections with large cover to ducts or in plane of the member, the normal reinforcement 
provided for shear or surface reinforcement is adequate to control any cracking in this region.
For tendons provided in thin curved sections (like webs curved in plan or curved slabs of box sections) 
pressure acting outwards from the plane of the member causes local out-of plane punching shear as

IRC:112-2020
53
well as overall bending and shear in the curved members. The following additional checks shall be 
carried out in such situations.
7.10.2	
Shear checks
Shear should be checked in the immediate vicinity of the ducts in accordance with the empirical 
equations shown in Fig. 7.2, which are based on experimental results.
Fig. 7.2 Radial Thrust of Tendons Causing Local Punching and Global Bending and Shear in Webs (Slab)
7.10.3	
Radial reinforcement
The local radial tensions set up in concrete behind radial thrust of a group of ducts lying in one plane, 
introduce de-laminating forces tending to separate concrete on two sides of the plane of the duct. 
These tensions should be resisted by reinforcement forming full loops or 180º hooks (Fig. 15.2(e) 
with 180º bend) placed in the concrete section connecting concrete on two sides of plane of ducts. As 
a simplification, full radial thrust Fr (Fig. 7.2) can be resisted by HYSD reinforcement steel limiting 
permissible tensile stress to 230 MPa.

Special Load Transferring Devices
7.11.1	
General
Devices like bearings of various types, dislodgement preventing stoppers and shock transmission units 
are used to transmit loads between parts of bridge elements. The global analysis of the structure should 
include the overall behaviour of these elements in terms of their load/deformation characteristics in a 
simplified way, by defining the released and restrained movements of the structure to which they are 
connected. However, the design of these elements themselves shall be based on the details of internal 
load transferring mechanism and materials used in their fabrication.
7.11.2	
Grade effect and positioning of bearings
For bridges built in grade or cross-fall, the bearings shall normally be set level by varying the thickness 
of the plate situated between the upper face of the bearing and lower face of the beam or by any other 
suitable arrangement. However, where the bearings are required to be set parallel to the inclined grade 
or cross-fall of the superstructure, an allowance shall be made for the longitudinal and transverse 
components of the vertical loads on the bearings.

SECTION 8
ULTIMATE LIMIT STATE OF LINEAR ELEMENTS FOR  
BENDING AND AXIAL FORCES
8.1	
Scope
(1)	
This Section covers structural members which can be idealised as linear members having 
the following characteristics: (a) one of the dimension (length or height) is sufficiently 
large as compared to other two dimensions of its cross-section (breadth, width, thickness), 
(b) the cross-sections which were plane before loading remain approximately plane after 
loading and loading is such that the distortion of the section by shear and torsional strains 
is not large enough to vitiate this assumption, (c) the regions of geometric discontinuity and 
heavy transverse loads where the assumption in (b) does not hold good locally, form a small 
part of the total length.
(2)	
Generally, members having length larger than 4 times the largest linear dimension of cross-
section, can be considered to belong to this class. Under certain conditions of loading 
members having length between 1 to 4 times the cross-sectional dimensions will qualify for 
being treated as linear members (e.g. short columns without bending created by transverse 
shear).
(3)	
Ultimate load carrying capacity of predominantly axially loaded members is adversely 
affected by instability (buckling) for long members by effect of second-order deformations 
caused by initial geometric imperfections, unintentional and small eccentricity of external 
loads or effect of lateral deflection due to transverse loading or end fixity conditions 
(moments). Additional checks for such effects and design of slender members in general 
are included in Section 11.
(4)	
Simplified methods for bi-axial bending are covered.
(5)	
Simplified methods for small magnitudes of axial forces acting together with bending 
moments are covered.
8.2	
Strain and Stress Distribution at Ultimate Limit State
8.2.1	
Limitations on strain and stresses
(1)	
In analysing a cross-section to determine its ultimate resistance, the assumptions given 
below shall be used:
	
(a)	
Plane sections remain plane.
	
(b)	
The strain in bonded reinforcement and in bonded prestressing steel beyond the initial 
pre-tension before bonding, whether in tension or compression, is the same as that in 
the surrounding concrete.
	
(c)	
The tensile strength of the concrete is ignored.
	
(d)	
The stresses in the concrete in compression are derived from the design stress-strain 
diagram in Fig. 6.5, which is a parabolic-rectangular diagram. For other shapes of 
stress-strain diagram, refer Annexure A-2.



======================================================================
PAGE 66 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
56
	
(e)	
The stresses in the reinforcement steel are derived from the design curves in Fig. 
6.2, and the stresses for prestressing steel are derived from Fig. 6.3 or Fig. 6.4 as 
appropriate, after dividing stresses by partial factor for materials as shown.
	
(f)	
When upward sloping branch of stress-strain curve beyond the linear elastic portion 
is used, the tensile stresses in reinforcing and prestressing steel are limited to those 
corresponding to strain of 0.9 εuk. Where idealised plastic branch is used for this part 
of the curve, it is not necessary to check strain limit.
	
(g)	
The initial pre-strain introduced in prestressing tendons is taken into account when 
assessing the stresses in the tendons at the ultimate limit state.
	
(h)	
For cross-sections subject to pure longitudinal compression, the compressive strain in 
the concrete is limited to εc2.
	
(i)	
For cross-sections subject to axial compressive force and bending and where neutral 
axis lies outside the section, the strain at most compressed face is restricted to εcu2. 
The strain diagram is defined by assuming that the compressive strain εc2 is at a level 
(1-εc2 / εcu2) of the height of the section from the most compressed face.
	
(j)	
For cross-sections subjected axial compressive force and bending moment where the 
cross-section is not fully in compression and neutral axis lies within the section, the 
strain at the most compressed face is taken as εcu2, for use with parabolic rectangular 
stress-strain diagram of concrete portion in compression.
	
(k)	
Possible range of strain distributions is shown in Fig. 8.1.
(2)	
For values of deformation characteristics of concrete such as, εc2, εcu2 refer Table 6.5.
(3)	
In parts of cross-section which are subject to approximately compressive loading (e/h < 
0.1), such as compression flange of box girder, the mean compressive strain in that part of 
section should be limited to εc2.
	
Ap	– Prestressing steel tensile strain limit
	
AR	– Reinforcing steel tensile strain limit
	
B 	– Concrete bending plus axial compression strain limit
	
C 	– Pure compression strain limit
Fig. 8.1 Possible Strain Distributions in the Ultimate Limit State
(4)	
If changes in the position of the reinforcement such as at a lap can lead to a localised 
reduction in the effective depth, the most unfavourable value should be used in the cross-
section analysis.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
57
(5)	
For prestressed members with permanently unbonded internal or externally prestressed 
tendons, it is generally necessary to take the deformation of the whole member into account. 
Refer Clause 7.9 for the suitable method of analysis. 
(6)	
In the analysis of a cross-section which has to resist bending and only a small longitudinal 
force, the effect of the design ultimate longitudinal compressive force may be ignored, if it 
does not exceed 0.08 fck times the cross-sectional area. The tensile force due to bending and 
the axial tensile force on the member shall be entirely carried by reinforcement.
(7)	
The bending resistance calculated on the basis of above assumptions, is strictly valid for 
bending in the planes of principal axes. For bending at any other axis, the approximate 
solutions given in Clause 8.3.2 may be used.
(8)	
Based on the principles and assumptions given in this Section, exact solutions for cross-
sections of variable width/depth may be evolved. Local large openings in cross-section 
should be accounted for (e.g. those caused by transversely or obliquely running cable 
ducts).
8.2.2	
Further explanation of possible domains of strain diagrams
The adoption of the assumptions in Clause 8.2.1 leads to the range of possible strain diagrams at 
ultimate limit states subjected to different combinations of moment and axial tensile/compressive 
force, as shown in Fig. 8.2.
 Fig. 8.2 Domains of Strain Distributions
Angular Deviation ‘1’ to ‘5’ denotes following:
1	
Pivot point is ‘A’, where tensile strain εu = εud in reinforcement. Section is fully in axial tension with some bending. 
Neutral axis outside the section. Compressive strain in concrete, εc≤0 (Negative).Failure occurs due to yielding of 
steel.
2	
Pivot point is ‘A’, where tensile strain εu = εud in reinforcement. Section is in combined axial and bending. 
Neutral axis within the section. Compressive strain in concrete, 0 ≤εc≤εcu2. Failure occurs due to yielding of steel.
3	
Pivot point is ‘B’, where compressive strain εc = εcu2 in concrete. Section is in combined axial and bending. Neutral 
axis within the section. Strain in reinforcement, εyd≤εs ≤ εud. The failure of the section occurs by an excess of plastic 
strain in concrete.
4	
Pivot point is ‘B’, where compressive strain εc = εcu2 in concrete. Section is in combined axial and bending. Neutral 
axis within the section. Strain in reinforcement, εs ≤ εyd. The failure of the section occurs by an excess of plastic strain 
in concrete.



======================================================================
PAGE 68 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
58
5	
Pivot point is ‘C’, where compressive strain εc = εc2 in concrete. Section is in axial compression with some bending. 
Neutral axis outside the section. The failure of the section occurs by an excess of average strain in concrete.
Zone-1: Tensile load with/without eccentricity
The entire section is in tension, the neutral axis lies outside the section and its location depends on the 
eccentricity of the tensile force. Reinforcing/prestressing steel at least on one side yields (with strains 
limited as per either idealised or simplified diagrams) which decide the ultimate tensile capacity.
Zone-2: Compressive load with eccentricity, having neutral axis within section, and ultimate 
strength governed by tensile steel
The maximum strain in the concrete is less than the limiting value of εcu2 thus the strength of the 
concrete is not exhausted. The tensile strain at steel is at the upper design limit of εud .
Zone-3 : Compressive load with eccentricity, having neutral axis within section, and steel beyond 
yield, ultimate strength governed by concrete
The concrete compression strain at the upper fibre is at upper design limit εcu2. The steel strain lies 
between εyd and εud.
Zone-4 : Compressive load with eccentricity, with ultimate strength governed by concrete and 
steel strain is below yield strain.
This is typically the cause of steel strength not fully exploited giving over-reinforced non-ductile 
failure.
The boundary between Zone-3 and Zone-4 is called the balanced condition, where the maximum 
concrete strain (εcu2) and reinforcement strain at yield (ε yd) are present simultaneously.
Zone-5: Compressive load with eccentricity, having neutral axis outside the section (i.e. full 
section in compression)
The entire section (with exception of possibly existing prestressing steel) is in compression. 
All strain profiles pass through point C. The maximum compressive strain of concrete at 
C is between εcu2 and o. C lies where the line BO (which defines the boundary between sections 
partially in tension and sections in compression) intersects the vertical line characterized by 
εc2 = constant. The distance of this point from the outermost compressive fibre is taken as equal to

Biaxial Bending
8.3.1	
General solution
The analysis of members of generalised cross-section having irregular shape is not normally required in 
bridge design. Methods are available in specialist literature for members having at least two orthogonal 
axes of symmetry, where loads can be split in components acting in plane of bending of each of the 
axes and the shear centre coinciding with the C.G of the section. The restrictions on the ultimate strains 
on concrete and steel specified in Clause 8.2.1 shall be observed.

8.3.2	
Simplified method for bi-axial bending and axial force
(1)	
The simplified method described below may be used for bi-axial bending. Special care 
should be taken to identify the section along the member with the critical combination of 
moments. Where more accurate analysis is required, specialist literature may be referred.
(2)	
Separate design in each principal direction, disregarding bi-axial bending, is done as a first 
step. Imperfections need to be taken into account only in the direction where they will have 
the most unfavourable effect.
(3)	
No further check is necessary if the slenderness ratios satisfy the following two conditions 
expressed by Eq.8.1 and if the relative eccentricities ez / b and ey / h satisfy one of the 
following conditions expressed by Eq.8.2 (Refer Fig. 8.3 for notations).

Section 9
Ultimate Limit State Of Two And Three Dimensional Elements For  
Out Of Plane And In Plane Loading Effects
9.1	
Scope
This Section deals with plate and shell type elements and sub-elements where out of plane loading effects 
as well as in plane loading effects are present. The permissible simplifications for separating in-plane 
and out-of-plane effects and designing for the same are given. A method of providing reinforcement 
for in-plane effects is indicated.
For use of three dimensional elements as bridge elements (e.g. shell elements as in case of fish-belly 
superstructure) apart from designing for sectional strength, overall and local buckling checks may be 
required. Specialist literature may be referred for the same.
9.2	
One-Way and Two-Way Slabs and Walls
For predominantly transverse loads acting perpendicular to the plane of the slab, where primary 
overall in plane tensile or compressive stress fields are absent, the slabs/walls can be designed using 
conventional plate bending analysis and providing ultimate strength in bending and shear in one and/
or two orthogonal directions as required by such analysis. Bridge deck slabs, retaining walls resisting 
lateral earth pressures etc., are the typical examples.
Any rational method of analysis which does not permit more than 15 percent redistribution of peak 
bending moments over supports can be used. The ultimate strength methods based on local yielding 
(e.g. yield line method) are not permitted. However, for calculating resistance to accidental impact 
loads (e.g. vehicular or barge impacts), use of such methods is permitted for which specialist literature 
may be referred.
9.3	
Sub-Elements of Box Structures
(1)	
Where box type structure resists the overall longitudinal bending, shear and torsional effects, 
significant in-plane longitudinal stresses are present in its sub-elements, which coexist 
with the local out-of-plane loading, e.g. effects due to self weight, live loads, intermediate 
prestressing anchorages etc.
(2)	
Such elements can be designed primarily for in-plane effects arising from overall bending, 
shear and torsion in longitudinal direction. In  transverse direction they are designed for 
out-of-plane loading effects.
(3)	
If effects of out-of-plane loading are present in the same direction as of the overall in-plane 
tensions/compressions, these elements should be locally checked for combined effect of 
in-plane forces, and out of plane bending moments and shears.

General Solution for Two-Way Slabs, Walls and Shell Elements
For plate type elements having complex geometry and edge conditions and having in-plane as well 
as out-of–plane (transverse) effects due to loading, the resultant stress fields may be obtained by use

of suitable finite elements in the FEM analysis. The analysis yields resultant stresses which represent 
combined effects of in-plane membrane stresses and local bending effects. These stress resultants can be 
directly used to design tensile reinforcement and for verifying safety in compression. A general method 
of design using sandwich model given in informative Annexure B-1 may be referred. Alternatively, 
the stresses can be converted to equivalent axial forces and bending effects in orthogonal directions 
and used for designing the sections following conventional methods.
9.4.1	
Simplified design for tensile reinforcement for orthogonal in-plane effects
The following simplified method may be used for proportioning of tensile reinforcement based on the 
in-plane stresses σEdx >  σEdy  and τ Edxy.
(1)	
Compressive stresses should be taken as positive, with σEdx> σEdy , and the direction of 
reinforcement should coincide with the x and y axes.
(2)	
The tensile strengths ftdx and ftdy provided by reinforcement should be determined from:
	
	
ftdx = ρx  f yd and ftdy = ρy  f yd
Eq. 9.1
Where ρx and ρy are the geometric reinforcement ratios, along the x and y axes respectively.
(3)	
In locations where σEdx and σEdy are both compressive and σ Edx. σ Edy>τ2 Edxy design 
reinforcement is not required. However, the maximum compressive stress should not 
exceed fcd.
(4)	
In locations where σ Edy is tensile or σEdx. σEdy ≤ τ2
Edxy reinforcement is required.
(5)	
The optimum reinforcement, indicated by superscript (‘) and placed in directions of 
concerned principal stresses are determined by :
	
 
The concrete stress, σcd , should not exceed v. fcd . The minimum reinforcement is obtained if the direction 
of reinforcement is identical to the direction of principal stresses, where value of v is obtained from 
Eq. 10.6.

where θ is the angle of the concrete compressive stress to the x-axis. The value of cot θ shall be chosen 
to avoid compressive value of ftd .
Note:
(1)	
In order to avoid unacceptable cracks for the serviceability state, and to ensure the required deformation 
capacity for the ultimate limit state, the reinforcement derived from Eq.9.8 and Eq. 9.9 for each direction 
should not be more than twice and not less than half the reinforcement determined by Eq. 9.2 and Eq. 9.3 
or, alternatively, from Eq.9.5 and 9.6.
	
These limitations are expressed by (1/2) f’tdx ≤ ftdx ≤ 2 f’tdy and (1/2) f’tdy ≤ ftdy ≤ 2f’tdy
(2)	
The reinforcement should be fully anchored at all free edges by following appropriate detailing, as described 
in Section 15.
9.4.2	
Simplified design for bending in orthogonal direction
The slab (wall) subjected to orthogonal bending effects is substituted by two half plates usually 
representing the compression and tensile zones of the element.
The stresses in compressive portions are checked by verifying that the resultant principle compressive 
stress is within the allowable limits.
The half plate carrying tensile stresses in orthogonal directions is converted to orthogonal mesh of steel 
following method described in Clause 9.4.1.
The out of plane shear forces are similarly converted to principle bending directions and the maximum 
shear checked using methods of Section 10.
9.4.3	
Simplified design of combined in-plane forces and out of plane bending and shears
The plate is substituted by a sandwiched plate of the same thickness consisting of three layers of 1/3rd 
thickness. The central 1/3rd thickness is designed to carry in-plane forces using methods of Clause 
9.4.1.
The outer two layers are designed to resist tensile and compressive fields with appropriate lever-arm to 
develop resistance to bending and shear in two directions as per Clause 9.4.2.

SECTION 10
ULTIMATE LIMIT STATE OF SHEAR, PUNCHING SHEAR AND TORSION
10.1	
Scope
This Section applies to design of flexural members for web shear, interface shear between the web and 
flanges, and torsion. The punching shear due to transverse concentrated loads/reactions acting over a 
small area is covered. Design verification for shear is carried out at Ultimate Limit State of strength 
only. The design of members requiring shear reinforcement is based on truss model. For members 
without shear reinforcement truss model is not applicable.
For concrete of grades higher than M60, the shear strength shall be limited to that of strength grade 
M60 for design purpose.
10.2	
Design of Flexural Members for Shear
10.2.1	
Shear design model of members without shear reinforcement
(1)	
The design rules, given in Clauses below are based on extensive experimentation and 
not on any specific design model. These rules take into account the important parameters 
mentioned in (3) & (4) below by empirical approach.
(2)	
Minimum shear reinforcement is required in this type of members to avoid sudden brittle 
failure induced by cracking in shear tension in webs. The minimum shear reinforcement 
may be omitted in members such as slabs where transverse redistribution of loads is 
possible.
(3)	
Thin structural members like slabs cracked in flexure carry shear forces using shear 
strength of the uncracked compression zone, shear forces transferred across flexural cracks 
by mechanical interlock and dowel action of reinforcing steel. Members of thickness less 
than 200 mm develop higher shear strength than those having over 200 mm thickness.
(4)	
The shear strength of rectangular section, T- section and L-section is mainly determined by:
	
–	
Effective width of web bw, depth d, ratio of bw/d, and ratio of shear span to depth.
	
–	
Properties of Concrete such as tensile strength, and mechanical interlock of cracked 
surfaces.
	
–	
Ratio ρ=As/bw.d of flexural tensile reinforcement to area of concrete.
	
–	
Dowel action of reinforcement.
10.2.2	
Shear Design model of members with shear reinforcement
10.2.2.1	
Zone of Shear design
These elements subjected to bending and significant shear forces exhibit four zones as shown in Fig. 
10.1(a) namely uncracked zone (Zone A); Zone with shear cracks in web without any flexural cracks 
(Zone B); Zone with combined flexural and shear cracks (Zone C, comprising Zones C1 & C2) and 
Zone with only flexural cracks (Zone D). The compression fields in concrete in these zones together

with the shear resistance provided by concrete cracks and the reinforcement, provide mechanism to 
carry shear forces to the support.
In Zone ‘A’, the type of support effects the compression field in concrete near the support.

Fig. 10.1(a) Shear Zones of Flexural Members
In case of direct support [Fig. 10.1 (b)], a fan like compression field exists. When structure is subjected 
to predominantly uniformly distributed loads, in area, confined by the beam end and the steepest 
inclination (θmax= 45º) of the compression field (generally within a distance equal to effective depth 
from face of support or centre of bearing where flexible bearings are used), no shear reinforcement is 
required.
For concentrated loads the steepest inclination may the taken as 26.5º (measured with respect to vertical 
face of beam end, generally within a distance of half the effective depth from face of support) and for 
loads within this distance no shear reinforcement is required. It is however, necessary to extend the 
shear reinforcement up to the support from the section within this region ‘X1’ (distance d or half of d, 
as the case may be, see figure 10.1(b)) and provide tensile reinforcement, adequately anchored beyond 
bearing point, for resisting the horizontal components of these internal compressive forces in addition 
to the steel provided for bending.
In case of indirect support [Fig.10.1(c)], as a consequence of compatibility condition, a fan like 
compression field does not exist. For the design it is assumed on the safer side that the compressive 
stresses are distributed equally over the full depth of the section. Additionally, in the common inter-
section zone of the supporting and the supported beam, reinforcement is required over and above the 
shear reinforcement.

Beam with Constant Depth
The design of shear resistance of members is based on a truss model (Fig. 10.2) in which loads are 
transferred to the support by truss type action within the member. The compression chord, tension 
chord and web members comprising compression struts and tensile steel elements are the members of 
the truss. Angles θ and α are the inclinations of concrete compressive truss and reinforcement with the 
axis of the element as defined in Fig. 10.2(a).The angles may be chosen within limits such that:

Beam of variable depth
A schematic truss model for beam with both tensile and compressive chords inclined to the central axis 
as shown in Fig. 10.3 may be used for design of shear resistance. The forces in the chord and web may 
be determined on the basis of this or other suitable truss models.
As a simplification, local zones of short length of a beam with inclined chords may be designed using 
method given for beam with parallel chord. For this shear force to be carried by the web shall be 
corrected by taking into account the components of chord forces parallel to the shear force as shown 
in Fig. 10.4.

10.2.3	
Design shear force
(1)	
In case of direct support, shear force VNS acting at section d (effective depth) away from 
face of support (or centre of bearing where flexible bearings are used) when the member 
is subjected to predominantly uniformly distributed load and at a distance d/2 away when 
member is subjected to concentrated loads – may be used for design of shear reinforcement 
in the region between support to d or support to d/2 as the case may be. For checking 
crushing of concrete compression strut VNS shall be taken at centre of support.



======================================================================
PAGE 78 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
68
(2)	
In case of indirect support, shear force shall be taken at face of the support both for design 
of reinforcement and checking compressive stresses.
(3)	
In the elements of variable depth, where VEd, MEd, and NEd, are concurrently acting forces, 
the design shear force VEd from sectional analysis shall be reduced by the favorable 
contribution from any inclined compression chord and tension chord as shown in Fig. 10.4. 
Any unfavorable contributions, depending on direction of inclination of chords shall be 
added to VEd. In Fig. 10.4, VNS=VEd –Vccd –Vtd.
(4)	
In case of prestressed members the design prestressing force is considered as external load 
in the analysis and is accounted for in the analysis of the sectional shear VNs including its 
hyperstatic effects in case of indeterminate members.
	
Further increase in force in bonded tendons due to cracking of concrete under ULS load 
only is to be included in the analysis of shear resistance of truss in the same way as that of 
untensioned reinforcement.
	
In case of pretensioned members the reduction in the maximum developable force under UTS in 
prestressing tendons within development length shall be taken into account.
(5)	
For members not requiring shear reinforcement the net design force shall be taken as VEd 
ignoring components of inclined chords and increase in bonded prestressing force.

Zone C may exist. For Zone C, cracked in bending the expression for VRd.c as given in 
Eq 10.1 can be used. For Zone B uncracked in bending, where flexural tensile stress in 
the region under maximum bending moment is smaller than fctk 0.05/γm, the shear resistance 
should be limited by the tensile strength of concrete. In these regions the shear resistance is 
given by

For cross-sections where the width varies over the height, the maximum principal stress 
may occur on an axis other than the centroidal axis. In such a case the minimum value of 
the shear capacity should be found by calculating VRd.c at various axes in the cross-sections.
4)	
The calculation of the shear resistance according to the Eq. 10.4 is not required for cross-
sections between the support and the section which contains the intersection of the elastic 
centroidaI axis and a line inclined from the inner edge of the support at an angle of 45°.

For members with concentrated loads applied on the upper side at a distance av where av is 
within 0.5d to 2d from the edge of a support (or centre of bearing where flexible bearings 
are used), the contribution of this load to the shear force VEd may be multiplied β= av/2d. 
This reduction may be applied for checking VRd.c in Eq.10.1. This is only valid provided that 
the longitudinal reinforcement is fully anchored at the support. For av≤0.5d, the value of 
av=0.5d should be used.

To find the least amount of shear reinforcement, for low and intermediate shear stresses, 
the lower limits of θ given in Clause 10.2.2.2 will normally govern the design. For higher 
shear stresses, the value of θ may be found by equating the design shear force VNS to VRd.

to VRd.s. The value of θ may alternatively selected to optimize the design, for example by 
minimizing the total amount of reinforcement.

Diagonal stress fields for members having unbonded tendon
(1)	
Sections having both bonded and unbonded tendons shall be treated as in Clause 10.3.3 
making use of only bonded tendons as reinforcement.
(2)	
In the case of precast elements joined by unbonded prestressing tendons in the tension 
chord (e.g. segmental construction), the section at ULS may act as tied arch with joints 
partially opening. This effect of opening of joints on shear resistance should be considered. 
Under these conditions, in absence of detailed analysis, the force in the tension chord, 
provided by the unbonded tendons should be assumed to remain unchanged after the 
joints have opened. In consequence, as the applied load increases and joints open further, 
the inclination of concrete strutt within the web increases. The depth of concrete section 
available for the flow of the web compression decreases to a value of hred . (Refer Fig. 10.7)

The shear capacity can be evaluated in accordance with Eq.10.7 and Eq.10.11 as applicable,

The shear stress that arises between the interfaces of concrete placed at different times is referred to as

The interface shear is resisted by friction at the interface and by reinforcement placed across the shear 
plane.

where
vEdi	
is the interface shear stress
	
vEdi = β VEd / Z.bi

Shear in the flange portion of flanged beams and box sections 
Flexural compression and tension is carried mainly by the flanges and the variation of flexure leads 
to shear at the junction of flanges with the webs. The flanges also will be subjected to shear flow in 
their own plane. The design for this shear is based on a truss model in the plane of the flanges with 
compression struts and tensile reinforcement (Fig. 10.9).
(1)	
The longitudinal shear stress vEd f at the junction between one side of flange and the web is 
determined by the change of normal (longitudinal) force in a definite distance.

To prevent crushing of the compression struts in the flange, the following condition should be satisfied

Note: The recommended values in the absence of more rigorous calculation are:
	
1.0 ≤ cot θf ≤ 2.0	for compression flanges (45° ≥ θf ≥ 26,5°)
	
1.0 ≤ cot θf ≤ 1.25	
for tension flanges (45° ≥ θf ≥ 38,6°)
(3)	
In the case of combined shear between the flange and the web, and transverse bending, the 
area of steel should be the greater of that given by Eq.10.23 or half that given in Eq. 10.23 
plus that required for transverse bending.

If vEdf is less than or equal to 0.4fctd no extra reinforcement above that for flexure is required.

required to transmit the force back to the web at the section where this reinforcement is 
required (Refer Fig. 10.9).

Design for Punching Shear
10.4.1	
General
The rules in this Section are complementary to those given in earlier Sections. This Section covers 
shear due to punching force (penetrating force) on two dimensional structural elements such as deck 
slabs, soffit slab, well caps and open foundations. The word ‘slab’ represents all these in Clause10.4.
The punching normally happens when a concentrated force (load or reaction) acts over a small area 
of the two dimensional structural element and causes local shear failure surrounding the concentrated 
force in the element.
10.4.2	
Loaded area and basic control perimeter
(1)	
Punching shear is evaluated as shear stress at (a) face of the loaded area u0 (b) along basic 
control perimeter u1 and (c) other perimeters as required in Clause 10.4.2(4).
(2)	
The basic control perimeter u1 shall be taken at distance 2d from the face of the loaded area 
(Refer Fig. 10.10) where the depth d of the element is taken as d=(dx+dy)/2; dx and dy being 
effective depths in two orthogonal directions measured at the control perimeter.

should be taken as shown in Fig. 10.11. In such cases special edge reinforcement shall be 
provided, as per Clause 16.6.1.4.
(4)	
Control perimeters at a distance less than 2d should be considered for checking punching 
shear where the concentrated force of loaded area is partly resisted by a high pressure such 
as soil pressure on a base (e.g. foundation slab/raft) or by effects of a reaction or load within 
a distance of 2d of the periphery of the area of application of force such as pile caps.(Refer 
Clause 10.4.5).

Design of section for punching shear
(1)	
In bridges, punching should be avoided by providing adequate concrete thickness with 
sufficient reinforcement for resisting bending and shear, which should also be capable of 
resisting the worst local punching shear stresses.
(2)	
The design procedure for punching shear is based on checks at the face of the column and at 
the basic control perimeter u1. The following design shear stresses (MPa) along the control 
sections, are defined:
vRd.c	
is the design value of the punching shear resistance of a slab without punching shear 
reinforcement along the control section considered i.e. between 2d and face of column or 
loaded area.
vRd.max	
is the design value of the maximum punching shear resistance along the control section 
considered i.e. at the face of column or loaded area.

Torsion
10.5.1	
General
(1)	
Torsional resistance in concrete elements, in which its longitudinal fibres are free to deform 
in longitudinal direction, is categorized into equilibrium torsion and compatibility torsion. 
Where the longitudinal fibres are restrained by external element, warping torsion results. 
For example, when longitudinal restraint to the deformation of external walls of hollow 
sections or surfaces of solid sections exists, warping torsion results.
(2)	
Equilibrium torsion is that which is essential to keep the element in equilibrium. Such 
elements shall be designed to cater for full torsional resistance in the ultimate limit state 
[Fig. 10.14(a)].

Fig. 10.14(b) Examples of Compatibility Torsion
(3)	
If torsional resistance is not essential for stability or static equilibrium of the element, but 
arises out of compatibility of displacement/ rotations of connected element, it is termed as 
compatibility torsion. It will not be necessary to consider torsion at ultimate limit state [Fig. 
10.14(b)].
	
Such elements will be subjected to torsional deformations in service leading to cracking 
and deflection.
	
To limit the crack width and deformations in the limit state of serviceability, checks as 
given in Clause 12.3.5 shall be performed. Suitable reinforcement as per detailing Sections 
shall be provided
(4)	
The torsional resistance of a closed section may be calculated on the basis of a thin-walled 
closed section, in which equilibrium is satisfied by a closed shear flow. Solid sections may 
be modelled by equivalent thin-walled sections.
	
Complex shapes, such as T-sections, may be divided into a series of sub- sections, each of 
which is modelled as equivalent thin walled hollow section. The total torsional resistance 
is taken as sum of the individual sub-sections.
(5)	
The distribution of the acting torsional moments over the sub­ sections should be in 
proportion to their uncracked torsional stiffnesses. For hollow sections such as box sections, 
the equivalent wall thickness should not exceed the actual wall thickness.

(6)	
Each sub-section may be designed separately. For conversion of solid sub- section to 
equivalent hollow section procedure given in Fig. 10.15 defining the effective thickness of 
wall tef.i may be followed.
(7)	
In the analysis, torsional stiffness may be calculated on the following basis:
	
(a)	
In case of equilibrium torsion, the stiffness should be based on uncracked sectional 
resistance, i.e. gross-section.
	
(b)	
In case of compatibility torsion, the torsional stiffness may be calculated on the basis 
of cracked section.
	
	
Torsional stiffness of cracked section may be assumed as 25 percent of that of the 
uncracked section (Refer Clause 7.4).

For resisting torsion, reinforcement has to be provided both in the longitudinal and transverse 
direction.

for truss analogy for shear shall be the same for the elements considered to resist torsion. 
The design reinforcement for the combined shear and torsion, may be considered as per 
Clauses 10.3.3.2 and 10.3.3.3.
(4)	
The maximum resistance of a member subjected to torsion and shear is limited by the 
capacity of the concrete struts. In order not to exceed this resistance the following condition 
should be satisfied:

In compressive chords, the longitudinal reinforcement may be reduced in proportion to the available

other reinforcement. The longitudinal reinforcement should generally be distributed over the length, zi 
(Fig. 10.15).
10.5.2.2	
Warping torsion
(1)	
For closed thin-walled sections and solid sections, warping torsion may normally be ignored 
unless the longitudinal elongation of the walls/surfaces of the section is restrained by other 
members.
(2)	
In open thin walled members it is necessary to consider warping torsion. For very slender 
cross-sections the calculation should be carried out on the basis of a beam grid model and 
for other cases on the basis of a truss model. In all cases the design should be carried out 
according to the design rules for bending and longitudinal normal force, and for shear.

SECTION 11 
ULTIMATE LIMIT STATE OF INDUCED DEFORMATION
11.1	
General
(1)	
This Section deals with structures and structural members whose load deformation behaviour 
and ultimate capacity are significantly affected by second order effects. Second order effects 
are defined as the additional effects of actions caused by structural deformations. Second 
order effects can be global, involving structure as a whole, and/or local, involving some of 
its members, such as columns, walls, compression flanges of beams etc.
(2)	
Classical buckling defined as sudden failure due to instability of perfectly axially loaded 
members without horizontal load does not usually occur in practical reinforced/prestressed 
concrete members. However, long slender members at ultimate load exhibit large and 
disproportionate increase of deflections due to combined effect of geometric non-linearity 
(P-∆ effect) and non-linear structural response due to material non-linearity, progressive 
cracking and local plasticity. This reduces the ultimate load carrying capacity as compared 
to the short members of identical cross-section and steel ratio. Therefore, long members 
should be designed to have higher moment resisting capacity as compared to short members 
of identical sectional details.
(3)	
Second order linear elastic method of analysis shall be used for calculating second order 
effects. Equilibrium and resistance shall be verified in the deformed state for the most 
unfavourable combination of actions at ultimate limit state, taking into account uncertainties 
in geometry and position of axial loads as additional first order effects.
(4)	
The distinction between treatment of long column and short column for purpose of this 
Section 11 is based on 10 percent criteria given in (5) below.
	
Structural behaviour shall be considered in all directions in which significant second order 
effects can occur. Biaxial bending shall be taken into account when necessary.
(5)	
Second order effects may be ignored if they are less than 10 percent of the corresponding 
first order effects, calculated on the basis of (3) above.
(6)	
In place of method described in (4) & (5) above, simplified criteria for identifying short and 
long members are given for isolated members of uniform cross-section in Clause 11.2.
(7)	
For piers with variable sections and those acting as long composite system together with 
piles which are not laterally supported below pile caps, (as in case of piles in river portion 
between the pile cap and scour depth), full height of the substructure shall be analysed 
using method described in (3). For piles fully embedded in soil, the piers alone can be 
separately analysed for slenderness effects.
(8)	
Compression members that can be isolated from rest of the bridge, whose boundary 
conditions can be represented by an effective length applied to the member, are defined as 
isolated members for the purpose of second order analysis.
(9)	
Second order analysis shall be carried out under Ultimate Limit State only.

Braced and Unbraced members: 
	
(a)	
Braced members: Members that are held in position at both ends and which may or 
may not have restraining rotational stiffness at ends.

Slenderness Ratio
	
The slenderness ratio λ is defined as le / i, where i is the radius of gyration of the uncracked 
concrete section. The effective length le is the length of a pin-ended column with constant 
axial force having the same cross-section and same buckling load as the actual member.
(2)	
Second order effects may be ignored if the slenderness ratio λ based on le as per Clause 
11.2.2 is less than a certain value λlim as per Eq.11.1.
	
λlim = 20.A.B.C/√n

M01 , M02 are the first order end moments at two ends of member as calculated from the 
analysis of structure, where |M02|≥|M01|.
	
If the end moments M01 & M02 give tension on the same side, rm should be taken positive 
(i.e. C ≤ 1.7), otherwise negative (i.e. C>1.7).



======================================================================

In the following cases, rm should be taken as 1.0 (i.e. C=0.7):
	
-	 For unbraced members in general.
	
-	 For braced members in which the first order moments arise predominantly from 
imperfections or transverse loading.
	
	
Note:	
For initial dimensioning of member, simplified values of A =0.7, B =1.1, C =0.7 may be 
used.
(3)	
In case of biaxial bending, the slenderness criterion may be checked separately for each 
direction. Depending on the outcome of this check, second order effects (a) may be ignored 
in both directions, (b) should be taken into account in one direction, or (c) should be taken 
into account in both directions.

In the definition of effective lengths, the stiffness of restraining members should include the effect of

(ii)	
k = 0 is the theoretical limit for rigid rotational restraint, and k =∞ represents the limit for no restraint at all. 
Since fully rigid restraint is rare in practise, a minimum value of 0.1 is recommended for k1 and k2, if they 
are considered as fully rigid.
(2)	
Alternatively, for piers/columns the effective length (height) le in a given plane of bucking 
may be obtained from Table 11.1 where lo is the clear height between end restraints. The 
values are based on the following assumptions:

Notes:
1.	
Positional restraints are given for directions at right angles to the member.
2.	
Class 1 to 5 shows superstructure held in position which means the deck is held in position at some location 
other than the pier under consideration (say typically either at another pier or at the abutment.) 
3.	
In case of any floating deck on elastomeric bearings (simply supported or continuous), Case 7 will be 
applicable.
4.	
For a continuous deck fixed at any pier/abutment Case 7 applies for the design of fixed pier/abutment. For 
design of other piers in the longitudinal direction, Case 4 applies for piers with elastomeric bearings and 
Case 5 applies for piers with free metallic bearings.
11.3	
Method of Analysis for Obtaining the Second Order Effects
11.3.1	
General
The methods of analysis include two simplified methods and one general method based on non linear 
analysis.
(1)	
The simplified methods are.
	
(a)	
Method based on nominal curvature.
	
(b)	
Method based on nominal stiffness.
(2)	
For isolated member method based on nominal curvature is applicable.
(3)	
For a group of compression members, as in a framed structure or where they are connected 
integrally to the same superstructure or a group of piles connected through a pile cap, which 
cannot be isolated as they collectively resist the side sway of the structure bringing unequal 
axial loads on the compression members, only the method based on nominal stiffness as per 
clause 11.3.3.2 is applicable.
(4)	
General method based on non-linear analysis.
	
Non linear analysis may be used for all members with any boundary conditions
	
a)	
In case of members having varying sections and different types of loading such as 
permanent and quasi-permanent loads leading to creep effects and short term loads 
such as live loads, generalized methods of non-linear analysis taking into account the 
geometric non-linearity of structure and or material non linearity need to be used. 
	
b)	
Stress-strain relationships for concrete given in Annexure (A2.7) and for steel given 
in Section 6 (Fig. 6.2 and 6.4) may be used. With stress-strain diagrams based on 
design value, a design value of the ultimate load is obtained directly from the analysis. 
In equation Eq.A2-28 and in the calculation of k-value, fcm is then substituted by the 
design compressive strength fcd and Ecm is substituted by: 
cm
cd
cE
E
E

 , where γcE is 
taken as 1.2.
	
c)	
In the absence of more refined models, creep may be taken into account by modifying 
all strain values in the concrete stress-strain diagram using effective E value as per 
Clause 6.4.2.5.(4) (iii)

11.3.2	
Method based on nominal curvature
11.3.2.1	
General
This method is primarily suitable for isolated members with constant normal force and a defined 
effective length le. The method gives a nominal second order moment based on a deflection, which in 
turn is based on the effective length and an estimated maximum curvature.
11.3.2.2	
Design bending moments
(1)	
The design moment is:
	
MEd= M0Ed+M2
Eq.11.4
Where
M0Ed is the first order moment, including the effect of imperfections, M2 is the nominal 
second order moment, defined in (3)
The maximum value of MEd is given by the distributions of MoEd and M2; the latter may be 
taken as parabolic or sinusoidal over the effective length.
For statically indeterminate members, MoEd is determined for the actual boundary conditions, 
whereas M2 will depend on boundary conditions via the effective length.
The effect of imperfection may be represented by an eccentricity in mm
15
800
ol
e 

Limited to 50 mm.
lo is the height of pier in mm.
(2)	
Differing first order end moments M01 and M02 may be replaced by an equivalent first order 
end moment Moe:
	
M0e=0.6 M02 +0.4M01 ≥ 0.4 M02
Eq. 11.5
	
M01 and M02 should have the same sign if they give tension on the same side, otherwise 
opposite signs. Furthermore, | M02 | ≥ | M01 |.
	
Eq. 11.5 is applicable only to the braced member and also when no transverse load is applied 
within the height of the member. Further the first order moment due to imperfections shall 
be added to the equivalent first order moment to get total first order moment in the middle 
of the member.
	
M0Ed = M0e+ moment due to imperfections
(3)	
The nominal second order moment M2 in Eq.11.4 is
	
M2 = NEd .e2

SECTION 12
SERVICEABILITY LIMIT STATE
12.1	
General
(1)	
In order to verify that the structure and structural elements perform adequately during 
service life. The serviceability limit states shall have to be satisfied. The serviceability limit 
states are:-
	
-	
Stress level
	
-	
Crack width
	
-	
Deflection
	
Other limit states such as vibration may be of importance in a particular structure, but are 
not covered in this Section.
(2)	
In calculation of stresses and deflection, the cross-section shall be assumed as uncracked 
provided tensile stress in concrete does not exceed fctm or fctm.fl and calculation of minimum 
tension reinforcement is also based on the same value of fctm or fctm.fl .Where tensile stresses 
exceed fctm or fctm.fl cross-section shall be considered as cracked.
12.2	
Stress Limitation
12.2.1	
Allowable compressive stress in concrete
(1)	
Maximum compressive stress in concrete under rare combinations of loads shall be limited 
to 0.48 fck, in order to keep the longitudinal cracks, micro cracks or creep within acceptable 
limits.
(2)	
Where compressive stress in concrete under quasi-permanent loads is within 0.36 fcm(t0), 
linear creep may be assumed. In case compressive stress exceeds 0.36 fcm(t0), non-linear 
creep shall be considered. For stress level in the range of 0.36 fcm(t0) < σc ≤ 0.48fcm(t0), non-
linear creep may be taken into account using the following equation:
	
φσ (t,t0) = φ (t,t0) exp [1.5 (kσ –0.36)] for 0.36 <kσ≤ 0.48
	
φσ (t,t0) is the non-linear creep coefficient.

12.3	
Limit State of Cracking
12.3.1	
General
Cracking takes place in tensile regions of concrete structures due to load effects, such as bending, 
shear, torsion and direct tension. Cracks may also be caused due to internal deformations such as 
shrinkage and temperature effects. The intent of the following provisions is to ensure, with acceptable 
probability, that the cracks will not impair the proper functioning or durability of the structure or cause 
its appearance to be unacceptable. Cracks due to other effects such as expansive chemical reactions 
need to be controlled by measures given under Section 14.
12.3.2	
Limiting crack width
(1)	
Due to the random nature of the cracking phenomenon, actual crack width cannot be predicted. 
However, a reasonable estimation of crack width can be made using the mathematical 
model given in Clause 12.3.4. The crack width, so calculated, shall be restricted to the 
values given in Table 12.1 for various conditions of exposure. The decompression limit 
check requires that no tensile stresses occur within 100mm of the surface of duct for bonded 
prestressing tendons.
	
This provision of 100 mm is not a cover requirement for prestressing duct, for which 
provision has been made in clause 14.3.2.1. In case the duct is closer than 100 mm to 
concrete surface the concrete within the cover portion shall be in compression.

The condition of exposure considered applies to the most severe exposure the surface will be subjected to in service.
(2)	
For moderate exposure class, crack width has no influence on durability and this limit is set to guarantee acceptable 
appearance.
(3)	
For these conditions of exposure, in addition, decompression should be checked under the quasi-permanent 
combination of loads that include DL+ SIDL + Prestress including secondary effect + settlement + temperature 
effects.
(4)	
0.2 applies to the parts of the member that do not have to be checked for decompression.
(2)	
For the crack width checks under combinations which include temperature distribution, the 
resulting member forces should be calculated using gross section concrete properties. The 
effect of self-equilibrating thermal stresses within a section may be ignored.

(3)	
For members with only unbonded tendons, requirements for reinforced concrete elements 
apply. For members with a combination of bonded and unbonded tendons, requirements for 
prestressed concrete members with bonded tendons apply.
(4)	
Crack width may be calculated according to Clause 12.3.4. Alternatively, limiting maximum 
bar size or spacing as per Clause 12.3.6 may be deemed to satisfy crack control criteria for 
reinforced concrete members.
12.3.3	
Minimum reinforcement for crack control
(1)	
A minimum amount of untensioned reinforcement is required to control cracking in areas 
where tension due to external loadings or external restraints is expected. The amount of such 
reinforcement may be estimated from equilibrium between the tensile force in concrete just 
before cracking and tensile force in steel at yielding.
(2)	
Minimum area of reinforcement may be calculated as follows. In profiled cross sections like 
T-beams and box girders, minimum reinforcement should be determined for the individual 
parts of the section (webs, flanges).
	
As.min σs=kc k fct, eff Act
Eq 12.1
	
where
	
As,min	 is the minimum area of reinforcing steel within the tensile zone 
	
Act	
is the area of concrete within tensile zone. The tensile zone is that part of the section 
which is calculated to be in tension just before formation of the first crack.
In the flanged cross sections such as T-beams and box girders the division into parts should 
be as indicated in Fig. 12.1.

the reinforcement, fyk. A lower value may, however, be needed to satisfy the crack

cracks may first be expected to occur fct.eff = fctm or lower, fctm(t), if the minimum area

greater of 2.9 MPa or fctm (t).

In prestressed members, no minimum reinforcement is required in sections where the

of prestress.
	
However minimum reinforcement for other considerations such as, early thermal and 
shrinkage cracking, prior to application of prestressing, shall be provided as per Section 16.

Calculation of crack width
(1)	
Crack width varies between the reinforcement bars depending upon the spacing of the bars. 
The crack width, Wk, may be calculated from Eq.12.5.
	
Due account should also be taken of the effects of restrained thermal and shrinkage effects.
	
Wk = Sr, max (εsm - εcm)
Eq 12.5
Where
	
sr, max	 is the maximum crack spacing (Refer Eq.12.8, 12.11 or 12.12)
	
εsm	
is the mean strain in the reinforcement under the relevant combination of loads, 
including the effect of imposed deformations, restrained thermal and shrinkage effects 
and taking into account the effects of tension stiffening. For prestressed members 
only the additional tensile strain beyond the state of zero strain of the concrete at the 
same level is considered
	
εcm

(2) 	
The larger tensile principal stress in the web σ1 is compared with the corresponding strength 
fctb obtained from Eq. 12.14.
	
If σ1 < fctb , the minimum reinforcement in accordance with Clause 12.3.3 should be provided 
in the longitudinal direction.
	
If σ1 ≥ fctb, the crack width should be controlled in accordance with Clause 12.3.6 or 
alternatively calculated and verified in accordance with Clause 12.3.4 taking into account 
the angle of deviation between the principal stress and reinforcement directions.
12.3.6	
Control of cracking without direct calculation
(1)	
The rules given in Section 12.3.4 may be presented in tabular form by restricting the bar 
diameter or spacing as a simplification.
(2)	
Table 12.2 gives maximum bar diameter subjected to different stress levels of steel under 
relevant combination of load for which crack width is to be controlled. Table 12.3 gives the 
maximum spacing of bars in mm for two crack widths for similar condition.
(3)	
The values in the tables are based on the following assumptions:
	
c=40mm; fct.eff =2.8 MPa; hcr = 0.5; (h-d) = 0.1h; k1=0.8; k2=0.5; kt=0.5 and k=1.0
(4)	
Where the minimum reinforcement given by Clause 12.3.3 is provided, crack widths are 
unlikely to be excessive if:
	
-	
for cracking dominantly caused by restraint, the bar sizes given in Table 12.2 are not 
exceeded where the steel stress is the value obtained immediately after cracking (i.e 
σs in Eq. 12.1).
	
-	
for cracks caused mainly by loading, either the provisions of Table 12.2 or Table 
12.3 shall be complied with. The steel stress should be calculated on the basis of a 
cracked section under the relevant combination of actions.
(5)	
For pre-tensioned concrete, where crack control is mainly provided by tendons with direct 
bond, Table 12.2 or Table 12.3 may be used with a stress equal to the total stress minus 
prestress.
(6)	
For post-tensioned concrete, where crack control is provided mainly by untensioned 
reinforcement, the tables may be used with the stress in this reinforcement calculated with 
the effect of prestressing forces included.

Note: Table 12.2 and 12.3 are applicable for circular section also.
(7)	
It should be noted that there are particular risks of large cracks occurring in locations where 
there are sudden changes of stress, e.g.
	
-	
at changes of section
	
-	
near concentrated loads
	
-	
at positions where bars are curtailed
	
-	
at areas of high bond stress, particularly at the ends of laps
	
Care should be taken at such locations to minimize the stress changes wherever possible. 
However, the rules for crack control given above will normally ensure adequate control 
at these points provided that the rules for detailing reinforcement given in Section 16 are 
complied with.

Limit State of Deflection
12.4.1	
General
Cable supported bridges are not in the purview of this Code, for which specialist literature may be 
followed.
(1)	
The deflections/deformations of a member or structure shall not be such that it adversely 
affects its proper functioning or appearance. In some cases, expected deflections may need 
to be adjusted in the structural geometry by pre-cambering, so as to attain the requisite 
profile at the time of placing expansion joints and wearing course.
(2)	
Appropriate limiting values of deflection taking into account the nature of the structure, 
bridge deck furniture and functional needs of the bridge, should be established. In the 
absence of other criteria, the following deflection limits for live load under frequent load 
combination may be considered.
Vehicular

Calculation of deflection due to sustained loads
(1)	
The calculation method adopted shall represent the true behaviour of the structure under 
relevant actions with accuracy appropriate to the objectives of the calculation. In case 
of cracked members, appropriate value of cracked moment of inertia shall be used. If, 
actual value of cracked moment of inertia cannot be determined, it may be taken equal to 
70 percent of uncracked moment of inertia. For uncracked members such as prestressed 
concrete members, fully under compression, uncracked moment of inertia may be used.

For loads with long enough duration to cause creep, the total deformation including creep 
may be calculated by using an effective modulus of elasticity for concrete according to

SECTION 13
PRESTRESSING SYSTEMS
13.1	
General
This Section covers requirements of the parts of prestressing systems which are incorporated in the 
structure. Prestressing systems manufactured by specialist manufacturers shall be compatible with the 
standard prestressing wires/strands covered in Section 6. The stressing equipment, de-stressing/re-
stressing facilities, and grouting arrangements shall be compatible with the tendons.
13.2	
Anchorages for Post Tensioning Systems
13.2.1	
Anchorages to be used
Following types of anchorages normally used in bridges shall meet the minimum requirements given 
in this Section.
(1)	
Anchorages partially or fully embedded in concrete in which the prestressing force is 
transferred within the body of the prestressed element by combination of bearing, friction 
and wedge action.
(2)	
Externally mounted anchorages which transfer prestressing force of tendons to concrete 
through a bearing plate which is externally mounted.
13.2.2	
Minimum requirements of anchorage capacity
(1)	
The anchorage device should be capable of holding and transferring force of not less than 
95 percent of the actual mean tensile ultimate strength of the tendons it is expected to hold, 
without failure of any of the parts of the anchorage-tendon assembly.
(2)	
The anchorage tendon assembly shall be capable of withstanding not less than two million 
cycles of fatigue load varying between 60 percent to 65 percent of nominal UTS of tendons 
it is expected to hold, without suffering more than 5 percent breakage of wires/ strands at 
the load frequency of not more than 500 cycles per minute.
13.2.3	
Load transfer to concrete element through end block
The end block is the portion of the concrete element through which the concentrated load applied at 
anchorages is transmitted to the whole cross section of the element. The concrete and the reinforcement 
in this region shall be designed to transfer load not less than 110 percent of nominal UTS of tendons it 
is expected to hold. The crack width shall not exceed 0.25 mm at 80 percent of UTS.
13.2.4	
Acceptance tests for anchorage-tendon assembly

111
13.3	
Mechanical Couplers
Mechanical couplers of fixed or movable type are devices in which individual lengths of tendons 
are anchored in two collinear directions to form one continuous tendon. The couplers shall meet the 
requirements of strength of individual anchorages as specified in Clause 13.2, and be able to transfer 
full force of tendon from one to another. The anchorage and stressing of second tendon should not 
disturb the anchorage of the first tendon in case of fixed couplers.
13.4	
Sheathing Ducts and Joints
The sheathing ducts shall be either in mild steel as per Clause 13.4.2 or in HDPE as per Clause 13.4.3. 
They shall be in as long lengths as practicable from handling and transportation considerations without 
getting damaged. The internal joints of the duct lengths shall be watertight when bent to the minimum 
radius of bending required in the structure as specified in Clause 13.4.1 (2).
13.4.1	
Common requirements of joints of sheathing
(1)	
The ducts lengths shall be joined by adopting any one or more of the following methods 
as convenient to suit the individual requirements of the location, subject to satisfactory 
pressure tests, before adoption.
	
-	
Using corrugated threaded sleeve couplers which can be tightly screwed to the outside 
of the sheathing ducts.
	
-	
Integrating the two ends by welding using electric roaster machine or mirror machine.
	
-	
Using heat shrink couplers.
(2)	
The sheathing ducts and connections should be fully leak-tight against water pressure 
equivalent to 1.1 x (maximum expected gravity head of grouting material + grouting 
pressure). The joints should also be leak-tight and pressure resistant for above pressure.
(3)	
External tendons shall be housed in either High Density Poly- Ethylene (HDPE) sheaths 
or metallic steel sheaths (plain or with protective coatings), which have smooth internal 
surfaces.
(4)	
Special precautions are required in the case of joints particularly in precast segmental 
construction. Leakages as well as interconnections between ducts, should be avoided. Duct 
spacing should be detailed in such a way that there is sufficient concrete between parallel 
ducts to prevent interconnections during grouting operations and to comply with relevant 
IRC codes.
	
As a general rule, the joints of precast segmental construction are treated with epoxy resin, 
if internal grouted tendons are used. The epoxy resin seals the joint and prevents grout 
leaking through and out of the segment joint. However there is a possibility that epoxy 
may be squeezed into adjacent ducts, when the segments are pressed together, causing 
blockages. To prevent this, generally a compressible foam seal is provided in the segment 
joint around the duct, and the excess is scraped out with plastic or rubber scrapers before 
the epoxy sets. Also the leak tightness of internal prestressing tendons can be improved by 
the use of rubber rings around the ducts at the joints between segments. Before casting of 
the segment, steel rings are placed around the ducts, leaving an imprint of half the thickness 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
112
of the rubber rings. The rubber rings are placed in this recess, and are compressed when the 
temporary prestressing is applied.
	
However, jointing with encapsulation is the preferable option and system suppliers may be 
having their own method of doing so.
13.4.2	
M.S. sheathing ducts
(1)	
Unless otherwise specified, the material shall be Cold Rolled Cold Annealed (CRCA) Mild 
Steel intended for mechanical treatment and surface refining but not for quench hardening 
or tempering.
(2)	
The material shall be clean and free from rust and normally of bright metal finish. However, 
in case of use in aggressive environment galvanised or lead coated mild steel strips shall be 
adopted.
(3)	
The thickness of metal sheathing shall not be less than 0.3 mm, 0.4 mm and 0.5 mm 
for sheathing ducts having internal diameter upto 50 mm, 75 mm and 90 mm and 
above respectively. For larger diameter ducts, thickness of sheathing shall be based on 
recommendations of prestressing system supplier. For some types of M.S. sheathing ducts, 
refer Fig 13.1.
(4)	
The metal sheathing shall conform to the requirements specified in Annexure A5 and a 
test certificate shall be furnished by the manufacturer. The joints of all sheathing shall be 
watertight and conform to provisions specified in Annexure A5.
Fig 13.1 Typical Types of Sheathing Ducts
13.4.3	
Corrugated HDPE sheathing ducts
(1)	
The material for the ducts shall be high density polyethylene with more than 2% carbon 
black to provide resistance to ultraviolet degradation and properties of raw materials shall 
comply with the provisions of Annexure A5.
(2)	
The minimum wall thickness of the duct as manufactured shall be 2.0 mm, 2.5 mm, 
3 mm, and 4 mm for the ducts of internal diameter 50 mm, 85 mm, 100 mm and 125 mm 
respectively. Linear interpolation may be done for any intermediate values.
	
Tolerance for duct diameter is ±1% or ± 1 mm, whichever is greater. Tolerance for wall 
thickness shall be -0/+0.5 mm. 
(3)	
For internally bonded tendons, the ducts shall be corrugated on both sides.The ducts shall 
transmit full tendon strength from the tendon to the surrounding concrete over a length not 



======================================================================
PAGE 123 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
113
greater than 40 times duct diameter. For some of the types of corrugated HDPE sheathing 
ducts, refer Fig. 13.1.
(4)	
Minimum internal diameter of the HDPE duct shall not be less than 3 times the cross-
sectional area of the tendon which can be fitted in the anchorage system used. However, in 
case of threading of tendons after concreting for spans larger than 30 m, internal diameter of 
duct shall be 5 mm larger than the requirement stated above, in order to facilitate threading.
13.5	
Anchorage Block Design and Detailing
Requirements given in this clause are in addition to those given in Clause 16.14 on detailing. The 
overall design of the end block shall take into account the stress distribution based on elastic distribution 
of forces in uncracked section and suitable reinforcement shall be provided to take up the tensions 
respecting the crack width limitations. The bursting forces in the end blocks, should be assessed on the 
basis of the ultimate tensile strength.

Individual Square End Block
The bursting tensile force, Fbst existing in an individual square end block loaded by a

When circular anchorages or bearing plates are used, the side of the equivalent square area

Pk = is the load in the tendon
Fbst = is the bursting tensile force.
This force, Fbst will be distributed in a region extending from 0.2Yo to 2Yo from the loaded 
face of the end block as shown in Fig. 13.2. Reinforcement provided in this region to 
sustain the bursting tensile force may be calculated based on a tensile strength of 0.87 fy 
except that the stress should be limited to a value corresponding to a strain of 0.001 when 
the concrete cover to the reinforcement is less than 50 mm.

Fig. 13.2 Loaded Face of the End Block
(2)	
Rectangular End Block (2Ao x 2Yo)
In the rectangular end blocks, the bursting tensile forces in the two principal directions 
can be assessed on the similar basis as in Table 13.1. The shape of the loaded area of 
anchorage should be taken as a concentric rectangular area having the same shape as the 
end block and the same area as that of actual anchorage. Alternatively, the higher of the two 
reinforcements can be provided in both directions.
13.5.1.2	
Internal (embedded) anchorages
Where the anchorages are embedded in concrete, the concrete behind anchorages is subjected to 
complex tri-axial set of forces where the main compressive thrust is limited to remain below the 
multi-axial compressive capacity and tensions in transverse directions are taken up by suitable 
reinforcement. Although theoretical assessment may be possible, the design and detailing is made as 
per recommendations of the manufacturers of the anchorage system.
13.5.1.3	
Group of anchorages
Where groups of anchorages or bearing plates occur, the end block should be divided into a series of 
symmetrically loaded prisms and each prism treated in the same manner. In detailing the reinforcement 
for the end block as a whole, it is necessary to ensure that the groups of anchorages are appropriately 
tied together. Special attention should be paid to end blocks having a cross-section different in shape 
from that of the general cross-section of the beam and reference should be made to specialist literature. 
Compliance with the above requirements will generally ensure that bursting tensile forces along the 
loaded axis are provided for. In case where large concentrated tendon forces are involved alternative 
methods of design based on specialist literature and manufacturer’s data as per Clause 13.5.3 may be 
more appropriate.

IRC:112-2020

13.5.2	
Spalling reinforcement for post-tensioned tendons
Consideration should also be given to the spalling tensile stresses that occur in end blocks. Where the 
anchorage or bearing plates are highly eccentric, these stresses reach a maximum at the loaded face. The 
end face of anchorage zone shall be continuously reinforced to prevent edge spalling. Reinforcement 
shall be placed as close to the end face as possible.
13.5.3	
Bursting reinforcement for pre-tensioned members
The bursting resistance of pre-tensioned anchorage zone provided by vertical reinforcement in the ends 
of pre-tensioned beams shall be taken as:
	
Pr = fs As
where
fs	
=	 Stress in steel not exceeding 140 MPa
As	
=	 Total area of vertical reinforcement located within the distance h / 5 from the end of the 
beam (mm2).
h	
=	 Overall depth of precast member (mm)
The bursting resistance Pr shall not be less than 4 percent of the prestressing force at transfer.
The end vertical reinforcement shall be as close to the end of the beam as practicable.
13.5.4	
Intermediate Anchorages
13.5.4.1	
General
Intermediate Anchorages are those post tensioned anchorages that are not located at the end surface 
of a member or segment (see fig 13.3). They are usually in the form of embedded anchors, blisters, 
ribs, or recess pockets. In case of intermediate anchorages, tensile stresses may develop behind the 
anchorages. These tensile stresses result from the compatibility of deformations ahead of and behind 
the anchorage. The force of the tendon must be carefully distributed to the flange/web by reinforcement 
in front as well as behind the anchorage. For intermediate anchorages, the anchorage zone shall be 
considered to extend for a distance not less than the transverse dimension of the flange/ web to which 
it is anchored.
13.5.4.2	
Intermediate anchorages shall not be used in regions where tensile stress exceeding 1 MPa 
is generated behind the anchor (upto 1.0x depth of section) from other actions under relevant SLS 
combination. Whenever practical, blisters should be located in the corner between flange and webs or 
shall be extended over the full flange width or web height to form a continuous rib.
If isolated blisters are required to be used in the middle of a flange or web, local shear, bending, 
and direct force effects, shall be adequately considered in the design. For flange/web thickness up to 
225mm, an upper limit of force equivalent to12 strands of 12.7mm diameter shall be adhered to for 
tendons anchored in intermediate blisters supported only by the flange or web.

IRC:112-2020

13.5.4.3	
Tie-back Reinforcement
Tie-back reinforcement is the one required to take care of the tensile stresses indicated in 13.5.4.1. For 
this purpose bonded reinforcement shall be provided to tie-back at least 25 percent of the unfactored 
intermediate anchorage stressing force into the concrete section behind the anchorage. Stresses in this 
bonded reinforcement shall not exceed 240 MPa. The anchorage force of the tendon must be carefully 
distributed to the main structure by reinforcement.
If permanent compressive stresses are generated behind the anchor from other actions, the amount of 
tie-back reinforcement may be reduced using the following equation
Tia = 0.25 Ps - fcb Acb
where:
Tia = the tie-back tension force at the intermediate anchorage (N)
Ps = the maximum unfactored anchorage stressing force (N) transmitted to the anchor plate
fcb = the unfactored compressive stress in the region behind the anchor (MPa) due to permanent load
Acb = the area of the continuing cross-section within the extensions of the sides of the anchor plate or 
blister, i.e., the area of the blister or rib shall not be taken as part of the cross-section (mm2)
The tie-back reinforcement shall be concentrated within one anchor plate on either side of the tendon 
axis. It shall be fully anchored so that the yield strength can be developed at a distance of one plate 
width or half the length of the blister or rib ahead of the anchor as well as at the same distance behind 
the anchor. The centroid of this reinforcement shall coincide with the tendon axis, as far as possible. 
For blisters and ribs, the reinforcement shall be placed in the continuing section near that face of the 
flange or web from which the blister or rib is projecting.
13.5.4.4	
Blister and Rib Reinforcement
Reinforcement shall be provided throughout the blisters or ribs as required for shear friction, corbel 
action, bursting forces, and deviation forces due to tendon curvature. This reinforcement shall extend 
into the flange or web and be developed by standard hooks bent around transverse bars or equivalent. 
Spacing shall not exceed the smallest of blister or rib height at anchor, blister width, or 150 mm, 
whichever is less. Reinforcement shall be provided to resist local bending in blisters and ribs due to 
eccentricity of the tendon force and to resist lateral bending in ribs due to tendon deviation forces. This 
reinforcement is normally provided in the form of ties or U-stirrups, which encase the anchorage and 
tie it effectively into the adjacent web and flange.
Reinforcement, as specified in earlier clauses of this Section shall be provided to resist tensile forces 
due to transfer of the anchorage force from the blister or rib into the overall structure.
13.5.4.5	
Precast Segmental Constructions
In the case of precast segmental structure, it is not feasible to provide continuing reinforcement over the 
segment joints to take care of the stresses indicated in 13.5.4.1. In such cases, adequate compression, 
behind the intermediate anchorages, through prestressing, shall be ensured to take care of these effects 
in accordance with 15.3.2.1 (6).

Protective Grouting
(1)	
Post tensioned tendons shall be bonded to concrete of the prestressed member as well as 
protected from corrosion by cement grout which shall fill the ducts fully, without leaving 
any entrapped air or water pockets, voids created by evaporation of excess water in the 
grout and bleeding.
(2)	
Unbonded tendons placed either in ducts embedded in concrete or externally located shall 
be protected from corrosion by suitable fillers. Grouting by cement, wax, nuclear grade (low 
sulphur) grease are some of the options. For materials other than cement or such long life 
permanent materials, arrangements for inspection and refilling or replacement of grouting 
materials shall be made. Factory made coated wires/strands embedded in polyethylene 
ducts with suitable fill are acceptable. Manufacturer’s recommendations shall be followed 
for the specialist materials and techniques.
13.7	
Protection of Post Tensioned Tendons and Anchorages
In order to achieve a durable post-tensioning system, matching with the design service life of the 
structure, suitable corrosion protection of the post-tensioning system, is necessary.
The corrosion protection system shall take into account:
(a)	
Temporary protection of the tendons, ducts, anchorages and all accessories from 
manufacturer handling storage, transport till incorporation in the structure.
(b)	
Semi-permanent protection of the system in situations where the tendons and anchorages 
are exposed to atmosphere for an extended period of time.
(c)	
Permanent protection of prestressing system applied either at the factory or at site shall be 
according to service environment. Special care is warranted since most parts of the tendon 
or other component are generally not accessible during service life.

SECTION 14
DURABILITY
14.1	
General
This Section covers design for durability and suggests provisions to ensure that adequate durability is 
achieved.
The structure shall be designed such that deterioration over its design service life does not impair the 
performance of the structure below that intended, having due regard to the service environment and the 
anticipated level of maintenance.
One of the main characteristics influencing the durability of concrete is its permeability to the ingress of 
water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, chloride, sulphate and other potentially deleterious substances. Degree 
of permeability is governed by the constituents, the mix proportions and workmanship used in making 
concrete. A suitably low permeability can be achieved by having adequate cement content, low water 
cement ratio and ensuring complete compaction of the concrete followed by adequate curing. Use of 
blended cements will also help to achieve low permeability.
The factors influencing durability of concrete include:
(1)	
The environment,
(2)	
The cover to embedded steel,
(3)	
The type and quality of constituent materials,
(4)	
The cement content and water/cement ratio,
(5)	
Workmanship, to obtain full compaction and efficient curing and
(6)	
The shape and size of the member.
14.2	
Common Mechanisms Leading to the Deterioration of Concrete Structures
Common mechanisms of deterioration of concrete structures in service are:
(1)	
Corrosion of reinforcement/prestressing tendons
(2)	
Frost attack
(3)	
Alkali-aggregate reactions
(4)	
Attack from sulphates
(5)	
Attack by aggressive chemicals
(6)	
Acid attack and
(7)	
Abrasion
Description of the mechanisms is given in Annexure B-2.
14.3	
Design for Durability
Basic steps in designing for durability are:
(1)	
To establish the aggressiveness of the service environment (exposure condition), with 
respect to the various mechanisms of deterioration. Different components of the structure 
can be exposed to different service environments.



======================================================================

(2)	
To select the type of structure suitable for the service environment.
(3)	
To select the appropriate materials, mix proportions, workmanship, design and detailing, 
including minimum cover to steel.
14.3.1	
Classification of exposure conditions
The general environment to which the concrete structure will be exposed during its service life is 
classified into four levels of severity. In doing so, it is possible that the classification relates to specific 
mechanisms of deterioration. The relative importance of the various mechanisms will vary from 
region to region in a country and no generally applicable ordering of the mechanisms can be made. 
However, there seems no doubt that the commonest and most serious form of degradation worldwide 
is corrosion of reinforcement. It can also be stated that, of the two initiating mechanisms for corrosion 
viz. - carbonation and chlorides; chlorides have caused the greater amount of damage by far. The 
classification in Table 14.1 caters essentially to corrosion of steel in concrete.
Table 14.1 Classification of Service Environment
Sl. No
Environment 
Exposure Conditions
(1)
Moderate
Concrete dry or permanently wet; concrete continuously under water; low 
humidity (Relative humidity < 50 %); humid (Relative humidity > 70 %)
(2)
Severe 
Wet, rarely dry; moderate humidity (relative humidity ≥ 50 % and ≤ 70 %), 
completely submerged in sea water below mid-tide level; concrete exposed 
to coastal environment.
(3)
Very severe
Concrete exposed to air-borne chloride in marine environment; freezing 
conditions while wet.
(4)
Extreme
Cyclic wet and dry, concrete exposed to tidal, splash and spray zones in sea, 
concrete in direct contact with aggressive sub-soil/ground water, concrete 
in contact with aggressive chemicals.
Note:	 Relative Humidity is as defined in note No.(3) below Table 6.9
14.3.2	
Durability provisions
14.3.2.1	
Concrete mix proportions and cover
Presence of moisture is necessary for most of the deleterious actions to proceed and low permeability 
of concrete is a prerequisite for durability. Greater impermeability is achieved primarily by the control 
of water/cement ratio and selection of the cement type.
The water/cement ratio governs the strength of concrete, and strength classes are accordingly chosen, 
as an indirect control on these parameters.
Cover (or clear cover) is the distance from the concrete surface to the surface of the nearest reinforcement, 
including links, stirrups and surface reinforcement. Cover is more important from the consideration 
of corrosion of steel in concrete. The cover should at least be equal to the depth of likely chloride 
ingress by diffusion over a time period equal to the design service life. Chloride diffusion coefficient 
in concrete depends upon the water/cement ratio and the cement type; it is lower for blended cements, 
and lower water/cement ratios. It is possible to select combinations of the water cement ratio and cover

thickness to achieve the objective. However, the selection of cover should also take into account other 
structural aspects like safe transmission of bond forces and control of crack width.
Taking these considerations into account, the requirements of concrete mix properties and cover for 
different exposure conditions considered in Table 14.1, for 20 mm size aggregate are given in Table 
14.2.

Notes.
(1)	
All four recommendations given in the Table for a particular exposure condition, shall be satisfied.
(2)	
For post tensioned tendons, the minimum clear cover measured from the outside of the sheathing shall be 
75 mm.
(3)	
For pre-tensioned tendons, minimum cover shall be 65 mm.
(4)	
Minimum cover shown in Table 14.2 can be reduced by 5 mm in case of factory made precast concrete 
elements, high performance concrete, use of stainless steel reinforcement, or controlled permeability 
formwork (refer Clause 14.4.1). In case more than one of the above measures are adopted the reduction 
should not exceed 10 mm.
(5)	
The term cement for maximum w/c ratio and minimum cement content in Table 14.2 includes all cementitious 
materials inclusive of additions mentioned in Clause 18.4.
(6)	
For plain cement concrete, with or without surface reinforcement, the minimum grade of concrete can be 
lowered by 5 MPa and maximum water/cement ratio exceeded by 0.05.
(7)	
For all foundations and elements below ground level minimum cover shall be 75 mm.
(8)	
For design service life of 50 years or less, the minimum cover can be reduced by 5 mm.
14.3.2.2	
Adjustments for other aggregate sizes
For aggregate sizes other than 20 mm, the minimum cement content shown in Table 14.2 shall be 
adjusted as per Table 14.3.

14.3.2.3	
Chloride content
All constituents of concrete, viz. cement, aggregate, water, chemical admixture and mineral admixture, 
may contain chlorides. Concrete may be contaminated by diffusion of chlorides from the external 
environment. Total acid soluble chloride content in the concrete mix, expressed as chloride ions, shall 
not exceed the following values by mass of cementations material. 
Prestressed concrete
-
0.10 percent
Reinforced concrete (in severe, very severe or extreme 
exposure conditions)
-
0.20 percent
Reinforced concrete in moderate exposure conditions
-
0.30 percent
14.3.2.4	
Sulphate content
Sulphates are present in cements, in some aggregates and mix water. They can also be imbibed from the 
service environment e.g. coastal environment. The total water-soluble sulphate content of the concrete 
mix, expressed as SO3, shall not exceed 4 percent by mass of cement in the mix.
14.3.2.5	
Maximum cement content
Cement content (excluding fly ash, GGBS or Silica Fume) shall not exceed 450 kg/m3.
14.4	
Additional Provisions for Specific Mechanisms of Deterioration
Some additional provisions for different mechanisms of deterioration are given below.
14.4.1	
Corrosion of reinforcement
The normal way to design against corrosion is to ensure that there is an adequate cover to the 
reinforcement and that the concrete in the cover region is of a high quality and is well cured. In extreme 
environments, however, there are other measures which may have to be adopted, such as:
(1)	
Use of galvanized reinforcement or reinforcement with fusion bonded epoxy coating.
(2)	
Use of surface coatings to the concrete to inhibit the ingress of chlorides or carbon dioxide. 
Such coatings need periodic renewal.
(3)	
Use of waterproofing membrane over the bridge deck.
(4)	
Use of controlled permeability formwork (CPF) liners, which effectively reduce the water-
cement ratio of cover concrete and reduce the chloride diffusion into the concrete.
(5)	
Application of cathodic protection to the structure.
(6)	
Use of stainless steel reinforcement.
One major factor in the avoidance of corrosion problems is the form of the structure. Areas of exposed 
concrete on which water can stand or can drain across, are particularly at risk.

Portland Slag Cement, SRPC: Sulphate Resisting Portland Cement.
(iii)	
Where chloride is encountered along with sulphates in soil, ground water or in ambient air, ordinary 
portland cement with C3A content from 5 to 8 percent shall be desirable to be used in concrete 
instead of sulphate resisting cement.

Alkali – silica reaction
The alkali-silica reaction can be alleviated by the following methods:-
(1)	
Use of aggregates which have been found to perform satisfactorily in practice,
(2)	
Use of non-reactive aggregate from alternate sources,
(3)	
Use of low-alkali OPC having total alkali content not more than 0.6 percent (Na2O 
equivalent). Further advantage can be obtained by use of fly ash, ground granulated blast 
furnace slag or silica fume as part replacement of low alkali OPC. In such cases, fly ash 
content should be at least 20 percent or slag content at least 50 percent,
(4)	
Measures to reduce the degree of saturation of concrete during service such as use of 
impermeable membranes,
(5)	
Limiting the cement content of the concrete mix and thereby limiting total alkali content in 
the concrete mix,
For more guidance, specialist literature may be referred.
14.4.4	
Frost attack
Frost damage can be avoided by the following methods:-
(1)	
Protecting the concrete from saturation.
(2)	
Using an air-entrained concrete mix. The small bubbles of entrained air within the matrix 
can provide pressure relief. The minimum amount of entrained air should be 3.5 percent 
for 20 mm size aggregate, and greater for smaller sizes. Air-entraining admixture should 
conform to IS 9103.
(3)	
Using high-strength concrete, with compressive strength of 45 MPa or more.

Where fyd is design ultimate stress = fy /1.15.
	
Values for k for different grades of concrete and steel are given in Table 15.4.

Anchorage of links and shear reinforcement
	
(a)	
The anchorage of links and shear reinforcement shall normally be achieved by means 
of hooks, bends or by welded transverse reinforcement. For hooked or bent bar, a 
transverse bar of same or larger dia should be provided inside hook or bend.
	
(b)	
For the permissible curvature of hooks and bends, see Table 15.2.
	
(c)	
The anchorage as a whole is considered to be satisfactory, where either (i) or (ii) 
below is satisfied.

Splices of bars by laps
(1)	
Arrangement of lapped splices
	
(a)	
As far as possible:
	
-	
Laps should not be located in areas of high stress
	
-	
Laps shall be staggered.
	
-	
Exceptions are however allowed under conditions as described in item (e) & (f).
	
(b)	
The clear space between the two lapped bars in a splice should not be greater than 4φ 
or 50 mm as indicated in Fig. 15.4 (a); otherwise the lap length should be increased 
by a length equal to the clear space where it exceeds 4φ.
	
(c)	
For adjacent laps, the clear longitudinal distance between two laps and transverse 
distance between bars be as indicated in Fig. 15.4 (b).
	
(d)	
Transverse reinforcement as given in Clause 15.2.5.1.3 shall be provided for avoiding 
spalling or cracking of concrete.
	
(e)	
Where provisions of (b) above are satisfied and the bars are all in one layer, 100 
percent lapping of bars in tension at one section may be permitted for HYSD bars 
only. Where bars are in several layers the percentage should be reduced to 50 percent.
	
(f)	
All bars in compression and secondary (distribution) reinforcement may be lapped at 
one section except where ductile detailing is required.

If the diameter of the lapped bars is less than 20 mm, or if the area of lapped bars in any 
one section is less than 25 percent of total area of bars at that section, then the minimum 
transverse reinforcement provided for other reasons (e.g. shear reinforcement, distribution 
bars) is considered as sufficient.
(b)	
If φ ≥ 20 mm, then the total transverse reinforcement should be placed between the 
longitudinal reinforcement and the concrete surface, and have a total area [sum of all steel 
placed in parallel plane to the layer of the spliced reinforcement, (Fig. 15.5)], of not less 
than the area As of one spliced bar (∑Ast ≥1.0 As).

Splicing by welding
Welded joints may be used subject to the following :
(1)	
Welding of Fe 240 grade bars conforming to IS 432 shall be permitted. Welding of other 
grades of bars shown in Table 6.1 is generally not recommended except in special cases 
mentioned in (8) below.
(2)	
In special cases the HSD bars conforming to IS 1786 may be welded after confirming 
that the equivalent carbon percentage calculated from the chemical compositions as given 
below are within the limitations of CE mentioned below:
	
For guaranteed weldability, the Carbon Equivalent, CE using the formula:

 shall not be more than 0.42 percent.
	
Reinforcement bars/wires with carbon equivalent above 0.42 percent should, however 
be welded with precaution. Use of low hydrogen basic coated electrodes with matching 
strength bars/wires is recommended.
(3)	
Welding shall conform to IS 2751 and IS 9417 except as provided herein.
(4)	
Generally, shop welding in controlled conditions is to be preferred, where feasible. Site 
welding where necessary shall, however, be permitted when the facilities, equipment, 
process, consumables, operators, welding procedure are adequate to produce and maintain 
uniform quality at par with that attainable in shop welding to the satisfaction of the engineer.
(5)	
Welding may be carried out by metal arc welding process. Oxyacetylene welding shall not 
be permitted. Any other process may be used subject to the approval of the engineer and 
necessary additional requirements to ensure satisfactory joint performance. Precautions on 
over heating, choice of electrode, selection of correct current in arc welding etc., should be 
strictly observed.
(6)	
All bars shall be butt welded except for smaller diameter bars with diameter of less than 20 
mm which may be lap welded. Single-V or Double-V butt joints may generally be used. For 
vertical bars single bevel or double bevel butt joints may be used.
(7)	
Welded joints shall be located well away from bends and not less than twice the bar diameter 
away from a bend.
(8)	
Joint welding procedures which are to be employed shall invariably be established by 
a procedure specification and shall be qualified prior to use by tests as prescribed in IS 
2751. All welders and welding operators to be employed shall have to be qualified by tests 
prescribed in IS 2751. Inspection of welds shall conform to IS 822 and destructive or non-
destructive testing may be undertaken when deemed necessary. Joints with weld defects 
detected by visual inspection or dimensional inspection shall not be accepted.
15.2.5.3	
Splicing by mechanical devices
(1)	
Bars may be spliced with mechanical devices, e.g. by special grade steel sleeves swaged on 
to the bars in end to end contact or by threaded couplers. A mechanical splice including its 
connecting elements shall develop, in tension or compression, at least 125 per cent of the 
characteristic strength fy.
	
(a)	
For established systems the design shall be based on manufacturer’s test certificate 
of ultimate strength with appropriate safety factor to be selected by the designer. In 
addition, field testing on selected samples from actual supply at site shall be carried 
out, both for acceptance and as quality control tool.
	
(b)	
For new systems acceptance testing shall be carried out in laboratories. In addition, 
field testing on selected samples from actual supply at site shall be carried out, both 
for acceptance and as quality control tool.

At location of mechanical splices reduction in minimum cover may be accepted but should 
not be less than 30 mm.
15.2.6	
Additional rules for high yield steel deformed (HYSD) bars exceeding 32 mm in diameter
15.2.6.1	
General
(1)	
The rules given below are complementary to those given in Clause 15.2.3.
(2)	
Splicing by lapped joints shall not be used either for tension or compression bars.
(3)	
Bars of φ>32 mm shall be used only in elements whose minimum depth is not less than 15 
times, the diameter of the bar.
(4)	
When large bars are used, adequate crack control shall be ensured either by using 
surface reinforcement as per Clause 16.3.4(3), or by calculation as per Section 12.
(5)	
Splitting forces are higher and dowel action is greater with the use of large diameter bars. 
Such bars should be anchored with mechanical devices. As an alternative they may be 
anchored as straight bars, but links should be provided as confining reinforcement.
(6)	
Generally large diameter bars should not be lapped. Exceptions include sections with a 
minimum dimension 1.0 m or where the stress in steel is not greater than 80 percent of the 
design ultimate strength.
(7)	
Transverse reinforcement, additional to that for shear, should be provided in the anchorage 
zones where transverse compression is not present.
(8)	
For straight anchorage lengths (see Fig. 15.6 for the notation used) the additional 
reinforcement referred to in (7) above should not be less than the following:
	
- in the direction parallel to the tension face:
	
Ash = 0.25 As.n1
Eq. 15.4
	
- in the direction perpendicular to the tension face:
	
Asv = 0.25 As.n2
Eq. 15.5
	
where
	
AS	is the cross sectional area of an anchored bar,
	
n1	 is the number of layers with bars anchored at the same point in the member
	
n2	 is the number of bars anchored in each layer.
(9)	
The additional transverse reinforcement should be uniformly distributed in the anchorage 
zone and the spacing of bars should not exceed 150 mm.
(10)	
For surface reinforcement provisions of Section (16.5.4) applies.
	
The area of surface reinforcement should not be less than 0.01 Act, eff where Act,eff is the area 
of cover portion outside the stirrups/links.

15.2.7.1	
General

Bundle of same Types of Bars
Unless otherwise stated, the rules for individual bars also apply for bundles of bars. In a 
bundle, all the bars shall be of the same characteristics, type and grade, and preferably of 
same dia. Bars of different diameters can be bundled provided the ratio of diameters does 
not exceed 1.7.
(2)	
Equivalent Diameter
In design, the bundle is replaced by a notional bar having the same sectional area and the 
same centre of gravity as the bundle.
The ‘equivalent diameter’ φn of this notional bar is such that:

portion.
	
-	
Three for all other cases.
(3)	
Use of Equivalent Diameter
For a bundle, provision of Section 15.2.1 applies using the equivalent diameter φn, in 
place of φ. Where two touching bars are positioned one above the other, and where bond 
conditions are favourable, such bars need not be treated as a bundle.
(4)	
Minimum Concrete Cover and Spacing of Bar
The equivalent diameter φn, is taken into account in evaluation of the minimum cover and

actual outside contour of the bundle of bars.
15.2.7.2	
Anchorage of bundled bars
(1)	
Bundles of bars in tension may be curtailed over end and intermediate supports. Bundles 
with an equivalent diameter of less than 32 mm may be curtailed near a support without the 
need for staggering bars. Bundles with an equivalent diameter of equal to or more than 32 
mm which are anchored near a support should be staggered in the longitudinal direction as 
shown in Fig. 15.7.

equivalent diameter ≥32 mm, at least four links having a diameter of ≥12 mm should be 
provided at the ends of the bundle within distance of 0.33 lo. One number of further link 
should be provided just beyond the end of the curtailed bar.

The lap length should be calculated in accordance with Clause 15.2.7.1 using equivalent 
diameter of bar.
(2)	
Bundles which consist of two bars with an equivalent diameter<32 mm may be lapped 
without staggering individual bars. In this case the equivalent bar diameter should be used 
to calculate lo.
(3)	
For bundles which consist of two bars with an equivalent diameter of ≥32 mm, or of three 
bars, individual bars should be staggered in the longitudinal direction by at least 1.3 lo. For

15.3.1	
Arrangement of the prestressing tendons/cable ducts
15.3.1.1	
General
(1)	
The spacing of cable-ducts or pre-tensioned tendons shall be such as to ensure that placing 
and compacting of the concrete can be carried out satisfactorily and good bond can be 
attained between the concrete and tendons/ducts.
(2)	
In case of post tensioned bonded cables, bundles of more than two ducts are not permitted. 
A pair of ducts placed horizontally or vertically touching each other may be permitted only 
in the straight portion of the cable subject to limitations given below and Fig. 15.9.
	
-	
Two cables can be grouped horizontally provided each duct diameter is not more than 
50 mm.
	
-	
Two cables can be grouped vertically provided each duct diameter is not more than 
110 mm.
	
-	
Two cables shall not be bundled over the curved length of cable in the plane of 
curvature.
	
-	
In case of precast segmental construction, grouping of cables is not permitted. The 
minimum clear distance between the ducts shall be greater of 100 mm or the outer 
diameter of the duct.
(3)	
In case of post tensioned bonded cables, the minimum horizontal and vertical clear spacing 
of cables as given in Fig. 15.9 shall be followed for major lengths of the cables.
These requirements can be relaxed locally near transition lengths of the cable, provided the 
minimum clear spacing between the adjacent cables along the line joining the centers of 
two cables is maintained as Min [φduct or 50 mm].
15.3.1.2	
Concrete cover
The concrete cover between the inner surface of the formwork and either a pre-tensioned tendon or a 
duct shall be fixed with due regard to the size of the tendons or of the duct, as well as the durability 
requirements. Minimum cover for pre-tensioned tendons shall be not less than the maximum of the 
diameter of tendon, nominal aggregate size plus 10 mm, and durability requirement as per Clause 
14.3.2.1. The minimum cover for post tensioned ducts shall not be less than 75 mm. Local reduction in 
cover at externally jointed locations of ducts is acceptable.

Anchorages and couplers for prestressing tendons
15.3.2.1	
Post-tensioning systems
(1)	
The anchorage devices used for post-tensioned tendons and the anchorage lengths in the 
case of pre-tensioned tendons shall be such as to enable the full design strength of the 
tendons to be developed.
(2)	
Anchorages for post-tensioned tendons shall meet the requirements of Clause 13.2. The 
specification 13.2.4 are mandatory for new systems. For the established systems, the client/
owner may at his discretion ask for fresh tests to verify the suitability of the system.
(3)	
Where couplers are used, these shall be so placed that they do not adversely affect the 
load carrying capacity of the member and that any temporary anchorage which may be 
needed during construction can be introduced in a satisfactory manner. The requirements 
of minimum concrete cover over couplers and reinforcement for bursting and spalling shall 
be as per the specifications of manufacturers and should be subjected to acceptance tests 
similar to those covered in 13.2.4 for anchorages.
(4)	
In general, couplers should be located away from intermediate supports.
(5)	
The use of couplers for more than on 50 percent of the tendons at any cross-section should 
be avoided.
	
The distance between any two successive sections at which cables are coupled should not 
be closer than 1.5 m. for structural members where depth is less than 2.0 m and not closer 
than 3.0 m. for members of depth greater than 2.0 m.
(6)	
If tendons are anchored at a construction joint or within a concrete member (whether on 
an external rib, within a pocket or entirely inside the member), it should be checked that 
a minimum residual compressive stress of at least 3 MPa is present in the direction of the 
anchored prestressing force, under the frequent load combination. If the minimum residual 
stress is not present, reinforcement should be provided to cater for the local tension beyond 
terminated tendon near the anchor. The check for residual stress is not required if the tendon 
is coupled at the anchorage considered.
(7)	
Anchorage of tendons in top surface of deck shall not be permitted.
(8)	
For tendons anchored in the deck slab and soffit slab, local thickening or blisters shall be so 
provided that minimum cover to anchorage shall not be less than 200 mm.

Anchorage of Tensile Force for the Ultimate Limit State
	
(a)	
The anchorage of tendons should be checked in sections where the concrete tensile 
stress exceeds fctk,0.05. The tendon force should be calculated for a cracked section, 
including the effect of shear according to Section 10.3.3.3(6). Where the concrete 
tensile stress is less than fctk,0.05 no anchorage check is necessary.

Deviators
	
(a)

In the deviation zones the tubes forming the sheaths shall be able to sustain the radial 
pressure and longitudinal movement of the prestressing tendon, without damage and 
without impairing its proper functioning.
	
(c)	
The radius of curvature of the tendon in a deviation zone shall not be less than 40 
times the diameter of wire/strand.
	
(d)	
Designed tendon deviations up to an angle of 0.01 radians may be permitted without 
using a deviator. The forces developed by the change of angle shall be considered in 
design.

Coated Steels
For coated steel, the bond is affected by coating system and the details of manufacture. The following 
values may be used:
(1)	
For fusion bonded epoxy coated high strength deformed steel (HSD) and prestresssing 
tendons, bond values given in previous Sections shall be reduced by 20 percent, and 
anchorage and lap lengths increased by 25 percent.

Length of the longitudinal tension reinforcement and anchorage in tension Zone
The curtailment of longitudinal steel and anchorage of the same in tension zone is done as described 
below with help of Fig. 16.2.

the distance equal to the distance of the bar from the web. (distance x1, x2 in Fig. 16.1).
(7)	
Curtailed reinforcement should be effectively anchored beyond point where it is no longer 
required. The anchorage length (lα) should not be less than larger of distance ‘d’ or lb.net 
where ‘d’ is the effective depth of member and lb.net is calculated as per Eq. 15.2 of Section 
15.
(8)	
The diagram of the resisting tensile forces should lie outside the envelope line of the acting 
tensile force, displaced as described.

(2)	
Surface reinforcement to control cracking in webs should normally be provided in beams 
over 1 m deep. It should be provided in two directions, parallel and orthogonal to main 
tension reinforcement in the beam. The maximum spacing of bars shall be 200 mm. The

(3)	
Where partial fixity occurs along one side of slab, but is not taken into account in the 
analysis, the top reinforcement should be capable of resisting not less than 25 percent of 
the maximum moment in the span. This reinforcement should be provided for length of not

Reinforcement at the free edges
(1)	
Stiffening of unsupported edge 
	
Unsupported slabs carrying vehicular live load (or accidental wheel load) shall be suitably 
stiffened as indicated below:
	
(a)	
Each unsupported edge of a slab parallel to traffic and beyond the clear road width, 
shall be so stiffened as to give a resisting moment for any type of flexure equal to or in 
excess of that of a 500 mm strip of the main roadway slab adjoining the edge. In case 
of a roadway slab of uniform depth, whether the reinforcement is one-way (parallel 
to or across the traffic) or two-way, the maximum resisting moment of the roadway 
slab adjoining the edge and given by a 500 mm strip in any direction shall be taken as 
the criterion for the resisting moment of the stiffened edge. When the roadway slab is 
of varying depth in the direction parallel to the edge concerned, the stiffening at any 
particular point along the length of edge shall be adjusted according to the resisting 
moment of the 500 mm adjacent strip at that particular point.
	
	
Stiffening of edge may consist of a reinforced kerb section, or an edge stiffening 
beam. Where concrete crash barriers are provided over the full length of free edge, 
they may be considered as stiffening beams.
	
(b)	
Unsupported edge along a line across the traffic of a roadway slab (as at the cantilever 
end of a solid slab cantilever bridge) shall be suitably stiffened for a strip of at least 500 
mm width by providing top and bottom reinforcement across the direction of traffic 
in addition to that required for articulation and local strengthening for expansion

the average area of longitudinal reinforcement for 500 mm width at the end of the 
cantilever.
(2)	
For other cases where end stiffening is not required to carry traffic across, detailing shall be 
as follows:
	
(a)	
Along a free (unsupported) edge, a slab should normally contain longitudinal and 
transverse reinforcement generally arranged as shown in Fig. 16.6.
	
(b)	
The normal reinforcement provided for a slab may be detailed in such a way as to act 
as edge reinforcement.

Corner reinforcement
If the detailing arrangements at a support are such that lifting of the slab at a corner is restrained, 
suitable reinforcement should be provided.
16.6.2	
Shear reinforcement
(1)	
A slab in which shear reinforcement is provided should have a depth of at least 200 mm.

Corbels
16.7.1	
General
(1)	
Corbels may be designed by using strut and tie model. The inclination of strut with respect to 
the “main” tie should lie between 45° and 68°. The strut shall be dimensioned such that the 
concrete compression stress does not exceed that given in clause 6.4.2.8. Horizontal forces, 
HEd when applied in addition to the vertical load FEd, will require additional reinforcement 
in the tie. The effects of torsion, if any, have to be catered to in accordance with clause 
10.5.2.1.
(2)	
The reinforcement, corresponding to the ties designed using strut and tie model should be 
fully anchored beyond the node under the bearing plate, by using U-hoops or anchorage 
devices such as welding to a cross bar, unless a length lb.net is available between the node 
and the front of the corbel. lb.net should be measured beyond the full width of compressive 
strut. It shall be fully anchored at the other end in the body of the member to which the 
bracket is attached.
(3)	
In corbels where ac ≤ 0.5 hc closed horizontal or inclined links with area As.link shall be 
provided in addition to the main tension reinforcement as shown in Fig. 16.7(a) or Fig. 
16.7(c), where:
	
As,link> 0.50 As,main (to be provided  in upper two-third of the corbel depth)
Eq. 16.11
(4)	
In corbels where ac lies between  0.5 hc and hc and FEd>VRd.c (Refer clause 10.3.2 and 
10.3.3), closed vertical stirrups with area As.stirrup shall be provided in addition to the main 
tension reinforcement and the closed horizontal or inclined links, as shown in Fig. 16.7(b), 
where:
	
As.stirrup ≥ 0.5 FEd / f yd
Eq. 16.12
	
In addition check against crushing of strut shall be made in accordance with Eq. 10.5
(5)	
If ac>hc the design shall be carried out as a flexural member. The shear check shall be 
carried out as per Eq. 10.5 of 10.3.2 (5) for checking against crushing of concrete as well 
as 10.3.3.3(7) and 10.3.3.3(8) for arriving at the shear reinforcement.
(6)	
The bearing area on a corbel shall not project either beyond the straight portion of the main 
tension bars or beyond the interior face of any transverse anchor bar.
(7)	
In the case of corbels with varying depth, Fig. 16.7(c), the depth at the outside edge of the 
bearing area shall not be less than half the depth at the face of the support. The favourable 
contributions from inclined compression chord and tensile chord (clause 10.2.3) shall not 
be considered.

Articulations
(1)	
The articulation acts analogously to the corbels, except that the local bearing load is 
distributed to full section by inclined tensile steel.
(2)	
The general shape and arrangement of reinforcement shall be as shown in Fig. 16.8. The 
design of bearings at articulations shall ensure that concentrated edge stresses will not 
be induced and the angular rotation of the cantilevers and the suspended span is possible 
without any damage to the articulation.
Fig. 16.8 Articulation – General Shape and Arrangement of Reinforcement
16.9	
Deep Beams
(1)	
Deep beams (span/depth ratio less than 3) can be designed using appropriate elastic models 
or by plastic methods.
(2)	
Generally, detailing rules for anchorages and laps given in Section 15 apply to the design 
of reinforcement. 
(3)	
The reinforcement corresponding to the ties, designed using strut and tie model, should be 
fully anchored beyond the nodes by bending up the bars, by using U hoops or by anchorage

devices unless a sufficient length is available between the node and the end of the beam 
permitting an anchorage length of lb.net .
(4)	
Deep beams should normally be provided with a distributed reinforcement on both sides, 
the effect of each being equivalent to that of an orthogonal mesh with a reinforcement ratio 
of at least 0.15 percent in both directions, but not less than 150 mm2 per metre in each face 
and in each direction. The spacing shall not exceed 200 mm.
16.10	
Members with Unbonded Tendons
For members with only unbonded tendons, requirements for reinforced concrete elements apply.
For members with a combination of bonded and unbonded tendons, requirements for prestressed 
concrete members with bonded tendons apply.
Crack width may be calculated according to Clause 12.3.4 and Clause 12.3.5. Alternatively, limiting 
maximum bar size or spacing as per Clause 12.3.6 may be deemed to satisfy crack control criteria for 
reinforced concrete members.
16.11	
Concentrated Forces
16.11.1	
General
(1)	
Where one or more concentrated forces act at the end of a member or at the intersection of 
two structural members, local supplementary reinforcement should be provided capable of 
resisting the transverse tensile forces caused by these forces.
(2)	
This supplementary reinforcement may consist of links or of layers of reinforcement bent 
in the shape of hair pins.

(2)	
The distance from the edge of the loaded area to the free edge of the concrete section should 
not be less than 1/6 of the corresponding dimension of the loaded area measured in the 
same direction. In no case should the distance to the free edge be less than 50 mm.

face should be provided to the point at which local compressive stresses are dispersed. This 
point is determined as follows:
	
A line inclined at an angle θ (30°) to the direction of load application is drawn from the 
edge of the section to intersect with the opposite edge of the loaded surface, as shown in

Anchorage Zones for Post Tensioning Forces
Anchorage zone is defined as the zone within which the concentrated forces of post tensioned anchorages 
disperse and spread over the full section of the prestressed structural element.
For the design and amount of reinforcement for the full section and for the local effects, refer Section 
13. This reinforcement should be detailed to meet requirements of Clause 13.5 as well as to satisfy the 
following rules. Extra reinforcement over and above the calculated amount as per Clause 13.5 shall be 
provided, if needed, to satisfy these rules.

Anchorage zones should always be provided with distributed reinforcement near all surfaces 
in the form of an orthogonal mesh.
(2)	
Where groups of post-tensioned cables are located at a certain distance from each other, 
suitable links should be arranged at the ends of the members, as a protection against splitting 
away of groups.
(3)	
All reinforcement should be fully anchored.
(4)	
Where a strut and tie model has been used to determine the transverse tensile force, the 
following detailing rules shall be followed:
	
(a)	
The steel area actually required to provide the tie force, acting at its design strength, 
shall be distributed in accordance with the actual tensile stress distribution, i.e. over 
a length of the block approximately equal to its greatest lateral dimension.
	
(b)	
Closed stirrups should be used for anchorage of ties.

Buckling of longitudinal compression reinforcement
(1)	
Buckling of longitudinal reinforcement shall be avoided along the length of the potential 
hinge areas, even after several hysterics cycles in post-yield region of stress-strain diagram 
of steel.
	
To meet this requirement all main longitudinal bars should be restrained against out 
ward bucking by transverse reinforcement (hoops or crossties for rectangular section and 
though circular hoops or spirals for circular section) perpendicular to the longitudinal bars

Along straight section boundaries, restraining of longitudinal bars should be achieved in 
either one of the following ways:
	
(a)	
Through a perimeter tie engaged by intermediate cross-ties at alternate locations of 
longitudinal bars, at transverse (horizontal) spacing St not exceeding 200 mm. The 
cross-ties shall have 135° hooks at one end, and 135º or 90º bend at the other end. 
Bends of 90º are not permitted if ηk is greater than 0.24. Cross ties having 135º on 
both ends may consist of two lapped spliced pieces. In sections of large dimensions 
the perimeter tie may be spliced using appropriate lapping length combined with 
hooks; or
	
(b)	
Through overlapping closed ties arranged so that every corner bar and at least every 
alternate internal longitudinal bar is engaged by a tie leg. The transverse (horizontal) 
spacing of the tie legs should not exceed 200 mm.
	
(c)	
The minimum amount of transverse ties shall be determined as follows:
	
	
{
  
  } = 
   
   
   
     (mm2/m) 

Eq. 17.8
	
	
where
	
	
Al is the area of one tie leg, in mm2.
	
	
SL is the spacing of the legs along the axis of the member, in m;
	
	
ΣAS is the sum of the areas of the longitudinal bars in outer layer restrained by tie at 
any one end, in mm2;

As for determining Al = 0.5 As1 + As2 + 0.5 As3
	
	
As for determining Al1 = 0.5 As1 + As2
	
	
	
	
	
Al2 = As3
	
	
When Al is at any inclination to the transverse outer tie, then the As shall be divided 
by the Sine of the angle between the outer transverse tie and this tie, e.g. in case Al is 
inclined at 45 degrees to the outer tie, then As shall be divided by Sin 45, hence As = 
√2 x (0.5 As1 + As2 + 0.5 As3)
(3)	
Along Circular section boundaries, restraining of longitudinal bars should be achieved 
through circular ties determined by :

bars given in Clause 17.2.2 are met.
17.3	
Foundations
17.3.1	
General

18.1	
General
This Section gives specifications of materials to be used in construction of new concrete bridges and 
standards to which they should conform. For new construction, the Indian Standards, referred below or 
any specific international standards governing these materials, shall be the latest revisions thereof. The 
tables and notes below table given in this Section are reproduced for ready reference from the relevant 
IS Codes listed in Annexure A-3.

construction or the actual standards used for procurement, shall be referred to. The time dependency of 
properties shall also be taken into account in such cases.
18.2	
Untensioned Steel
18.2.1	
Specification and grades
Reinforcement shall consist of hot rolled, thermo-mechanical or heat-treated rods, de-coiled rods, or 
cold worked steel conforming to relevant Indian Standards. The main definitive properties and grades 
are given in Table 18.1. Steel conforming to any other international standard may be used provided 
its strength, elongation, chemical composition and bond in concrete, are not inferior to those of Indian 
Standards. The grade designations are as adopted by the relevant standards.
The minimum strength, as specified in relevant BIS Standards, which is either the yield strength in 
case of mild steel or 0.2 percent proof strength in case of high yield steel is notionally taken as the 
characteristic strength fyk.
18.2.2	
Other characteristics
Other important characteristics such as bendability (established by bend and re-bend test), weldability 
(established by equivalent carbon content) and bond characteristics in concrete should be as specified 
in IS:432 and IS:1786.
The dimensional tolerances and characteristics of ribs for HSD steel should be as per IS:432 and 
IS:1786.

For seismic zones III, IV and V, HSD steel bars shall possess following properties:
	
a.	
The actual 0.2% proof strength of steel bars based on tensile test must not exceed 
their characteristic 0.2% proof strength by more than 20 percent.

The ratio of the actual ultimate strength to the actual 0.2 percent proof strength/yield 
strength shall be at least 1.15.
18.2.3.1	
Galvanised reinforcement
Galvanising of reinforcing steel is achieved by hot dipping process in which steel reinforcement is 
dipped in a bath of molten zinc at about 450°C and cooled in a controlled manner. The coating is 
chromate treated to avoid reaction between zinc and fresh cement paste. The requirements of coating 
are as per IS 12594-1988. In this process, zinc is chemically bonded with steel surface in layers with 
varying percentage of zinc contents, from maximum of 100 percent (i.e. free) zinc as the outermost 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
170
layer, to a minimum 72-79 percent of zinc as the innermost layer above the base steel. These layers 
increase the corrosion resistance of steel.
The strength as well as elongation and bond properties are not adversely affected by galvanising.
18.2.3.2	
Epoxy-coated reinforcement
Reinforcing bars conforming to IS 1786 can be coated by fusion bonded epoxy conforming to IS 
13620-1993.
The fusion-bonded epoxy coating forms a continuous layer (free of holidays) which has high electrical 
resistance and prevents setting up of corrosion cells between steel and the surrounding electrolytic 
micro-environment of moist concrete. It also provides physical barrier between steel and the harmful 
elements from environmental sources, controlling their rate of penetration. On the other hand, the 
discontinuities in the barrier (holidays) have the tendency to concentrate the corrosion currents in 
these areas, leading to faster localised corrosion. The overall effect of coating is, however, beneficial in 
increasing the corrosion resistance of the structure, provided the occurrence of holidays is controlled.
The bond between reinforcement and concrete is lowered by upto 20 percent of the bond without such 
coating. In detailing of steel, the lap lengths and anchorage lengths shall be increased by 25 percent.
18.2.3.3	
Stainless steel reinforcement
Stainless steel reinforcement shall conform to IS:16651.
Properties of stainless steel reinforcement shall not be inferior to those of carbon steel reinforcement 
of corresponding strength class.
18.3	
Prestressing Steel
18.3.1	
Specification and grades
Prestressing steel in the form of plain or indented wires, stress-relieved multi-ply strands, or high 
tensile steel bars, shall conform to standards given in Table 18.2 subject to the stipulations given in 
Clause 18.3.2.

Mixing or curing of concrete with sea water is not permitted due to presence of harmful 
salts in sea water.

Water found satisfactory for mixing is also suitable for curing concrete. However, water used 
for curing should not produce any objectionable stain or unsightly deposit on the concrete 
surface. The presence of tannic acid or iron compounds in the water, is objectionable.

Mix Proportions of Concrete
18.5.1	
Grade designation
The concrete shall be designated by one of its types as described in Clause 6.4.2 – Ordinary Concrete, 
Standard Concrete, or High Performance Concrete and its grade-designation based on characteristic 
strength as described in Table 6.8.

Except ordinary concrete with strength designations of M-15 & M-20, the design mix of standard 
concrete and high performance concrete shall be established by laboratory / field testing and controlled 
at site by conducting tests to confirm suitability of constituent materials, as per the relevant codes 
mentioned in Clause 18.4. The concrete shall meet the acceptance criteria as per Clause 18.6. Mix 
design shall be modified if it does not meet the acceptance criteria.

Requirement of design mixes
(1)	
Trial Mixes
Trial mixes shall be prepared using sample of approved materials for the initial design.
Additional trial mixes and tests shall be carried out during production in case any changes in the 
properties of fresh concrete and/or strength of hardened concrete on the basis of early age tests, are 
observed, so as to control and bring the quality of concrete within acceptable limits. In case of any 
change in the source of materials, or properties of materials, the design of mix shall be newly established.
(2)	
Procedure for Design of Mix
Procedures as per any national code or any procedure established by practice for arriving at the suitable 
mix design, can be followed. Where earlier experience of concrete made from the selected materials is 
available, the same can provide the basis for the start of the mix design.
The target mean strength of concrete shall exceed the specified characteristic strength by at least the 
margin (called current margin) taken as 1.645 times the standard deviation of sample test results taken 
from at least 30 separate batches of concrete of nominally similar proportions produced at site by the 
same plant under similar supervision, over a period exceeding 5 days, but not exceeding one month.
Where sufficient data as above to establish the standard deviation is not available, the current margin 
for the initial mix design shall be taken as 10 MPa, (i.e. standard deviation as 6 MPa) for normal and 
uniform conditions of quality controls. This initial current margin shall be used only until sufficient 
data are available to determine the current margin as described above.

Mix Design for High Performance Concrete
General: Choice of materials, concrete mix design and field practices are quite critical, so that optimum 
performance can be extracted of each of the ingredients. The procedure of mix proportioning of normal 
grades of concrete may not be adequate. Relationships between the compressive strength of concrete 
and water/cement ratio (or water-cement + cementitious materials ratio, when part of the cement is 
replaced by mineral admixtures) and between water content and workability will have to be established 
by laboratory trials for the grade of concrete, the materials to be used, and the water-reducing efficiency 
of the superplasticiser.
The minimum cement content of concrete, inclusive of any mineral admixtures, shall be not less than 
380 kg/m3.
The ratio of water/(all cementitious materials including cement) should generally not exceed 0.33, but 
in no case more than 0.40.
Field Trial Mixes: Mix proportions arrived at by laboratory trials shall, in addition, be verified to be 
satisfactory under field conditions and necessary adjustments made. Field trial mixes shall be prepared 
for all grades of concrete, using samples of approved materials.
The concreting plant and means of transportation employed to make trial mixes and to transport them 
to representative distances shall be similar to the corresponding plant and transport to be used in the 
works. The optimum sequence of mixing of ingredients shall be established by trials. Mixing time may 
be longer than in normal grade concrete mixes.
The temperature of concrete at the time of placement shall not exceed 25°C. The temperature of 
concrete at the mixing stage should be lower, to allow for rise in temperature during transport. When 
considerable distance of transport is involved, particular attention should be paid to ensure retention of 
slump as targeted for placement.
Use of Mock-up Testing: Further mock-up testing may be carried out to ensure that the concrete can 
be satisfactorily placed and compacted, taking into account the location of placement and provision 
of reinforcement, and adjustments made in concrete mix design and/or detailing of reinforcement 
accordingly.
18.5.4	
Sampling and testing
(1)	
General
(a)	
Samples from fresh concrete shall be taken as per IS 1199 and samples shall be made, cured 
and tested at specified number of days in accordance with IS 516. The strength parameters 
are based to 28 days strength. Tests at other age shall be performed, if specified.
(b)	
Where automated batching plant is located away from the place of use or concrete is 
supplied from Ready Mixed Concrete (RMC) Plant, and the time gap between production 
and placement is more than the initial setting time or where any ingredients are added 
subsequent to mixing, separate sets of samples shall be collected and tested at batching 
plant and at location of placement. The results shall be compared and used to make suitable 



======================================================================
PAGE 188 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
178
adjustments at batching plants so that properties of concrete at placement are as per the 
requirements.
(c)	
In order to get a relatively quicker idea of the quality of concrete, optional tests on beams 
for modulus of rupture at 72 ± 2 h or at 7 days, or compressive strength tests at 7 days 
may be carried out in addition to 28 days compressive strength test. For this purpose, 
the acceptable values should be arrived at, based on actual testing. In all the cases, the 
equivalent 28 days compressive strength shall be the criterion for the acceptance/rejection 
of the concrete.
(d)	
Additional samples may be required for various purposes such as to determine the strength 
of concrete at 7 days or at the time of transfer of prestress or striking the formwork, or to 
determine the duration of curing, or to check the testing error. Additional samples may also 
be required for testing samples cured by accelerated methods as described in IS 9013. The 
specimen shall be tested as described in IS 516.
(2)	
Test Specimen and Sample Strength
Three test specimens constitute one sample for any type of test at specified age of testing. The average 
of these results of three samples constitute the test result of sample provided that the individual variation 
is within ±15 percent of average. If variation is larger, the sample shall be discarded.
(3)	
Frequency of Sampling
The minimum frequency of sampling of concrete of each grade shall be in accordance with Table 18.8.
Table 18.8 Minimum Frequency of Sampling of Concrete

4 plus one additional sample for each 
additional 50 m3 or part thereof.
At least one sample shall be taken from each batch of work. For the purpose of acceptance as per Table 
18.8, quantity of concrete represented by a group of four consecutive samples shall include all batches 
and single sample shall represent the batch from which it is taken.
Where concrete is provided continuously at site from a batching plant or RMC plant, groups 
of four consecutive samples, shall not have overlapping common samples. Irrespective of other 
methods of controlling production used at the batching/RMC plant the requirements of this Clause 
shall be met.

18.6	
Acceptance Criteria
18.6.1	
General
Acceptance or rejection of concrete is mostly based on compressive strength. However, other properties 
of the concrete in fresh and hardened states including durability are also important.
Apart from meeting the acceptance criteria given below, concrete is liable to be rejected if it is porous 
or honey-combed, its placing has been interrupted without providing a proper construction joint, the 
reinforcement has been displaced beyond the tolerances specified, or construction tolerances have 
not been met. However, the hardened concrete may be accepted after carrying out suitable remedial 
measures.
18.6.2	
Compressive strength
When both the following conditions are met, the concrete shall be deemed to comply with the specified 
compressive strength:
(a)	
The mean strength determined from any group of four consecutive non-overlapping samples 
shall exceed the specified characteristic compressive strength by 3 MPa.
(b)	
Strength of any sample is not less than the specified characteristic compressive strength 
minus 3 MPa. 
Concrete of each grade shall be assessed separately.
If the concrete is deemed not to comply as per the above criteria, the structural adequacy of the bridge 
elements affected shall be investigated and any consequential action as needed, shall be taken.
18.6.3	
Flexural strength
When both the following conditions are met, the concrete complies with the specified flexural strength:
(a)	
The mean strength determined from any group of four consecutive non-overlapping samples 
exceeds the specified characteristic flexural strength by at least 0.3 MPa.
(b)	
The strength determined from any sample is not less than the specified characteristic flexural 
strength minus 0.3 MPa.
18.6.4	
Density of fresh concrete
Where minimum density of fresh concrete is specified, the mean of any four consecutive non-
overlapping samples shall not be less than the specified value and any individual sample result shall 
not be less than 97.5 percent of the specified value.
18.6.5	
Density of hardened concrete
Where minimum density of hardened concrete is specified, the mean of any four consecutive non-
overlapping samples shall not be less than the specified value and any individual sample result shall 
not be less than 97.5 percent of the specified value.



======================================================================
PAGE 190 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
180
18.6.6	
Chloride content
The chloride content in the concrete can be measured as described in IS 14959 – Part I (for fresh 
concrete) or Part II (for hardened concrete). Alternatively it can be calculated, in which case, the 
method of calculation shall be based upon the measured chloride-ion contents of all constituents and 
the mix proportion of concrete. The chloride-ion content so measured or calculated and expressed 
as the percentage of chloride-ion by mass of cement, shall not exceed the value specified in Clause 
14.3.2.3.
18.6.7	
Durability of concrete
Unlike the tests on concrete described above, there is no specified test method for durability, which 
can be completed within a reasonably short time. The requirement of long term durability of concrete 
is ‘deemed to be satisfied’ by following the recommended provisions in this Code for maximum 
water-cement ratio, minimum cement content, cover thickness, type of cement and amounts of 
chlorides and sulphates in concrete etc. All these recommendations taken together tend resulting 
concrete being dense, workable, and placeable and having as low permeability as possible under the 
given situation.
When durability of concrete is the main reason for adopting high performance concrete, or in other 
specific situations, Rapid Chloride Ion Permeability Test (RCPT) as per ASTM C1202 shall be carried 
out. Suggested upper limits of values of RCPT for 56 days for various exposure conditions (refer Table 
14.1) are:
(1)	
Extreme 	 	
800 Coulombs
(2) 	
Very Severe	
1200 Coulombs
(3) 	
Severe	
	
1500 Coulombs
Additional durability tests, such as Water Permeability test as per DIN 1048 Part 5 or Initial Surface 
Absorption test as per BS 1881 Part 5 can also be specified. The permissible values in such tests have 
to be specified taking into account the severity of the exposure condition. The acceptance criteria shall 
be arrived at prior to testing.
18.7	
Self-Compacting Concrete
18.7.1	
Constituents
In Self-Compacting Concrete, superplasticisers provide the fluidity, and Viscosity Modifying 
Admixtures (VMA) are used to help reduce segregation, and sensitivity of the mix due to variations in 
other constituents, especially to moisture content. Other materials are as in Clauses 18.4.1 to 18.4.5.
VMA’s are hydrophilic, water-soluble polymers having high molecular weight. Such polymers can 
form a network of large molecules extending throughout the mass. The dimensions of the polymers or 
particles are in colloidal range; hence these are called ‘colloidal admixtures’. These can also be used 
as ‘anti-washout’ admixtures for underwater placement.

Properties in the Fresh State
The filling ability and stability of self-compacting concrete in the fresh state can be defined by four key 
characteristics. Each characteristic can be assessed by one or more test methods (Table 18.9).

Mix Design
There is no fixed method of mix design for SCC. Mix proportions are to be selected by trials and tests, 
till a satisfactory mix is arrived at. EFNARC Guidelines 2005 suggest broad outline, as given below:
•	
Coarse aggregate content - 750 – 1000 kg  per m3 of concrete,
•	
Total powder content – 380 to 600 kg per m3 of concrete,
•	
Water/powder ratio by solid volume – 0.85 to 1.10,
•	
Water content –150 – 210 litres/ m3,
•	
Paste volume – 300 – 380 litres/ m3,
•	
Water/cement ratio selected for strength and durability requirements,
•	
Sand content to balance the remaining volume, usually 48 – 55 % of total aggregate by 
weight.
18.8	
Grouting
18.8.1	
General
Grout is a homogenous mixture of cement and water. It may contain chemical admixtures which 
modify the properties of grout in its fluid state. These recommendations cover the cement grouting of 
post tensioned tendons of prestressed concrete members of bridges.
The purpose of grouting is to provide permanent protection to the post tensioned steel against corrosion 
and to develop bond between the prestressing steel and the surrounding structural concrete. The grout 
ensures encasement of steel in an alkaline environment for corrosion protection and by filling the duct 
space it prevents water collection and freezing.
A critical feature of grout is that it should remain pumpable for the time required to fully inject the 
tendon.



======================================================================
PAGE 193 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
183
18.8.2	
Materials
(1)	
Water
Only clean potable water free from impurities conforming to Clause 18.4.5 shall be used. No sea or 
creek water is to be used at all.
(2)	
Cement
The same type of cement as used in construction of prestressed elements, should be used for preparation 
of the grout. It should be as fresh as possible and free from any lumps.
(3)	
Sand
It is not recommended to use sand for grouting of prestressing tendons.
(4)	
Admixtures
Acceptable admixtures conforming to IS 9103 may be used if tests have shown that their use improves 
the properties of grout, i.e. increasing fluidity, reducing bleeding, entraining air or expanding the grout. 
Admixtures must not contain chlorides, nitrates, sulphides, sulphites or any other products which are 
likely to damage the steel or grout. When an expanding agent is used, the total unrestrained expansion 
should not exceed 10 percent. Aluminium powder as an expanding agent is not recommended as doubts 
exist about its long term effects.
(5)	
Ready Mixed grout
Alternatively, the dry materials may be batched in a factory for pre-mixed grout and mixed with the 
liquid materials on site as per instructions of the manufacturers.
18.8.3	
Use of grout colloidal mixer
It is essential that the grout is maintained in a homogenous state and of uniform consistency so that 
there is no separation of cement during the entire grouting process. It is, therefore, necessary that the 
grout be continuously mixed in a colloidal mixer with a minimum speed of 1000 RPM and travel of 
discharge not exceeding 15 m per second.
18.8.4	
Properties of the grout
Before grouting, the properties of the grout mix should be tested. Tests should be conducted for each 
job periodically.
(1)	
Water/cement Ratio
Water/cement ratio should be as low as possible, consistent with workability and should not exceed 
0.40.



======================================================================
PAGE 194 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
184
(2)	
Deleterious Materials
No chloride, sulphates shall be separately added to the grout. The constituent may contain chlorides/
sulphates. However, its net effect should not exceed the following limits in the grout:
	
- Chlorides (Cl-) not more than 0.1 percent by weight of cement.
	
- Sulphate (SO3) not more than 4 percent by weight of cement.
	
- Sulphide-ions (S2
-) not more than 0.01 percent by weight of cement.
(3)	
Temperature
The temperature of the grout after accounting for the ambient temperature of the structure, shall not 
exceed 25°C.
(4)	
Compressive Strength
The compressive strength of 100 mm cube of the grout shall not be less than 27 MPa at 7 days or 30 
MPa at 28 days. Cubes shall be cured in a moist atmosphere for the first 24 hours and subsequently in 
water. These tests shall be conducted in advance to ascertain the suitability of the grout mix. The 7 day 
strength is not mandatory if the 28 day strength requirement is met.
(5)	
Setting Time
Initial setting time of grout shall be more than three hours and less than 12 hours. The final setting time 
shall not be less than 24 hours.
(6)	
Bleeding
Bleeding is the separation of free water from the grout mix. It includes the filtering effect of strands 
where the cavities between the wires constituting the strand, block cement particles and permit water 
under pressure to move ahead of the grout in the direction of general flow of grout. The bleeding shall 
be sufficiently low to prevent excessive segregation and sediment of the grout material. The bleeding 
shall not exceed 0.3 percent of volume of the initial volume of grout after three hours kept at rest.
(7)	
Volume Change
Volume change of the grout at rest for 24 h shall be within the range of - 1 % and + 5 % of the original 
volume when tested as per EN 445. It should not be more than +0.2 percent at 28 days.
(8)	
Fluidity
Fluidity is tested as per EN 445 by a) cone test and b) grout spread test. The time for cone test (as per 
Fig 18.2a) shall be less than or equal to 25 seconds. The spread of the grout as per grout spread test (as 
per Fig 18.2b) shall be greater than or equal to 140 mm.
For retention of fluidity there shall not be more than 20% reduction in fluidity at 30 minutes when 
tested as per EN 445.

18.8.5	
Grouting Procedure
The grouting procedure shall be as per EN 446. Guidelines for grouting are given below:
	
a)	
Ducts should be grouted at a continuous and  steady rate of 6 to12 m / minute for 
horizontal and 2 to 3 m / minute for vertical ducts. For parabolic ducts the grouting 
rate should be 6 to 8m / minute.
	
b)	
Grouting pressure should not exceed 2 MPa.
	
c)	
Grouting should continue until the fluidity or density of grout flowing from free ends 
and vent openings is same as that of original grout.
After closing all the vents, retained pressure should be same as adopted for grouting subject to a 
minimum of 0.5 MPa.
18.9	
Quality Control and Workmanship
18.9.1	
General
This Clause covers the requirements of proper workmanship in all operations of construction of 
concrete structures and related quality assurance and quality control measures, so that the structure is 
built as designed and the intended performance over the design service life is achieved. Concrete is 
made with ingredients with inherent variability. The operations of production, placement, compaction 
and curing of concrete under site conditions can also exhibit variability. In order that concrete is 



======================================================================
PAGE 197 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
187
obtained with reasonable amount of consistency in its characteristics, the properties of ingredients 
and the resultant concrete should be monitored diligently as per an appropriate plan of testing and all 
site operations should be carried out with adequate proficiency, as detailed in this Section. A Quality 
Assurance (QA) Plan should be in position to ensure that the construction results in satisfactory 
strength, serviceability and long term durability which will lower the overall lifecycle cost of the 
structure.
18.9.2	
Quality assurance measures
Quality assurance in construction activity relates to proper design, use of appropriate materials and 
components to be supplied by the producers, proper workmanship in the execution of works and proper 
care during the use of structure, including periodic inspection and timely maintenance and repair by 
the owner.
Quality assurance measures are both technical and organizational. The Quality Assurance Plan shall 
identify the key elements necessary to provide fitness of the structure and the means by which they are 
to be provided and measured with the overall purpose to provide confidence that the realized project 
will work satisfactorily in service, fulfilling intended needs. Quality control and quality assurance 
would also involve ensuring quality of both the inputs as well as the outputs. Inputs are in the form of 
materials of construction; workmanship; and the related plant, machinery and equipment; resulting in 
the output in the form of final structure.
Each party involved in the realization of a project should establish and implement a Quality Assurance 
Plan for its role in the project. Suppliers' and sub-contractors’ activities shall be covered in the plan. 
The individual Quality Assurance Plans shall fit into the overall Quality Assurance Plan of the project 
and shall define the tasks and responsibilities of all persons involved, adequate control and checking 
procedures, and the organization and maintaining of adequate documentation of the construction process 
and its results. Such documentation shall be in accordance with IRC Publication IRC:SP:47-1988 
“Guidelines on Quality Systems for Road Bridges, Plain, Reinforced Prestressed and Composite 
Concrete”.
18.9.3	
Production of concrete
(1)	
Storage of Materials
All efforts shall be made to store the materials in proper places to prevent their deterioration and any 
intrusion of foreign matters, so as to ensure their satisfactory quality and fitness for the work. The 
space shall permit easy storage, inspection, removal and re-storage of materials. All such materials, 
even though stored in approved manner, shall be subjected to inspection and acceptance test prior to 
use, whenever considered necessary.
(2)	
Batching
In batching concrete:
	
•	
The quantity of cement, aggregate and mineral admixtures, if used, shall be determined 
by mass.



======================================================================
PAGE 198 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
188
	
•	
Chemical admixture, if solid, shall be determined by mass.
	
•	
Liquid admixture may be measured in volume or mass, and
	
•	
Water shall be weighed or measured by volume in a calibrated tank.
The concrete shall be sourced from on-site or off-site batching and mixing plants, or from approved 
ready-mixed concrete plants, preferably having quality certification.
Except where supply of properly graded aggregate of uniform quality can be maintained over a period 
of work, the grading of aggregate should be controlled by obtaining the coarse aggregate in different 
sizes and blending them in the right proportions when required, the different sizes being stocked in 
separate stock piles. The material should be stock piled several hours, preferably a day before use. The 
grading of coarse and fine aggregate should be checked as frequently as possible to ensure that the 
specified grading is maintained.
The accuracy of the measuring equipment shall be within ±3 percent of the quantity of cement, 
aggregate, admixtures and water being measured. All measuring equipment shall be maintained in a 
clean and serviceable condition. Their accuracy shall be checked over the range in use, when set up at 
site and maintained thereafter.
It is important to maintain the water-cement ratio constant at its correct value. To this end, determination 
of moisture contents in both fine and coarse aggregates shall be made as frequently as possible, 
being determined according to weather conditions. The amount of the added water shall be adjusted 
to compensate for any observed variations in the moisture contents. To allow for the variation in 
mass of aggregate due to variation in their moisture content, suitable adjustments in the masses of 
aggregates shall also be made. Accurate control shall be kept on the quantity of mixing water, which 
when specified, shall not be changed without approval.
(3)	
Mixing
All concrete shall be machine-mixed. In order to ensure uniformity and good quality of concrete, the 
ingredients shall be mixed in a power driven batch mixer with hopper and suitable weigh batching 
arrangement or in a central mix plant. The concrete shall be mixed until it is of even colour, cohesive 
and of uniform consistency throughout. When mineral admixtures are added at the mixing stage, their 
thorough and uniform blending with the cement shall be ensured, if necessary, by longer mixing time. 
In general, the mixing time shall be at least 2 minutes after all the ingredients are in the mixer. For other 
types of more efficient mixers, manufacturer’s recommendations should be followed. The addition of 
water after the completion of the initial mixing operation, shall not be permitted.
18.9.4	
Transportation, placing, compaction and curing
(1)	
Transporting Concrete
Mixed concrete shall be transported from the place of mixing to the place of final placement as early as 
practicable, by methods which will prevent the segregation or loss of the ingredients.
Concrete may be transported by transit mixers or properly designed buckets or by pumping. Transit 
mixer or other hauling equipment when used, should be equipped with means of discharging the concrete 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
189
without segregation. During hot or cold weather, concrete shall be transported in deep containers. 
Other suitable methods to reduce the loss of water by evaporation in hot weather, and heat loss in cold 
weather, may also be adopted.
When concrete is conveyed by chute, the plant shall be of such size and design as to ensure practically 
continuous flow in the chute. The slope of the chute shall be such as to allow the concrete to flow freely 
and without segregation of the ingredients. The delivery end of the chute shall be as close as possible 
to the point of deposit. The chute shall be thoroughly flushed with water before and after each working 
period and the water used for this purpose shall be discharged outside the formwork.
In case concrete is to be transported by pumping, the fresh concrete should have adequate fluidity and 
cohesiveness to be pumpable. Proper concrete mix proportioning and initial trials should be carried out 
to ensure this. The conduit shall be primed by pumping a batch of mortar through the line to lubricate 
it. Once the pumping is started, it shall not be interrupted, as concrete standing idle in the line is liable 
to cause a plug. The operator shall ensure that some concrete is always there in the pump’s receiving 
hopper during operation. The lines shall always be maintained clean and free of dents.
(2)	
Placing and Compacting Concrete
Concrete shall be placed as nearly as practicable in its final position to avoid rehandling. Methods 
of placing should be such as to preclude segregation. Care should be taken to avoid displacement 
of reinforcement or movement of formwork. To achieve this, concrete should be lowered vertically 
into the forms and horizontal movement of concrete inside the forms should, as far as practicable, be 
minimised.
Concrete shall be placed and compacted before its initial setting so that it is amenable to compaction 
by vibration. The workability of concrete at the time of placement shall be adequate for the compaction 
equipment to be used. If there is considerable time gap between mixing and placing of concrete, as in 
the case of ready mixed concrete plants or off-site batching and mixing plants, concrete mix shall be 
designed to have appropriately higher workability at the time of discharge from the mixer, in order 
to compensate the loss of workability during transit. This is generally achieved by use of suitable 
chemical admixtures. Keeping these considerations in view, the general requirement for ready mixed 
concrete plants or off-site batching and mixing plants, is that concrete shall be discharged from the 
truck mixer within two hours of the time of loading. A longer period may be permitted if suitable 
retarding admixtures are used. In case of on-site mixing, fresh concrete shall preferably be placed and 
compacted within 30 minutes of mixing.
In wall forms, drop chutes attached to hoppers at the top should preferably be used to lower concrete 
to the bottom of the form. As a general guidance, the permissible free fall of concrete may not exceed 
1.5 m and under no circumstances; shall it be more than 2 m.
When free fall of larger height is involved, self compacting concrete having adequate fluidity, 
cohesiveness and viscosity shall be used. Self compacting concrete completely fills every corner of the 
formwork by its own weight without segregation, whilst maintaining uniformity. No compaction by 
vibration is required.



======================================================================
PAGE 200 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
190
When concrete is to be deposited by means of tremie, the lower end of the vertical pipe shall always be 
inserted sufficiently deep into the concrete which has been placed previously but has not set. The top 
section of the tremie shall be a hopper large enough to hold one entire batch of the mix or the entire 
contents of the transporting bucket, if any. The tremie pipe shall be large enough to allow a free flow 
of concrete and strong enough to withstand the external pressure of the water in which it is suspended, 
when concrete is deposited under water. It will be necessary to raise the tremie slowly in order to cause 
a uniform flow of the concrete, but the tremie shall not be emptied allowing water to enter the pipe. At 
all times after the placing of concrete is started and until all the concrete is placed, the lower end of the 
tremie pipe shall be below the top surface of the plastic concrete.
Concrete shall be thoroughly compacted during the operation of placing and carefully worked around 
the reinforcement, around embedded fixtures and into the corners of the form work. To achieve proper 
compaction vibrators may be used. The vibrator can be internal or external type and depending upon 
the shape and size of the member, both types may be used individually or together.
When internal vibrators are used, they shall be inserted vertically to the full depth of the layer being 
placed and ordinarily shall penetrate the layer below for a few centimetres. The vibrator should be kept 
in place until air bubbles cease escaping from the surface and then withdrawn slowly to ensure that no 
hole is left in the concrete, care being taken to see that it remains in continuous operation while being 
withdrawn. Internal vibrators shall be inserted in an orderly manner and the distance between insertions 
should be about 1½ times the radius of the area visibly affected by vibration. Internal vibrators should 
not be used for spreading the concrete.
(3)	
Construction Joints
Concreting shall be carried out continuously up to construction joints, the position and arrangement 
of which shall be pre-determined by the designer. Joints should be positioned where they are readily 
accessible for preparation and concreting. Construction joints should be positioned to minimise the 
effects of the discontinuity on the durability, structural integrity and appearance of the structure. As 
far as possible, joints should be provided in non-aggressive zones, but if joints in aggressive zones can 
not be avoided, they should be sealed. Joints should be located away from regions of maximum stress 
caused by loading; particularly where shear and bond stresses are high. Joints should be either vertical 
or horizontal. For a vertical construction joint, the lifts of concrete shall finish level or at right angles 
to the axis of the member. Concreting shall be continued right up to the joint.
Before resuming work at a construction joint when concrete has not yet fully hardened, all laitance 
shall be removed thoroughly. The surface should be roughened, care being taken to avoid dislodgement 
of coarse aggregates. Concrete may be brushed with a stiff brush soon after casting, while the concrete 
has only slightly stiffened. If the concrete has partially hardened, it may be treated by wire brushing or 
with a high pressure water jet, followed by drying with an air jet, just before the new concrete is placed. 
Fully hardened concrete shall be treated with mechanical hand tools or grit blasting, taking care not to 
split or crack the aggregates. The practice of first placing a layer of mortar or grout when concreting 
joints is not recommended. The old surface should be soaked with water, without leaving puddles, just 
before starting concreting. The new concrete shall be thoroughly compacted against it.



======================================================================
PAGE 201 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
191
Where there is likely to be a delay before placing the next concrete lift, protruding reinforcement 
shall be protected. In all cases, where construction joints are made, the joint surface shall not be 
contaminated with release agents, dust, or sprayed curing membrane and reinforcement shall be firmly 
fixed in position at the correct cover. 
The sequence of concreting, striking of forms and positioning of construction joints for every individual 
structure shall be decided, well in advance of the commencement of work.
(4)	
Curing and Protection of Concrete
The concrete shall be kept constantly wet for a minimum period of 14 (fourteen) days by ponding or 
covering with a layer of wet (but not dripping) sacking, canvas, hessian or similar absorbent material. 
Water should be applied on unformed surfaces as soon as it can be done without marring the surface 
and on formed surfaces immediately after the forms are stripped.
High Performance Concrete containing silica fume is more cohesive than normal mixes hence, there 
is little or no bleeding and no bleed water to rise to the surface to offset water lost due to evaporation. 
Plastic shrinkage cracking is possible, if curing is not proper. Initial curing should commence soon after 
initial setting of concrete. Concrete should be covered with moist covers (sacking, canvas or hessian), 
opaque colour plastic sheets or suitable curing compound. Final moist curing should commence after 
final setting of concrete and continue for at least 14 days.
Liquid membrane-forming curing compounds conforming to ASTM C 309, may be used in lieu of 
moist curing after approval. The curing efficiency shall be tested as per ASTM C 156. Such compounds 
shall be applied to all exposed surfaces of the concrete as soon as possible after the concrete has set, but 
not dried out.  The membrane formed shall be stripped off afterwards. Impermeable membranes, such 
as sheet materials for curing concrete conforming to ASTM C 171, or polyethylene sheeting covering 
closely the concrete surface, may also be used to provide effective barrier against evaporation.
Steam curing under atmospheric pressure is adopted to develop high early strength of concrete, so 
that concrete members can be removed from the formwork and handled as early as possible. This is 
particularly suitable for precast concrete members. Steam curing is applied in enclosures or tunnels 
through which concrete members are transported on a conveyor system; alternatively, portable 
enclosures or plastic covers are placed over precast members. Steam is supplied to the enclosures. 
Various elements of the steam curing cycle, e.g. the delay in commencement of heating (i.e. extending 
pre-steaming period), the rate of increase of temperature, the level and time of constant temperature, 
and the rate of decrease of temperature, shall receive careful consideration. As a general guidance, the 
pre-steaming period should be about one to three hours, the rate of increase or decrease of temperature 
should not exceed 10°C to 20°C per hour and the maximum temperature of curing can be about 70°C.
The ideal steam curing cycle in a particular situation, is governed by the concrete mix proportions and 
type of cementitious materials and the strength required at the end of steam curing period, and shall be 
decided by prior trials. Steam curing of concrete shall be followed by water curing for at least seven days.
After placing and during the first stages of hardening, concrete shall be protected from harmful effects 
of sunrays, drying winds, cold, running water, shocks, vibrations, traffic including construction traffic 
etc.

18.9.5	
Concreting in extreme weather
(1)	
Concreting in Hot Weather
Special problems are encountered in the production, placement and curing of concrete in hot weather. 
The climatic factors affecting concrete in hot weather are high ambient temperature, reduced relative 
humidity, high wind velocity and combination thereof. High temperatures result in rapid hydration of 
cement, increased evaporation of mixing water, greater mixing water demand, rapid loss of workability 
and large volume changes resulting in cracks. 
The temperature of the concrete at the time of placement should be as low as possible, but in no case 
more than 35°C. For high performance concrete, the temperature at the time of placement shall not 
exceed 25°C. If concreting has to be done in hot weather at ambient temperatures exceeding these 
limits of concrete temperature, steps shall be taken to sufficiently lower the temperature of ingredients 
of the concrete below the ambient. The contribution of each ingredient to the temperature of concrete 
is a function of the temperature, specific heat and quantity of that ingredient.
Aggregates and mixing water exert the most pronounced effects on the temperature of concrete. Thus, 
in hot weather, all available means shall be used for maintaining these materials at as low temperature 
as practicable, such as;
	
•	
Use of chilled mixing water
	
•	
Use of crushed ice or flaked as a part of mixing water.
	
•	
Shading stockpiles of aggregates from direct rays of Sun.
	
•	
Sprinkling stockpiles of coarse aggregate with water and keeping them moist.
	
•	
Limiting temperature of cement to be preferably not in excess of 30°C at the time of 
use.
Period between mixing of concrete and placing shall be as short as possible. Immediately after 
compaction and surface finish, concrete shall be protected from evaporation of moisture, without 
letting ingress of external water, by means of wet (not dripping) gunny bags, hessian etc. Once the 
concrete has attained some degree of hardening (approximately 12 hours after mixing), moist curing 
shall be commenced and satisfactorily continued throughout the requisite period.
(2)	
Concreting in Cold Weather
Effects of cold weather on concrete, in absence of special precautions, include;
	
•	
Delayed setting and hardening, slower rate of gain of strength,
	
•	
Irreparable loss of strength and durability, if freezing of concrete takes place at early 
ages, when it is still in plastic state. Even one cycle of freezing of concrete during the 
prehardening period may lower the compressive strength by 30 to 50 percent,
	
•	
Disruptive effects of freezing of pore water make hardened concrete vulnerable to 
repeated cycles of freezing and thawing, resulting in loss of compressive strength and 
modulus of elasticity.
	
•	
Stresses due to temperature differential within the concrete member at the time of 
removal of form insulations, may promote cracking.



======================================================================
PAGE 203 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
193
When depositing concrete at or near freezing temperature, precautions shall be taken to ensure that 
the concrete shall have a temperature of at least 5°C at the time of placing. When necessary, concrete 
ingredients shall be heated before mixing, but cement shall not be heated artificially other than by the 
heat transmitted to it from other ingredients of the concrete. In general, heating of only the mixing 
water to about 65°C may suffice for this purpose.
The temperature of the concrete shall be maintained above freezing temperature (preferably above 
2°C) until it has thoroughly hardened. This may be achieved with the help of proper insulating methods 
before the protection is removed.
Use of air-entraining admixtures conforming to IS 9103 increases the resistance of hardened concrete 
to freezing and thawing. To counter slower setting of concrete, non chloride-bearing accelerators can 
be used after approval. However, accelerators containing chloride shall not be used.
No frozen material or materials containing ice shall be used. All concrete damaged by frost shall be 
removed.
18.9.6	
Steel reinforcement
(1)	
Bending
Reinforcement shall not be bent or straightened in a manner that will injure the material. All reinforcement 
shall be bent cold. Mechanised bending or prefabricated reinforcement shall be preferred. Bar bending 
schedules shall be prepared for all reinforcement work.
(2)	
Placing
All reinforcement shall be placed and maintained in positions shown on the drawings by providing 
proper cover blocks, spacers, supporting bars etc. High strength mortar or concrete of the same 
grade with smaller size aggregate shall be used for cover blocks. To ensure adequate cover, use of 
manufactured chairs is recommended.
(3)	
Splicing and Lapping
Splicing and lapping shall be in positions conforming to the drawings and for this purpose, all reinforcing 
bars shall be to the full lengths indicated thereon. However, suitable adjustment in the locations of the 
splices to accommodate the available lengths of bars, can be made with prior approval. In all cases of 
such adjustment, the requirements of lap length and other stipulations, as per Sections 15 and 16 shall 
be compiled with.
(4)	
Substitution of Bar Sizes
In order to accommodate the available size of bars, use of bar sizes other than those shown on the 
drawings may be permitted with prior approval. In case of such substitution, the reinforcement actually 
used shall have an area equivalent to the original or slightly in excess thereof, provided further that the 
various stipulations of this Code are not violated by such substitution. The requirements with regard to 
bond stress, limitations of bar sizes, spacing of bars, cover, etc., shall be specially looked into.

IRC:112-2020
194
18.9.7	
Falsework
For design, fabrication, and erection of falsework, IRC:87 “Guidelines for the Design and Erection of 
Falsework for Road Bridges” shall be followed.
The formwork should be robust and strong and the joints should be leak proof. Form release agents 
of approved quality shall be used. The staging, scaffolding and shuttering are required to be properly 
designed so that their erection as well as striking can be conveniently done. The design should also 
ensure that at the time of striking, the concrete does not get disturbed and the forms are conveniently 
removed. Staging shall be of steel pipes or steel sections.
Where centering trusses or launching trusses are adopted for casting of superstructure, the joints of the 
centering or launching arrangement, whether welded, riveted or bolted, shall be thoroughly checked 
and various members of the centering trusses shall be examined for proper alignment and unintended 
deformation before proceeding with the concreting. Launching trusses and travelling forms shall be 
load tested.
The locations where fixing of reinforcement and placing of concrete are being done, shall be accessible 
to the inspecting officers at all stages of construction.
Forms shall not be released until the concrete has achieved strength of at least twice the stress to which 
the concrete may be subjected at the time of removal of formwork. In absence of tests, generally, the 
striking period may be as specified in IRC:87.
18.9.8	
Inspection and testing of structures
(1)	
Inspection
To ensure proper performance, it is necessary that each step in concreting which will be covered by 
the next step is inspected as the work proceeds. Immediately after stripping the formwork, all concrete 
shall be carefully inspected and any defective work or small defects shall be either removed or made 
good before concrete has thoroughly hardened. Concrete members shall be inspected within 15 days for 
occurrence of cracks due to shrinkage, temperature, local restraint, undue deflection and deformation.
(2)	
Testing of Concrete in Structures
In case of doubt regarding the grade of concrete in the structure, either due to poor workmanship or 
based on results of cube strength tests, compressive strength tests of concrete shall be carried out by 
core tests and/or non-destructive tests.
(3)	
Core Test
The points from which core samples are to be taken and the number of core samples required shall be 
decided so as to be representative of the whole of concrete concerned. In no case, however, shall fewer 
than three cores be tested. Cores shall be prepared and tested as described in IS 516.



======================================================================
PAGE 205 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
195
Concrete in the member represented by a core test shall be considered acceptable, if the average 
equivalent cube strength of the cores is equal to at least 85 percent of the characteristic strength of the 
grade of concrete specified for the corresponding age and no individual core has strength less than 75 
percent.
Core tests may also be required for other purposes like repair, retrofitting and strengthening of structure 
where requirement of strength could differ.
(4)	
Non-Destructive Tests
Non-destructive tests are used to obtain estimation of the properties of concrete in the structure.
The methods adopted include ultrasonic pulse velocity [IS:13311(Part 1)] and rebound hammer [IS 
13311 (Part 2)], probe penetration (ASTM C 803), pullout (ASTM C 900) and maturity (ASTM C 
1074). Non-destructive tests provide alternatives to core tests for estimating the strength of concrete 
in a structure, or can supplement the data obtained from a limited number of core specimens tested. 
These methods are based on measuring a concrete property that bears some relationship to strength. 
The accuracy of these methods is determined by the degree of correlation between strength and quality 
of the concrete and the parameter measured by the non-destructive tests.
Any of these methods may be adopted, in which case the acceptance criteria shall be agreed upon prior 
to testing.
18.9.9	
Load tests of structures
(1)	
Load Test for Flexural Member
In case the core test results do not satisfy the requirement in Clause 18.9.8 (3) or where such tests 
have not been done, load test may be carried out if specifically desired. Load test should be carried 
out as soon as possible after expiry of 28 days from time of placing of concrete. Procedure as per IRC 
publication SP:51 ‘Guidelines for Load Testing of Bridges’ may be adopted.
(2)	
Members Other than Flexural Members
Members other than flexural members should be preferably investigated by analysis.
18.10	
Design considerations for construction stages, refer to Annexure A-6.

ANNEXURE A-1
ACTIONS, DESIGN SITUATIONS AND COMBINATION OF ACTIONS
A1-1	
General
Section 5.0 “Basis of Design” describes the approach adopted for taking into consideration various 
limit states, which shall not be exceeded by the bridge structure and its elements, when subjected to 
combined effect of actions in various design situations. The values of actions and partial factors to be 
used in different combinations for verification of design by Limit State Method are given in IRC:6, 
Annexure B.
The description of actions, their classification, nomenclature of design situations and combination for 
verifying different limit states as applicable to concrete bridges, are explained in this Annexure. The 
terms loads and force (arising out of friction, buoyancy etc) are also used to represent ‘Actions’ in 
IRC:6, and in the description below.
A1-2	
Classification of Action
The description of actions and their notations given as per IRC:6, unless otherwise stated.
(1)	
Permanent Actions - G
	
(a)	
Permanent Action
	
(i)	
Self Weight/Dead Load

(ii)	
Backfill Weight
	
	
To be treated as D.L. when present.
	
(iii)	 Earth Pressure: (Fep)
	
	
In IRC:6, the increased earth pressure due to live load surcharge considered is 
included by convention in Fep. For Limit State Method the surcharge due to live 
load needs to be taken as a variable load together with other live loads.
	
(iv)	 Prestressing Force: (P)
	
	
In analysis of structure P is considered as a force acting on concrete elements 
which has time dependant variation, and also superior (i.e. higher estimate) and 
inferior (i.e. lower estimate) values.
	
(v)	
Secondary Effects (Fs)
	
	
Such as creep, shrinkage and settlement.
Note:	 Second order effects arising from the deformed geometry are not considered as secondary effects. These are 
considered for verification of Ultimate Limit State of Deformation only.
	
(b)	
Variable Gravity Loads Treated as Permanent Loads 
	
(i)	
Super Imposed Dead Load

IRC:112-2020
197
	
(ii)	
Surfacing and Wearing Coat
	
	
In Limit State Method superior and inferior values may be used, which should 
account for re-surfacing, with or without removing existing coat, and possibility 
of change in type of surfacing.
	
(iii)	 Snow Load
	
	
Snow loads, if present, are treated in the same way as Dead Load depending on 
the depth of snow on superstructure. The design value of live load is modified 
depending on the restrictions on operation of vehicular loads which give rise to 
different design situations.
	
(c)	
Quasi-Permanent Loads
	
	
There are variable loads which act for a major part of the structure's design life. 
By convention, loads acting for more than 50% of the design life are called quasi-
permanent. In load combinations, they are treated as variable loads with different 
values depending on the action effects under evaluation. Temperature load is an 
example, where it has a permanent component (casting temperature), semi-permanent 
component (seasonal variation from casting temperature) and varying component 
(daily variation from seasonal temperature).

travelling at high speed on uneven surface of wearing coat, to equivalent static 
load.

(excluding restraints due to frictional resistance at bearings).
	
(ii)	
Effect of thermal gradient in the structure.
	
(iii)	 Wind Load (W)
	
	
Normally used as static load acting on bridge elements. For wind sensitive 
structure or elements of structure, dynamic analysis and dynamic wind force is 
stipulated.

(b)	
Seismic Hazards
	
	
Seismic situations considered in the design are rare events [even more rare than type 
3(a)] having return period of the order of few hundred years. They produce following 
types of loads.
	
(i)	
Inertial loads due to self-mass, generated in bridge structure by ground 
acceleration.
	
(ii)	
Inertial loads due to mass of vehicular live load.
	
(iii)	 Hydrodynamic forces generated on parts of bridge submerged under water.
	
(iv)	 Increased earth pressures.
	
(v)	
Effects of liquefaction of soils.
A1-3	
Design Situation and Load Combination
Various actions defined in Clause A1-2, act on the bridge structure at different time and in different 
combinations. The magnitudes of the loads also differ from time to time. Thus the loading conditions 
to which bridge structure is exposed are extremely large. In practice the verification that the limit states 
are not exceeded is carried out for a limited number of combinations, each of which represents likely 
condition of bridge loading during its design service life. The load combinations and the partial factors 
of loads to be considered in that combination are defined in IRC:6. Basically, the following four design 
situations are considered, depending on the duration of the load and the frequency of occurrence of 
load combinations.
Persistent Design Situation (Basic Load Combinations)
It is the design situation that is relevant during a period of the same order as the design working life of 
the structure. Generally it refers to conditions of normal use.
This includes permanent and quasi-permanent loads as well as variable loads like live load, wind, 
hydraulic loads like water current buoyancy etc.



======================================================================
PAGE 209 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
199
Transient Design Situation
It is the design situation that is relevant during a period much shorter than the design working life of 
the structure but which has a high probability of occurrence.
A transient design situation refers to temporary conditions of the structure, of use, or exposure, such as 
those arising during construction or when restrictions are put on its use.
Accidental Design Situation
It is the design situation involving exceptional conditions of the structure or its exposure, including 
fire, explosion, impact or local failure.
For concrete bridge structures, vehicle impact load is usually considered. The fire hazard or explosion 
pressures, if specified, (e.g. as in case of material storage or human occupancy below city flyovers) 
shall be based on the Indian Standards specifying fire resistance (as per IS 456, IS 1641 and IS 1642) 
and blast resistance (as per IS 4991).
Seismic Design Situation
It is the design situation involving exceptional conditions of the structure when subjected to a seismic 
event.
Generally, it is not economical to design bridge structure to remain within elastic limits when subjected 
to ‘Design Basis Earthquake’ which is defined in IRC:SP:114. Parts of the bridge structure are permitted 
to suffer damage during the design event. At higher level of seismic event, the bridge elements are 
expected to suffer large but repairable damage without failure or collapse. Presently, IRC:SP:114 
is specifying force-based design methods, which are deemed to achieve the aim of satisfactory 
performance. 
Since the structural behaviour of the bridge under seismic conditions is completely different (i.e. non-
elastic response is considered) from the response to other loads (which are essentially in elastic range), 
the seismic situations are separately treated.

Limit States to be Considered
(1)	
Limit States of Strength (ULS)
	
Three limit states are checked:
	
(i)	
Stability of overall structure or its elements,
	
(ii)	
Failure of members or the whole structure by buckling of its elements,
	
(iii)	 Failure of member at its critically loaded section under action of axial force, bending 
moment, shear, and torsion.
(2)	
Limit States of Serviceability (SLS)
	
Following limit states of serviceability are covered in this Code:
	
(i)	
Limit state of stresses
	
(ii)	
Limit state of deformation (deflection)

(iii)	 Limit state of crack width
Other limit states such as limit state of vibration and limit state of fatigue may be important for some 
bridge structures. Specialist literature or international standards may be referred for the same.
Different serviceability limit states are governed by different sets of load combinations. The following 
sets of load combinations are defined in Section 12.
(a)	
Rare combinations (also called Characteristic Combination or Infrequent 
Combination)
	
In these situations bridge elements, are subjected to maximum design loads leading to 
maximum stress levels. These basic combinations are used for checking ‘limit state of 
maximum stress levels’ in bridge elements.
(b)	
Frequent Combinations
	
These represent design situations that occur repeatedly in service. 
	
The maximum allowable deflections, crack width in prestressed elements with bonded 
tendons (and vibration where specified) are checked for the frequently occurring situation.
(c)	
Quasi-Permanent Combinations
	
These combinations are used to consider long term action effects. Crack widths in reinforced 
concrete elements and prestressed elements with unbonded tendons where durability is 
affected and effects of settlement, creep etc., caused by permanent or more or less permanent 
actions listed in A-1.2(1), are evaluated with quasi-permanent combinations.

ANNEXURE A-2
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND DATA ABOUT PROPERTIES OF  
CONCRETE AND STEEL
A2.1	
General
Section 6 gives values of various design properties. The co-relations on which these are based are 
given in the following Sub-sections. Also, the expressions for creep and shrinkage for different types of 
cements and in different conditions of relative humidity, are given. Effect of high temperature curing, 
and multi-axial stresses is indicated. High temperature curing also increases the rate of relaxation loss 
of steel in pre-tensioned precast members. Method of calculating the same is given.
An informative Sub-section is added about partial material factor for concrete, and use of cores taken 
for measuring in-situ strength of concrete structures. The test results of cores taken from existing 
structure are also used for retrofitting of old bridges by using probable equivalent design cube strength 
fck, few observations on the co-relation between the two are given for guidance of designers.
For more detailed information on these and various other properties of concrete which may be needed 
for special applications, while still using the general principles of this Code specialist literature may 
be referred.
A2.2	
Co-relation between Compressive Cube Strength and Other Concrete Properties
Table 6.5 gives directly the design properties of concrete in terms of its 28 days compressive (cube) 
strength. The values are based on the following co-relationships, which are experimentally established. 
However, the scatter in values is larger than the scatter in cube strengths, since co-relationship is not 
exact, but is a best fit to actual data.

Development of Strength with Time
(1)	
Gain of strength with time
Equations given in Clause 6.4.2.2 are valid for concretes made from ordinary Portland Cements. For 
other types of cements mentioned in Section 18, the value of ‘S’ in equations may be modified as 
follows :
	
S = 0.2 for rapid hardening high strength cements.
	
= 0.38 for slow hardening cement.
A2.4	
Effect of High Temperature on Strength (Clause 6.4.2.2)
In case of heat curing the compressive strength of concrete at age ‘t’ before 28 days, fcm(t) may be 
estimated from expression 6.2 & 6.3 in which the concrete age ‘t’ is substituted by temperature adjusted 
concrete age (maturity) obtained from Eq. A2-13.
The effect of elevated or reduced temperatures within the range 0 - 80°C on the maturity of concrete 
may be taken into account by adjusting the concrete age according to the following expression:

Partial Safety Factor γc for Concrete
The material partial factor γc of concrete includes consideration of various factors as described below.
Partial material safety factor γc which is considered to have a value of 1.5, consists of two parts.
The first part is the factor γM = γM1. γM2=1.3, which considers unfavourable deviation of concrete 
strength from its characteristic value fck, model uncertainties, variation of geometrical properties and 
overall safety level. It is based on log-normal distribution:
	
γM	= exp [αR.β.VR – 1.645VR]

αR = 0.8	 Sensitivity factor for resistance.

second part of γc is a conversion factor γ conv =1.15, used with cylindrical strength which takes into 
account the decrease of in-place strength versus the characteristic strength fck. In the literature the 
inverse value of 0.85 often is used. (This factor for use with cube strength becomes 0.67). The mean 
values of concrete compressive strength controlled at plant and the mean value of in-situ concrete 
compressive strength are approximately of the same magnitude for the concrete age at 28 days. But 
due to other effects, such as transportation temperature changes, placing, compaction and curing, the 
variation of insitu concrete strength is essentially larger (coefficient of variation is about 0.23) than the 
variation of strength of concrete at plant (coefficient of variation is about 0.13). Therefore, the safety 
factor γM =1.3 is not adequate to cover this increase of variation and additional factor should be used 
γ conv.To find this additional factor the in-situ strength, or a ratio 
s
ck

f
  was evaluated. In-situ strength of 
concrete was considered as a random variable (log-normally distributed). Based on the German and 
Canadian data the 5 percent fractile of this ratio was found as a value of 0.90 for columns and walls 
and as a value of 0.83 for slabs and beams. These results corroborate the use of γconv =1.15, increasing 
γm from 1.3 to 1.5 which correspond to the factor 0.85 used with the cylinder strength (or 0.67 used 
with cube strength).

Relaxation of Steel
The relaxation loss shall be obtained from the manufacturers test certificates, and verified by 
independent tests, if required. Relaxation characteristics are dependent on the manufacturing process. 
In the absence of specific data, for steels conforming to BIS codes, the following relationships may be 
used for calculation of relaxation loss up to 30 years. The long term loss after 50 years may be taken 
as three times the 1000 hour loss. Eq. A2-38 is a general equation describing relationship between 
relaxation loss at time t in hours (ρt) and that at 1000 hours (ρ1000). The exponent 'k' in the equation is 
approximately given by log (ρ1000 / ρ100).

hour relaxation loss value at not more than 5 percent and 100 hour relaxation loss as not more than 3.5 
percent, k is 0.155. 
Wires/strands of low relaxation for which IS 14268 specifies 1000 hour relaxation value at not less 
than 2.5 percent and 100 hour value at not less than 1.8 percent, k is 0.143.
For bars/rods, IS 2090 does not specify 100 hour relaxation loss value. Also 1000 hour relaxation loss 
value is not expressed as % value. For this reason the applicable strength, ρ1000 , ρ100 loss values will 
have to be obtained from the manufacturer’s data.

For steels conforming to other national standards reference shall be made to the respective standards.
A2.12	
Effect of High Temperature Curing on Relaxation of Steel
For pre-tensioned members, the effect on the relaxation losses of increasing the temperature while 
curing the concrete, shall be considered.
The relaxation is accelerated during the application of thermal curing when thermal strain is introduced 
at the same time. Finally, the relaxation rate is reduced at the end of the treatment.
An equivalent time teq should be added to the time after tensioning 't' in the relaxation time functions to 
cater for the effects of the heat treatment on the prestress loss due to the relaxation of the prestressing 
steel. This equivalent time can be estimated from the expression:

TESTS ON MILD STEEL & CORRUGATED HDPE SHEATHING DUCTS
1.0	
FOR MILD STEEL SHEATHING DUCTS
All tests specified below shall be carried out on the same sample in the order given below. At least 3 
samples for one lot of supply (not exceeding 7000 metre length) shall be tested.
1.1	
Workability Test
A test sample 1100 mm long is soldered to a fixed base plate with a soft solder (Fig. A5-1). The sample 
is then bent to a radius of 1800 mm alternately on either side to complete 3 cycles.
Thereafter, the sealing joints will be visually inspected to verify that no failure or opening has taken 
place.
Fig. A5-1. Workability Test
1.2	
Transverse Load Rating Test
The test ensures that stiffness of the sheathing is sufficient to prevent permanent distortion during site 
handling.

The sample is placed on a horizontal support 500 mm long so that the sample is supported at all points 
of outward corrugations.
A load as specified in Table-A5-1 below is applied gradually at the centre of the supported portion 
through a circular contact surface of 12 mm dia. Couplers shall be placed so that the load is applied 
approximately at the centre of two corrugations, Fig. A5-2. The load as specified below is applied in 
increments.

Water Loss Test
The sample is sealed at one end. The sample is filled with water and after sealing, the end is connected 
to a system capable of applying a pressure of 0.05 MPa, Fig. A5-4 and kept constant for 5 minutes, 
hand pump and pressure gauge or stand pipe system can be used.
Fig. A5-4 Water Loss Test
The sample is acceptable if the water loss does not exceed 1.5 per cent of the volume . The volume is 
worked out as follows:
Another sample 500 mm long is sealed at one end and the volume of hollow space arrived at by 
pouring water from a measuring cylinder.
The computation of relative profile volume is worked out as follows:
Va	
-	 Premeasured quantity of water in measuring cylinder
Vb	
-	 Balance quantity of water left in the cylinder after completely filling of the test sample
Actual Volume ‘Vp’ = Va - Vb
Relative Profile Volume = Vp - (πφ2l/4)/(πφl) cm3/ cm3
Where l is length of specimen and φ is internal nominal dia. of sheathing.
1.5	
Specification for Sheathing Duct Joints
The sheathing ducts shall be of the spiral corrugated type. For major projects, the sheathing ducts 
should preferably be manufactured at the project site utilising appropriate machines. With such an 
arrangement, long lengths of sheathing ducts may be used with consequent reduction in the number of 
joints and couplers.
Where sheathing duct joints are unavoidable, such joints shall be made cement slurry tight by the 
use of corrugated threaded sleeve couplers which can be tightly screwed on to the outer side of the 
sheathing ducts. A heat-shrink coupler could also be used if suitable.



======================================================================
PAGE 228 of 256

Typical details of a sleeve coupler is shown in Fig. A5-5. The length of the coupler should not be less 
than 150 mm but should be increased upto 200 mm wherever practicable. The joints between the ends 
of the coupler and the duct shall be sealed with adhesive sealing tape to prevent penetration of cement 
slurry during concreting. The couplers of adjacent ducts should be staggered wherever practicable. 
As far as possible, couplers should not be located in curved zones. The corrugated sleeve couplers are 
being conveniently manufactured using the sheath making machine with the next higher size of die set.

The heat-shrink coupler Fig. A5-6 is supplied in the form of bandage rolls which can be used for all 
diameters of sheathing ducts. The bandage is coated on the underside with a heat sensitive adhesive 
so that after heating the bandage material shrinks in to the sheathing and ensures formation of a leak 
proof joint, without the need for extra taping or support in the form of corrugated sleeve couplers. The 
heating is effected by means of a soft gas flame.

For Corrugated Hdpe Sheathing Ducts
A summary of all the requirements, methods of verification, and acceptance criteria for the polymer 
duct system together with the components and material is given in Table A5-2 below. The Table is in 
line with the technical report Bulletin 75 published by Fib titled “Polymer – duct systems for internal 
bonded post-tensioning”.

ANNEXURE A-6
DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR CONSTRUCTION STAGES
A6-1	
General
(1)	
For bridges built in stages, the design and detailing shall take into account of the 
construction procedure, sequence etc., as appropriate. Some situations are illustrated 
in the following.
	
a)	
Where forces, other than those produced on the completed structure, occur in 
any structural section during the phases of construction (e.g. deck erection by 
incremental launching, bridges built by balanced cantilever, change in sections 
during construction, change of support conditions during construction etc.).
	
b)	
Where redistribution of forces due to creep, shrinkage and steel relaxation is 
originated by changes to the structural arrangement during the construction 
process (e.g. continuous bridges built span by span on false work or by cantilever).
	
c)	
Where distribution of stresses due to creep, shrinkage and steel relaxation is 
originated by changes to structural sections during the construction process (e.g. 
decks consisting of precast beams and an insitu slab).
	
d)	
Where the erection or construction sequence may have an influence on the 
stability of the structure / capacity of section during construction, the forces in 
the completed structure, or the geometry of the completed structure.
(2)	
For structures in which any of the circumstances described in paragraphs (1) a) to d) 
apply, the serviceability limit states and ultimate limit states should be verified during 
various construction stages.
(3)	
For structures in which the circumstances described in paragraphs (1) b) or c) apply, long 
term values of forces or stresses should be determined from an analysis of redistribution 
effects. Step by step or approximate methods may be used in these calculations.
(4)	
For structures in which the circumstances described in paragraph (1) d) apply erection 
and casting sequences / procedures should be indicated on drawings or detailed in 
a construction procedure document along with assumed construction and equipment 
loads / configurations etc.
A6-2	
Actions & Effects to be considered during construction
For the verifications of equilibrium and limit states during various construction stages following 
construction loads and erection effects shall be considered.



======================================================================
PAGE 233 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
223
A6-2.1	
General
(1)	
Distributed construction live load taken as 50 kg/m2 of deck area for cantilever 
construction, sequential / span by span construction etc.
(2)	
Specialized construction equipment load from launching gantry, form traveler, beam 
and winch, movement of precast segments over constructed portion etc.
(3)	
Dynamic load of equipment may be taken as 10% of the lifting load.
(4)	
Longitudinal forces arising from construction equipment loads according to the type of 
the machinery.
(5)	
Unbalanced load resulting from sequence / construction stage. 
(6)	
Horizontal wind load on structure shall be taken in accordance with the provisions of 
IRC:6 for construction stages.
(7)	
Effects arising from imposed deformations shall be taken into account. These effects 
can be of permanent nature, depending upon the situation. In such situations the strains 
and stresses shall be algebraically superimposed as per applicable section at various 
construction stages. 
(8)	
The support restraints during all construction stages shall be ensured for stability 
against sliding and overturning. The situation may arise when restraint, particularly 
in longitudinal direction, may be absent during construction stage. Need of temporary 
restraint for this situation shall be either accounted for in suggested sequence & 
detailing or constructor shall be instructed to provide appropriate restraint.
A6-2.2	
For cantilever construction
(1)	
A differential Dead Load of 2 % on the unfavorable side of the cantilever shall be 
considered for verification of equilibrium.
(2)	
For verification of equilibrium under the accidental combination, dynamic response 
due to accidental release of precast segment taken as equivalent to additional static 
load as 100% of the weight of the precast segment. 
A6-3	
Verification criteria
A6-3.1	
Verification for static equilibrium
The equilibrium of the structure shall be verified for the combinations as per Table B.1 of IRC:6.
A6-3.2	
Ultimate limit states
ULS verifications required for design during construction are the same as those given in sections 
8, 9, 10 & 11.



======================================================================
PAGE 234 of 256
======================================================================
IRC:112-2020
224
A6- 3.3	
Serviceability limit states
(1)	
Serviceability criteria for the completed structure need not be applied to intermediate 
construction stages, provided that durability and final appearance of the completed 
structure are not affected (e.g. crack width and deformations) and comply with 
applicable provisions of the Code.
(2)	
The idea of frequent combination does not exist during construction and also limit states 
related to durability are not pertinent for short term-phases as such limiting stresses in 
concrete to 0.48 fck(t) and steel to 0.8 fyk under rare combination during construction is 
adequate.
(3)	
For bridges or element of bridges in which limit state of decompression is checked 
on the completed structure, tensile stresses less than fctm(t) under the quasi permanent 
combination during construction is permitted.
(4)	
Prestressing effects may be taken as γsup= γinf= 1.0 during the construction.

CONCRETE SHELL ELEMENTS
B1.1	
This section applies to shell elements, in which there are generally eight components of 
internal forces. The eight components of internal forces are listed below and shown in Figure B1.1.1 
for an element of unit dimensions:
	
-	
3 plate components ηEdx ,ηEdy and  ηEdxy= ηEdyx
	
-	
3 slab components mEdx , mEdy and  mEdxy= mEdyx
	
-	
2 transverse shear forces vEdx , vEdy,
Fig. B1-1 Shell Element
B1.2	
The first stage in the verification procedure is to establish if the shell element is uncracked 
or cracked. 
B1.3	
In uncracked elements the only verification required is to check that the minimum principle 
stress is smaller than the design compressive strength fcd. It may be appropriate to take into account the 
multiaxial compression state in the definition of fcd.
B1.4	
In cracked elements a sandwich model should be used for design or verification of the shell 
element.
B1.5	
In the sandwich model three layers are identified (Fig. B1.2): The two outer layers resist the 
membrane actions arising form ηEdx, ηEdy, ηEdxy,  mEdx, mEdy, mEdxy and the inner layer carries the shear forces 
vEdx, vEdy. The thickness of the different layers should be established by means of an iterative procedure 
(B1.13 and B1.15) (Fig. B1.2).
B1.6	
The inner layer should be designed according to 10.3 taking into account the principal 
shear, its principal direction and the longitudinal reinforcement components in that direction (B1.13 to 
B1.15).

If the verification in (B1-12) above is not satisfied, one of the following procedures shall be 
followed.
a)	
increase the concrete cover and consequently reduce the internal lever arm;
b)	
use different values for zn and zt with zn>zt , internal concrete stresses should then be added 
vectorially; 
c)	
Increase the layer thickness to satisfy the concrete verification and leave the reinforcement 
position unchanged. This will cause the reinforcement to become eccentric in the layer; as a 
consequence two internal bending moments arise, and these should be in equilibrium within 
the shell element. In these circumstances, the forces in internal reinforcement become:

INFORMATIVE ANNEXURE B-2
MECHANISMS OF DETERIORATION OF CONCRETE STRUCTURES
This Annexure gives description of the main deterioration mechanisms which may need to be considered 
in design.
B2.1	
Corrosion of Reinforcement/Prestressing Tendons
In normal circumstances, the highly alkaline nature of concrete protects steel embedded within it. The pH 
value of the pore solution in concrete is generally in the region of 12 to 14. The protection is afforded by the 
formation of a very thin, coherent layer of iron oxide over the surface of the steel bar under such alkaline 
conditions. Steel protected in this way is described as being in a passive state. Steel will not generally 
corrode in uncontaminated concrete until the pH drops below 10. Two mechanisms, which can lead to the 
destruction of this passive state, are:- 
(1)	
Carbonation of Concrete
This is a reaction between carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the calcium hydroxide in the hydrated 
cement matrix. This process starts at the surface and with time, penetrates slowly into the concrete. The 
rate of penetration of carbonation into the concrete, is the highest, where the relative humidity is in the 
range 50 to 70 percent. It is lower at higher humidities, being effectively zero at 100 percent. The rate is 
also lower at lower humidities, being effectively zero at (zero) percent humidity, because carbonation can 
not take place without presence of water. The rate of carbonation will be lower in good quality concrete 
as compared to that in poor quality concerete. The rate of carbonation depends on the rate at which carbon 
dioxide can diffuse into the concrete. This will decrease with a decrease in the water/cement ratio. The 
effect of carbonation is to reduce the alkalinity of the concrete surrounding the reinforcement to a level 
where the natural protection is lost.
(2)	
The presence of Chlorides in Concrete
Chlorides have the capacity to destroy the passivity of steel locally, even where the alkalinity remains 
high, giving rise to ‘pitting corrosion’. Chlorides may get into the concrete from various sources, but the 
commonest are seawater in marine environments; chloride ions, if any, contained in the ingredients of 
concrete, particularly the mix water; and de-icing chemicals on bridge decks as used in colder climates. The 
rate of ingress of chloride into the concrete depends upon the amount of chloride in the service environment 
in contact with the concrete surface and on the quality of the concrete. Once the passivity of the steel has 
been destroyed, occurrence of corrosion of steel requires only two things; sufficient moisture and sufficient 
oxygen. It is found that these two requirements can act against each other since, if the concrete is wet, 
oxygen cannot penetrate and if it is dry, there is insufficient moisture for the reaction to progress. As a 
result, the greatest risk of corrosion is in members subjected to alternate wetting and drying.
B2.2	
Frost Attack
If saturated concrete is subjected to frequent freezing and thawing, the expansive effects of ice formation 
will disrupt the concrete. The usual manifestations of frost damage are surface spalling or the formation of 
closely spaced surface cracks. Concrete, which is not close to being saturated, is not at risk from frost as 
the expansion that occurs on freezing can be accommodated in the pores not filled with water. Except in a 
few areas in colder regions of the country, frost attack may not pose a significant problem.

B2.3	
Alkali-aggregate Reactions
There are two basic forms of reaction which occasionally occur and can damage concrete:  viz. - the alkali-
silica reaction and the alkali-carbonate reaction. The alkali-silica reaction is the more common in India. 
It is a reaction between the alkalis (sodium and potassium salts) in the cement and certain forms of glassy 
or crypto-crystalline silica in the aggregate, which results in the formation of a hygroscopic ‘silica gel’. 
This gel expands when in contact with water, resulting in the formation of cracks, which may be large 
(several millimeters wide are not uncommon). In relatively unstressed and unreinforced concrete, these 
cracks can form a random ‘map’ pattern. In other cases, the cracks will tend to form parallel to the direction 
of compressive stress or reinforcement. The cracks are usually not deep, only extending 50-70 mm into 
the section. Their effect on structural performance is not as great as might be imagined from looking at 
the cracks. A reduction in the compressive and tensile strengths and modulus of elasticity of the concrete 
occurs, but this is commonly not more than about 20-30 percent.
In India, siliceous rocks like granite, granite gneiss and schist, quartzite and sandstone, containing ‘strained 
quartz’ have been found to be reactive. The methods of evaluation are given in IS 2386; more refined 
methods of detection of reactivity of aggregates are being evolved, for which, specialist literature may be 
consulted.
B2.4	
Attack from Sulphates
In the presence of water, sulphate ions can react with the tricalcium aluminate component of the cement. 
This reaction causes expansion, leading to cracking and eventual disintegration of the concrete. The 
commonest source of sulphates is in the earth surrounding foundations but other sources are sometimes 
significant. Seawater contains significant amounts of sulphates in addition to chlorides. The severity of 
attack depends on the concentration of sulphate ions in the soil and subsoil water and in the environment.
B2.5	
Attack by Aggressive Chemicals
Effluents, vapours, fumes etc. from chemical and fertilizer industries can attack concrete, leading to its 
disintegration. In case of a bridge structure being exposed to such harmful chemicals due to proximity to 
such industries, the structure should be designed for ‘extreme’ exposure condition (Table 14.1). Protective 
coatings may be required. For further guidance, specialist literature may be referred.
B2.6	
Acid Attack
No concrete is acid resistant. Even mild acids can attack the calcium compounds in concrete, converting 
them to soluble salts, which can then leach away. The effect of acids is therefore to eat away, or render 
the surface of the concrete weak and permeable. Acid rain, for example, will do no more than etch the 
surface of the concrete over any reasonable design life. If the concrete is likely to be exposed to major 
amounts of acid, for example from some industrial process, the only way to avoid damage is to provide an 
impermeable coating to the concrete.
B2.7	
Abrasion
Abrasion of concrete surfaces may occur due to movement of boulders, sand or gravel suspended in turbulent 
water, or air borne sand particles. Resistance to abrasion can be obtained by using higher strength concrete 
and abrasion resistant aggregates. Resistance is also markedly improved by good curing of surfaces likely 
to be exposed to abrasive action.

INFORMATIVE ANNEXURE B-3
EFFECT OF LIVE LOADS ON DECK SLABS
B3.1	
Scope
The effect of concentrated loads on slabs spanning in one or two directions or on cantilever slabs may 
be calculated from the influence fields of such loads or by any other rational method. A value of 0.2 
may be assumed for Poisson’s ratio. A simplified method for estimating the action of concentrated 
loads on slab, based on effective width method for cantilever and simply supported slab, is described 
below, which may be used where more detailed calculations are not performed.
B3.2	
Effective Width
The bending moment per unit width of slab caused by concentrated loads on solid slabs spanning in 
one direction or on cantilever slabs, may also be calculated by assessing the width of slab that may be 
taken as effective in resisting the bending moment due to the concentrated loads. For precast slabs, the 
term ‘actual width of slab’ used in this Clause shall indicate the actual width of each individual precast 
unit.
Slabs designed on the above basis need not be checked for shear.
(1)	
Solid slab spanning in one direction
	
(i)	
For a single concentrated load, the effective width may be calculated in accordance 
with the following equation:
	
	

	
where
	
bef	
= the effective width of slab on which the load acts,
	
lo	
= the effective span,
	
a	
= the distance of the centre of gravity of the concentrated load from the nearer support,
	
b1	
= the breadth of concentration area of the load, i.e., the dimension of the tyre or 
track contact area over the road surface of the slab in a direction at right angles to 
the span plus twice the thickness of the wearing coat or surface finish above the 
structural slab, and
	
α	
= a constant having the following values depending upon the ratio b/lo where b is the 
width of the slab.
	
	
Provided that the effective width shall not exceed the actual width of the slab; and 
provided further that in case of a load near the unsupported edge of a slab, the effective 
width shall not exceed the above value nor half the above value plus the distance of 
the load from the unsupported edge.

(ii)	
For two or more concentrated loads in a line in the direction of the span, the bending 
moment per unit width of slab shall be calculated separately for each load according 
to its appropriate effective width of slab calculated as in (i) above.
	
(iii)	 For two or more loads not in a line in the direction of the span: If the effective width 
of slab for one load overlaps the effective width of slab for an adjacent load, the 
resultant effective width for the two loads equals the sum of the respective effective 
widths for each load minus the width of overlap, provided that the slab so designed is 
tested for the two loads acting separately.
(2)	
Solid slab cantilever
	
(i)	
For a single concentrated load, the effective width may be calculated in accordance 
with the following equation:
	
	
bef = 1.2a +b1
Eq. B3.2
	
where
	
bef 	
= the effective width,
	
a	
= the distance of the centre of gravity of the concentrated load from the face of the 
cantilever support, and
	
b1	
= the breadth of concentration area of load, i.e., the dimension of the tyre or track 
contact area over the road surface of the slab in a direction parallel to the supporting 
edge of the cantilever plus twice the thickness of wearing coat or surface finish 
above the structural slab.
	
	
Provided that the effective width of the cantilever slab shall not exceed one-third the 
length of the cantilever slab measured parallel to the support. And provided further that 
when the concentrated load is placed near one of the two extreme ends of the length 
of cantilever slab in the direction parallel to the support, the effective width shall not 
exceed the above value, nor shall it exceed half the above value plus the distance of 
the concentrated load from the nearer extreme end measured in the direction parallel 
to the fixed edge.

(ii)	
For two or more concentrated loads
	
	
If the effective width of slab for one load overlaps the effective width of slab for an 
adjacent load, resultant effective width for the two loads shall be taken as equal to 
the sum of the respective effective width for each load minus the width of overlap, 
provided that the slab so designed is tested for the two loads acting separately.
B3.3	
Dispersion of Loads along the Span
The effect of contact of wheel or track load in the direction of span length shall be taken as equal to the 
dimension of the tyre contact area over the wearing surface of the slab in the direction of the span plus 
twice the overall depth of the slab inclusive of the thickness of the wearing surface.
B3.4	
Dispersion of Loads through Fills and Wearing Coat 
The dispersion of loads through fills and wearing coat shall be assumed at 45°, both along and 
perpendicular to the span.
