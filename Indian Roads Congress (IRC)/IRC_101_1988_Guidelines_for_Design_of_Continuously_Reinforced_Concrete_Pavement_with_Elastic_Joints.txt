1.2.
These Guidelines were considered by the Specifications &
Standards Committee
in their meetings held
at New Delhi on the 28th
August,
1986 and 23rd
April,
1987 and were returned back
to the
Cement Concrete Road Surfacing Committee for further consideration.
These Guidelines were then finalised by Dr. M.P.
Dhir, the present
Convenor and
Shri
S.S.
Seehra, the present Member-Secretary of the
Committee.
The document received from the Cement Concrete Road
Surfacing
Committee
was
reconsidered
by
the
Highways
Specifications & Standards Committee
in
their meeting held on the
25th April, 1988 at New Delhi and approved. These Guidelines received
the approval of the Executive Committee and the Council
in
their
meetings held on the 26th April and 7th May,
1988
respectively.
1.3.
The technique of continuously reinforced concrete pavement
(CRCP) obviates the need
for expansion and contraction joints, thus
1



======================================================================

IRC: 101-1988
permitting very long slab lengths with improved riding comfort and
reduced maintenance
as compared
to
plain concrete pavements.
Conventional CRCP requires relatively high percentage of steel of the
order of 0.7-1.0 per cent of concrete cross-section.
The technique of
CRCP construction with
elastic joints (CRCP-EJ) enables
significant
reduction
in quantity of steel required (0.4
-
0.5
per cent) and
also
eliminates
the
random
cracks
which
occur
in
conventional
continuously reinforced concrete pavements.
1.4. The provision of continuous reinforcement
in CRCP of the
conventional
type results
in the formation of transverse cracks
in the
pavement which are held tightly closed by the steel without impairment
of structural
strength.
The closely held cracks ensure load transfer
across the cracks through aggregate interlocking and
also prevent the
ingress of water and
grit into the cracks.
The width and spacing of
such cracks
are dependant on
the amount of steel reinforcement
provided.
The greater the amount of steel, the closer
is the spacing of
the cracks and the smaller
is
their opening.
An optimum amount of
longitudinal reinforcement
is called
for so that the cracks
are neither
too widely spaced with resulting over-stressing of steel,
loss
in load
transfer provided by aggregate
interlock and accelerated corrosion of
steel; nor too closely spaced so
as to cause disintegration of the slab.
1.5.
The elastic joints consist of dummy contraction joints with
the reinforcement continuous through them.
The reinforcement
is
painted with
a bond-breaking medium over
a specified design length
on
either side of the joint groove to provide adequate gauge length
for limiting the
steel strains due to joint movement.
A typical
elastic
joint for the solved example given
in Appendix,
is shown
in Fig.
1.
1.6.
The use of elastic joints, apart from resulting in reduction of
steel
stresses by about 50 per cent and enabling the use of
less
quantity of steel,
also preclude the random cracking associated with
conventional construction, since the weakened plane provided
at such
joints
localises the cracking.
The usual spacing of such joints works
out to about 4 to
5 m.

the slab movement due to shrinkage and temperature change, and thus
induces
stresses
in both
steel and concrete.
However,
if steel
is
provided
at mid-depth of the
slab,
as
is the usual
practice, no
stress
will develop
in
it due to wheel load and warping.
2.1.2.
The stresses (due to continuity of steel at elastic joints) in
steel,
(g v ), and concrete, (g c ),
in the vicinity of elastic joints may be
calculated from Eisenmann equations which are given below:

Difference between the mean temperatures of the slab

slab.
Note: While finding out the temperature stress at the edge, IRC:58
recommends definite values of temperature differential
in
different
states of India.
This
differential
has been
designated as At in IRC:58 and
is different from A T which
is used
in
this
text
to designate temperature difference
between
the minimum
of minimums
and
the mean
temperature
at the time
of construction. A T
is
not
a
function of slab thickness whereas At the temperature
differential depends on the thickness of slab.

The steel stresses so determined should not exceed
the permissible value of 1400 kg/cm

. The concrete stresses are additive
to the load and temperature warping
stresses and
are required
to be
taken
into account
while designing the pavement.
The transverse
steel may be taken as 25 per cent of longitudinal
steel.

2.1.4.
The provision of steel
enables some
increase
in the
effective slab thickness and
its continuity
at elastic joints provides
additional load transfer over and above that provided by conventional
dummy contraction joint.
At the same time, the percentage of steel
is
small enough not
to induce any restraint
to bending of the
slab
at
elastic joints due to effect of wheel load and temperature warping.
2.1 .5.
While in CRCP without elastic joints the permissible stress
in steel
in 2800 kg/cm
2 (i.e. the steel
is allowed to be stressed upto the
6



======================================================================
PAGE 11 of 16
======================================================================
IRC: 101-1988
yield
point), the permissible value
in CRCP with
elastic joints
is
restricted to 1400 kg/cm
2 only (i.e. normal working stress in steel used
in conventional
structures).
The lower permissible
stress
in
steel
in
CRCP with
elastic joints enables taking advantage of the effective
increase in concrete slab thickness due to provision of steel, while the
permissible yield
stress
limit
in
steel
in the case of CRCP without
elastic joint precludes such
increase.
2.2.
Design of Slab Thickness
2.2.1.
Initially, the thickness of plain cement concrete pavement
should be worked out as per IRC:58.
While working out the thickness,
the additional concrete
tensile
stress should be accounted
for
as
indicated in para 2.1.3.
2.2.2.
The effective increase
in slab thickness due to provision
of steel reinforcement may be worked out by using Mallinger's chart
given
in
Fig.
4.
The equivalent
CRCP
slab thickness may then be
calculated by reducing the thickness calculated
in para 2.2.1, by the
amount of the effective increase
in
slab thickness using
Fig.
4 the
average of steel
in
longitudinal and transverse direction may be
taken.
2.2.3.
Outline of design procedure
Step
I
: Assume
a thickness and examine wheel
load and temperature
stresses as per IRC:58.
Step
II:
For a proposed value, choose a steel percentage from Fig. 2 such
that the steel stress is within the permissible value.
Calculate the
concrete
stress from Fig.
3.
In calculating these
stresses
the
ordinates are to be multiplied by the corresponding value of
t, as
applicable to the particular location.
Step III: Add the concrete stress calculated in Step II to the value obtained
in Step
I and the final total stresses should be within the flexural
strength of concrete. The trials may be repeated till the assumed
thickness in Step
I meets the requirement.
Step IV:
Calculate the effective increase in slab thickness due to provision
of reinforcement as per Fig. 4 (vide para 2.2.2.) and reduce the
thickness obtained
in Step
III to account for the increase.
An
illustrative example
is given
in Appendix.

Cement Concrete Mix Design
The mix should be designed on the basis of absolute volume
method
as per IRC.44 - "Tentative Guidelines
for Cement Concrete
Mix Design".
The flexural strength of concrete at 28 days
in the field
should not be
less 40 kg/cm
2
.

Should conform to IS
:
269 or IS
:

1
1 2.
3.2.
Coarse and Fine Aggregate
Should conform to IS
: 383.
3.3.
Steel
The diameter of steel
bars should be so choosen
as to keep the

spacing, between bars around 25
to 35 cms.
Steel should conform to
IS
:
432 (Part I)- Mild Steel.
3.4.
Water
Water used for both mixing and curing should be clean and free
from injurious amount of deleterious matter and should conform to
IS:456.
Potable water
is generally considered
satisfactory.
4. CONSTRUCTION DETAILS
4.1.
General
The construction
details
are the same
as
in the case of plain
cement concrete pavements (vide IRC: 15) except the following.
4.2.
Construction of Joints
4.2.1.
Elastic joints
:
These are dummy type joints which should
be induced
at intervals similar to that for dummy contraction joints.
The joint grooves may be formed as in the case of conventional dummy
joint, and filled with sealing compound.
Alternatively, bitumen-coated
plywood strips of 50 mm width and
3 mm thickness may be inserted
therein.
On either side of the elastic joint, steel should be coated with
bitumen
for a length of 1/3
-
1/4 joint spacing
in order to break the
bond of steel with concrete and to provide greater length for elongation
of the
steel due
to joint opening
for reducing the
stress
in
the
reinforcing
steel.
4.2.2.
Expansion joints
: The expansion joints are provided only
at the ends of the CRCP-EJ sections and there
is no need of providing
these in-between.
The width of such expansion joints
is kept upto
double that of conventional concrete pavement
to accommodate the
greater end movements.
Details of these joints should be as shown
in
IRC: 15.
5. REINFORCEMENT
The steel mats, assembled
at
site, are placed over suitable chairs
at mid depth of the slab
before concreting
is done.
The bars should
be continuous across elastic joints and any construction joints.
Where
overlap of bars
is required, a minimum overlap of 30 diameters should
be provided.
Such overlaps should be staggered.
It should
also be
ensured
that no overlap of steel
bars
are provided
at the location of
elastic joints.
