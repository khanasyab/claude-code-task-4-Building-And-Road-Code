INTERIM GUIDELINES FOR WARM MIX ASPHALT
1 INTRODUCTION
This document presents the guidelines for the production and construction of Warm Mix
Asphalt (WMA) pavement. This technology, which is already in use in the USA and a number
of European countries and on a trial basis in India as well, has a great potential of full scale
use in the country because of its inherent advantages in terms of reduction of green house has
emissions and economy
in construction (because of less fuel consumption
in construction)
as well as elimination of suspected health hazards to construction workers (according to
some studies the fumes from
hot bituminous mixes
is a
health
hazard). The guidelines
would need to be further refined and amended
in course of time with experience gained
with widespread use of the technology and therefore, this document may be considered as
interim guidelines.
The draft document "Interim Guidelines for Warm Mix Asphalt" was
first outlined by Prof.
P.S. Kandhal and thereafter brought into shape by Dr. Sunil Bose, Co-Convenor,
Flexible
Pavement Committee (H-2). Ms. Ambika Behl, Scientist, CRRI also assisted in the preparation
of the draft document with her valuable inputs and vast field knowledge. The Committee
deliberated on the
draft document
in a series of meetings.
The H-2 Committee
finally,
approved the draft document
in
its meeting held on 21^' December, 2013
and authorized
the Convenor, H-2 Committee to send the final draft for placing before the HSS Committee.
The Highways Specifications & Standards Committee (HSS) approved the draft document
in
its meeting held on
7'^ January, 2014. The Executive Committee
in
its meeting held on
9'^ January, 2014 approved the same document for placing
it before the Council. The Council
in its 201^* meeting held at Guwahati, Assam on 19*^ January, 2014 approved the draft "Interim
Guidelines for Warm Mix Asphalt" for publishing.

2 SCOPE
2.1
The Guidelines describe:
i)
A range of warm mix technologies, which have potential for use in bituminous
construction like Dense Bituminous Macadam (DBM), Bituminous Concrete
(BC) meeting the
quality and performance requirements
of !RC:111
and
Recycled Asphalt Pavements (RAP).
ii)
The essential requirements of collaborative effort between the technology
provider/the product supplier on the one hand and the contracting agency on
the other with a view to promoting the use of the warm mix technology.
2.2
Since the Warm Mix Asphalt technology uses a variety of patented products as
additives, which come
in different forms such as solid,
liquid and powder and use different
processes for administering the additives and mixing, these guidelines do not prescribe any
specific product or process except in a generic manner at the level of technology.
2.3
The guidelines further recommend that the contracting authorities may accept any
technology that claims to meet the requirements of these guidelines provided such a claim is
(a) substantiated by laboratory and field tests, and (b) backed by a collaboration between the
contracting agency and the product/technology provider in a manner that ensures joint and
several responsibility.
3 OVERVIEW OF WARM MIX ASPHALT TECHNOLOGY
3.1
The basic principle of this technology is that by adding certain additives at the final
stages of the mix production, the coating of the aggregates by the binder is greatly enhanced
and can be achieved at a considerably less temperature (typically 30°C less) compared to
the hot mix process wherein bitumen
is heated to a sufficiently high temperature to make
it fluid enough to surround the aggregates and coat their surfaces.
In hot mix process,
it
is
viscosity of bitumen alone, which
is less at higher temperature, that plays the main role
in
coating of aggregates.
In warm mix technology, this can be achieved in three different ways,
viz. by increasing the volume of bitumen, by making the bitumen less viscous, by reducing
the surface tension at aggregate bitumen interface etc.

IRC:SP:101-2014
3.2
Currently there are more than 30
different WMA technologies,
using patented
processes and products, which have capabilities of bringing reduction in mixing, laydown and
compaction temperatures of bituminous mixes
in one of three different ways as described
above. These guidelines covers currently adopted Warm Mix Asphalt technologies globally,
classifying them
into four main
categories.
Currently there are altogether more than 30
different WMA technologies. Although the end effect of reduction of mixing, laydown and
compaction temperatures are the same, the different technologies work
in different ways.
The additives, which are either waxes or other hydrocarbon modifiers improve lubrication
by reducing the viscosity of bitumen and allow a reduction of 28°C to 40°C
in mixing and
compaction temperature. Typical dosage amounts are 0.5 to
1 .5 percent by weight of bitumen.
Sometimes these additives are also added as modifiers for increasing the stiffness of asphalt
mixes, for specialty applications, such as in racing tracks.
Waterbased Technologies
1)
Foaming
In essence,
the "water technologies" use
fine water droplets
to expand the volume
of
binder
in the mix by causing
it to foam. This has the
effect of increasing the volume of
the bitumen, enabling
it to coat aggregate at lower temperatures. The foaming technology
can be further subdivided
into two classes, foaming additives and water injection system.
The
foaming
process
works
by
creating
foamed
asphalt
that
improves
coating
and
compaction at lower temperature. Water expands
1 ,600 times when converted into steam at
atmospheric pressure, and the steam
is encapsulated by viscous bitumen producing foam,
which occupies a much greater volume compared to the original bitumen. The water for
creating the foam
is either added as water through a water injections stem
in a specialized
equipment, or from zeolites (which contain about 20 percent water). Water is added at a rate of
1 .25 to 2.0 percent by weight of bitumen (about 500 ml of water per ton of mix), whereas the
zeolites are added a rate of 0.1 to 0.3 percent by weight of the mix. Foaming by water allows
18°C to 30°C reduction
in temperature whereas foaming by zeolites allows a reduction of
30°C to 40°C.
i|
Water carrying chemical additives
Natural and synthetic zeolites are mineral additives used to introduce water
into the mix thereby creating "in-situ" foaming within the bitumen.
Zeolites in general are added to the mix with the filler during mixing process. As
the mixing temperature increases the zeolites slowly release their absorbed
water into the bitumen, which is dispersed throughout the mixture in the form
of very fine foam droplets. This causes an increase
in the volume of the
bitumen and leading to improvement in
its ability to coat the aggregate.
ii)
Wet fine aggregate addition systems
In this process the bituminous binder is added to the heated coarse aggregate
in the mixer. Once the coarse aggregate are well coated, fine aggregate at
ambient temperature with moisture content of around 3 percent is introduced.
The moisture vaporizes, causing the binder coating the coarse aggregate to
foam, which in turn encapsulates the fine aggregate.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:101-2014
2
Chemical Additives
WMA technologies utilize chemical additives that have little effect on rheological properties of
the binder. These products may be supplied
in pellet, powder or liquid form, and then mixed
into the binder or directly added to the mix. Chemical additives are Surfactants (surface active
agents) that reduce surface tension between the polar aggregates and non-polar bitumen,
improve wetting and reduces internal friction, and allows a reduction of 28-50°C
in mixing
and compaction temperatures. Typically they are added at the rate of 0.20 to 0.75 percent by
weight of bitumen.
3
Rheological IViodifiers
The wax based products can be described as viscosity modifying organic additives that reduce
binder viscosity at high temperatures and thus allow lower mixing and paving temperatures.
4
Hybrid Technologies
Hybrid technologies utilize a combination of two or more WMA technologies to achieve the
reduction in temperature. For example, Low Energy Asphalt (LEA) utilizes a chemical additive
with a water injection system to improve coating at lower temperatures.
5
Other Technologies
Finally, there are products that were originally developed for other uses, but do incorporate
the WMA technology for reducing temperature and hence better utilization of the product.
Examples are (sulfur and WMA) and TLAX (Trinidad lake asphalt and WMA technology).
The additives come
in different forms, such as liquid, powder,
pellet and are administered
in
the mix
production
process
at
different
stage. Accordingly, some
modification
in
the
bituminous mixing plants
is necessary to administer the controlled dosage of the additives.
Some additives in liquid form can be pre-blended with bitumen and would need no modification
in the conventional mixing plant provided the blended bitumen contains the right dose of
additive. Other additives, which are administered
in the mix at certain stage during the mix
production
process, would
require some
modification
in
the conventional
mixing
plants.
These modifications would generally require a separate material (additive) feed system and
a material metering system
(to ensure the
right dosage) which should be integrated with
computerized plant control system of the mixing plant. The water-based WMA technologies
would additionally need a water injection system as well.
Apart from such plant modification as required to administer the additives (described above),
some modification need would arise out of the need to operate the plant at reduced temperature
compared to that for the conventional hot mix production, for example recalibrating the fuel
burner, aggregate drying system, bitumen heating system as also to take care of the possible
consequences of lower temperature operation, such as contamination of the mix by un-burnt
fuel and trapped moisture, condensation of bag house fines, etc.
4 BENEFITS OF WARM WARM MIX ASPHALT
i)
Environmental Benefits: The single most important justification for use of
this technology
is that
it reduces the emission
of green house gases by
4



======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 24
======================================================================
IRC:SP:101-2014
around 25 to 30 percent and controls thereby global warming. This would
earn tradable carbon
credit. Secondly, the technology
is quite compatible
with Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement technology, which saves the requirement
of fresh aggregates and reduces the environmental hazard associated with
dumping of damaged pavement materials.
ii)
Health Benefits: The fumes from hot mix asphalt are known to be potential
health hazards, especially for the construction workers. Reduced temperature
of the mix avoids this health hazard.
ill)
Technical advantages:
a)
Lower
mixing
temperature
reduces
the
oxidation
and
ageing
of
'
bitumen and thereby gives longer lasting pavement by delaying fatigue
cracking.
b)
Much improved workability of the mix at lower temperatures gives better
compactibility and larger compaction window.
c)
Reduced rate of cooling of the mix (due to low initial temperature of the
mix) permits longer haul distance from the plant to work sites and better
cold weather construction opportunities.
iv)
Cost benefits: WMA
is most
likely
to have
long term
cost advantages,
though
its estimation should be case
specific. The cost advantage
is a
trade-off between the additional cost of using the additives and technologies
(including plant modification) and cost savings achieved through reduced
fuel consumption, longer life of pavement and use of recycled material.
5 CHOICE OF AN APPROPRIATE WARM MIX ASPHALT TECHNOLOGY
In the Section dealing with 'overview', the principles behind various alternative technologies
and
different
additives have been
presented. These
provide
the
general
guideline
for
an
appropriate
choice
of technology.
Secondly,
since
the
plants and equipment used
for producing WMA mixes would remain essentially the same
(at least
till such time the
technology
proliferates and
its use becomes widespread) as that for HMA mix,
it would
be
necessary
to
ascertain
the
nature and
feasibility as
well
as commitment
to these
modifications/changes. Thirdly, the suppliers of the products to be used
in works should be
willing to take responsibility along with the main contractor not only for their products but for
the entire technological solution.
All technologies and
all commercial additives should be allowed to compete for acceptance
on a work
if the following conditions are satisfied:
®
Technology and/or product suppliers provide evidence of
:
a)
achieving
the
reduction
of
at
least
30°C
in
mixing
and
laying
temperature on some actual work done in the past. The evidence should
be in the form of a certificate from the owner/owner's representative of
the said work,
5



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 24
======================================================================
IRC:SP:101-2014
b)
additives proposed to be used not having any harmful effects on human
health and environment. This evidence should be
in the form of test
certificates from reputed laboratory,
c)
complete understanding of the technological solution such as dosage
of additives, the process of administering the additives
in a controlled
manner (weight, volume,
pressure, temperature,
etc.), adequacy of
the plant and equipment proposed to be used on the work and
if not,
the modifications required, quality assurance
in the process, etc. This
evidence should be in the form of a written quality statement.
•
The main contractor provides evidence of understanding of the technological
requirement,
including
modifications
in
the
plant
and
equipment
and
acceptance of these requirements. This evidence should be in the form of a
written joint commitment statement.
The selection of the best WMA technology depends on many factors, and
in most cases
is
dependent on the monetary incentives and benefits of using WMA. Importantfactors to consider
include the reduction in temperature that is desired, the tonnage of mix that is anticipated and
whether or not to invest in plant technology that are needed for certain additives.
It should
also be pointed out that the "green" benefits of adopting WMA technologies should not be
overlooked, and that a reduction
in emission through a reduction of temperature can help
contractors/agencies receive significant amount of "carbon credits."
6 DESIGN OF WARM MIX ASPHALT iliXES
The quality and performance of the mix shall be the same as specified for HMA in IRC:111
except for mixing and laying temperatures, which should be at least 30°C less than those
specified for HMA. The threshold of 30°C
is considered technologically feasible as well as
desirable from the point of view of fuel savings of some significance.
Design of mix, quality of inputs (except the additives) and tests required to be performed shall
follow the same procedures as specified
in IRC:111.
In addition, the following WMA specific
tests shall also be performed:
•
Coating
,
-
.
,
•
Compactibility
-
'
•
Moisture Sensitivity
The above parameters should be verified first in the laboratory, after the criteria are satisfied,
a field trial of at least 500 m length shall be constructed, and the parameters obtained in the
laboratory may be verified.
6.1
Aggregate Coating
•
WMA sample shall be prepared as per AASHTO T1 95 (Refer Annex 1) at a
temperature at least 30°C lower than conventional hot-mix.
•
The warm-mix shall be evaluated for coating as per AASHTO T195.
"
Minimum 95 percent of the coarse aggregate particles shall be fully coated
at a temperature at least 30°C lower than conventional hot-mix.
6



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 24
======================================================================
IRC:SP:101-2014
6.2
Compactibility
Since the mixing and compaction temperature of the warm-mix samples are lowered by at
least 30°C compared to the conventional hot=mix,
it
is important for the warm-mix samples
to attain specified mix densities at adopted lower temperatures.
In order to verify that the
warm-mix samples attain sufficient density at least 30°C lower temperatures relative to the
conventional hot-mix, the following
is proposed:
•
Three hot-mix specimens shall be prepared conforming to the Job Mix Formula
(JMF) as per AASHTO T245 (also adopted in MORTH Section 500 Table
1 0).
(Refer Annexure 1)
•
Similarly, three more warm-mix specimens
shall be prepared conforming
to the JMF.
In
all cases the JMF shall be made
in the same procedure as
per conventional mixes except at a temperature at least 30°C lower than
the hot-mix samples as per AASHTO T245. The compactive effort should
be similar for both mixes.
In case there
is a specific change required by
an additive manufacturer to suit the JMF requirements the same shall be
permitted except that the Specified Properties in the Guidelines shall have to
.
'
be adhered to.
• '•
The bulk specific gravity (G^J of all the specimens shall be determined as
per AASHTO T1 66.
•
The theoretical maximum specific gravity (G^^) of the bituminous mixture of
HMA and WMA shall be determined as per AASHTO T209.
•
The
air voids of both the mixes shall be determined as per the following
equation:
"
G
•
The ratio of the air voids shall be as per the following equation:
_
of WMA
.
~
of HMA
•
The ratio shall be such that 0.9 < R < 1.1
6.3
Moisture Susceptibility
Warm-mixes are typically prepared
at least 30°C lower temperatures,
it
is
likely that the
aggregate can retain some residual moisture, especially when the aggregate are porous and
when the moisture content in the aggregate is high due to recent rains.
It is recommended that
the warm-mix additives or processes should also behave as anti-stripping agents, and should
be able to improve the resistance of the mix to moisture susceptibility even when produced at
temperatures at least 30°C lower than conventional mixes.
If the warm-mix additives cannot
perform as an anti-stripping agent,
it must be mandated to add either hydrated lime or a liquid
anti-stripping agent to the mix to improve resistance to moisture damage. However in case of
WMA using foaming technology use of anti-stripping agent or lime may be detrimental.

The specimens shall have 7.0 ± 0.5 percent air voids.
•
Six samples
of warm-mix specimens
conforming
to
the JMF
shall
be
prepared at a temperature at least 30°C lower than the hot-mix samples as
per AASHTO T245. The compactive effort shall be similar for both mixes,
and the specimens shall have 7.0 ± 0.5 percent air voids.
•
The Tensile Strength
Ratio (TSR) of the hot-mix and the warm-mix shall
be determined as per AASHTO T283. The TSR value of HMA shall meet
the requirement of minimum 80 percent as specified
in IRC: 111. A TSR of
above 80 percent for the warm-mix that
is prepared
at least 30°C below
corresponding
hot-mix
will ensure
sufficient
resistance
against
moisture
susceptibility.
7 PRODUCTION OF WARM MIX ASPHALT
7.1
Mixing Plant Requirements
WMA requires mix temperatures to be significantly reduced. The two basic types of bituminous
mixing plant most commonly used are the batch type mixing plant and the continuous drum
type plant, both of which types can be adapted to manufacture WMA.
^
For production of warm mixes that also contain reclaimed bituminous mixes, mixing plant
design should include adequate features. When any of the various types of mixing plants
are used,
it should be ensured that the Recycled Asphalt (RA) and the virgin aggregates are
properly blended together; the blending process shall facilitate proper heat transfer and shall
prevent both physical and thermal segregation.
As with any new technology, there are a few concerns about the production ofWMA, specifically
because of the lower temperatures that are utilized during production. Fortunately, all of these
problems are expected and solvable,
in many cases through the adoption of techniques that
could also be utilized for improving conventional HMA production.
The first concern is about incomplete drying of aggregates (specifically the internal moisture)
at the reduced temperatures.
It has been seen that for aggregates with an absorption value
of less than
1 percent, drying of aggregate has not been reported to be a problem at WMA
temperatures. To prevent the incomplete drying of aggregates,
it is suggested that stockpiles
be kept as dry as possible by sloping sides, paving surrounding areas, and keeping them
under cover. To dry aggregates with high moisture content the retention time
in the dryer
drum could be increased and the dryer shell should be insulated properly. Ways to detect
incomplete drying include a greater than 20°C fall
in temperature in mix between discharge
and loading, dripping water from silos and excessive steam from slat conveyors and a loss of
more than 0.5 percent of the weight of mix during moisture content test.
The second concern
is regarding incomplete combustion of fuel at the reduced temperature
and the resulting risk of getting unburnt fuel in the mix.
Evidence of such a problem include brownish color of mix and higher than normal emissions.
Proper maintenance and tuning of burner, and preheating of burner fuel are recommended

IRC:SP:101-2014
solutions to this problem. The last but not least problem
is the potential of condensation of
baghouse fines, leading to the clogging and decreased efficiency of the emission control
system.
Recommended solutions include proper preheating of baghouse, sealing of leaks, adjusting
flights and slopes of the dryer to increase baghouse exhaust temperature,
insulation
of
baghouse and ductwork and addition of duct heaters to increase baghouse temperatures,
if needed. A high
i.e. within the range of 0.28 to 0.35 kg/cm^. A high-pressure drop within
a range greater than 0.28 to 0.35 kg/cm^ across the bags
is an indicator of caking due to
condensation.
7.2
Warm
IVlix Asphalt Techooiogy Addition Systems
ForWMATechnologies, both Theological modifier and chemical additive types that are blended
into the binder shall be added through the mixing
plant's normal binder addition system.
These may also be blended at terminals and supplied to project sites through conventional
transportation system.
Water carrying chemical additives, which are in powdered form, can be added manually into
the pugmill of batch type mixers either through the filler system, or by intruding
it through the
RA collar.
Equipment to produce foamed bitumen may be installed on both batch and continuous drum
mixing plant types. The systems obviously operate differently, with separate generations of
foamed bitumen for each batch
in the former type of plant and a continuous production of
foam in the latter plant type's case.
Conventional types of bituminous mix plants shall have the following monitoring and control
systems:
Binder storage tank heating temperature
Integrated individual cold feed hopper (new aggregate and RA) and burner
fuel flow
Burner fuel flow meter
Infrared temperature monitor
Infrared silo discharge temperature monitor
Foaming systems should include integrated flow metering and pressure sensing systems for
both the binder and the water used to produce the foam.
8 CONSTRUCTION OPERATION
The construction operation for WMA shall same as that prescribed for HMA and shall be
in
accordance with the 1RC:111 except that the mixing, laying and rolling temperature for WMA
shall be as indicated in TabSe 1.

11 ROAD MAP FOR WARM MIX ASPHALT TECHNOLOGY
It is necessary that every user of the technology monitors and evaluates the performance of
the WMA technology, creates a database in a standard format and uploads
it on
its website
to make
it accessible to any interested party. Over time the success stories will lead to the
wide spread use of the technology, lessons can be learnt from not so successful ones and
the unsuitable ones would fall by the way side.

The standard method of test for "Determining degree of particle coating of Asphalt Mixture",
helps
in determining the
particle coating
in asphalt mix based on the percentage of fully
coated aggregate present
in a mix. The specification also helps
in determining the mixing
time required for satisfactory coating of aggregate in the asphalt mixture.
After producing WMA mix by lowering the temperature by at least 30°C lower than conventional
hot-mix, samples of the mix are taken immediately after discharge from the pug mill. Coating
is only measured on aggregate retained on 9.5 mm sieve. So the material
is sieved on a
9.5 mm sieve while
still hot and roughly 200-500 gram of sieved sample is collected.
The percentage of coated particles is determined by
No. of completely coated particles

The standard method of test for "Resistance to
plastic flow for bituminous mixture using
Marshall Apparatus" covers the measurement of resistance to
plastic flow of cylindrical
bituminous mixture samples by the means of a Marshall Apparatus.
This test method is specified to verify that the warm-mix samples attain equivalent resistance
to plastic deformation
relative to conventional mixes at temperatures at least 30°C lower
than conventional hot-mix. The specification details the procedure for preparing a cylindrical
bituminous mixture sample of 1 00 mm diameter consisting of around
1 200 g of material. The
sample
is prepared by compacting using a standard Marshall Hammer. The samples are
checked for Marshall Stability and flow under a constant displacement rate testing using a
Marshall Apparatus after being immersed in water at 60 ± 1°C for 30 to 40 minutes.
WMA mixes shall have at least 9kN Marshall Stability value (12 kN
if sample prepared with
PMB) and flow between 3 to 6 mm.

AASHTO T283/ASTM D1075
The standard method for "Resistance of compacted asphalt mixture samples to moisture-
induced damage" covers preparation of specimens and the measurement of the change of
diametrical tensile strength
resulting from the effects of water saturation and accelerated
water conditioning, with a freeze-thaw cycle,
of compacted asphalt mixtures. The results
may be used to predict long-term stripping susceptibility of the asphalt mixtures and evaluate
liquid anti-stripping additives that are added to the asphalt binder.
The test is performed by compacting cylindrical bituminous mixture specimens to an air void
level of six to eight percentages. Three specimens are selected as a control and tested without
moisture conditioning, and three specimens are selected to be conditioned by saturating
with water undergoing
a freeze
cycle
(-18°C
for
at
least
16
hours), and subsequently
having 60 ± 1°C water soaking cycle for 24 hours. The specimens are then transferred to a
25 ± 1°C water bath for two hours and then tested for indirect tensile strength by loading the
specimens at a constant rate and measuring the peak force required to break the specimen.
The tensile strength of the conditioned specimens
is compared to the control specimens to
determine the Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR).
Tensile strength of conditioned samples
%TSR=

Tensile strength of unconditioned samples
The Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR) of the hot-mix and the warm-mix shall be determined as
per the AASHTO T283. A TSR of above 80 percent for the warm-mix that
is prepared at
least 30°C below corresponding hot-mix will ensure sufficient resistance against moisture
susceptibility.
