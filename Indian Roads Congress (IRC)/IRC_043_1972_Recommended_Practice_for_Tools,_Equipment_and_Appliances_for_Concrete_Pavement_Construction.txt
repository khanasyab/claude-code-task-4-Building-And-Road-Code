RECOMMENDED PRACTICE FOR TOOLS, EQUIPMENT
AND APPLIANCES FOR CONCRETE PAVEMENT
CONSTRUCTION
I.
INTRODUCTION
1.1.
Even though
greater mechanisation of concrete pavement
construction
has a
lot to command
itself both
from
the point
of
quality and output of construction, in view of peculiar socio-economic
infra-structure
of our country most of our constructions are bound to
be carried out with a minimum of mechanisation for quite some time.
In
addition
to
small
mechanised
units,
semi-mechanised
concrete
pavement
construction requires a number of small,
though nonethe-
less special,
tools and appliances
for various manual phases.
While
comparatively
larger
units
such as
those
for
batching of
concrete
materials, mixing and compaction of concrete, etc., are manufactured
commercially in the country and standard specifications for these exist
to ensure their
performance, no
such standards are available
for the
smaller tools
and appliances.
They are also not commercially
avail-
able and have normally
to be got fabricated by the field
engineer for
the particular project.
1.2.
In the absence of any guidelines in respect of these smaller
tools and appliances,
the field engineers have been experiencing
diffi-
culties when
executing concrete paving jobs.
It has,
therefore, been
felt necessary to
provide some
basis for the fabrication of such
tools
and appliances
in keeping
with
the
performance
requirements,
by
way of three
dimensional sketches and brief description of the essen-
tial features.
For plants fabricated commercially, reference has been
drawn to the relevant standards.
1.3.
This recommended
practice was prepared by
the Cement
Concrete Road Surfacing Committee (personnel given
below).
It
was
then
processed and approved
by
the
Specifications
and
Standards
Committee in their meeting held on the 18th and 19th November 1971.
Later,
it was
finally
approved by the Executive Committee
in
their
meeting held
on the 26th and 27th April 1972 and by
the Council
in
their 78th meeting held at Nainital on the 10th July, 1972.
This recommended practice
is closely
allied
to IRC
:
15-1970*
and should be used in conjunction with that standard.

Formwork and iron stakes
The formwork should consist of mild steel channels for
straight
lengths and wooden
sections
reinforced
with
mild
steel
angles for
curved
portions.
Manufactured
sections
are
also
available
in the
market and may be used if they meet the
construction
requirements.
The general requirements for
formwork
as
given in IRC:
15-1970
shouldbe complied with. The details of mild steel stakes for fixing mild
steel channel and wooden formwork are given in Fig.
1.
4.2.2.
Bulk head
The bulk-head, used for closing the construction at an expansion
joint,
or
for
making
an
emergency
construction
joint
in case of
machinery breakdowns, should consist of a hardwood beam with hole
drilled along its centre line to accommodate the dowel bars if provid-
ed,
and with its
top
and
bottom
faces
conforming
to
the
cross-
profile of the
finished
pavement and
sub-base
course
respectively.
Sometimes
a
two-piece
bulk-head
is
preferred
from
the
point of
construction convenience. Fig. 2 shows a typical bulk-head.
In case of dowelled constructions, the bulkheads should be used
in pairs, one being positioned at the
joint
proper,
and
the second a
little further, to
keep
the
projecting
part
of
the dowels in proper
alignment.
4.2.3.
Scratch template or strike board
The
scratch
template
used
for
checking
the
trueness of the
subgrade or sub-base surface should
consist
of a
hard
wood board
fitted with
handles,
with its
lower
face
conforming
to
the desired
cross profile or camber and having steel nails fixed thereto at regular
intervals.
A typical scratch template for slabs not
exceeding 4 m
in
width
is shown in Fig.

MINIMUM BALANCED SET OF TOOLS, EQUIPMENT
AND APPLIANCES
5.1.
For smooth progress of work,
without any
bottlenecks,
it is essential to acquire a minimum balanced set of tools, equipment
and appliances needed for different phases
of
construction.
Details
of such a balanced set for small sized constructions envisaged herein,
with
a
daily
concreting
output
of
20-30
cu.m., are
given
in
Annexure 2.
6.
ANCILLARY ITEMS OF TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT
V
6.1 .
In addition to the tools, equipment and appliances covered
in preceding Clauses, certain ancillary items will be needed at concrete
paving works for taking measurements, marking
distances, storage of
water, routine repairs to machinery, etc. A list of these items is given
at Annexure 3.
Though by no means exhaustive, the list includes all
such items which will generally be needed
7.
MAINTENANCE AND UPKEEP OF TOOLS, EQUIPMENT
AND APPLIANCES
7.1.
The need for proper maintenance
and
upkeep of various
tools, plants and equipments
cannot
be
over-emphasised
to ensure
quality construction.
Some of the
tools and
equipments
especially
tend to develop inaccuracies and
defects
with
use.
Their
constant
checking and rectification should form a part of daily routine.
Points
deserving attention in this respect are brought
out in Annexure 4.

Annexure 4
ROUTINE MAINTENANCE AND UPKEEP OF TOOLS,
FQUIPMENT AND APPLIANCES
The following points should form
a
part
of
routine
daily
check-up
of
plant so as to ensure quality construction
:
1.
Scratch Template or Strike Board:
The
trueness
of
setting
of
nails
to cross-profile should be
checked
daily
before commencement
of
work,
2.
Formwork: (1) The straightness of formwork
in
both
the horizontal
and vertical planes should be ensured before each
use.
When
fixed,
it should be
checked
with
a 3 m
straight
edge
and
any
departure
greater than
1.5 mm
duly
rectified.
(2) The
formwork
should
be
thoroughly cleaned and should not have any foreign material sticking
thereto.
3.
Sieving Screens:
It should be ensured that the
sieves
are
thoroughly
clean and that there
is no
displacement
or
breakage
of
the mesh
wires, etc.
4.
Weigh Batcher: (1) The calibration of the weigh batcher scales should
be checked regularly by means of a set of standard
weights over
the
full working range in use.
(2) The
knife-edge
supports
should
be
regularly cleaned.
(3) Free movement of the dial
needle
should
be
ensured.
5.
Measuring Boxes:
Wherever volume batching is
permitted,
the true-
ness of shape and correctness of dimensions of
the
measuring
boxes
should be ensured.
6.
Water Measures
:
The calibration of the water
measures
should
be
checked regularly against standard graduated cylinders.
7.
Concrete Mixer
:
(I) Any worn
out mixer
blades
(worn more than
20 mm) should be replaced.
(2) After
any
break
in
construction
longer than 20 minutes and at the end
of the
day's work, the mixer
drum should be thoroughly washed and cleaned.
8.
Concrete Vibrators:
Regular
servicing
of the
units
should
be
got
done to keep them in good working order.
9.
Surface Finishing Tools:
Floats and
straight edge, should
be
daily
checked
before
use
for
trueness,
and
any
departure
from
a true
plane surface should be rectified before use.
10.
Mild
Steel
Sections
for Making
Joint
Grooves:
The
trueness
and
straightness should be checked
before
use,
especially
in case of the
mild steel
flats
for making
contraction
joint
grooves,
as
they are
sometimes likely to get bent during insertion in the concrete.

11.
Canvas Belt:
Should be
thoroughly washed
and cleaned
after each
use.
12.
Long Handled Coir Broom:
The coir bristles
should
be checked
for
wear, and worn out brooms should be replaced.
13.
Graduated Master Straight Edge with Wedge
Gauge:
The trueness
of
the straight edge and
wedge
gauge
should
be
checked
before
use.
It will
not
be
normally
necessary
to make
this
