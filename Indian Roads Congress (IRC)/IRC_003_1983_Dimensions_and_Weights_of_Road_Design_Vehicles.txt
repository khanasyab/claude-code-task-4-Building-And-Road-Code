DIMENSIONS AND WEIGHTS OF ROAD
DESIGN VEHICLES
1.
INTRODUCTION
1.1.
The
object
of
framing
this Standard
is to lay down a
basis for designing road components.
The dimensions and weights
of
vehicles
are
cardinal
factors
in
the design of road elements.
The width of the design
vehicle
has
a
bearing
on
the
width
of
traffic
lanes
and
that
of
shoulders.
The
height
of
the vehicle
affects
the
clearance
to
be
. provided
in
designing
road under-
bridgcs,
electrical
service
lines,
and
other
overhead
structures.
The overall length of the vehicle (including trailer and
semi-trailer
combinations) has to be taken into consideration in
designing
hori-
zontal
curves
and vertical curves, as also in framing safety regula-
tions for passing and overtaking.
The axle load affects the
design
of
the
thickness
of
pavement,
whereas
the
total weight of the
vehicle governs limiting gradients.
1.2.
The
Indian
Roads
Congress
Standard on Dimensions
and
Weights
of
Road
Design
Vehicles
was
first
published in
January,
1954.
When
the
question
of
metricization
of
this
standard was
taken up,
it
was
felt
that
since by that time
con-
siderable
changes
had
taken
place in the
design and construction
of motor vehicles and concept of geometric and
structural
design
of
the highway system both in this country and abroad, there
was
need of its wholesale
revision.
Accordingly,
a
revised
draft for the Standard was prepared
by L.R. Kadiyali.
This
was
modified
in
the
Ministry
of
Ship-
ping and Transport (Roads Wing) considering
the
current amend-
ments to the Indian Motor Vehicles Act 1939 and the latest
trends
on
the
subject
both
in
this
country and abroad.
The modified
document
was
considered
by
the
Specifications
and Standards
Committee in their meeting held at New Delhi on
the
24th
May,
1983.
The draft
as approved with a few
changes
by
the
Speci-
fications
and
Standards
Committee
was
later
approved
by
the
Executive
Committee
and
the
Council
in their meetings held on
the
21st
July
and
the
21st
August
1983
respectively
for
being
published as a standard of the Indian Roads Congress.

SCOPE
2.1.
The
Standard
shall
be
applied
in
designing
all road
elements except culverts and bridges, the latter being governed
by
the IRC Bridge Codes.
2.2.
For purposes of this Standard, three types
of commer-
cial vehicles have been recognised
:
(i) Single unit
(ii) Semi-trailer
(iii) Truck-trailer combination.
The selection of the vehicle type for design of
a
road
would
depend upon terrain conditions, economic justification,
importance
of the road and similar other considerations.
As
a
general
guide,
roads in steep and mountainous terrain
need not be designed for truck-trailer combination and may only be
designed
for
single
unit vehicle and, where economically feasible,
for semi-trailers.
Subject
to
the
above, such of the maximum dimensions and
weights out of those
specified
here
shall
be
used
that
have
the
severest
effect
in
the
design
of any road component.
All road
components, to be newly built or improved,
shall
be
so
designed
that they are initially adequate or capable of being made
adequate
subsequently when the necessity arises, for the movement
of
vehi-
cles
conforming
to
this
Standard
and
selected for design of the
road.

a
pavement
structure.
