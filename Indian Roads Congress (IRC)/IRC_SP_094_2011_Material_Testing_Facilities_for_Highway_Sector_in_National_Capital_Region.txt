INTRODUCTION
Standard Specifications and Conditions of Contract provide for testing of materials
and
finished
products.
According
to
IVIORTH
Specifications and
IRC
guidelines
some material testing facilities are arranged at project site.
Still
it is necessary to get
several tests done from outside. For this purpose,
it
is required to approach such
laboratories which
are
reliable and approved by
National
Accreditation Board
of
Laboratories (NABL).
Engineers working for different projects need information about, availability of testing
facilities with
reliable laboratories. This document provides such
list of laboratories
and available testing
facilities
in NCR. The information contained
in the document
being dynamic
in nature which
is subject to constant up-gradation, every endeavor
will
be made
to
update
ttie
information
of
newly
accredited
laboratories
in
the
subsequent documentation.
The
draft document on
Material Testing
Facilities
for Highway Sector
in
National
Capital Region had been under the consideration of Human Resource Development
Committee (G-2) for quite sometime. The draft was discussed by G-2 Committee
in
a number of meetings.
The Human
Resource
Development
Committee
(personnel
given
below)
in
its
meeting
held
on
10.08.2010
finalized
the
document
and
recommended
its
submission
to
the
General
Specifications
&
Standards
Committee
(GSS)
for
consideration.

CHAPTER
1
TESTING OF fVIATERSALS !N HIGHWAY SECTOR
All projects
in Highway Sector require extensive testing of the materials which
is a
pre-requisite
for
producing
quality
work.
This
requires
several
tests
including
physical, chennical, ultrasonic, X-ray and various other types of tests which normally
cannot be carried
out
at
project
site
laboratory without adding
high-costs on
the
project. These tests also require trained and experienced personnel to conduct the
required tests
in controlled environment. Therefore, the need arises for depending
on
independent
laboratories
with
facilities
to
conduct
the
tests
as
per
IRC
specifications and in controlled conditions like temperature, humidity etc.
2
In order to help engineers and contractors for the purpose
of testing
of
materials, the compilation of NABL accredited laboratohes
in NCR region has been
done by
this Committee. Updated
information
of NABL accredited laboratohes
is
though
available
on
the
website
of NABL
under
category
Laboratory
Search;
however every laboratory may not have the facility for carrying out
all the required
tests. This compilation gives information about available testing
facilities
in various
reputed laboratories. These laboratories are both
in Govt, and Private sectors. Most
of the standards and specifications required
in Highway projects are met by these
laboratories. However, depending on
specific requirements, owner of the
projects
may approve some more laboratohes for their projects. These laboratories can be in
the Public Sector or Private Sector. For laboratories
in the private sector, the past
record and reputation of the laboratory must invariably be given due consideration.
The infrastructure in these laboratories can be inspected before they are short-listed
for testing.
3
The name
of
the
laboratohes
with
addresses
and
details
of
contact
persons are given
in Chapter
2, while the
details
of testing
facilities are given
in
Chapter 3. The testing
facilities are given
in tabular form.
First Column shows the
name of tests along with the reference of the standards. Other Columns show the
name
of laboratohes and wherever such
facility
is
available;
it
is shown
with
"V"
mark.
4
This
compilation,
it
is
expected,
will
be
useful
for
selecting
proper
laboratory
at convenient distance,
from
the
project
site.
This
will
in
turn
help
in
achieving required quality control
in Highway projects.
