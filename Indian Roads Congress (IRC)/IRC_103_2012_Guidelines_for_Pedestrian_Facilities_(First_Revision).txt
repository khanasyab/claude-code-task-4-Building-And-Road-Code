Guidelines for pedestrian facilities
1  GLOSSARY
Footpath (Footpaths)- It is a portion of right of way of road used for the movement of 
pedestrian traffic. 
Street Crossings- It is a place where streets cross each other and includes all kind of 
movements of pedestrian & vechicular traffic.
School Zone Improvements- Covers engineering issues, facilities, operations, and signage 
as applied specifically to areas near schools. 
Pedestrian Level of Service (LOS)- Pedestrian level of service indicates the environmental 
qualities of a pedestrian space and serves as a guide for development of standards for 
pedestrian facilities. Environmental factors that contribute to the walking experience and 
therefore to the perceived level of service, such as comfort, convenience, safety, security and 
attractiveness, should also be considered.
2  INTRODUCTION
2.1	
The Guidelines for Pedestrian Facilities was first published in February, 1989. The 
work of revision of this document was taken up by the Urban Roads, Streets & Transport 
Committee (H-8) of the Indian Road Congress. A sub group consisting Prof. P.K. Sarkar 
as Chairman and Ms. Anjali Agarwal, Dr. (Mrs.) Purnima Parida and Prof. Rajat Rastogi as 
member was formed to revise the Guidelines. The Sub-group was benefitted with detailed 
inputs given by Samarthyan, National Centre for Accessibel Enivronments with all line drawings 
and illustrations. The revised document as prepared by the Sub-group was considered and 
approved by the Urban Roads, Streets & Transport Committee (personnel given below) in its 
meeting held on 8th September, 2011:

2.2	
The draft was approved by the Highways Specifications and Standards Committee 
(HSS) in its meeting held on 23rd September, 2011 for placing before the IRC Council. The draft 
was finally approved by the IRC Council in its meeting held on 3rd November, 2011 at Lucknow. 
2.3	
Walking is an important mode of transport. In urban areas; a significant proportion of 
trips upto 1-2 km in length is performed on foot. Moreover, every journey necessarily starts and 
ends as a walk trip. Pedestrian do not consume fuel, fitness is a bonus. Above all pedestrian 
facilities ensure social equity. It may be added that pedestrian facilities enhance the liveliness 
of the urban environment, making both business districts and residential neighborhoods 
safe and interesting. Developing a pedestrian environment means more than laying down 
a footpath or installing a signal. A truly viable pedestrian system takes into account both the 
big picture and the smallest details - from how a city is formed and built to what materials are 
under our feet. 
2.4	
Accessible design is the foundation and primary concern for all pedestrian design, 
hence all pedestrian facilities need to be planned, designed, operated and maintained so that 
it is usable by everyone, including those with disabilities or using mobility aids. As considerable 
number of pedestrian traffic is the victims of road accidents, it is therefore important to address 
various issues of pedestrian while providing facilities for them. Care has to be taken to provide 
the facilities to pedestrian not only along the roads and intersections, but also at the areas like 
work places, access to transit areas, markets, schools, etc.
2.5	
Definition of Pedestrian
“Pedestrian” is used throughout these guidelines to include people who walk, sit, stand in 
public spaces, or use a mobility aid like walking stick, crutches or wheelchair, be they children,

IRC:103-2012
teenagers, adults, elderly persons, persons with disabilities, workers, residents, shoppers or 
people-watchers. Pedestrian-oriented design is accessible design for all people.
3  SCOPE
3.1	
Every traveller is a pedestrian at some stage of his or her travel and hence pedestrian 
facilities are very significant in urban transportation. In view of the paradigm shift from ‘moving 
the vehicles’ to ‘moving the persons’ while planning for transportation facilities in cities, 
provision of integrated and barrier free pedestrian facilities is essential to ensure inclusive 
mobility.
3.2	
These guidelines cover engineering design and planning aspects of pedestrian 
facilities on road sides and at road crossings in urban and semi urban areas. Pedestrian 
facilities at special locations like schools, parking, and transit areas are also covered. Issues 
related to pedestrian safety audit are highlighted with respect to road safety audit.
3.3	
The guidelines are intended for use by the local authorities responsible for creating and 
maintaining semi urban and urban road transport facilities. The guidelines are framed to serve 
the objectives of universal accessibility and social equity for sustainable transportation. 
4  GENERAL  PRINCIPLES
4.1	
Pedestrian facilities should be planned in an integrated manner so as to ensure a 
continuous pedestrian flow. It should be useful therefore to look at pedestrian needs for an 
area as a whole and prepare an overall strategic plan.
4.2	
The basic aim should be to reduce pedestrian conflicts with vehicular traffic to the 
minimum. Efforts should be made to create such conditions that pedestrian are not forced to 
walk in unsafe circumstances, and that the motorists respect the position of pedestrian.
4.3	
While planning, the convenience of pedestrian should be a paramount consideration 
to ensure full utilization of the facilities. 
4.4	
Pedestrian facilities are a critical element in producing a pedestrian-friendly 
environment. A number of engineering solutions to improve the quality of the pedestrian 
network should take into account the following groups: children, families with young children, 
elderly persons, persons with disabilities, and people carrying heavy luggage.
4.5	
The mobility and safety of “all” the pedestrian, including those with disabilities and 
reduced mobility should be ensured to promote inclusive mobility and universal accessibility. 
4.6	
Above all, regular maintenance of all facilities and design elements should be 
undertaken to maintain accessibility, reliability, usability, safety and continuity.
4.7	
While planning and design the pedestrian facilities, the overall objectives would be 
continuity, comfort and safety 
5 PEDESTRIAN  LEVEL  OF  SERVICE 
5.1	
Quality of Service
Pedestrian spaces should be designed in consideration of human convenience and have to 
be qualitatively suitable to the needs of human beings. Nine parameters affect the quality of 



======================================================================
PAGE 11 of 75
======================================================================

IRC:103-2012
service of a footpath facility out of which six are pertaining to the physical characteristics of 
the footpath facility, like footpath width, footpath surface, obstruction, encroachment, potential 
of vehicular conflict, and continuity. The three user factors are pedestrian volume, security, 
comfort and walking environment.
5.2	
Concept of Pedestrian Level of Service
Pedestrian level of service indicates the environmental qualities of a pedestrian space and 
serves as a guide for development of standards for pedestrian facilities. Pedestrian spaces 
should be designed in consideration of human convenience and have to be qualitatively 
suitable to the needs of human beings. The planning and design methods for pedestrian 
suggested by many researchers are based primarily on vehicular traffic flow theory. Additional 
environmental factors that contribute to the walking experience and therefore to the perceived 
level of service, such as comfort, convenience, safety, security and attractiveness, should also 
be considered. Within the pedestrian LOS definition, six levels of service can be expressed 
as under:
	
(i)	
LOS A is a pedestrian environment where ideal pedestrian conditions exist 
and the factors that negatively affect pedestrian LOS are minimal.
	
(ii)	
LOS B indicates that reasonable pedestrian conditions exist but a small 
number of factors impact on pedestrian safety and comfort. As LOS A is the 
ideal, LOS B is an acceptable standard.
	
(iii)	
LOS C indicates that basic pedestrian conditions exist but a significant 
number of factors impact on pedestrian safety and comfort.
	
(iv)	
LOS D indicates that poor pedestrian conditions exist and the factors that 
negatively affect pedestrian LOS are wide-ranging or individually severe. 
Pedestrian comfort is minimal and safety concerns within the pedestrian 
environment are evident.
	
(v)	
LOS E indicates that the pedestrian environment is unsuitable. This situation 
occurs when all or almost all of the factors affecting pedestrian LOS are 
below acceptable standards.
	
(vi)	
At LOS F, all walking speeds are severely restricted, and forward progress 
is made only by shuffling. There is frequent, unavoidable contact with other 
pedestrian. Cross and reverse-flow movements are virtually impossible. Flow 
is sporadic and unstable. Space is more characteristic of queued pedestrian 
than of moving pedestrian streams.
Illustrations for quantitative Pedestrian Level of Service for sidewalks and Pedestrian L.o.S. 
thresholds for cross walks are given in Annexure-I. The relationships between pedestrian 
flow characteristics of speed, flow and density are also illustrated in the Annexure.
5.3	
Physical Characteristics
The pedestrian facilities shall comply with following physical characteristics:
	
(i)	
Footpath Surface: an even surface without cracks or bumps for comfortable 
walking. All surfaces should be stable, firm, and slip resistant.



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 75
======================================================================
5
IRC:103-2012
	
(ii)	
Footpath Width: The footpath should be wide enough to accommodate 
pedestrian flow at any given point of time.
	
(iii)	
Obstructions: The obstruction can be an electric pole, tree, garbage bin, 
and hoardings. The location of garbage bin, electric pole and any other 
feature like signage etc. should be on one side of the footpath so as to give 
a clear walkway to the pedestrian.
	
(iv)	
Encroachment: The informal commercial activities are an integral part of 
the footpath environment in India. The pedestrian also need them as they 
cater to their day-to-day needs, but sometimes the extent of encroachment 
rises to a level that the footpath facility becomes inaccessible/ non-usable by 
the pedestrian. The informal sector has to be integrated in the overall design 
of the footpath facility by providing space for them to operate.
	
(v)	
Potential for Vehicle Conflict: The footpaths need to be segregated from 
the roads, where fast moving vehicles ply. The two ways to protect the 
pedestrian from vehicle conflicts is the raised footpaths and the guardrails. 
	
(vi)	
Continuity: The continuity of the pedestrian facility is very important for the 
pedestrian with disability and of old age. Frequent kerb cuts along a street 
both impede traffic flow and create more conflict points between vehicles 
and pedestrian, thus reducing the effectiveness of footpaths. Frequent 
ups and downs make the footpath uncomfortable to use by the pedestrian 
especially the old and forces the pedestrian to share the carriageway along 
with the vehicles. The provision of kerb ramps is essential for continuity of 
the footpath.
5.4	
User Characteristics
Following user characteristics shall be given the consideration while planning/designing 
pedestrian facilities:
	
(i)	
Safety & Security: The feeling of being secure is the most important 
governing factor. A pedestrian should feel safe during the day as well as 
night while using a footpath/crosswalk. Characteristics of this factor include 
provision of adequate street lighting, police patrolling during the night time 
and sufficient activities on the surrounding areas to ensure safety. Separation 
of pedestrian traffic and vehicular traffic with the provision of pedestrian’s 
footpaths ensures safety of pedestrian and ensures less chance of pedestrian 
from entering the carriageway even unintentionally. It is therefore, strongly 
recommended that pedestrian footpaths be provided on all new facilities, 
and on all existing facilities as far as practicable (IRC:70-1977 “Guidelines 
on Regulation and Control of Mixed Traffic in Urban Areas” may be referred 
for this).
	
(ii)	
Comfort: A pedestrian needs to be protected from the inclement weather 
like harsh sun and rain. The trees protect the pedestrian but if planted in 
an unplanned manner also act as an obstruction. The location of trees 



======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 75
======================================================================

IRC:103-2012
and the plants need to be carefully planned. Provision of chairs /benches, 
rain shelters and wash rooms is another factor that adds to the comfort of 
pedestrian.
	
(iii)	
Walk Environment: Walk environment is governed by the surroundings 
of the facility. The walking should be a pleasant experience. The footpath 
should be clean and free of stink.
6  PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES DESIGN STANDARDS
6.1	
Footpath 
6.1.1	
Pedestrian footpaths are defined as any area primarily used by ‘all’ pedestrian. They 
can be adjacent to roadways, or away from the road.
6.1.2	
Footpaths should be regarded as a transportation system which is connected and 
continuous, just like roadways and railways. They should not be sporadically placed where 
ever convenient, but instead should be provided consistently between all major attractions, 
trip generators, and other locations where people walk. In order to be effective, the side-
walks should be provided on both sides of the road and above the level of the carriageway 
separated by kerbs. Height of the kerb at the edge should, however, not exceed the height of 
a standard public step riser i.e. 150 mm.
6.1.3	
Clear walking zone
In the natural and tempered landscapes, paths should be at least 1800 mm wide in order to 
accommodate wheelchair users and persons with vision impairments assisted by a sighted 
person or guide dog. It will also allow, for instance, an adult and child to walk together. If 
existing paths are less than 1800 mm wide, provision of passing places, 1800 mm wide 
and 2500 mm long, shall be made at a reasonable frequency, depending on intensity 
of use. This will allow groups of persons to pass each other, particularly on busy routes. 
Where the effective width is constricted by, for example, existing trees or walls, paths may 
reduce to 1200 mm for short distances. A 1200 mm wide path is too narrow for persons to 
pass each other, hence provision of passing places should be made at a greater frequency. 
A change in surface at the edge, such as a grass or ground or a verge, which often occurs 
naturally anyway, will help to prevent persons from straying off the path. 
The minimum 1.8 m (width) x 2.2 m (Height) Walking Zone should be clear of all obstructions 
– both horizontally and vertically. No utility ducts, utility poles, electric, water or telecom 
boxes, trees, signage or any kind of obstruction should be placed within the “Walking Zone” 
(Fig. 1).

======================================================================

IRC:103-2012
Fig. 1 Clear Walking Zone is separate from Planting Zone
6.1.4	
Clear height
A clear height of 2.2 m is required for the entire width of the footpath walking zone. No tree 
branches, trees, utility poles, electric/water/telecom boxes or signage should be placed within 
the clear height and width of the Walking Zone.
6.1.5	
Width 
6.1.5.1	 The width of a footpath is fundamental to the effective functioning of the pedestrian 
system. Without an optimum width, footpath will not help move enough pedestrian and will 
discourage them from walking. The width of side-walks depends upon the expected pedestrian 
flows and could be fixed with the help of guidelines given in Table 1. The minimum width of a 
clear unobstructed pathway should be 1800 mm in roads of right of way of 10 m and above. 
This allows two wheelchairs to pass each other comfortably (Fig. 2). In case of road with 
right of way less than 10 m or in the areas with light pedestrian traffic, a width of 1500 mm is 
regarded as the minimum acceptable, giving enough space for a wheelchair user and a walker 
to pass each other. As an exception, the width of the footpath may be considered as 1500 mm. 
The full width of footpath should be maintained consistently,  even behind bus shelters and in 
front of shop. For the actual length or width of people and equipment, the clearance lengths

IRC:103-2012
and clear outdoor passage widths needed for those people and equipment, Annexure-I can 
be referred to. 
Fig. 2 Minimum Width of a Clear Footpath
6.1.5.2	 Footpaths should normally be designed for a pedestrian Level of service B, thereby 
providing wide pedestrian facilities for pleasant and comfortable walking. Under resource 
constraint, Level of Service C can be adopted for deciding width of footpath (Table 1). The 
width of the footpaths depends upon the expected pedestrian traffic and may be fixed with the 
help of the following guidelines subject to not being less than 1.8 m (Table 1).

IRC:103-2012
6.1.5.3	 Frontage zone or dead width 
For footpaths in shopping areas, an extra 1m should be added to the stipulated 4 m width. 
This extra width is called “Dead Width”. In other situations where footpaths pass next to 
buildings and fences, a dead width of 0.5 m can be added. In busy areas like bus stops, 
railway stations, recreational areas, the width of footpath should be suitably increased to 
account for accumulation of pedestrian.
6.1.6	
Surface quality
Firm, even paved surfaces are important to people using sticks or crutches or wheelchairs, 
or people walking with difficulty. The removal of obstacles like potholes, tree roots and 
storm water drains crossing the walkway will make it safe and usable. If brick paving is used 
care should be taken to lay it evenly. Where grates over storm water drains cannot be kept 
out of the footpath, the gratings should be aligned across the direction of travel to prevent 
wheelchairs’ wheels from falling through. Paving should have an even surface to prevent 
tripping (Refer IRC:SP:50: Guidelines on Urban Drainage), and be laid to even falls to allow 
proper drainage and prevent the formation of puddles. The gap between paving slabs or any 
vertical deviation between slabs should not exceed 5 mm. Annexure-II may be referred for 
materials recommended for footpath surface.
6.1.7	
Cross falls 
Cross falls should only be provided where absolutely necessary for drainage purposes and 
should be 1:50 maximum. If the change in cross fall is so severe that one wheel of a wheelchair 
or one foot of a walker leaves the ground, it may cause the user of the wheelchair or walker 
to fall. Steeper gradients tend to misdirect buggies and wheelchairs. Where falls are not 
adequate, silt will accumulate after rain and cause the surface to become slippery. Puddles 
also cause the footpath to become slippery, lead to glare in bright sunshine after other parts 
of the footpath have become dry and become a hazard in frosty weather. Any break in the 
surface, e.g. drainage channels or the gaps between boards on a walkway, should not be 
greater than 12 mm and should cross perpendicular to the direction of movement. This will 
prevent walking sticks and wheels getting caught in the gaps.
6.1.8	
Service covers 
Service covers to manhole and inspection chambers should not be positioned on footpaths, 
particularly at dished crossings. They can be dangerous when opened for inspection, forming 
a tripping hazard and reducing the clear width. Covers and gratings should be non-slip, flush 
with the footpath surface, and be such that openings are not more than 10 mm wide. Gratings 
and slot type drainage should be sited away from pedestrian flows and perpendicular to the 
main line of pedestrian flows so as not to trap small wheels.
6.1.9	
Pedestrian guardrails 
Pedestrian guard-rails are an important design element to prevent indiscriminate crossing and 
spilling over of pedestrian on to the carriageway. Their judicious use can help to ensure that 
pedestrian cross the streets at predetermined and safe locations. As the guard-rails would 



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 75
======================================================================
10
IRC:103-2012
confine the movement of pedestrian to the footpath, it is obligatory that sufficient width of 
footpath be made available. 
6.1.9.1	 Design
The design of guard-rails should be neat, simple in appearance and, as far as possible, 
vandal proof. Two aspects which need special consideration are the height of hand-rail 
and the obstruction to visibility. The height should be sufficient so as to deter people from 
climbing over it. The visibility of the approaching vehicles by the pedestrian as well as the 
visibility of the pedestrian by the drivers of the approaching vehicles should be adequate. 
The railings should not, therefore, have any thick horizontal member, other than the baluster 
to achieve the desired objective. Above all, the guard-rails should be sturdy but of slender 
design.
Pedestrian guard-rails in reinforced cement concrete have been found to be generally suitable 
in urban situations. Iron tubes, steel channeled sections, polymer fiber railings and pipes 
may also be adopted so as to fit in with the environment or for better aesthetics. These can, 
however, be costly and may also need higher level or maintenance. 
6.1.9.2	 Applications
	
Use of pedestrian guard-rails should be considered under the following situations:
	
(i)	
Hazardous locations on straight stretches
	
	
In particularly busy reaches where the road is congested and vehicles 
move at a fast pace, guard-rails should be provided on both sides of the 
carriageway so as to channelize the pedestrian on to the planned crossing 
locations.
	
(ii)	
At Junctions/Intersections
	
	
Railing barriers should be provided to prevent people from crossing the 
junctions diagonally at signalised intersections. The barrier must open only 
at planned crossing facility (at the zebra crossing). At signalised junctions 
they should be provided for sufficient length to guide the pedestrian to the 
nearest planned pedestrian crossing.
	
(iii)	
Schools/Colleges
	
	
Provision of guard-rails near schools where children would other-wise run 
straight into the road is essential. If there is a pedestrian crossing or a school 
crossing nearby, the guard-rails must be extended up to it.
	
(iv)	
Bus stops, Railway stations, etc.
	
	
Provision of guard-rails alongside-walks with suitable access at bus stops, 
railway stations and other areas of heavy pedestrian activity such as cinema 
houses, stadiums, etc. are recommended for guiding pedestrian safely in 
such areas.
	
(v)	
Overpass, Subway, etc.
	
	
Guard-rails may be necessary at these locations in order to compel the 
pedestrian to use the facilities provided for them.



======================================================================
PAGE 18 of 75
======================================================================
11
IRC:103-2012
	
(vi)	
Central reserves
	
	
Where there is a central reserve or a median, guard-rails can be erected 
within it to deter the pedestrian from attempting a crossing.
	
(vii)	
High volume pedestrian generating areas such as bus stops, markets, 
terminals, recreational areas, etc.
6.1.9.3	 Installation guidelines
	
•	
Guard-rails may help to improve pedestrian safety at road intersections in 
cities where poor road user discipline is the cause of many accidents. 
	
•	
Occasionally, gaps in guard-rails may have to be provided, to accommodate 
trees, pillar boxes, sign posts, electrical control boxes, etc., located near the 
side-walk. However, these should be suitably designed to prevent pedestrian 
or little children from squeezing through to cross the carriageway.
	
•	
Preferably, the guard-rails should be set back from edge of the carriageway 
by at least 150 mm. Railing barriers should be painted periodically, especially 
after the monsoon, for increased life and better appearance. Broken barriers 
must be promptly replaced.
	
•	
To be clearly detectable, guard-rails should be 1100 mm high from the 
median level and painted to contrast clearly with the surroundings preferably 
in canary yellow colour as it is easily detectable by persons with low vision.
	
•	
Simple galvanized railings are not desirable unless they have contrasting 
markings on them.
	
•	
Guard-rails on the footpath should have rounded top to prevent injuries. 
Fig. 3 shows typical design of guard-rail.

6.1.10	
Obstructions 
6.1.10.1	 Obstructions on the footpath surface shall be adequately distinguished by adopting 
following design elements: 
	
•	
A straight shape rising from the footpath. 
	
•	
A 100 mm raised platform.
	
•	
Tactile warning markings on the ground around the obstruction. The warning 



======================================================================

IRC:103-2012
markings should extend over a width of at least 600mm outside the projected 
area.
6.1.10.2	 Overhanging and other obstructions :
	
•	
Obstacles (man holes, trees etc.) should be placed outside the path of travel 
(Fig. 4, 5) or should be placed along one continuous line.
	
•	
Overhanging signs or vegetation should be mounted at a minimum height of 
2.20m.
	
•	
Undetectable obstacles mounted lower than 2.20 m may project a maximum 
distance of 100mm into the footpath (Fig. 7). 
	
•	
Protruding elements should be avoided (Fig. 6-8). Bicycle stands should be 
located on a raised platform.
6.1.10.3	 Others:
	
•	
Fixed poles should have contrasting durable colour marking strips of 
300 mm in length, placed with the centre line at a height between 1.40 m 
-1.60 m.
	
•	
Garbage bins attached to lampposts should not face the line of pedestrian 
flow so as to minimize collisions and should be painted in a contrasting 
colour for easy identification by persons with low vision.

Bollards should be painted in a contrasting colour or in coloured stripes.
6.2	
Kerbs
6.2.1	
Kerb height
Maximum height of a pavement (including kerb, walking surface, top-of-paving) shall not 
exceed 150 mm from the road level, which is the standard anthropometric height of a public 
step/ riser. Medians should be maximum 250 mm high or be replaced by crash barriers. Only 
along Segregated Busways/ BRT corridors, the kerb height of the Bus Stop could match the 
height of the bus floor.
6.2.2	
Kerb radius and slip road (left turning pocket)
Smaller turning radii increase pedestrian safety in terms of reduction of crossing distances, 
increasing pedestrian visibility for drivers, decreasing vehicle turning speed; and making 
drivers look out for pedestrian while taking the turn (Fig. 9).
Fig. 9 Signalised Left Turning Pocket



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 75
======================================================================
14
IRC:103-2012
Maximum corner radius of kerb shall be 12 m, as this allows movement of the largest size of 
trucks, buses and emergency vehicles. Corner kerb radius may be reduced to 6m in residential 
areas to slow down turning buses, trucks etc. with the provision of a mountable kerb for turning 
of emergency vehicles.
Left Turning Slip roads provided at road junctions are meant for signal free movement of 
vehicular traffic. However, such left turning slip roads may make crossing by pedestrian and 
cyclists unsafe in case of high volume of left turning vehicular traffic. Therefore, from safety of 
pedestrian and cyclist standpoint, slip roads are not desirable.
Slip roads or Free Left Turns should be avoided at intersections up to right of way of 30 m. In 
cases where they already exist for intersections of roads with right of way more than 30 m, 
following strategies may be employed:
	
•	
Slip roads are not recommended wherever crossing pedestrian and NMV 
volumes are high. In such situations corner radius of kerb can be reduced to 
slow the movement traffic. The slip road crossing can be signalized fully or 
pelican signal may be provided.
	
•	
Signalized turning pockets may be provided where left-turning volumes 
are high. Raised table top crossings (Photo 1) may also be introduced 
and shall invariably be provided at slip roads, with a minimum 20-second 
pedestrian signal, to allow pedestrian and cyclists to cross the road safely 
and comfortably at the same level. Table top with flat surface will be preceded 
followed by the gradient at I:I5
Photo 1 Raised Table Top Crossing
6.2.3	
Kerb ramps
Kerb ramp is useful for a smooth transition, to overcome changes in level between the footpath 
and the road carriageway, at each pedestrian crossing on opposite sides of the street and in 
the vicinity of building entrances. Absence of kerb ramps prevents persons with disabilities 
and reduced mobility from crossing streets. 



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 75
======================================================================
15
IRC:103-2012
	
•	
Standard kerb ramps are cut back into the footpath (flush with roadway), at a 
gradient not greater than 1:12 (Fig. 10, 11 & 12), with flared sides providing 
transition in three directions. At street intersection and turnings kerb ramps 
should be provided (Fig. 13, 14 & 15).
	
•	
Width of the kerb ramp should not be less than 1200 mm. 
	
•	
Tactile warning strip shall be provided on the kerb side edge of the slope, so 
that persons with vision impairment do not accidentally walk onto the road.
	
•	
The ramps should be flared smooth into the street surface and checked 
periodically to make sure large gaps do not develop between the gutter and 
street surface. 
	
•	
It is desirable to provide two kerb cuts per corner. Single ramp located in 
the center of a corner is less desirable. Separate ramps provide greater 
information to pedestrian with vision impairment in street crossings.

Continuity and Consistency
It is mandatory for footpaths to be continuous between junctions or where at-grade crossing 
is provided. A change in colour of pavers can emphasize and highlight the crossing area to 
all users. Consistency of design elements, color and texture should provide visual continuity. 
Footpath interruptions must be avoided by minimizing cuts in kerbs. These act as traffic 
calming measures and make such conflict points safer. Entrances/exits, side properties, gates 
and service lanes shall be accommodated by following provisions: 
	
•	
Raised crossings, where the car lanes are raised by ramps of slope (1:10) 
and brought to the level of the footpath (+150 mm from carriageway). 
	
•	
The pavers on the footpath should continue over the raised crossings with 
vehicle load taken into account for the area subjected to vehicular traffic.
	
•	
Minimize the number of driveways crossing the footpath should be minimized 
to support pedestrian safety and continuous footpath.
	
•	
The continuity of footpath in the public right-of-way (Photo 2) should be 
maintained, incorporating existing wall openings, steps and other features 
that might obstruct the walkway.
	
•	
Connections for missing links should be provided by installing footpath to 
connect pedestrian areas to each other.
	
•	
Every change in level on the footpath (steps, kerbs or road-works) should be 
made clearly visible through the use of bright contrasting colours and tactile 
pavers for persons with low vision and vision impairment.

Tactile Pavers 
6.4.1	
Usually persons with vision impairment need guidance in using a pedestrianised 
area, especially if the footpath crosses larger open spaces where the usual guidance given by 
the edge of the footpath or building base is not available, or when pedestrian need guidance 
around obstacles. It is important that, whichever tactile pavers are used for guiding or warning, 
they should be used consistently to avoid confusion. The different texture can be followed by 
people using a long or white cane, and can also be detected underfoot by others with low 
vision. 
6.4.2	
Guide blocks (Line blocks, Fig. 16) has straight continuous line and indicate the 
correct path/route to follow, leading to building entrances, an amenity, bus stop etc. It should 
be laid in a simple and logical manner and not be located close to manholes or drains, to 
avoid confusion for persons with vision impairments. A continuous path of guide blocks in 
the direction of pedestrian travel, which has a different texture to the rest of the footpath, can 
provide this guidance.

6.4.3	
Warning blocks (Dot/Blistered block, Fig.17) provides warning signal to screen off 
obstacles, drop-offs or other hazards, to discourage movement in an incorrect direction and 
to give warning of a corner or junction. It should be placed 300 mm at the beginning and end 
of the ramps, stairs and entrance to any door. It should be laid 600mm wide across the entire 
footpath where the crossing occurs. Provide a warning block strip along the inner edge of a 
footpath where there is a break in the line of the corridor, e.g. at a garage forecourt or a gap in 
a building façade for an archway. Tactile paving at intersections, turnings, building entrances, 
etc. should be provided (Fig. 18).

These tiles should have a colour (preferably canary yellow), which contrasts with the 
surrounding surface. Tactile paving must, however, be maintained to ensure that the profile 
does not erode away. This will allow persons with visual impairments to recognize that they 
are continuing in the right direction and that they have not reached a junction or missed a 
turning. A distance of 600 mm is to be maintained from the edge of footpath/ boundary wall/ 
any obstruction to navigate persons with vision impairment (Photo 3, 4 and 5).

6.5	
Level Change
It may be possible to adjust ground levels more broadly to eliminate the need for a ramp 
or steps altogether. Arbitrary changes of level should be avoided. For instance, in creating 
a sense of importance for a building approach, a change in the quality of paving or street 
furniture can have the desired effect, rather than introducing a level change. 
	
•	
A ramp or series of slopes should be integrated into the level change to 
facilitate wheelchair users or pram/buggies and bi-cycles (Photo 6). 
	
•	
The steeper the incline, ramp or steps, and the greater the change in level, 
the more frequent is the need for landings and resting places. 
	
•	
Where resting places are located on landings, they should be out of the way 
of the line of movement. A gradient less than 1:20 does not require handrails 
and resting places. 
	
•	
A gradient of 1:10 or steeper will be extremely difficult and dangerous for most 
persons with disabilities to use. This is the point in the natural landscape where 
accessibility, particularly for those with mobility impairments, will become 
an issue for assistance and/or special provision. At these gradients, many 
persons would welcome a place to rest which is desirable at suitable places.
Photo 6 Levelled Crossing Over Cycle Track, BRT Corridor, New Delhi
6.6	
Maintenance
Regular maintenance of footpath will ensure uninterrupted accessibility. Maintenance should 
prevent or replace cracked and uneven paving slabs and those with loose joints, as they 
become tripping hazards and are difficult to walk on. They also cause puddles to form and 
can become slippery. The selection of paving materials should therefore be guided by the 
ease of repair and maintenance. These should be regularly checked before, during and 
after rains.

Pedestrian Crossings
6.7.1	
Principles of pedestrian crossings
	
•	
Pedestrian must be given the shortest possible direct route to cross the 
street; therefore the most preferred crossing for them is “at-grade”.
	
•	
Mid Block Crossings must be provided for people to cross the street safely 
between building entries or bus stop locations or active land uses on opposite 
sides of the street. 
 
•	
Crossings must be provided at all T-junctions. 
	
•	
At grade pedestrian crossing both near intersection and mid-block, raised 
pedestrian crossing (table top) should be made mandatory in case of 
multilane roads with heavy volume of vehicular traffic. 
6.7.2 	
Key guidelines
	
•	
Minimum 3 m wide pedestrian crossing and 2.5 m wide cycle crossing must 
be provided at all road crossings. 
	
•	
All crossings should have universal accessibility features (for persons with 
disabilities, reduced mobility, vision and hearing impairment) and street 
directional signage.
 
•	
At-grade crossings are preferable in pedestrian priority areas and streets. 
	
•	
If grade separation is required in a high pedestrian and NMT priority zone (e.g. 
near Metro or BRT stations), the pedestrian and NMT must be kept at grade.
	
•	
Midblock crossing kerb extensions provide better visibility for motorists and 
pedestrian (Fig. 20). This kind of kerb extension of the street will be provided 
whenever the street is characterised by kerb side parting facility. 
	
•	
A midblock crossing with a median refuge allows the pedestrian to look for 
gaps in only one direction at a time (Fig. 21).

•	
	
•	
Crossing roads is one of the major deterrents to pedestrian with disabilities 
and reduced mobility. At main crossing points, kerb ramp should be provided 
to facilitate persons with buggies or using wheelchairs. Kerb ramps should 
be located away from corners, on both sides of the street, flush with the 
road. 
	
•	
With crossings at grade, pedestrian experience a continuous pathway that 
will connect them with different destinations, including transit stations and 
commercial districts, safely. 
	
•	
Kerbs are the best indicators for persons with vision impairments to detect 
the edge of the footpath. So kerb ramps/footpath must always have tactile 
pavers/tiles with flared sides of 1:10 gradient (Fig. 22). Kerb ramps should be 
1200 mm, minimum 900 mm wide. The gradient of the ramp should ideally 
be 1:20, and not to exceed 1:12 in any case. It can be difficult in existing 
situations to achieve a dropped kerb with a gradient of 1:20 across a footpath 
and still leave a clear corridor of movement along the footpath. For persons 
with visual impairment, crossing should be marked with tactile paving.



======================================================================

IRC:103-2012
	
•	
Different materials should also be used to indicate the change in function 
between the footpath and carriageway.
	
•	
Make sure the crossing point is always well drained. Avoid gullies in the 
immediate area of the crossing. However, the slight kerb lip required to 
facilitate roadway drainage should be maximum 20mm high and chamfered 
in section.
	
•	
Raised crossings for pedestrian footpath across property entrances, petrol 
pump entrances, minor roads, service lane access and un-signalized 
intersections should be provided.
	
•	
In busy streets, safe crossing areas with pedestrian operated traffic signals 
should be provided. 
	
•	
Audible crossing signals (pelican crossings) help everyone, as well as being 
essential for persons with vision impairments. Pedestrian traffic lights should 
be provided with clearly audible signals to facilitate safe and independent 
crossing of pedestrian with low vision and vision impairment. Acoustic 
devices should be installed on a pole at the point of origin of crossing and 
not at the point of destination.

6.7.3	
Components of pedestrian crossings
6.7.3.1	 Zebra crossing
A zebra crossing is a clearly specified pedestrian track across the carriageway and is 
delineated with the help of alternate black and white stripes, which should have embossed 
texture for easy detection by persons with vision impairment. Thermoplastic paint with 
+ 5 mm embossed texture can be used and raised pedestrian crossings (table top) be provided
(Photo 7). Alternatively dropped kerb can be provided (Fig. 23). A zebra crossing must always 
be accompanied by a “STOP” line as per IRC:35-1970 ‘Code of Practice For Road Markings 
(First Revision)’.

Photo 7 Raised Pedestrian Crossings (Table Top)
Siting of zebra crossing: A zebra crossing should not be sited within 150 m of another such 
crossing. Provision of zebra crossings at short intervals adversely affects the overall efficiency 
of traffic operation in the area. For safety reasons, the zebra crossing should be somewhat set

IRC:103-2012
back from the carriageway line. However, the setback distance should not be so much as to 
cause an appreciable increase in walking distance for the pedestrian. Pedestrian guard-rails 
may be necessary where the setback distance is appreciable or at the skew crossings.
Width of zebra crossing: The width of the zebra crossing must be adequate and should 
generally lie within a range of 2-4 m. For divided carriageways, the crossing should, as far 
as possible, proceed uninterrupted through the median strip. In the event of the median strip 
being used as pedestrian refuge, adequate width of median must be provided. In case of 
raised medians, such portion could be suitably depressed with kerb height not exceeding 
150 mm.
Guard-rails and lighting: Guard-rails in the vicinity of zebra crossing should be of sufficient 
length to deter pedestrian from crossing the road at any arbitrary point along the road. Night 
time visibility of zebra crossing is of vital importance and this can be achieved through proper 
lighting of the intersection area. 
Zebra crossing at signalized intersections: Unlike in the case of un-signalized intersections 
where the pedestrian uses the zebra crossings through judicious gap selection, a signalized 
intersection could allow exclusive time slots for movement of cross pedestrian traffic. In the 
case of intersections controlled by two phase signals, an “all red” phase could be inserted to 
ease pedestrian movements. In case of intersections controlled by three or four phase signals, 
zebra crossings could be utilized in such a manner that pedestrian could move across the 
road in a direction parallel to the movement of vehicular traffic during a particular green phase. 
If exclusive time slots for movement of pedestrian is not available, use of zebra crossings at 
such locations would also warrant judicious gap selection. It is a good idea to install a flashing 
warning signal for pedestrian and left turning vehicular traffic at such intersections that permit 
uninterrupted infiltration to the left for vehicular traffic. Wherever pedestrian signal is provided, 
Stop Line should be provided to stop the vehicles. The physical design features of zebra 
crossings at signalized intersections will be similar to those at un-signalized intersections.

6.7.3.2	 Traffic signal
Keeping in mind the volume of pedestrian traffic, general design criteria for signalized crossings 
on different rights-of-way are as under:
R/Ws ≤ 30 m
A Pedestrian cycle should be added to all at-grade signalized crossings. 
At mid-block, signalized pedestrian only crossings need to be provided as required.
R/Ws above 
30 m 
Separate pedestrian cycle is not necessary at all at-grade signalized crossings. 
However, Median Refuge Islands as per Fig. 21 should be provided at all signalized 
crossings and mid-block pedestrian only crossings.
In a traffic signal, the red phase should keep traffic stopped for minimum 12 seconds for a 
7.5m crossing to allow disabled pedestrian to complete their crossing. Signals that can be 
activated by the pedestrian using a push button box (Pelican signal) are useful, particularly 
at mid-block crossings. A large diameter (up to 50 mm) raised button that can be activated 
by a closed fist will be usable by most people. Traffic signal poles and push buttons should 
also be colour contrasted. At signalized intersections audible signals can be very useful to 
pedestrian with vision impairment. Audible signals may encourage safer crossing behavior 
among children. These signals have a beep which sounds during the first part of the green 
phase to indicate when it is safe to cross the road. To help pedestrian with vision impairment, 
the push button box should be located consistently at crossings. The push button box should 
have Braille buttons and raised alphabets for different signals, for example ‘s’ for stop and ‘g’ 
for go and so on. It is also important to place the traffic signal in conformity with pedestrian 
sign (Refer IRC: 67- 2010:Code of Practice for Road Signs (Second Revision)) to enable 
pedestrian to cross the road in safer manner. Also, variable message signage including the 
options of pedestrian timing can be displayed.
6.7.3.3	 Refuge islands
The provision of pedestrian refuges and traffic islands is a useful traffic management technique 
on pedestrian routes near junctions or roundabouts enabling the pedestrian to deal with one lane 
particular direction of traffic at a time. Pedestrian refuges are, an effective way to help disabled 
and elderly pedestrian. They do reduce pedestrian accidents. This should be mandatory on 
all roads with four lanes or more. Traffic islands and medians should be adequate in size to 
accommodate the length of a pram or wheelchair and pusher. The recommended width is, 
therefore 2 m (Table 4). At staggered pelican crossings including those without guardrails, 
two courses of tactile paving linking the two kerb edges should be provided with the rest of 
the central reserve paved nor¬mally. Traffic islands and medians should be accompanied by 
dropped kerbs on both footpaths.

The safety of pedestrian is enhanced by the provision of pedestrian refuge islands on roads 
having wide carriageway (Fig. 25 & 26). The main function of a refuge island is to provide a 
place of safety for pedestrian who cannot cross the entire carriageway at one time in safety. 
At-grade Median Refuges allow pedestrian to wait safely for crossing wide streets with long 
signal rotations (Photo 8 & 9). The best use of medians is planting of trees and bioswales to 
create on conducive temperature for the street & increasing its ecological value by treating 
and filtering storm water on site. Medians can be designed to retain, cleanse, and infiltrate 
storm water runoff from the road way, replenishing ground water and decreasing the peak flow 
burden on storm water infrastructure.

6.7.4	
Types of pedestrian crossings
Pedestrian cross-walks should be provided at all important intersections and such other 
locations where substantial conflict exists between vehicular and pedestrian movements. 
Wherever possible the cross-walks should be at right angles to the carriage-way and properly 
marked so that the pedestrian are subjected to minimum inconvenience. Cross-walks should 
not substantially increase the walk distance for pedestrian. Adequate visibility, freedom from 
obstructions and sufficient space for waiting are the other important requirements for location 
of cross-walks. Pedestrian crossings can be broadly classified as:
	
(a)	
At-grade crossings
	
(b)	
Grade separated crossings

6.7.4.1	 At-grade pedestrian crossings
At-grade pedestrian crossings are those where the pedestrian cross the carriageway at the 
same level as that of vehicular movement. Grade separated crossings are those where the 
pedestrian are required to cross the carriageway at a level different from that of vehicular 
movement. Thus, the latter may be in the form of a pedestrian subway or a foot over bridge 
across the road. At-grade pedestrian crossings are of common occurrence in cities and towns. 
With respect to locational aspects, such crossings could be classified as:
	
(i)	
Pedestrian crossings at intersections
	
(ii)	
At-grade pedestrian crossing away from intersection (e.g. mid-block 
crossings).
	
(iii)	
At-grade pedestrian crossing at Intersections could be uncontrolled or 
controlled. 
	
•	
Uncontrolled crossings are those where the pedestrian cross-walk is marked 
by studs or paint line but not controlled by any system of signals. Provision 
of uncontrolled pedestrian crossings must, as far as possible, be avoided 
except where the intersection itself is left uncontrolled because of extremely 
low volumes of both vehicular and pedestrian traffic even during peak hours 
and where accident records do not indicate any need to segregate vehicular 
traffic from cross pedestrian traffic.
	
•	
Controlled crossings are achieved normally through provision of zebra 
crossings whether at an unsignalized or signalized intersection. Once a 
pedestrian is on a zebra crossing, she/he gains priority of movement with 
respect to vehicular traffic. Pedestrian crossings must inevitably be integrated 
with the overall design of the intersection.
6.7.4.1.1	Uncontrolled crossings: Mid-block zebra crossings are to be provided only when the 
distance between two consecutive intersections is more than 300 m and simultaneously, there 
is a genuine demand for such a facility (e.g. shopping or commercial area being located within 
this area).
It must be noted that mid-block crossings are more difficult to control and frequently warrant 
provision of additional safety measures. All such crossings must be properly maintained with 
respect to painting, marking, etc., and must always be accompanied by suitable “pedestrian 
cross” signs. These signs must be so located that their visibility is not impaired by road side 
trees, overhead service poles, bends, humps or any other physical obstruction. For undivided 
carriageways, mid-block crossings should be accompanied by “STOP” lines with central 
barrier line marking being continued on either side of the crossing up to a certain distance 
on each side. Fig. 27 shows a typical layout plan for such a crossing. In case of two way 
streets, the “STOP” line will be on one side of the crossing only as shown in, Fig. 28 Beacons 
or flashing signals may be used with advantage in conjunction with pedestrian cross signs at 
such locations. In the case of mid-block crossings, the guard-rail must open at the crossing 
only. Guard-rails are rather essential for satisfactory operation of mid-block crossings. All other 
physical design considerations in this case remain same as in the case of zebra crossings at 
intersections.

6.7.4.1.2	Controlled crossings: Control measures at mid-block crossings may be warranted 
when one or more of the following conditions exist:
	
(i)	
Peak hour volumes of pedestrian (P) and vehicles (V) are such that PV2> 108 
for undivided carriageways and PV2> 2 x 108 for divided carriageways;
	
(ii)	
Approach speeds of vehicles exceed 65 kph;

(iii)	
Waiting time for pedestrian/vehicles becomes too long;
	
(iv)	
Accident records indicate 5 or more injuries to pedestrian in a year due to 
collision with vehicles.
The control measure usually adopted in such cases is a traffic signal with exclusive pedestrian 
phase. In certain cases, where the warrants are met only during peak hours, police control 
could also be introduced. Pedestrian operated pelican signals could also be introduced at 
such locations where the vehicular volume is too large even though the volume of pedestrian 
may be low. Unless judiciously used, pelican crossings are known to cause undesirable 
impediments to the flow of vehicular traffic. 
The design of street crossings should aim for simplicity and consistency. The recommended 
minimum width of a street crossing is 1800 mm. Where the pedestrian has to cross multiple 
lanes of traffic, central islands are extremely helpful because they reduce the distance that 
the pedestrian have to walk on the road at one time without protection. Central islands convert 
two-way roads into two separate one-way roads, which are much easier to cross. They can 
also help slow the movement of traffic and reduce vehicle speeds. Centre islands should be 
at least 2 m wide across the direction of the road to cater for wheelchairs, with a cut through 
at the surface level of the crossing, preferably 5 m wide along the length of the road.
The safety of a crossing can be significantly improved by extending the footpath out across 
any parking lanes (Fig. 29 & Photo 10). This has the triple purpose of reducing the width of 
roadway to be crossed, slowing vehicular traffic and improving the ability of pedestrian and 
drivers to see each other. Crossings should be laid out with ample space, especially at the top 
of the kerb ramp to allow easy passage for pedestrian who are not crossing the road.
It is important to design crossings with consistent patterns, to enable visually impaired users 
to orient themselves easily. For instance, the traffic signal pole should always be on the left 
(or the right) of the crossing; and the push button at the same height (about 1000 mm above 
the ground). With respect to design speed to be considered at crossings, the following are 
recommended
	
•	
15th percentile speed (approx. 0.95 m/s) should be used for the design of 
pedestrian crossing facilities
	
•	
If older pedestrian are high in proportion a crossing speed of 0.79 m/s should 
be used
	
•	
In educational and recreational areas it can be taken as 0.98 m/s

6.7.4.1.3	Pedestrian safety at roundabouts
Roundabouts are used at intersections in place of signals and can handle significant traffic 
volumes. Although their primary purpose is to provide free flowing mobility to motor vehicles, 
properly designed roundabouts can create a positive environment for pedestrian, as well as 
a unique design treatment. Roundabouts have lower vehicle speeds and fewer pedestrian 
collisions than standard signalized or unsignalized intersections, and experience has 
demonstrated that vehicular crashes are significantly reduced when low-speed, single lane 
roundabouts replace four-way intersections1.
When vehicular volumes are low to moderate, roundabouts allow pedestrian to cross frequently 
without waiting for vehicles to stop. However, crossing pedestrian are not protected since 
vehicles are free flowing. Modern roundabouts incorporate splitter islands to provide crossing 
refuge for pedestrian and deflect the path of motor vehicles. This deflection reduces vehicle 
speeds making it easier for pedestrian to cross. Because they introduce non-standard geometry 
to the intersection, roundabouts can be confusing to pedestrian with visual impairments and 
special care must be taken to provide way finding cues such as tactile pavers/ audio cues. 
Roundabouts are safer for pedestrian than conventional intersections. Pedestrian generally 
walk on footpaths around the perimeter of the circular roadway and roundabout. If they 
require traveling across the roadway, they move across only one direction of traffic at a 
time. In addition, crossing distances are relatively short, and traffic speeds are lower than at 
conventional intersections.
Studies indicate that, on average, converting conventional intersections to roundabouts can 
reduce the magnitude of pedestrian crashes by about 75 percent. Single-lane roundabouts,

in particular, have been reported to cause substantially lower pedestrian crash rates than 
comparable intersections with traffic signals. Roundabouts have fewer conflicts. 
Fig. 30 Pedestrian Facilities at Roundabout
For example, any four legged uncontrolled junction offers 32 vehicle-vehicle conflicts and 
24 vehicle-pedestrian conflicts while round about only offers 8 vehicle-vehicle and 8 vehicle- 
pedestrian conflicts. Only Multi-lane roundabouts present some challenges to pedestrian, 
thus reducing the safety effects. Fig. 30 & 31 and Photo 11 shows pedestrian facilities at 
round-about in which all the approach arms can be used to provide zebra crossings with table 
top facilities.

6.7.4.2	 Grade separated pedestrian crossing facilities
6.7.4.2.1	Warrants
Provision of a grade separated pedestrian facility may be warranted at locations where one or 
more of the following conditions exist:
	
(1)	
Volumes of pedestrian and vehicular traffic are so large that insertion of an 
exclusive pedestrian phase will increase the cycle time for traffic signals 
beyond 120 seconds;
	
(2)	
Vehicular traffic demands uninterrupted flow as associated with major arterial 
roads and expressways;
	
(3)	
Control at-grade pedestrian crossing decisively fails to mitigate the problems 
of pedestrian-vehicle collision. Viability of a grade separated pedestrian facility 
must be checked against delay costs for both pedestrian and vehicle drivers/
users including increase in vehicle operating costs inflicted by increased 
delays. Effective law enforcement is necessary to control incidental crossing 
of Stop line by vehicles. 
6.7.4.2.2	Layout of grade separated pedestrian facilities
Most pedestrian consider that the shortest and quickest way to cross a road is at grade (at 
level) – in the absence of traffic. This perception is heightened under mobility impairment. The 
reasons are various, for instance, tortuous routes confuse blind people, additional distances 
hamper frail people, steps, escalators and steep ramps are problematic, if not physically 
impossi¬ble, to several groups. Descending into badly lit, insanitary subway is unpleasant, as 
well as adding to fears (real or imag¬inary) of being attacked especially to children, girls and 
women with disability.
Hence, at grade pedestrian crossings are the shortest, quickest and the most comfortable 
way to cross a road by any pedestrian. The ideal situation is one where the pedestrian does

not have to change level and this should be seriously considered in planning new facilities. If 
this cannot be achieved, the height that the pedestrian must rise or fall should be minimized. 
Generally, a subway more easily solves this problem than a FOB, as the headroom to be 
accommodated is less. The layout of the flyover is so prepared that it does not end at preferred 
mode of crossing nor embankment falls in the preferred mode of crossing. Elevated portion 
may be extended or pedestrian subway should invariably be planned through the embankment. 
Table 5 gives requirements of pedestrian subways.

Visibility
There should be a clear view from one end to the other and a good level of lighting, at 
least 50 lux.
Security
CCTV cameras placed in subways will enhance security and should be located so as to 
provide full coverage. Notices to the effect that CCTV is in operation should deter vandals 
and provide a measure of comfort to pedestrian. Small shops shall be encouraged and 
set up as it gives sense of safety to pedestrians during night time also.
Options given below are prioritized in order of pedestrian friendliness:
	
•	
Hump subways: Both the car lane users and the pedestrian (including cyclists, 
wherever segregated facility is provided) need to have a change in level. The 
surface of the road is raised (+1.5 m) using a ramp of 1:30 and the pedestrian 
paths (cycle tracks, wherever provided) are lowered using ramps of slope 
1:20 with landing at appropriate intervals to equally achieve a clear minimum 
height of 2.75 m (-1.5 m). The advantage of such subways is that the walking 
length of a pedestrian is not increased to that extent that discourages her/him 
from using it. Fig. 32 shows a typical sections of subway. 
	
•	
Full subways: Pedestrian paths are lowered to a depth where a clear height 
of 2.75 m minimum can be achieved using 1:20 slope ramps with appropriate 
landings. The car lanes encounter no level change and maintain the same 
level.  Small shop may be included in the planning of subway which may 
provide a sense of safety to the pedestrian traffic during night time. This will 
also help maintain the subway. Even cost of construction and maintenance 
of subway may be recovered by allowing shops to operate in the subways. 
Fig. 33 shows a typical section of a hump subway. Subway with 40 m length 
should be provided with forced ventilation facilities in busy areas. While 
planning and designing the subway, an attempt should be made to ensure 
natural lighting and ventilation as much as possible.
	
•	
FOB: this is of least priority, since the walking length increases 
considerably.

6.7.4.2.3	Subway and foot over bridges (FOB)
Escalators are generally not considered desirable as an option for inclusive mobility. Approach 
to subways and footbridges should comprise of ramps/elevator or inclinators and steps, except 
that in the subway situation. The widths should be as generous as possible. 
A slope of 5 per cent (1 in 20) on footbridge ramps with appropriate resting places/landings 
is preferable as per section 6.8. Within the subway, a handrail set 760 mm-900 mm above 
the walking surface should be provided. To assist visually impaired people, tactile paving/tiles 
and a colour contrast should be provided 300 mm before and after i.e. at the top and bottom 
of the flight of steps and these areas should be well lit. Ramp/lift is mandatory and steps/
escalators can be provided. Lift should be provided on both the entrances/exits and should 
have minimum internal dimensions of 1500 mm x 1500 mm (Fig. 41-43). More natural light for 
the subways should be provided. Greater safety can be achieved by having hawker spaces 
in some subways and/or video surveillance camera. Minimum width of the FOB should be 
1800 mm.
6.8	
Ramps and Steps
Ideally, both steps and ramps should be provided. Some persons with disabilities (such as crutch 
users) find it easier to use steps rather than a ramp. However, in the external environment, 
if there is no room for both, a ramp (Fig. 34) should be provided. The route should not be 
tortuous, nor deliver persons out of the way in which they want to go. 
6.8.1	
Ramp
A ramp should be accompanied by a flight of easygoing steps. Slope of ramp is to be a 
maximum of 1:12. Refer Table 6 for ramp gradients for long lengths which will facilitate water 
to drain away from the ramp surface and from landings. Grill type gullies can be provided 
across the width of the ramp surface to ensure good drainage. Slip-resistant smooth surfaces 
can be used such as ribbed or brushed concrete, textured stone or macadam. Landings at 
every 750 mm of vertical rise should be provided and minimum width of the ramp will be 
1200 mm. Handrails are to be on both sides at two levels 760 mm and 900 mm; both ends 
are to be rounded and grouted and to be extended to 300 mm beyond top and bottom of 
ramp. Surfaces (ramp + landing) should be slip resistant. Tactile warning tile 300 mm will 
be provided before and end of ramp to indicate change in gradient. On long ramps, one can 
provide passing bays, 1800 mm x 1800 mm every 20 m. Landings should be at least 1500 
mm x 1500 mm. Where a door or gate opens onto a landing, the length of the landing should 
be at least 1300 mm clear of the door swing. Edge protection 100 mm high is required at the 
sides of ramps and landings to prevent persons falling through. A turning circle of 1800 mm 
diameter will be provided at the top and bottom of all ramps.

Steps
Uniform risers of 150 mm and tread of 300 mm shall be adopted for the stairs. Stair edges 
should have bright contrasting colors. Maximum height of a flight between landings shall be 
1200 mm. Landing should be 1200 mm deep, clear of any door swing. The steps should have 
an unobstructed width of at least 1200 mm. Top and bottom landings with a strip of tactile 
warning blocks (Fig. 35), is to be provided to give advanced tactile warning of a change in 
level. The first and last steps should provide a permanent visual contrast with the rest of the 
steps. Flights and landings should have a clear unobstructed width of at least 1000 mm. The 
rise between landings should not exceed 1200 mm. Heights of risers should be consistent 
throughout the flight. Tapered treads and open risers should not be used. Nosing should be 
avoided. There should be a suitable continuous handrail (Photo 12) on each side of flights 
and landings. The handrail tops should be 600–900 mm above the pitch line of the flight of 
steps and above the surface of the landing. Handrails should extend at least 300 mm beyond 
the top and bottom risers and terminate in a closed end that does not project into the path of 
travel and should be provided on both the sides (Photo 13). Handrails should project 50 mm 
from a wall to allow adequate grip/ knuckle space. The rise of each step should be no greater 
than 150 mm, consistent throughout the path. It is convenient for all users if the numbers of

Handrail
A continuous handrail on each side of the flights and landings should be provided. The 
handrails should be between 760 mm and 900 mm above the ramp and landing surfaces
(Fig. 36). Handrails should extend 300 mm beyond the ramp and steps at the top and bottom, 
and terminate in a closed end that does not project into the path of travel. Handrail profile and 
projection from a wall should be suitable to allow adequate grip. Handrail should be circular 
in diameter of 38-40 mm with clear knuckle space of 50 mm (Fig. 37). Handrails should be 
supported centrally on the underside so there is no obstruction to the passage of the hand 
along the rail. There should also be a minimum of 600 mm clear space above the handrail. 
Colour/tonal contrasted handrails are essential to assist persons with low vision.

Elevator/Lift
A carefully designed lift makes a huge contribution to the accessibility of an subway/FOB 
for persons with disabilities and reduced mobility. Lift locations should be clearly signposted 
(Fig. 38-40) from the main pedestrian route, and recognizable through design and location. 
The colour and tone of the lift doors should contrast with the surrounding wall finish to assist 
in their location. Minimum lift car space should be 1500 mm x 1500 mm. Doors should be 
900 mm wide and closing mechanism is to be adjusted to give adequate entry time. Call 
button and control panel will be placed at a reach of 800 mm-1000 mm with at least 400 mm 
from any corner or have a clear floor space of at least 900 mm x 1200 mm with no obstruction 
placed to prevent a wheelchair user from reaching the call button. There should be no gap 
or difference in level between the lift door and the floor surface at each level. If such a gap 
is unavoidable, then it should not be more than 10 mm. Review mirror and kick plates are to 
be fitted. The lift should have a voice announcement system along with a visual display to 
indicate the floor level. A clear landing area of minimum dimensions 1500 mm x 1500 mm 
(Fig. 41), in front of the lift doors should be provided. Handrail is to be placed at a height of 
900mm from the floor level; and is to be fixed on both sides and at the rear of the lift (Fig.42). 
The landing area shall be made distinguishable by texture and colour of floor surface. It will 
aid location and recognition of core areas. The floor level/location should be indicated on the 
wall adjacent to or just above the call buttons, and opposite the lift doors whereever possible. 
Buttons with Braille and raised letters in sharp contrast from the background are meant to aid 
persons with vision impairments (Fig. 43).

persons, particularly for persons with visual impairments and those using a wheelchair or 
pushing a pram/buggy.
All Indian cities experience street vendors operating on major roads and they are important 
service providers for road users especially pedestrian. They are often found as a consequence 
of the demand generated on the streets. Usually, they are found encroaching the footpath or 
the left most lane of the carriageway, which affects the users that are found to be using this 
facility. In such cases, the pedestrian or cyclists (riding in the left most lane in the carriageway) 
are pushed toward the median with the chances of mixing with fast moving traffic.
Such activities are to complement economic viability. Integration of road infrastructure will 
surely reflect a safer and functional design. The sheer advantage of integration of such 
demand as part of road infrastructure is that they cater to cyclists, pedestrian including bus 
commuters. Hawker spaces do not affect the space but these affect function for the mobility 
of the pedestrian. Their presence also ensures safety. It is therefore important to integrate the 
hawkers’ activities as a part of the design depending on intensity of activities
6.11.2	
Allocation and design of hawker space
Hawkers should be relocated/ allocated a space. Least displacement is necessary for the 
adequate use of the space to be allocated. The size of the space should be equal or more to 
accommodate requirement of the hawkers. It should be low maintenance, attractive and easy 
to use. 
6.11.3	
Following are the requirements to outline a designed space for this vital component 
of road infrastructure. The determinants for the design are as follows:
	
•	
Location: Designated space should be such that the spillover of activities or 
clientele does not start encroaching the pedestrian path. However, additional 
spaces could be planned and designed near auto rickshaw/ short-parking 
term bays for vehicles that are clearly distinct from the other lanes/tracks/ 
infrastructure. The ideal location is to integrate the space after allocating 
space for the carriageway, lanes/tracks and pedestrian paths. The hawkers 
can then be integrated along the pedestrian path in case of arterials and 
along the carriageway between parking bays in a distributor street.
	
•	
Material: Use of material can be same as that of the pedestrian path or a 
mix of materials can be used to evolve a pattern in the paving. It should 
be attractive enough for vendors to use it. The material should ensure no 
hindrance in drainage.
	
•	
Edge Treatment: The edges could be designed using street furniture like 
benches and bollards. 
	
•	
Change in Elevations: It would not be wise to segregate levels in case 
the area is small. Hawkers and vendors would like to be as close to their 
client and a change in level from the pedestrian path would not ensure a 
fluid movement of their clientele. A visual segregation works the best in such 
cases since it is also easier to demarcate territory, incase regulations are to 
be enforced.

IRC:103-2012
	
•	
Access: Space should be easily accessible by all types of hawkers. Some of 
the hawkers use bicycles and wheeled-carts. To ensure easy access of such 
spaces, a mountable kerb could be designed. Another provision would be 
the use of ramps provided for level access for persons with disabilities. Such 
a design would ensure 90% usage and would minimize conflicts between 
users especially with cyclists and would prevent accidents.
6.11.4 	
Placement of street furniture
In both rural and urban situations, proper placement of furniture out of the line of movement, 
is necessary so that persons do not bump into it. Good placing and coordination of furniture 
will result in a tidy, legible pathway or street that is easy to move along. Elements should be 
placed in straight lines. For instance, light posts define the main zone of objects in a street. 
Therefore bollards, traffic signs and post boxes can follow this line. Bulky objects such as post 
boxes should not be placed where they will become a visual obstruction at crossing points. 
The line of furniture should allow a clear circulation corridor of 1800 mm, minimum 1200 mm, 
wide. This dimension allows a wheelchair user and a pedestrian to pass each other without 
having to give way. In addition to these, provision of rain shelter facility should provided at 
appropriate places so as to enable the pedestrian protect against heavy rain. It is essential to 
provide wash facility at selected interval to prevent involuntary compulsive nuisance. 
6.11.5	
Need for resting places/seats
Elderly and disabled pedestrian need to rest at reasonably frequent intervals. Provision of 
resting places - simple sitting areas with chairs, benches or steps where one can have a break 
- is an important element of pedestrian spaces (Fig. 45). Resting spaces and shelter should 
also be provided where frequency is more.
	
•	
As with all street furniture, seating should be placed next to the footpath 
without obstructing it, and painted in contrasting colours. Seats can be as 
simple as wooden benches or perch-type rails to lean against.  
	
•	
Seats should be 450 mm and backrest 700 mm high (Fig. 46).
	
•	
Tables with knee clearance of 700 mm and 600 mm deep (Fig. 47) should 
be provided with 600 mm clear width of table and wheelchair space of 
1000 mm (Fig. 48).
	
•	
Along frequently used pedestrian ways, seating should be provided at regular 
intervals, typically every 50 metres. 
	
•	
It is helpful to people with sight problems if these and other amenity areas 
adjacent to walkways and pedestrian routes are available in contrasting 
colors.

6.11.6	
Colour and contrast
Furniture should contrast in colour and in tone with the background against which it is seen 
and should be highlighted by means of a 75–100 mm high feature, such as a crest or band, 
which contrasts in colour and tone with the furniture itself.
Furniture should be continuous to ground level. Pedestal-mounted objects should be avoided 
such as litter bins, telephones or letter boxes. Items attached to posts should face in the 
direction of travel so that they do not interfere with the line of movement. Where eye-level 
signs, such as maps, are supported on two vertical poles, a tapping rail located between the 
posts at around 250 mm above ground level prevents an unsuspecting pedestrian colliding 
with the sign. The rail and posts should be colour contrasted with their background.
6.12	
Bollards
	
•	
Bollards are often used to stop vehicles form entering the footpath and to 
keep pedestrian away from vehicular traffic. Unless positioned carefully, 
they can form a barrier to wheelchair users and are a particular hazard for 
persons with visual impairments. 
	
•	
They are essential, so as to ensure clear escape routes. Bollards with 
minimum 1000 mm high should be identifiable by using contrasting colours 
with the provision of reflective tapes.
	
•	
To stop use by bicycles/bikes, bollards at suitable locations should be 
provided with clear gap of 1200 mm between two bollards. (Fig. 49).
Fig. 49 Height and Gap Between Bollards
6.13	
Lighting
Personal security is especially important to vulnerable groups such as elderly people and 
women (including girls and women with disabilities) more than men and good lighting is 
particularly necessary for pedestrian crossings, public transport facilities and for car parks. 
Concentrated lighting is especially required where congregation of pedestrian is expected 
i.e. at bus stops, near crosswalks, near street furniture. Lighting should be accentuated at all 
intersections and hazard-prone areas.

•	
Lighting shall be directed downward (Fig. 50 & 51) at all times (up-lighting 
must be prohibited).
	
•	
Lighting must be provided every 20–30 m interval, focusing light on the 
pedestrian and bicycle lanes and not on the car lanes. 
	
•	
Pedestrian lighting should illuminate the pedestrian walkway; appropriate 
lighting fixtures not exceeding a height of 4m from ground grade level should 
be provided.
	
•	
Recessed lighting on the ground along vehicular access, ways and pedestrian 
walkways should be highly encouraged.
	
•	
Wall-mounted lighting, besides reducing street furniture, ensures a more 
even distribution of light, reducing the risk of damage due to vehicle impact 
and  vandalism. 
	
•	
All exterior lighting fixtures shall conform to the shielding requirements.
	
•	
A whiter light source, for example high-pressure sodium, is preferable in 
city and town centres for the aesthetic effect and for better colour definition, 
which benefits those with poor sight.
	
•	
White lighting at 25-40 lux for footpaths is recommended. It is recommended 
to maintain colour contrast from road and to ensure colour contrast of tactile 
tiles visible at night to persons with low vision. 
	
•	
Location of lighting fixtures must consider the location of existing and 
proposed trees. 
	
•	
Spacing of fixtures should be based on the intensity of light, height of the 
fixture and the clearances from tree canopies such that no light is blocked 
by the summer foliage. 
	
•	
Higher lighting levels (80 lux) using special light poles for pedestrian crossing 
is recommended, while lower level light poles are preferred to avoid shadow 
where there are high trees.
	
•	
Under no circumstances should the lighting pole interfere with the clearance 
of the main pedestrian walkway of the footpath. Light pole may preferably be 
located within the tree-planting zone.

School Zone Improvements
Traffic safety around schools is an important concern to parents, school officials, and 
communities. Improvements should start at the planning level; when new elementary schools 
are sited, they should be located inside neighborhoods to minimize the need for young children 
to cross busy arterial streets. These schools should not face busy arterial streets. School 



======================================================================
PAGE 62 of 75
======================================================================
55
IRC:103-2012
officials need to review attendance boundaries and walking attendance boundaries so that 
young children do not have to face unnecessary challenges on their way to and from school.
Schools should plan for “Safe Routes to School” walking and bicycle plans to serve all residences 
within the walking attendance boundary and work with local agencies to identify and correct 
traffic problem areas while developing these plans. These “Safe Route to School” walking and 
bicycling plans help to identify where traffic control (signs, traffic signals, crosswalks, adult 
guards, etc.) should be placed around the school and along school routes. Marked crosswalks 
can help guide children to the best routes to school with these plans..
A number of roadway improvements can be used to enhance the safety and mobility of children 
walking to or from school. Footpaths need to be kept clear of obstructions and should be 
promptly repaired when damaged. Wider footpaths should be used closer to schools where 
larger groups of students are walking.
The greatest hazards to all pedestrian occur when crossing streets; young children are even 
more vulnerable, as they have trouble judging traffic and finding an acceptable gap to cross. 
Traffic Marshals are generally required to be deputed to ensure safe crossing of school 
children. Some of the most effective safety treatments are low-cost and easy to implement 
measures such as larger standing areas and stand-back lines to keep students further back 
from busy streets while waiting to cross. Students drop off area should be clearly marked.
Police enforcement in school zones are required in situations where drivers are speeding or 
not yielding to children in crosswalks. Radar speed boards and other innovative enforcement 
programs, such as photo speed or red-light cameras may also be employed at some 
crossings.
One of the biggest safety problems around schools is often created by parents or caretakers 
dropping off and picking up children. There are two immediate solutions: 
	
•	
This needs to be a clearly marked area where parents are allowed to drop 
off and pick up (Photo 14 & 15) their children, and 
	
•	
drop-off/pick-up regulations must be provided to parents prior to the first day of 
school. Drop-off areas must be situated away from where children on foot cross 
streets or access the school and should be designed to provide the appropriate 
amount of on-site vehicle storage or queuing along the on-street drop-off zone. 
Parent drop-off zones must be segregated from bus drop-off zones.

IRC:103-2012
	
Following steps are suggested for ensuring safety at schools:
	
•	
An effort should be made to ensure high degree of road safety by taking 
confidence, cooperations and all possible help from the local traffic police, 
schools offices, parents and students and neighburing areas. 
	
•	
School attendance and walking attendance boundaries should be reviewed 
and may need to be adjusted and planned to provide safest walking and 
bicycling conditions for children. 
	
•	
“Safe Route to School” walking maps should be prepared to serve all homes 
within the walking attendance boundaries of all elementary schools and 
middle schools. 
	
•	
There are a number of engineering treatments and traffic control techniques 
that can be applied to improve safety and walkability at schools and school 
crossings. Each school will be required to utilize its own set of engineering 
treatments. 
	
•	
Local officials should take initiative to review school area footpaths, 
crosswalks, and other traffic control devices annually to make sure that they 
are in good condition before the start of the next school year. 
	
•	
School officials need to ensure feedback to local officials and police to help 
identify problems areas or maintenance needs.

Pedestrian Facilities-Parking
6.16.1	
Provision and siting
Adequate parking places shall be provided to discourage indiscriminate parking, as this can 
obstruct building access. Where parking is provided, priority should be given to the persons with 
impaired mobility, so that they can park their cars as convenient to entrances as possible. 
6.16.2	
Designated car parking spaces-accessible parking
	
Following are the important issues for accessible parking:
	
•	
Designated car parking spaces may be arranged perpendicular or parallel 
to the kerb. Dropped kerbs will facilitate access to the footpath for persons 
using wheelchairs (Photo 16).
Photo 15 Marking of Student Drop off Area 



======================================================================
PAGE 64 of 75
======================================================================
57
IRC:103-2012
	
•	
If arranged perpendicular to the kerb, a minimum 900mm clear space beside 
the designated bay so as to facilitate wheelchair transfer from car to footpath 
(Fig. 57) should be provided. Cars can be driven forward or reversed into 
the bay, so that the transfer space is at the right side.
	
•	
Two accessible parking lots with overall minimum dimension 3600 mm x 
5000 mm, should be provided (Fig. 58). 
	
•	
It should have the international signage painted on the ground and also on 
a signpost/board put near it.
	
•	
There needs to be directional signs guiding people to the accessible 
parking.
	
•	
Wheel stoppers should be provided to avoid vehicles to occupy space on the 
pedestrian footpath.
	
•	
The transfer side should be taken care of in case spaces are arranged 
parallel to the kerb. A disabled driver or passenger getting out on the kerb 
side may transfer directly onto the wheelchair located on the footpath. 
	
•	
This can be very difficult if the kerb is high, as it necessitates lifting the 
wheelchair out of the car up onto the footpath, and then lifting oneself up onto 
the chair from the car seat. This problem does not present itself if parking 
is perpendicular to the kerb, as transfer will always be onto road level. This 
may be more convenient, assuming the provision of appropriate kerb ramp 
provide access to the footpath. 
	
•	
Where parallel parking is the only option, some persons prefer to transfer on 
the road side to avoid the kerb, despite the obvious hazards. If they do so, 
a clear space of 1200 mm must be available at the ends of the car to allow 
them to gain access to the footpath.
	
•	
In some situations, where footpath width is restricted, it may be appropriate 
to ramp the footpath down to road level for the full length of the parking 
spaces in question.
	
•	
In car parks of 25 cars or less, the roadway may be used for transfer purposes, 
provided this area is clearly visible to approaching traffic and the roadway is 
not a through road.

6.16.3 	 Drop-off/boarding points
Provide a drop-off/boarding point near entrances marked by wheelchair (access) symbol 
painted on the floor and put on a pole at height of 2 m (Photo 17). Passengers with impaired 
mobility often move slowly and therefore are vulnerable in bad weather. Persons with visual 
impairments also benefit from having direct access to the building entrance. Provide protection 
from the weather wherever possible. A canopy height of 2500 mm facilitates most passenger 
vehicles.
Drop-off points should be level, with a firm surface. Avoid siting manholes, drainage gullies 
etc in areas where persons get out of cars, in particular at kerb ramps. Such items can impede 
walking sticks, crutches and wheelchairs and can become hazardous in cold weather. Drop-
off points should not obstruct circulation areas. Avoid transfer directly onto footpaths or, if 
this is not possible, ensure that the footpath is at least 2000 mm wide at the drop-off‚ point.

Pedestrian Facilities at Transit Areas
Pedestrian are extremely exposed and vulnerable even within the transit areas due the 
presence of vehicular traffic in most of the Indian cities. Transit areas include right from the 
bus stop, bus station, bus terminal to railway and airport terminal. Even at the interchange 
where both a central bus station and a metro station co-exist, the dispersal of pedestrian 
traffic is of   paramount importance. Walkways have a very important role to play in linking 
the interchange points of different transport systems – bus, trains, metro to allow easy and 
comfortable dispersal. This distance should be the shortest and the most direct route which 
should be walkable and safe. From this perspective, the integration of the bus station with 
the metro stations through a walkway that allows people easy access with minimal conflict 
ensures pedestrian friendly environment. 
Walking is an ideal mode for a trip length of 500 m to 1 km. To promote walk trips as well as 
to provide adequate pedestrian facilities the preferences and perceptions of the pedestrian 
need to be understood in a rational manner. Pedestrian facilities should be planned in an 
integrated manner so as to ensure a continuous pedestrian flow. It should be useful therefore

IRC:103-2012
to look at the pedestrian needs for an area for different types of transit areas.  The following 
components have to be considered for provision of pedestrian facilities at transit areas. 
FACILITIES FOR PEDESTRIAN IN TRANSIT AREAS (Photo 18-21)
WALKABLE AREA WITHIN THE TRANSIT AREA
A.	
The permissible walking distance in transit area is 400m & the sufficient area for pedestrian to be 
aware of other pedestrian in transit area is required to be 1.9-3.3 sq.m./person.
The maximum flow of pedestrian for public transit occurs when transit stops are within a 10 minute 
walking distance from source.
Direct pedestrian path makes it easier for people to walk.
PEDESTRAIN FACILITIES IN TRANSIT AREAS- WALKWAYS
B.	
Pedestrian walkways should be planned with minimum width of 2 m with accessible grade changes.
Pedestrian should not have to walk more than 200 m to ramp or elevators to change floor level to 
access transit.
FOOTPATH/FOOTPATHS
C.	
1.8-2 m footpath/footpaths for light pedestrian traffic.
5 m footpaths for heavy pedestrian traffic.
To allow walking at near normal speeds, the footpaths must provide continuity without any obstacles.
CROSSWALKS
D.	
The  cross walks should be provided at every 30 m on the pedestrian streets.
At the zebra crossing, width of  zebra crossing should be  within the range of 2 m–4 m.
The minimum island size should be 15 sq.m.
The radii  at the corner of the streets varies from 0.7 m to 1.7 m and with curbside parking it can vary 
from 1.7 m to  3.5 m.
In case of raised median, being used as pedestrian refuge, such portion could be suitable depressed 
with curb height not exceeding 150 mm.
RAMPS
E.	
Ramps must have maximum slope of 1: 20. A level walking space should be provided at the top of the 
ramp.
The  ramps and landings are required where the slope  exceeds 5 per cent. 
For ramps maximum permissible slope is 8.33% with minimum width of 1m.
The hand rails should be installed along the side of the ramp; more than 0.15m or the length should 
be greater than 2 m.
The diameter of the hand rail should not be more than 35 mm for proper gripping.
 OTHER PEDESTRAIN FACILITIES IN TRANSIT AREAS
F.	
Signage can add several pedestrian friendly qualities to the streets.
Use of special paving to break up an expanse or to link pedestrian path with the transit stop restricting 
pedestrian and vehicular conflicts.
Street trees should be placed less than 30 m apart.

Road Safety Audit and Pedestrian Facility Audit
6.18.1	
An effective in identifying potential safety issues and recommending countermeasures 
is the Road Safety Audit (RSA). RSA is a formal examination of the safety performance of an 
existing or planned road or intersection by an independent audit team. RSAs are different 
from traditional safety reviews in a number of important ways. First, an RSA is conducted by a 
multidisciplinary team, including safety and design experts independent of the project. RSAs 
always result in generation of a formal report. 
6.18.2	
Traditional safety reviews focus primarily on vehicle traffic while RSAs broaden the 
scope to consider all potential road users and account for their capabilities and limitations. A top 
priority for RSAs is to consider all roadway users, minimizing the unintended consequences, 
especially for pedestrian.
6.18.3	
The benefits of an RSA include the design and reconstruction of facilities that reduce 
the number and severity of crashes, and the reduction of costs by identifying safety issues 
and correcting them before projects are implemented. RSAs also promote awareness of safe 
design practices, the value of integrating multimodal safety concerns, and consideration of 
human factors in all facets of design.

6.18.4	
The following issues need to be addressed while conducting the pedestrian safety 
audit.  It is also necessary to work out a comprehensive check lists to conduct the audit in 
consultation with Road Safety Auditor.
	
•	
Needs of Pedestrian: Do pedestrian facilities address the needs of all 
pedestrian including those with disabilities?
	
•	
Connectivity and Convenience of Pedestrian Facilities: Are safe, continuous, 
and convenient paths provided along pedestrian routes throughout the study 
area?
	
•	
Traffic: Are design, posted, and operating traffic speeds compatible with 
pedestrian safety?
	
•	
Behavior: Do pedestrian or motorists regularly misuse or ignore pedestrian 
facilities?
	
•	
Construction: Have the effects of construction on all pedestrian been 
addressed adequately?
	
•	
School Presence: Is the safety of children in school zones adequately 
considered?

LOS A
Pedestrian Space > 4.9 m2/p. Flow Rate < 12 p/min/m
At a walkway LOS A, pedestrian move in desired paths 
without altering their movements in response to other 
pedestrian. Walking speeds are freely selected, and 
conflicts between pedestrian are unlikely. 
LOS B
Pedestrian Space > 3.3-4.9 m2/p. Flow Rate < 12-15 
p/min/m
At LOS B, there is sufficient area for pedestrian to select 
walking speeds freely, to bypass other pedestrian, and 
to avoid crossing conflicts. At this level, pedestrian begin 
to be aware of other pedestrian, and to respond to their 
presence when selecting a walking path.
LOS C
Pedestrian Space > 1.9-3.3 m2/p. Flow Rate < 15-21 
p/min/m
At LOS C, space is sufficient for normal walking 
speeds, and for bypassing other pedestrian in primarily 
unidirectional streams.  Reverse-direction or crossing 
movements can cause minor conflicts, and speeds and 
flow rate are somewhat lower.
LOS D
Pedestrian Space > 1.3-1.9 m2/p. Flow Rate < 21-27 
p/min/m
At LOS D, freedom to select individual walking speed 
and to bypass other pedestrian is restricted. Crossing 
or reverse-flow movements face a high probability of 
conflict, requiring frequent changes in speed and position. 
The LOS provides reasonably fluid flow, but friction and 
interaction between pedestrian is likely.
LOS E
Pedestrian Space > 0.6-1.3 m2/p. Flow Rate < 27-45 
p/min/m
At LOS E, virtually all pedestrian restrict their normal 
walking speed, frequently adjusting their gait. At the lower 
range, forward movement is possible only by shuffling. 
Speed is not sufficient for passing slower pedestrian. 
Cross- or reverse-flow movements are possible only with 
extreme difficulties. Design volumes approach the limit of 
walkway capacity, with stoppages and interruption to flow. 
LOS F
Pedestrian Space < 0.6 m2/p. Flow Rate varies 
At LOS F, all walking speeds are severely restricted, 
and forward progress is made only by shuffling. There 
is frequent, unavoidable contact with other pedestrian. 
Cross- and reverse-flow movements are virtually 
impossible. Flow is sporadic and unstable. Space is 
more characteristic of queued pedestrian than of moving 
pedestrian streams.
