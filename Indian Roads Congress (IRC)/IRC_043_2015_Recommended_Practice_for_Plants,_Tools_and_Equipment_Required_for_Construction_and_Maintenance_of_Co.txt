RECOMMENDED PRACTICE FOR PLANTS, TOOLS AND 
EQUIPMENT REQUIRED FOR CONSTRUCTION AND 
MAINTENANCE OF CONCRETE ROADS
1  INTRODUCTION
1.1	
The road infrastructure has witnessed increasing mechanization (use of plants and 
equipment) over time for reasons of speedy construction with quality. Appropriate technology 
with use of minimal and light equipment is being adopted for construction and upgradation of 
rural roads whereas intensive use of equipment is being insisted for higher category of roads 
such as State Highways and National Highways.  
1.2	
Larger equipment like automatic concrete batching plants are assembled/ 
manufactured commercially in our country, and for this standard specification viz 
IRC:SP:96-2012, IS 4925 exists to ensure their quality. Commercially available equipment 
currently being used for concrete roads are floaters, finishers, needle vibrators and screed 
vibrators etc. Sometimes, these have also fabricated by the field engineers. Large size fixed 
form and slipform pavers are being used in India for heavy traffic roads. Fixed forms pavers 
are being manufactured in India. However, slipform pavers complete with automatic dowel 
bar inserter and tie bar inserter are not being manufactured in India at present. 
1.3	
This document would help the field engineers in properly executing concrete paving 
jobs. This document also provides basis for the fabrication of such tools and equipment 
keeping in view the performance requirements, by way of sketches, and description of the 
essential features. For plants fabricated commercially, reference has been drawn to the 
relevant standards.	
1.4	
This recommended practice is closely allied to IRC:15-2011 (Standard 
Specifications and Code of Practice for Construction of Concrete Roads) and should be 
used in conjunction with that standard. This draft document discussed in the meeting of 
HSS Committee held on 09.08.2014 and it was decided to have this draft considered by the 
Mechanization Committee (G-4) also.
1.5	
Accordingly, H-3 Committee had joint meeting with G-4 Committee on 30.9.2014 
and suggestions of G-4 Committee were discussed. Subsequently, a core group meeting 
of the Members comprising Shri R.K. Jain, Shri Satander Kumar, Shri K.C. Sharma, 
Shri N.K. Nayek, Shri U.C. Joshi, Shri Jitendra Kumar, Shri Arvind Nagri and Shri Sanjay 
Bajaj drawn from both the Committees was held on 20.10.2014 and the document was 
revised. The revised document has also been considered and approved by the Mechanization 
Committee under the Convenor ship of Shri S.N. Das, DG (RD), MoRT&H. The H-3 Committee 
also approved the revised document in its meeting held on 14.11.2014 for placing before the 
Highways Specifications and Standards Committee (HSS).
The composition of the H-3 Committee is as given below:

The HSS Committee approved the draft revision in its meeting held on 12th January, 2015. The 
Executive Committee in its meeting held on 18th January, 2015 approved the draft revision for 
placing it before the Council. The Council in its 204th meeting held at Bhubaneswar, Odisha on 
19th January, 2015 approved the draft revision of IRC:43 “Recommended Practice for Plants, 
Tools and Equipment Required for Construction and Maintenance of Concrete Roads” (First 
Revision) for publishing.
1.6	
The technology of construction equipment is continuously getting developed 
and new sophisticated equipment are getting introduced in the market. The operating and 
maintenance cost of these equipment works out to 10-15% of completed items and as 
the use/adoption is necessary to get quality product, the actual use of these equipment is 
recommended.   
2 SCOPE
The document describes most of the equipment which are being used presently. However 
there are no prohibition/restrictions to use equipment which can serve the purpose in a better 
manner. The operating and maintenance cost of these equipment is not likely to exceed 15% 
of completed cost and hence usage of these equipment is desirable.

The document deals with a current list and specification introductory of plants, tools, and 
equipment required for fully mechanized concrete pavement construction, semi-mechanized 
including labour intensive and overlays (white topping) as practiced in this country.
The list is described according to different phases of work, starting from subgrade, sub base, 
laying and compaction to the sealing of joints. Brief of the specification and pictorial views of 
some the tools and machines used for construction, quality control and maintenance of rigid 
pavement is also described.

4.1.1.1	
Crushers
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large size rocks into smaller size rocks, gravel, 
or rock dust
Types of Crushers: The broad types of crushers and their advantages are as under:
	
A)	
Primary Crushers : Jaw and Gyratory Types :+ 
	
	
In the first stage of crushing, usually the jaws, gyratory types of crushers are 
used.
	
	
Jaw and gyratory crushers are both capable of handling hard and abrasive 
rocks and selection is based upon the capacity and maximum lump size. Use 
of impactor is generally restricted to less abrasive rocks e.g. limestone.
	
	
Generally, for the same capital investment, the jaw crusher will be able to 
accept the largest boulder size. For capacities less than 1000 tonnes per 
hour, any of the two types could be selected while for a capacity much higher 
than 1000 tonnes per hour, the choice would normally fall on a Gyratory type 
crusher. 
	
a)	
Jaw Crusher : The jaw crusher compresses the rock between fixed 
dimensions of feed opening jaw to create braking action. Maximum 
dimension of feed opening (gape) and the product size is determined 
by the width of discharge aperture when the jaw has retreated fully 
(open side setting). The moving jaw may be actuated by one of the two 
principal mechanisms - ‘single toggle’ and ‘double toggle’ .In the double 
toggle system, very powerful compressive forces are created without 
any abrasive motion; therefore, it is most applicable to the crushing of 
very strong, abrasive rocks but is more complex, heavy and expensive 
than a single toggle.
	
	
Jaw Crusher is suitable for all hard rocks, generally used for aggregate 
production. 
	
b)	
Gyratory Crusher : It consists of a lined inverted conical crushing 
chamber within which gyrates an upright conical crushing member, the 
shaft and cone are protected by a liner.
	
	
The main advantage of a gyratory crusher is the much greater unit 
capacity for any given ‘gape’ or maximum lump size assuming that this 
capacity can be fully utilized to justify greater cost.
	
	
Gyratory crushers are sometimes employed at the secondary stage, 
(where cone crushers are more common) as they can accept larger 
lump sizes.

IRC:43-2015

B)	
Secondary and Tertiary Types:
	
a)	
Cone Crushers : Even though the jaw and gyratory types of crushers 
may be adapted to secondary and tertiary crushing, it is because of 
the greater capacity of the cone crusher that cone crushers are very 
commonly used for secondary and tertiary crushing.
	
	
The Cone Crusher is a development of the gyratory crusher. It consists 
of a gyratory upright conical crushing member. The main difference 
from gyratory type is that the crushing chamber is also in the form of an 
upright, truncated cone and the gyrating cone (45º angle) is supported 
entirely from beneath by the eccentric bush assembly. Also, the eccentric 
shaft rotates very much more rapidly (more than 200 rpm) than that 
of gyratory crusher. Thus, there is an improved energy utilization and 
improvement in the shape of aggregate. In order to ensure good cubical 
shape, low reduction ratios have to be used and also the crushing 
chamber should always be full of material, known as ‘choke feed’.
	
	
The secondary cone crusher has as steeply inclined (sometimes 
stepped) crushing chamber formed by concave and a flatter, less 
steeply inclined conical crushing member.
	
	
The tertiary, short-head-cone- chamber has both crushing chamber and 
cone steeply inclined to promote the gravitational flow of more finely 
sized material.
	
b)	
Impactors :	In a lined chamber, a rotor fitted either with swing hammers 
(located by pins) or blow bars of alloy steel (located by mechanized or 
hydraulic clamps) revolves on a horizontal axis The hammers or blow 
bars provide impact to the rock resulting in energy efficient crushing 
and producing cubical shaped aggregates.
	
	
Advantages are high reduction ratio, low capital and operating cost, 
ease of installation and low head room requirement and good product 
shape. Product size can be varied within limits by changing rotor speed 
and the clearances between rotor and liners. A serious limitation is 
abrasive wear. Abrasive wear requires costly replacement of hammers 
or blow bars and above all, results in loss of operating time. Therefore, 
use of impactors is restricted to crushing on non-abrasive rocks e.g. 
non-siliceous limestones and dolomites.
	
	
Impactors are not suitable for rocks having more than 5 percent free 
silica.
	
	
Swing hammer type impactors are generally used for the production 
of the finer sizes of aggregates but impact becomes ineffective at a 
particle size less than 3 mm.

A vertical shaft impactor comprises a horizontal table or rotor that 
revolves about the vertical axis of the drive shaft. The crushed rock 
fed into the centre of the rotor is ejected at high speeds and breaks 
by impact upon the hardened alloy anvils surrounding the rotor and by 
inter-particulate collision.

The advantages are (i) cubical product shape and (ii) overcoming the 
problem of wear while crushing abrasive rocks.
	
c)	
Rolls Crushers : Essentially, a rolls crusher comprises two contra 
rotating crushing rolls.
	
	
The use was common before the development of cone crushers. They 
suffer from the following two disadvantages:
	
-	
low-capacity
	
-	
wear of the roll surface when crushing abrasive rock
	
	
Rolls crusher may still find application within small capacity operations 
in confined spaces where simple construction and low headroom 
requirement are advantages or for processing very soft rocks (life, 
high purity lime stones). In the modern versions the rolls are provided 
with hardened alloy steel teeth. Rock is broken by a combination of 
compression, tension and shear.

Motor Grader
Graders are used to spread fill and finely trim the sub grade. They consist of a blade which 
can rotate in a circular arc about a sub horizontal axis and which is supported beneath a 
longitudinal frame joining the front steering wheels and the rear drive wheels to achieve 
specific slope and grade.
The front wheels are generally articulated whilst the rear wheels are set in tandem beneath 
the motor and control units. The blade is used to trim and redistribute soil and therefore 
graders usually operate in the forward direction.

Disc harrow are used for pulverisation, and mixing of soil/aggregates and stabilizers. 
It consists of many iron or steel discs which have slight concavity and are arranged into 
sections. The discs are also offset so that they are not parallel with the overall direction of 
the implement. This is so they slice the ground they cut over a little bit to optimize the result. 
The concavity of the discs as well as their being offset causes them to loosen and pick up 
the soil they cut.

As per the general practice in India, for lower subbase, if the thickness of the compacted layer 
does not exceed 100 mm, a smooth wheeled roller of 80-100 kN weight may be used. For a 
compacted single layer upto 200 mm the compaction shall be done with the help of a vibratory 
roller of minimum 80-100 kN static weight capable of achieving required compaction.
In some countries, compaction in single lift of 300 mm using heavy vibratory or pneumatic 
tyred rollers are allowed.  
Details of various kind of compaction equipments used are as under. 
4.1.6.1	
Static road roller
Static Road rollers are most suitable for compacting gravels, sand and crushed rock where 
some crushing action is required. Generally Static rollers of 80-100 kN capacity are used for 
compaction of soils.

Walk behind roller 
Walk-behind rollers can be single drum or tandem models. Both types are self-propelled and 
can work in reverse travel direction and are controlled by cable or road linkages. The mobility 
of walk-behind rollers improves compaction power when compared to plates and tampers. 
They are used for soil, granular and asphalt compaction and for small area repair and pothole 
work. Walk-behind vibratory single drum rollers have a weight range between 160 to 460 kg, 
high frequencies of 70 to 77 Hz and amplitudes from 0.4 to 0.5 mm. Twin drum walk-behind 
rollers have two drums of identical size with a relatively small diameter. Each drum has its 
own eccentric shaft. Both drums are driven, are connected by a rigid frame and are steered 
by pulling or pushing the guide bar. Double drum models may also feature hydraulic controls, 
which lessens steering effort.

Dry Lean Concrete (DLC) 
The details of plant, equipment and tools required for construction of sub bases i.e. Dry Lean 
Concrete (DLC) or lean cement concrete are given as under:
4.2.1	
Concrete Production
The following plant, equipment and tools shall be used for concrete production for DLC.
4.2.1.1	
Concrete batching and mixing plant
A plant is an assembly of mechanical and electronic equipment, in which raw material is 
processed and undergoes through various processes to produce the desired output. Plants 
for production of concrete are classified into two types:
	
A)	
Batch type 
	
B)	
Continuous type
	
A)	
Batch Type : Batch types plants are further classified into two categories:
	
a)	
Central Mix Plant 
	
b)	
Mobile or Portable Plants  
	
a)	
Central Mix Plant
	
	
Central Mix Plant mixes the ingredients internally before being loaded 
into the truck. Small plant may have an output as low as 12 m3/hr, 
medium plants may have an output in the range of 30 to 100 cum/hr 
and larger plants may have an output of more than 100 cum/hr. Plants 
of more than 300 cum/hr are available in India.
	
	
The plant shall consist of all arrangements for:
	
i)	
Receiving all ingredients of concrete, viz fine and coarse 
aggregates from storage bins, cement from silos and water form 
tank:  
	
ii)	
Weighing each ingredient for each batch of the mix: For concrete 
batching plant of capacity below 20 cum/hr, the aggregates, sand, 
and cement may be weighed one after the other cumulatively in 
the same weigh batcher whereas for concrete batching plants 
more than 20 cum/hr capacity, individual batchers are provided 



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 65

for each ingredients. Water and admixtures measurement is 
preferred by weight. However, for plants upto 30 cum/hr capacity, 
water and admixture may be measured by volume. The batching 
plant shall have facility for injecting at least two admixtures in the 
mixing pan.
	
iii)	
Mixing these ingredients thoroughly to form a concrete of required 
specification.
	
	
The concrete is said to be adequately mixed if the samples taken 
from different portions of a batch will have essentially the same 
unit weight, air content, slump and coarse-aggregate content 
within permissible limits.
	
	
The mixing action of concrete involves two operations:
	
i)	
A general blending of different particle sizes of the ingredients 
to be uniformly distributed throughout the concrete mass.
	
ii)	
A vigorous rubbing action of cement paste on to the surface 
of the inert aggregate particles.
	
	
Controls: The annunciations like operating conditions; fault indications 
etc. can be very easily displayed on the computer screen with the help 
of software SCADA ((Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition). This 
software makes the data storage and printout very flexible and easy. 
The live weight of the ingredient in the weigh hoppers are continuously 
upgraded on the computer along with the operating status of equipments. 
SCADA based system with GPRS technology provides the real-time 
batch data to the client server.

4.2.1.1.1	 Quality of mix 
	
a)	
The properties of mixers which affect the homogeneity of mix are as under:
	
i)	
Workability of the fresh concrete as defined by the slump.
	
ii)	
Density of concrete
	
iii)	
Air content 
	
iv)	
Compressive strength
	
v)	
Operation close to rated capacity; unless leads to non-uniform mixing 
and un-economical 
	
b)	
Each stationary mixer shall be equipped with an approved timing device which 
will automatically lock the discharge lever when the drum has been charged 
and release it at the end of mixing period. The device shall be equipped 
with a bell or other suitable warning device adjusted to give a clearly audible 
sound or other suitable warning device each time the lock is pressed.
Quality of Batcher: The quality of batcher depends upon type of batcher used (manual, 
semi-automatic or automatic), calibration of batchers, etc. The batcher should be calibrated at 
suitable interval not exceeding 1 month. For details of calibration, IS 4926 may be referred.

4.2.1.1.2	 Mixing energy 
Mixing energy is defined as product of average power consumption during the mixing cycle 
and duration of mixing cycle. For reasons of economics, mixing energy should be kept low 
but the quality of concrete should be considered first. Mixing energy is used for monitoring 
workability during mixing.
4.2.1.1.3	 Mixer efficiency
Mixing efficiency of the mixture is its ability to mix the ingredients to obtain a concrete having 
uniformity within the prescribed limits. The uniformity of mixed concrete shall be evaluated 
by finding the % variation in quantity (weight in water) of cement , fine aggregate and coarse 
aggregate in a freshly mixed batch of aggregate. Efficiency and quality of concrete mixer 
depends largely on:
	
i)	
Duration of mixing,
	
ii)	
Speed of mixing drum,
	
iii)	
Timely supply of water
	
iv)	
Proper cleaning of mixing blades and of inner surface of the drum.
4.2.1.1.4	 Maintenance
	
i)	
The plant must be kept clean and in good mechanical condition to do a good 
job of mixing.
	
ii)	
Accumulation of hardened concrete in the drum and mixing blades will reduce 
the efficiency of the mixture.
	
iii)	
Badly worn out mixture blades need to be replaced periodically.
	
iv)	
Remove the old dried concrete built up around the blades.
4.2.1.1.5	 Environmental issues
	
i)	
Keep the cement in completely enclosed silos.
	
ii)	
Keep the mixing equipment, stockpiles and silos away from the property 
line.
	
iii)	
Add cartridge or bag filters to the silos, so the air that is pushed out when 
they are filled does not carry dust with them.
	
iv)	
Enclose the cement conveyor belts, so that dust does not blow away as the 
cement is moved to the silos or mixing drum.
	
v)	
Use filters called bag houses where the concrete is mixed and where it is 
dropped into the trucks. Like large vacuum cleaners, these filters suck the 
dust out of the air before it can blow away.
	
vi)	
Spray water on the haulage road and stock piles.

Tilting Mixers: Free fall mixing suits concretes that are not too stiff, usually 
with a slump up to 50 mm is commonly used on construction sites.
Photo 18.1  Tilting Mixer
	
ii)	
Non-Tilting Mixers : A non-tilting drum mixer is one in which the axis of the 
mixer is always horizontal, and discharge takes place by inserting a chute 
into the drum or by reversing the direction of rotation of drum.

Reversible Mixers: The reversible drum mixer is similar to the non -tilting 
(described below) except that the same opening is used to add the constituents 
and to discharge the aggregate. The drum on a reversible mixer has one 
horizontal axis around which it rotates. In mixing position, the drum rotates in 
one direction; while for discharging, the rotation is reversed.
4.2.1.3	
Volumetric batcher 
Volume batching is not permitted for any regular work of concrete. However for very specific 
work for example for laying a slab for full depth repair or for any specific work where volume 
batching is permitted for aggregates, the aggregate measuring boxes should consist of deep, 
narrow, wooden boxes fixed with handles on either side for carriage. Some typical boxes 
of different capacities are given in Figure below. Typical dimensions of different boxers are 
given in Table 1. It should be ensured that the sides and bottoms of the measuring boxes 
retain their shape during use and do not bulge when loaded. If needed, wooden stiffening 
battens should be used at the sides or bottoms to ensure this. Alternatively, iron boxes may 
be used.

4.2.1.4	
Water and admixture measures
For the purpose of correct gauging of the mixing water and admixtures, water measuring can 
of capacity 6 to 15 liter may be used. Where concrete mixes are fitted with water measures, 
it is preferable to use them in case of semi mechanized construction method. Alternatively, 
empty five-liter, two-liter and one-liter tins may be used as water measures. In the last case it 
should be ensured that the tins are not bent or deformed and they deliver correct volume of 
water to the nearest 0.05 liter. The tins should be provided with suitable handles.
4.2.1.5	
Water pumps
Water pumps, if required for pumping water for concrete mixing and curing operations, may 
be of centrifugal type conforming to IS:1520, or any other suitable pump of approved quality 
and make.
4.2.2	
Concrete Transportation
Segregation tends to occur during filling and discharging of concrete handling equipment 
unless concrete is discharged vertically. When discharge is at an angle the larger aggregate 
particles are thrown to the far side of the container or forms and the mortar is concentrated 
on the near side.
Transportation of the mix includes determination of haul distance, routes, time to transport, 
types of conveyance; such as trucks, type of trucks, tippers, and conveyor belts, etc., ambient 
conditions, and production rates. Normally tipping trucks are used to transport the DLC mix 
to the paving site.
During transportation following requirements should be fulfilled: 
	
a)	
No segregation or separation of materials in the concrete.
	
b)	
Concrete delivered at the point of placing should be uniform and have proper 
consistency.                                                   
There is a limitation on using the concrete mix after adding the water within a stipulated 
time, the mix shall not normally be carried beyond 30 km of lead on a maintained road nor 
requiring more than 60 minutes of travel time. The elapsed time between addition of water 
for preparation of mix and completion of rolling should not be more than 1.5 hours. During 
transportation the material should be covered with tarpaulin or additives should be added to 
maintain the mix in required condition.
4.2.2.1	
Wheel barrows 
Wheel barrows (with single or two wheels) when used to transport concrete over short 
distances from the mixer to the point of placement should conform to IS : 2431 and IS : 4184 
respectively.

Non-agitator truck: These are used when haul distance is small.
Agitator trucks : The truck bed contains a large barrel or drum that is used to continuously 
roll or agitate the concrete mixture keeping it from solidifying before use.
Transit mixer : These trucks are used to mix the ingredients while the truck is on the move. 
A transit mixer is used to perform following three functions:
	
a)	
sIt can mix coarse aggregates, fine aggregates, cement and water for 
production of concrete while it is moving or stationary.
	
b)	
It can prevent segregation of already mixed concrete during transit by 
agitation, as a result of slow revolution of the drum.
	
c)	
It can completely mix the shrink concrete (that is concrete partially mixed in 
central batching and mixing plant) while it is moving or stationary.

may be referred. 
The condition of the road should also be taken into account for travel time. Re-tampering 
the mixed material by adding water or by other means should not be permitted. To minimize 
segregation, re-handling of the mix should be minimized. Also, when placing the mix on 
grade, minimum drop heights should be used and paving to be done from lower to higher 
grade.
4.3.3	
Spreading
Placer/Spreader
It places a metered supply of concrete mix in front of the paver using a series of conveyor 
belts, augers, plows and strike off devices. Using a placer/spreader allows the contractor to 
receive material from transport vehicles and place a uniform amount of concrete mix in front 
of the entire paver width, while minimizing segregation. 
The spreader receives the concrete from the hauling units and places it in rough form in its 
proper location on the roadbed to the depth of the mat reinforcement. Reinforcement mats 
are placed immediately behind the spreader.
The subbase must be thoroughly moistened ahead of the spreader to prevent rapid loss of 
water from the concrete. Care must be taken to see that the correct quantity of concrete is 
placed; too much will overload the following paver, and too little will result in having necessarily 
to halt the paving while additional material is being added. The interval between the spreader 
and paver is important; the distance should be kept as short as possible because the concrete 
will set in about 20 minutes.

Laying 
There are two basic methods of placing and finishing concrete pavements: fixed form paving 
and slip-form paving.
Stationary forms are used in fixed form paving. The forms are built to the line and grade of 
the finished pavement, and the paving equipment rides on the forms.
4.3.4.1	
Slip form paving
Slipform paving is defined as a process used to consolidate, form into geometric shape and 
surface finish a PCC mass by pulling the forms continuously through and surrounding the 
plastic concrete mass. Slipform paving is most appropriate for larger jobs that require high 
production rates. Slip-form paving usually uses string lines for line and grade. The paving 
units are equipped with sensors that run along the string lines. Slip form pavers can pave 
to grade, spread the concrete over the subgrade, vibrate, tamp, strike off, and shape the 
concrete to the desired thickness and surface configuration. Concrete is contained by short 
side-forms built into the paving equipment. Components of the slip form paver are as under:
	
i)	
Distributor (augur or plough) and regulating bar
	
ii)	
Vibrators
	
iii)	
Finisher with conforming plate and slip forms
	
iv)	
Dowel Bar Inserter (DBI) and Tie Bar Inserter (TBI)
	
v)	
Twin oscillating beams
	
vi)	
Auto float for finishing the surface
	
vii)	
Texturing and curing compound spraying unit.

Photo 26  Slipform Paver
The paver usually performs screeding, consolidation and initial finishing. Some pavers are 
equipped to place reinforcing steel (if needed), dowel bars and tie rods as well. Slip-form 
pavers use their own weight to mould the plastic concrete into the correct shape.
Consolidation
After screeding, the paver consolidates the fresh PCC using a series of vibrators. Typically, 
the most effective vibrator position is after the strike-off mechanism and at the final slab 
elevation. Most pavers use fully adjustable vibrator spacing to account for different conditions 
and mix types, while still providing adequate influence zone overlap. 
Initial Finishing  
Initial finishing is accomplished by extruding the PCC mass through a moving form made up 
of the base course (bottom), the side forms (vertical edges of the paver) and the confirming 
plate (flat paver pieces mounted behind the vibrator). Extruding PCC through the resulting 
rectangular shape provides the final slab dimensions and also serves to imbed larger 
aggregate particles below the surface, which results in a smooth finish. Some pavers are also 
equipped with a hydraulic tamper bar (sometimes called a “jitterbug”), located just behind the 
vibrators. By moving up and down, the tamper bar is thought to: 
1)	
Assist in consolidation and finishing by tamping large aggregate particles below 
the slab surface. 
2)	
Keep the large aggregate moving in an area where it may have tendencies to stop 
or stick.   
3)	
Keep the material moving around the vibrators so as not to collect and cause flow 
problems.  
Placing of dowel/tie bars at their pre-designed locations are also done by slip form pavers.
Advantages of slip form paving:
	
●	
Uses low-slump PCC. Low-slump PCC of the order 25 ± 10 mm is necessary 
so that the fresh PCC is able to hold its shape once the slipform paver has 



======================================================================


IRC:43-2015
31
passed. Low slump PCC can be made with less water and usually has higher 
compression and flexural strengths than comparable high slump mixes.
	
●	
High productivity. Large jobs generally require high production rates.
	
●	
Smooth riding surface. Automation and computer control allows pavers to 
produce very smooth riding surfaces   
PCC placement, consolidation, finishing and curing is typically done in Slipform paving. Most 
often, these steps are accomplished by three pieces of equipment: the placer/spreader (used 
for rough placement), the concrete paver (used for final placement, consolidation and initial 
finishing), and the texturing and curing machine. These machines usually travel together in 
series down the length of the project.
4.3.4.2	
Fixed form paving
Despite the speed and ease of Slipform paving, there are still many applications where fixed 
form paving is more practical and cost-effective. These include streets, intersections, local 
roads, and complicated short-run of variable-width pavements.
The formwork should consist of mild steel channels for straight lengths and wooden sections 
reinforced with mild steel angles for curved portions. Manufactured sections are also available 
for formwork as given in IRC:15. The details of mild steel stakes for fixing mild steel channel 
and wooden formwork are given in Fig. 29.
Photo 27  Fixed form Concrete Paver
Particular advantages of fixed form paving are:
	
●	
Tight tolerances and side clearances. Existing curbs or other features can be 
used as forms. 
	
●	
Custom geometry. Forms can be placed in just about any pavement 
geometry, which allows for multiple changes in pavement width, smooth 
curves, blockouts and other abnormalities.



======================================================================
PAGE 39 of 65

●	
Better construction staging. Forms can be placed such that staged construction 
can be used to maintain traffic flow or intersection use.
	
●	
Less expensive equipment and mobilization. Forms and equipment are less 
expensive than slipform paving equipment. If paving operations are small 
enough, this cost savings can more than offset the higher production rates of 
slipform paving.

4.3.4.2.1	 Formwork and Iron stakes
The formwork should consist of mild steel channels for straight lengths and wooden sections 
reinforced with mild steel angles for curved portions. Manufactured sections are also available 
in the market and may be used if they meet the construction requirements. The general 
requirements for formwork as given in IRC:15 should be compiled with. The details of mild

4.3.5	
Compaction of PQC
Concrete vibrators are not used only to consolidate the concrete for maximum density, but 
they also internally blend the different lifts of concrete together into a single solid mass with 
few to no air pockets and no lift lines on the finished exposed surface. After deciding whether 
to use internal or external vibration, following shall be considered in making an appropriate 
choice:  
	
i)	
Frequency, 
	
ii)	
Amplitude,
	
iii)	
Power and 
	
iv)	
Size.  
Since concrete contains particles of varying sizes, the most satisfactory compaction would 
be obtained by using vibrators with different speeds of vibration.
The various types of vibrators used are described below:
	
i)	
Internal or Immersion or Needle Vibrators 
	
	
This is the most commonly used vibrator. It essentially consists of a steel tube 
(with one end closed and rounded) having an eccentric vibrating element 
inside it. This steel tube called poker is connected to an electric motor or a 
diesel engine through a flexible tube.
	
	
The vibrators run by 110 V, 200 Hz Generator and operate at speeds ranging 
from 8000 to 12000 vpm (vibrations per minute). The diameter of the poker 
vibrators is in the range of 20-80 mm.The diameter of influence is 900 mm 
and the pokers are placed at a spacing of 360 – 500 mm to ensure proper 
compaction of the concrete in the compaction chamber. The amplitude 
of vibration is in the range of 0.4-0.8 mm. For proper uniform compaction 
across the slab, it is essential to have same frequency of all the vibrators. 
The idea of compaction is to remove the air voids. IS:2505-1980 General 
requirements for Concrete Vibrators Immersion type, IS:3558-1983 Code of 
Practice for use of immersion vibrators for consolidating concrete may be 
referred.

ii)	
External or Shutter Vibrators
	
	
These  vibrators are clamped rigidly to the formwork at the pre-determined 
points so that the form and concrete are vibrated. They consume more power 
for a given compaction effect than internal vibrators.
Photo 30  Shutter Vibrator
	
	
These vibrators can compact upto 450 mm from the face but have to be 
moved from one place to another as concreting progresses. The external 
vibrators are more often used for pre-casting of thin in-situ sections of such 
shape and thickness as cannot be compacted by internal vibrators. For 
detailed information, IS:4656-1968 – Form Vibrators for Cement Concrete 
may be referred.
	
	
Very stiff mixes respond better to high amplitude and lower frequency. The 
high frequency use tends to give a better surface appearance.
	
iii)	
Surface or Screed Vibrators
	
	
These are placed directly on the concrete mass. These best are suited for 
compaction of shallow elements and should not be used when the depth of 
concrete to be vibrated is more than 150 mm. Very dry mixes can be most 
effectively compacted with surface vibrators. The surface vibrators commonly 
used are pan vibrators and vibrating screeds. For detailed information 
IS: 2506-1964 Screed Board Vibrators may be referred.

Frequency and Amplitude- Frequency and amplitude under no load (Operation in air) 
shall be tested in accordance with IS:6923-1973; Method of Test for and shall be as given 
below:
Hand Tamper Board : The hand tamper, used in lieu of screed board vibrator for compacting 
concrete for minor jobs, or as an emergency stop-gap arrangement in case of breakdown 
of the screed board vibrators, should consist of a hard wood beam of rectangular section 
of sufficient weight to ensure adequate compaction and should be fixed securely with 
sturdy handles to withstand the tamping action. A typical dimensioned sketch is included in 
Fig. 4.
The lower face of the tamper board should conform to the desired profile of the pavement 
cross-section, and be fitted with a mild steel shoe of appropriate width, as in the case of 
screed board (IS : 2506) to prevent wear.

Finishing and Curing
The equipment used for Finishing of PQC pavement and Curing are as under:
4.3.6.1	
Texturing and curing machine
The texturing and curing machine follows the paver and is used to impart macro texture and 
apply a curing membrane over the pavement. Sometimes the paver is equipped with a tining/ 
texturing machine, while a separate machine is used for applying the curing membrane.
Curing is done once finishing of an area is complete and the original wet sheen has nearly 
disappeared. On tined pavements, curing is usually specified to occur in two passes, one 
forward and one in reverse, to ensure both sides of the texture ridges are coated with curing 
membrane.

Floater
The float used for smoothing the compacted concrete, should be made of hard wood board 
of dimensions shown in Fig. 6, planned to true surface and fixed with a suitable handle as 
illustrated. Currently floater or finishers are also being used in semi mechanised construction 
as shown in Photo 32, not only for finishing even these are being used to make the surface 
abrasion resistant using some commercial hardener while floating or finishing. These are 
generally known as mechanical/power floater and trowel for finishing of fresh PQC.

in longitudinal or transverse direction to make it skid resistance should conform to the 
requirements given in Fig. 7. The fibers should meet the requirement of IS:189 and be of 
Grade 3 or higher than this specification. The bottom should be replaced when the bristles 
wear down to a length of about 40 mm. For Tining in Semi Mechanized method, tining Brush 
(steel/aluminum) as shown in Fig. 33 is also used for 3 mm width and 3 - 4 mm depth for 
making the road skid resistant.

Jack hammer
A jack hammer is a pneumatic or electro-mechanical tool that combines a hammer directly 
with a  chisel.  Hand-held jack hammers are typically powered by  compressed air, but 
some use electric motors. Larger jack hammers, such as rig mounted hammers used on 
construction machinery, are usually hydraulically powered. They are usually used to break 
up rock, pavement, and concrete.
Only energy involved in making a jack hammer pound up and down is supplied from an air 
hose. The hose, which has to be made of especially thick plastic, carries high-pressure air 
(typically 10 times higher pressure than the air around us) from a separate air-compressor 
unit powered by a diesel engine. Piledriver smashes down on the drill bit over 25 times each 
second, so the drill pounds up and down in the ground around 1500 times a minute.
