For spans more than 30 m, calculations may
be mad
with the "Equivalent weight" (total weight, referred
to
the track area) instead of the different wheel loads.
(a)
The
standard
trucks,
2*5 m
wide,
are equal to the
width of a lane; therefore the trucks have
to
be
put
close together, so that the live load for the considered
structural part arises to a maximum.
It is not necessary to shift the wheels of the trucks
to
the kerb.
(b)
The caterpillar, as the only load on the roadway,
has
a maximum deviation of 0'5 m on both sides from the
centre line of the roadway.

ceeding
trains

loads

only
being
considered for this
pur-
pose.
When
only

train

brak-
ing force shall
be
only
20 per

of load on the span.
(b) For bridges having more
than two lanes
: as in (a)
above for
the
first
two
lanes plus 5 per cent
of
the loads on the lanes in
excess
of two.
(Effect
of
impact
is
not taken
into consideration).
In slab calculations, the weight of a
rear wheel
(6t) of the
roller
is
distributed
over a rectangle,
one side of which is equal to the sum of the width
of the roller wheel
plus
twice
the depth of
slab
and wearing coat; the other side is
equal to 10 cm
plus twice the depth of slab and wearing coat.
For
the bridge
on
highway of category I, an
additional calculation
must be made in respect of
the two rear
axles, each of 18t, of load
in Type 6.
In
such
a
case,
the
total
load
of the two axles
must
be
distributed over a rectangle with sides of
2.65x1.12m
each
side
being
increased
by twice
the depth of slab and wearing coat.
Normally the calculation is carried out for a slab
When the
lengths
of the sides differ substantially,
the slab can be considered
as
being bound by the
longer
sides,
increasing
the rectangular distribu-
tion in the
direction
of those sides by one half of
the shorter side.
On main beams
In considering transverse distribution, the load-
ing
should
be
so
placed
as
to
give
the
most
unfavourable effects.
In the case
of beam and
slab construction, if
a rigorous
calculation
is
not made based on the
theory of slabs, then all the beams
should be simi-
lar and
designed
to
carry
the
increased
edge
stresses.
See Table 2 page 131
Braking force shall be equal to 1/10 of the load
superimposed
by
a
continuous
train of
trucks
(T)pe 1).
This
force,
however,
shall not be less
than
0-3
of
the
heaviest
axle of the load system
being considered.

BARAK BRIDGE
When completed this bridge
will have the
largest prestressed span of
any bridge so far built in India.
The bridge will be 924 ft. long with deckings of 77 ft.— 185 ft.—400 ft.
185 ft—77
ft. span, providing a 24 ft. wide roadway. This "Cantilever" in-situ
construction
was
done
without
staging,
which
ensured
navigation
during
construction.
Prestressing has been done by the Freyssinet method.
Designed and constructed to the orders of the Chief Engineer (Roads)

FREYSSINET, ONCE AGAIN
An artist's impression of the Thana Creek Bridge
It is quite a job to hold together the enormous
mass of cement concrete that goes into the cons-
truction of a bridge— especially more
so when the
bridge is the one now under construction across the
*
Thana Creek to
link Greater Bombay with a vast
area
of open
land
in
Panvel.
This road bridge,
which is estimated to cost
Rs.
236,00,000
will
be
6,015
feet long and 49
ft.
wide,
and will have its
central
span
as
long
as
175
ft.
Engineers
at
Gammon India Limited, the designers of the bridge,
specified the Freyssinet system for carrying out
the
task of prestressing, depending once again on
the
proven qualities of
this
system—ECONOMY and
DEPENDABILITY—testified by the large number
of structures built throughout India for more
than
20 years now, using the Freyssinet Prestressing equip-
ment and techniques.
