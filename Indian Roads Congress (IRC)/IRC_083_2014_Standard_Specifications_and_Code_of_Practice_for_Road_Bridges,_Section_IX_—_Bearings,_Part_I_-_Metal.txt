Shri Jitendra Rathore prepared the
initial draft with the active support of Shri S. Mazumdar.
The
initial
draft was discussed
in the meetings of the B-6 Committee. The
final
draft of
IRC:83-2014 (Part
IV), "Standard Specifications and Code of Practice for Road Bridges",
Section IX Bearings (Spherical and Cylindrical), was discussed and approved by the Bearings,
Joints and Appurtenances Committee (B-6) held on
SO**" November, 2013 for placing
it
in
the Bridges Specifications and Standards Committee (BSS). The Bridges Specifications and
Standards Committee (BSS) approved this document in its meeting held on 6*^ January, 2014.
The Executive Committee in
its meeting held on 9'^ January, 2014 approved this document.
Finally, the document was considered by IRC Council
in
their 201^' meeting held on
19'^
January, 2014 at Guwahati (Assam), and approved the document for publishing.
1 SCOPE
This Code deals with
the requirements
for the
materials,
design,
manufacture,
testing,
installation and maintenance of Spherical and Cylindrical Bearings for Bridges. The provisions
of this code are meant to serve as a guide to both design and construction engineers, but
mere compliance with the provisions stipulated herein
will not relieve the manufacturer
in
any way of their responsibility for the performance and soundness of the product
in the
structure.
The
provisions
of this code
shall apply
for operating temperature between
- 15°C and
+ 50° Service life of Spherical Bearings depends on the condition of rotation and translation
movements posed by the Structure on
Bearings. The provisions made
in
this code are
based on an assumed working
life of the Spherical Bearing upto 30 years with PTFE and of
50 years with UHMWPE.
Bearings which are subjected to Tensile Loads are beyond the scope of this code as requiring
special arrangement/configuration.
Established codes and
Specifications woridwide may
please be referred for such Bearings. However this specification may be considered as a
guide for general purpose in such cases.
'
Spherical and
Cylindrical Bearings with an included angle
(20) greater than 60° and 75°
respectively are beyond the scope of this code.
In no case the radius of curvature shall be
less than the projected diameter of the Spherical curved sliding surface.
Sliding surfaces with a diameter of the circumscribing circle less than 75 mm or greater than
1 500 mm are beyond the scope of this code. For cases of bearing application requiring larger
diameter of the sliding surface, established codes. Specifications and approval documents
woridwide may please be referred. The recommendations of such document for all aspects
incl. design, material, manufacturing and tolerances and testing and acceptance shall then
be applicable
in addition to this specification which may well be considered as a guide to
such cases.

Bearings
and
Cylindrical
Bearings
for
use
as
temporary
devices
during
construction, for example during launching of the super-structure, are also beyond the scope
of this code. However, this specification may well be considered as a guide to these cases.
2 DEFINITION OF PRODUCT AND INTENDED USE
2.1
Definition of the Product
Spherical Bearing
The Spherical Bearing consists of a pair of matching concave and convex steel spherical
backing plates with a low friction sliding interface
in between thereby permitting rotation by
in-curve sliding as shown
in Fig.

Cylindrical Bearing
The Cylindrical Bearing consists of a concave cylindrical metal backing plate affixed with
a low friction
sliding surface to provide
friction
less
sliding against the matching convex
cylindrical surface from another plate as shown

Spherical
Bearings are
suitable
for
all types
of structures especially for long span and
continuous structures, Cable Stay and Suspension Bridges with relatively large and repetitive
rotation and translation requirements caused by variable loads, and for superstructures that
induce fast sliding displacements in bearings, e.g.
in case of Road cum Railway Bridges.

5 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
5.1
General
Loads, forces, movements and rotation to be considered
in designing the bearings shall be
determined by global analysis of the structure with idealized boundary condition under the
11



======================================================================
PAGE 20 of 60
======================================================================
IRC:83-2014 (Pt. IV)
critical load combination that can co-exist. Resistance due to friction at the sliding interface of
the bearing shall be ignored for idealizing the boundary conditions. However, induced force
generated due to friction at sliding interface shall be considered in the design of bearings and
adjacent (supported/supporting) structures.
For deriving the bearings design values for both SLS and ULS Conditions. Load combinations
and factors shall be taken from IRC:6 or other relevant available specification as deemed
necessary. Co-existing values of loads, forces and movement data for design of bearings
shall be furnished for both Service and Ultimate Limit state condition for each type of bearings
separately in the format given in Annexure-C "Bridge Bearing Design Questionnaire Form".
5.2
Rotation Capability
The Hard Chromium
Plated convex mating surface
shall
fully cover the concave
sliding
surface under
all
rotation conditions and there
shall be no contact (seizure) of concave
and convex component or any other metallic component of the Bearings under full design
rotation.
For the verification of the above conditions, the nominated design rotation value shall be
increased by ± 0.005 radians or ± 10/r radians, whichever is greater.
.
5.3
Displacement Capacity
The stainless steel mating surface shall cover the flat sliding surface fully under max. design
displacement and
shall
not cease or become
unstable before
providing
the
full design
displacement.
For the verification of the above conditions, the nominated design movement requirement
shall be increased by ± 20 mm
in both directions of movement with a min. total movement
of ± 50 mm in bridge longitudinal direction and ± 25 mm in the bridge lateral direction unless
restrained by guides.
Note:- The increase
in
rotation and movement requirements as stated above
shall however be
applicable only for the purpose of calculating the practical rotational clearances between the
components and movement capabilities without ceasing or failure and shall not be considered
while calculating the stresses/applying design checks for rotation and movement ability of the
bearing.
5.4
Design Verification for Curved Sliding Surfaces
When dimensioning
sliding surfaces, the
resultant of the co-existing
active and induced
horizontal forces generated due to sliding friction shall be considered.
The capacity of the Bearings restraint only by virtue of curvature of the sliding surface
i.e.
without restraining rings or external guides (reference Figs. 1, 2a and 2b) shall be checked
for stability and separation against the Horizontal forces.

Note:
The above check is only applicable
if the condition (9 - (3 - a) is positive value
i.e. > 0.
If this condition is not satisfied
i. e. the curvature of the sliding surface is inadequate to resist
the resultant horizontal forces, the fixed and guided bearing shall be designed compulsorily
with the steel restraining rings and external guides respectively (reference Figs. 2c and 2d).
Vice-a-versa, this check shall not be applicable for Bearings those restrained against base.
Even
if the capacity of the Bearings curved sliding surface alone satisfies the check for stability
and separation against the Horizontal forces.
It is recommended to design the bearing with
the steel restraining ring/external guides for additional safety against separation and sliding
off under unforeseen conditions (refer Figs. 6 and 8).

For the purpose of compressive stress verification the curved sliding surface shall be replaced

5.4.3
Eccentricities
Internal forces and moments acting on the curved sliding surface due to frictional resistance,
externally applied horizontal forces and the rotated condition of the bearing shall be taken
into account when determining the resulting total eccentricity

Coefficient of friction for PTFE
For curved sliding interfaces combined with dimpled and lubricated PTFE
sheets and stainless steel/hard chromium plating, the coefficient of friction
p^g^
is determined as a function of the average pressure Op^p^ [MPa] under

In case aluminium alloy used as mating surface for curved sliding interface, the stated
limits and also the actual value worked out from the expression above in a) and b) shall

5.4.3.2
Sliding surfaces witti external guides and restraining rings
For the spherical bearings designed to resist horizontal forces through external guides or
restraining
rings,
(refer Figs. 2c and d) and not by the curvature of the
sliding surface,
rotational movements produces an eccentricity
'e^' which
shall only be considered

5.4.3.3
Rotation
In
all the types
of bearings with two
sliding
surfaces, a
rotation
angle,
'a' produces an
eccentricity 'e^' of the vertical load on the curved surface which
is:
e^ = a^.{r+b)
where,
b
distance
(in elevation) between the cross-section under consideration and
the sliding surface (refer Fig. 5).
At any rate, eccentricity 'e3' shall act in the opposite direction to the eccentricities calculated
in the Clauses 5.4.3.1 and 5.4.3.2.
In the type of bearings equipped with only one sliding surface, 'e3' occurs only in the curved
sliding surface and, furthermore, only when said sheet
is attached to the convex backing
plate.
5.4.3.4
Lateral forces
Lateral forces acting on to the Bearings are the result from horizontal actions and the frictional
resistance of the other bearings
in the structure. This eccentricity
is not applicable for the
18



======================================================================
PAGE 27 of 60
======================================================================
IRC:83-2014 (Pt. IV)
curved sliding interface in the bearings where lateral forces are transmitted by external guides
or restraining rings. In bearings of the fixed type with only one sliding surface or with internal/
central guides, the horizontal load V^^^^ produces an eccentricity 'e^' which
is:
sd,max
5. 4. 3. 5
Additional eccentricity due to horizontal force bending moment
In
all cases, as the lines of application of lateral action and reaction are not coincident, the
resulting couple (force lever arm) causes an eccentricity that shall be additionally taken into
account.
5.4.4
Separation of sliding surface
With the exception of guides,
it shall be verified that the edge pressure "a" over PTFE/
UHMWPE > 0 under SLS condition of Loading. This condition
is satisfied when the
total
eccentricity
'e^' falls within the kernel of the projected area. For the purpose of Separation
Check, the values of different eccentricities viz. e^, 63 and e^ etc. shall also be calculated as
per the above expressions but using the values
in SLS condition for vertical load
(N^i^^^J,
horizontal forces (V^y^^), rotation (aj etc. Also, the average pressure "a" over PTFE/UHMWPE
for calculating
"Mmax"
^^'^ eccentricity "e^" shall be worked out using minimum
vertical load
(N

) in SLS condition.
For circular sheets this condition
is satisfied when:

Guides
In the design of the Bearings where, externally applied horizontal forces are to be resisted.
Guides either externally attached and projecting from the top sliding plate or internally located
projecting from the Calotte and
sliding
inside the recess
in the top sliding
plate
shall be
used. The sliding interface shall be fixed on to the Guides and
its adjacent surface for low
friction sliding movement. While the Stainless steel strips shall be affixed by continuous fillet
weld, the sliding surface strips shall be either bonded with confinement or screwed to assist
assembling. Composite materials shall be attached by bonding supplemented by mechanical
attachment.
In
order
to
facilitate

Design Verification of Backing Plates
Both the sliding and the mating surfaces shall be supported by metal backing plates. In order
to avoid unacceptably small clearance due to deformation under loads and stresses at the
sliding interface, which could otherwise create unacceptably small clearance between the
adjacent backing plates and as a
result, cease the Bearing rotation
ability causing higher
wear, the clearance between the adjacent backing plates shall be checked.
However,
in Spherical and Cylindrical Bearings, the flat sliding surface
is confined/mounted
on a thick convex backing
plate which apparently has high
stiffness and
rigidity against
deformations as shown
in Fig. 9. Thus only the deformation "Aw,^^^" of the backing plates to
flat mating surface i.e. bearing top plate and concave sliding surface i.e. bearing bottom plate
shall be calculated separately as per the expression given
in Clause 5.6.1 and both shall

Design Verification of Anchiorages Against Sliding Under Horizontal Force
Irrespective of the Bearing type (fixed or movable), the bearings shall be adequately anchored
using Positive anchoring arrangement e.g. Bolts passing through Bearing component and
anchored to Dowels, Headed Stud connectors (Shear or Tension), Steel distribution plates
embedded
in the adjoining concrete structure or anchored to the intermediate steel plates
welded to the adjoining structure in case of steel construction.
The safety and adequacy of the anchoring mechanism against sliding under the application of
horizontal force shall be checked at the ultimate limit state in accordance with the stipulations
described in Annexure-E "Bearing Anchorage Design Rules".
In the case of dynamically loaded structures where extreme load fluctuations can occur,
e.g. structures
in high seismic zones (Zones
IV and
V),
contribution due to
friction
shall
not be taken
into consideration while designing the anchorages
i.e.

zero.
5.8
Verification of the Stresses in the Adjoining Concrete Structure
The strength
of the concrete structure adjoining
to the Bearings shall be checked so as
to ensure safe bearing and transmitting the loads and forces that from the Bearings. The
concreting of the Bearing seating (Pedestal) and superstructure
soffit above the Bearing
shall be
carefully done
to avoid the voids/honeycombing underneath the Bearing which
may result
in undue deformation of the Bearing components or even premature Bearing
failure. The
stress
in
the
concrete
structure
shall
be checked
against
the
expression
described
in Annexure-F "Check

9.1
Installation
Bearings are to be installed with due care to ensure their correct functioning
in accordance
with the design of the Structure. The primary factors to be considered during the Installation
of the Bearings are:
Design Based Aspects
•
Provision of the Bearings
in the structure shall be so made so as to have
the least chances of dust and dirt accumulation and also spoilage from rain
water seepage that may affect their performance.
•
Provision
for
Jacking
Points
and
adequate
space
and
clearances
to
accommodate
the jacking arrangements
shall
be made
during
the
design/construction of the Structure to allow repair, replacement of bearings,
if required during service.
•
Consultation with the Bearing manufacture shall be done at an early stage of
the Bridge design to avoid the hassles of Pre- Stressing Tendons and anchor
blocks fouling with the Bearing Dowels.
Transportation and Site Handling Aspects
•
Transport Brackets are not to be relied upon for the Lifting of the Bearings.
•
On
receipt
of the
Bearings
at
Site,
the
Contractor
shall
have
a
visual
Examination
of the Bearings
to ensure that no damage or displacement
35



======================================================================
PAGE 44 of 60
======================================================================
IRC:83-2014(Pt. IV)
of the Bearing components
is taken place during the transportation. Any
rectification or re-assembly
if required shall be done strictly in the presence
of the Manufacturer's Representative.
installation Aspects
•
Bearings shall be installed truly horizontal with Top and Bottom Components
of the Bearings perfectly parallel to each other, unless otherwise stated.
•
For pre-cast construction, the positioning of the Bolts and Dowels embedded
in the Sub-structure/Superstructure shall be made strictly as per the Shop
Drawings.
•
The Dowels/Distribution Plates shall be properly grouted with suitable grout
material ensuring no voids, honeycombing underneath and above the Bearing
bottom and top plates respectively.
In case of Movable Bearings, particular
care shall be taken to ensure the correct orientation of the Bearings.
•
For In-situ type of Construction the Bearings shall be covered from ail sides
to avoid the ingress of cement slurry etc. inside the Bearing Components.
•
In case of Pre-cast Construction, extreme care is to be taken to avoid impact
loading
onto
the
Bearings
while
launching
the
Girders/Superstructure.
Girders shall not be rested freely over the Bearings i.e without any additional
temporary support as this may cause the overturning of the Girders due to
pendulum effect.
•
Transport brackets shall be removed at an appropriate time after the casting
of the cross diaphragm and setting of the Superstructure Concrete.
•
Bearings and
its components shall be checked for any dust, dirt or Cement
Slurry Deposit etc. and the surrounding area shall be cleaned thoroughly
once the process of Bearing installation
is finished.
9.2
iVIaintenance
Bearings shall be designed and manufactured to make them virtually maintenance free so
that the undesirable effects caused by extreme atmosphere or aggressive environmental
condition/unforeseen events can be eliminated to a great extent. However, the surrounding
area of the Bearings shall always be kept clean and dry to avoid damage to the Bearings.
Provisions for suitable easy access to the Bearing shall be made in the construction drawings
for the purpose of inspection and maintenance.
Inspection of Bearing at site
is required to be carried out from time to time to ascertain the
performance of the Bearings. Periodic nominal maintenance of Bearing shall be carried out in
36



======================================================================
PAGE 45 of 60
======================================================================
IRC:83-2014 (Pt. IV)
order to ensure better performance and longer life of the Bearings. The Bearings are generally
required to be inspected at an interval of approx. one year for the first five years and at an
interval of two years thereafter or as agreed between the client and the contractor. However,
the Bearings shall also be examined carefully after unusual occurrences,
like heavy traffic,
earthquakes, cyclones and battering from debris in high floods.
The inspection shall be preceded by careful cleaning of the Bearings as well as its surrounding
space, depending on the actual conditions around the Bearings, e.g. deposit of salt, debris,
dust or other foreign material.
Elements of Inspection
The following are recommended
inspection elements and actions which are considered
necessary to monitor and upkeep the Bearings:
1)
Measurement of Movement: During inspection at site, measurements are
required to be taken and documented to compute its movement and rotation
values in relation to their design values to ascertain whether the performance of
the Bearings is satisfactory. To ascertain maximum movement, measurement
should be taken once during peak winter (early morning) and once during
peak summer
(afternoon)
and
corresponding
atmospheric
temperature
should be recorded. The recorded value of movement shall be compared
with the design values.
2)
Measurement of Dimensions:
Overall dimensions
of the Bearings
are
required
to be measured and compared
with
the
actual dimensions
to
ascertain any excessive stress or strain on the Bearing.
3)
Evidence of locked
in Condition:
If any movable or
rotating
part of a
Bearing is found to be in locked - in/jammed condition, necessary rectification
measures shall be taken immediately.
4)
Evidence of Corrosion:
If corrosion of any part of exterior exposed steel
surface of the Bearing
is detected, the following measures may be taken.
In addition, the root cause of defect should be analyzed and proper actions
should be taken to avoid recurrence of the problem.
•
Detect affected part.
•
Wire brush the affected portion to clean of it's rust.
•
Apply protective coating as per Manufacturer's Specifications.
5)
Condition
of
the
adjacent
Bridge
Structure:
The
condition
of
the
structure
adjacent
to
the
Bearings
is
also
required
to be
inspected
for
any damage and necessary actions to repair the same, should be taken
immediately.

D.O
Ferroxyl Test for Hard Chromium Plating
D.1
Purpose of tlie Test
The Test objective is to ascertain the soundness and integrity of the Hard Chromium Plating
at the curved mating surface.
D.2
Principle
The test method
is based on the principle that cracks and porosity extending through the
hard chromium layer to the steel substrate will be revealed as blue marks due to the reaction
of Fe-ll-ions with the indicator solution of potassium ferrocyanide
111 and sodium chloride.
D.3
indicator Solution Composition
The ferroxyl indicator solution is composed of 1 0g K3 [Fe(CN)J and 30g NaCI in
1
1 of distilled
water or water completely desalinated by ion exchange.
Note:
As skin contact with indicator solution shall be avoided, skin protection
is required and food
shall not be consumed while handling the indicator solution. The indicator solution
in contact
with acids releases extremely toxic prussic (hydrocyanic) acid.
D.4
Test Specimen and Preparation
The test shall be performed on min. 20 percent of the contact area of the surface.
The test shall be carried out at a temperature between 5°C and 40°C.
In order to prevent false indications, the atmosphere
in the vicinity of the test shall be free
from ferrous particles and the test sample shall be covered and protected from dust and
foreign material.
Immediately before the
test, the hard chromium layer shall be cleaned with an acid-free
degreasing agent.
D.5
Test Procedure
The hard chromium area to be tested shall be covered with white blotting paper impregnated
with the indicator solution. The wet paper shall adhere firmly to the hard chromium surface
without wrinkles or blisters.
The solution shall remain
in contact with the surface for
1 hour min. At the end of the test
period, before removing the blotting paper,
it shall be identified and checked for changes in
colour.
Defective areas
in the hard chromium layer will be indicated as blue-coloured marks on the
paper. After the test, the indicator solution shall be completely removed from the sample by
means of water or alcohol and then the surface shall be dried.
