RECOMMENDED PRACTICES FOR TREATMENT OF
EMBANKMENT AND ROADSIDE SLOPES FOR EROSION CONTROL
Indian
Roads
Congress
(IRC)
had
published
the
Guidelines
'Recommended
Practice for Treatment of Embankment Slopes for Erosion Control' (IRC:56)
in the
year 1974. During the last 36 years, sufficient amount of work has been carried out
in
the
field
of
erosion
control
practices
by
various
agencies
and
new
materials/improved techniques have been evolved. Keeping
in view this aspect, the
'Embankment, Ground
Improvement and
Drainage Committee
(H-4)'
of the IRC
decided to review these Guidelines. The Committee assigned the work of revising
the same and preparing a new draft to Shri U.K. Guru Vittal and Mr. Sudhir Mathur
from
CRRI,
New
Delhi.
The
draft
prepared
by them
was
discussed
by
H-4
Committee during
its several meetings and the suggestions/modifications proposed
were
incorporated
in
the
draft.
The
H-4
Committee
in
their
meeting
held
on
8.10.2010 approved the revised draft and referred the same to HSS Committee of
IRC.
The HSS Committee approved
the document
with some
modifications
in
its
4'^
meeting held on 22 October 2010. The Executive Committee of IRC approved the
modified document
in
its meeting held on 27 October 2010 and then the document
was placed before the IRC Council in
its 19""^ meeting held on
1 1 November 2010 at
Nagpur for consideration. The Council approved the document for publication. The
composition of H-4 Committee is as given below:

2 MECHANISM OF SURFACE EROSION
The
impact
of highway
location on
the environment
is a
major concern
to
the
highway engineers and the public. The highways,
if they are not properly located,
designed, constructed
or maintained, would be subjected
to erosion and may
at
times contribute sediments to the stream. The control of soil and water
is essential
for protection of the road structure and the conservation efforts. Therefore, highway
design, construction and maintenance procedures must be continuously evaluated
to minimise erosion and sedimentation problems. Lack of timely provision of erosion
control
measures
and/or
inadequate
workmanship
accelerates
the
problems.
Erosion can be controlled to a considerable degree by geometric design, particularly
through aspects relating to cross
- section.
In some respects, the control
is directly
associated
with proper provision
of drainage and landscape development. Thus,
effect of erosion should be considered
in the planning and design stage itself. There
have been instances where many embankment slopes,
irrespective of type of
soil
used for their construction, have suffered a high degree of damage due to erosion
from
rain and
runoff.
Denudation
of
vegetation
from
soil
slopes
or the
lack
of
vegetative cover on embankment slopes
is often
responsible
for formation
of
rills
and
rain-cuts,
eventually
leading
to a
surficial
slide
or
to an undermining
of the
edges of the road pavement structure. When vegetation grows on the slopes, there
2

======================================================================
IRC:56-2011
becomes available an effective dense network of root system, penetrating to a depth
of about 0.50 to 0.75m into the slope, which serves to anchor down the soil mantle
and render
it resistant to erosion.
Although some standardisation
of methods for minimising
soil erosion
in highway
construction
is possible, comprehensive guidelines for control of erosion can be of a
general nature because of the wide variation
in climate, topography, geology,
soils,
vegetation,
water resources and
land
use encountered
in
different
parts
of
the
country.
Also,
erosion
process
is
a
natural phenomenon
accelerated
by man's
activity, technical competency
in evaluating the severity of erosion problem and the
planning and design of preventive and corrective measures
is essential
in obtaining
economical
and
environmentally
satisfactory
methods
of
erosion
control.
This
guideline
highlights some
of the techniques of establishing a vegetative cover on
embankment slopes by different methods such as use of organic mulch, readymade
turfs of grass, application of jute or coir nettings, etc.
In the recent past, considerable
research has been
carried
out
in the
field
of 'Use
of Geosynthetics'
for erosion
control. There
is also an emerging area
of bioengineering techniques, which can
also be adopted
for erosion control by
field engineers. These aspects have been
kept
in
view
while
revising
these
guidelines.
However,
this
guideline does
not
provide details about other traditional methods which are
in routine use such as the
provision
of stone pitching, use of concrete blocks,
etc. Additionally,
this guideline
mainly covers the methods used to control/minimise erosion caused by water alone.
A general
classification
of various methods
of ground covers
for erosion
control
available to a highway engineer are
illustrated
in
Fig.
1.
Fig. 2 to 7 which show
different
erosion
patterns
encountered
in
case
of
road
embankments.
Erosion
process may sometimes lead to rock fall problems
in
hill slopes.
Brief details about
rockfall control techniques applicable to
hill slopes are given
in Annex-I. For further
details about rockfall mitigation techniques, HRB Special Report - 15, 'State of the
Art: Landslide Correction Techniques' can be referred to.
3 OBJECTIVE OF EROSION CONTROL
The objective of the erosion control practices should be,
in order of priority:
•
To protect the road
infrastructure so
that
it continues
its function
of
permitting uninterrupted flow of traffic at design speed and safety;
•
to protect and preserve the earthwork
in
fill
or road side cut slopes
especially in hilly terrain, ditches and drainage structures;

•
to prevent damage to land adjacent to the road structure (in fact quite
often, the neglect of control measures on adjacent land creates serious
problems of erosion within the road land);
•
to reduce
the
soil
loss from
the
road embankment, which
silts up
drainage channel, watenA/ays of cross drainage structures and pollute
rivers;
•
to contribute to the improvement of the aesthetics of the landscape;
•
to avoid accidental falling of debris.
4 SOIL LOSS ANALYSIS
Erosion may be considered as detachment of soil particles from the soil surface and
the transportation of the detached particles to a new location. Erosion
is caused by
the combined action of physical and chemical processes by which the soil or rock
particles are loosened, detached and transported from one
place
to another by
impact
of
raindrops,
running
water,
wind, moving
ice,
etc. Clayey
soils are
less
erodible than fine sands and silts.
In
the
rain induced
erosion
process,
firstly,
raindrops
hit the slope surface and
impact
of the
raindrops detaches the
particles
of
soil.
Additionally,
runoff water
6



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 48
======================================================================
IRC:56-2011
flowing on the slope surface also contributes towards detachment of soil particles.
The
overland
water
flow
(surface
runoff)
resulting
from
rainfall
transports
the
detached
particles. The
rate of detachment
is a function
of
kinetic energy of the
falling raindrop. Comparing the kinetic energy dissipated by the impact of raindrop
with that of water flowing
relatively slowly down the slope, the energy of impact
would be found to be much higher than the energy of flowing water. Thus,
it may be
inferred that erosion can be reduced
in the first place by protecting the soil surface
from direct impact of rain. The equation to calculate energy of raindrops responsible
for erosion is given in Table 1

A method to quantify erodibility of site is to measure the rate of soil loss per unit area
of site per unit time. Erodibility of site
is the function of the erosivity of rain, the soil
properties, the topography, land cover and management. When applied to a single
slope, the topographical factors to be considered would be the slope length and
its
steepness. Thus the
soil loss can be estimated using the
relationship, known as
universal soil loss equation (USLE), in t/km^/yr as given below;
A=RxKxLxSxCxP
where
A

This

'Revised

Equation (RUSLE)' was given by Renard et al.,
in 1997. A principal modification is in
R
factor which
includes
rainfall and
runoff
erosivity
factor
(runoff
erosivity
also
includes snow melt where runoff is significant).
For protection of a road embankment running along a river course or for protection
of bridge abutments close to river edge, bank protection measures are sometimes
required to be adopted. Riprap with properly designed apron
is generally used as a
liner for streams,
rivers and channels subjected to high-velocity flow and for lake,
reservoir and channel banks subject to wave action. Geotextiles are an effective and
economical
alternative
to conventional graded
filters which
are placed under the
stone
riprap.
However,
for
aesthetic
or economic
reasons,
articulated
concrete
mattresses, gabions or precast cellular blocks or geotextile bags can also be used to
cover the geotextile. The velocity of the current, the height and frequency of waves
and
the
erodibility
of
the
bank
need
to
be
considered
while
designing
bank
protection.
Extensive
soil
conservation
and
watershed
management
play
an
important role in reducing sediment discharge from watersheds. Special construction
measures, other than vegetation growth on slope, include compaction of slope and
provision
of
revetment
protection
such
as
using
stone
or
bricks,
placement
of
fascines, etc. These are designed to break up energy of flowing water and prevent
migration of particles by reducing the threshold velocity of erosion. For more details
regarding
river bank protection, IRC:89 "Guidelines
for Design & Construction
of
River Training and Control Works for Road Bridges" may be referred.
4.2
Provision of Kerb Drains and Chutes in Embankments
The
problem
of
erosion
of
slopes
and
shoulders
is
most
severe
in
high
embankments having steep longitudinal gradient, when the embankment has been
built with
erodible
soil, without proper longitudinal and cross drains. The erosion
problems
in
such
embankments
become
acute
when
the
side
slopes
are

unprotected.
In such a case, water gains velocity and eventually when
it leaves the
roadway at any random location,
it may cause serious erosion of slopes manifesting
in
the form
of deep
gulleys extending
right upto carriageway. Sometimes such
problems may
undermine
road
pavement
also. The quantum
of
runoff
water
becomes considerable in case of four lane roads with paved shoulders, especially in
curved sections
of the
road, where
unidirectional camber
is provided. This may
result
in accumulation
of huge
quantity
of
runoff water from
both carriageways
towards one side of the embankment side slope, thereby increasing the severity of
the erosion by many times. Therefore
in such instances, a system of proper kerb,
channel and median drains coupled with chutes should be provided to drain off the
rain water from the road embankments. For more details in this regard, IRC:SP:42
"Guidelines on Road Drainage' and 1RC:SP:50, "Guidelines on Urban Drainage"
may be referred to.
Road embankments as well as
hill side cuttings and stream/ river banks experience
a high degree of damage due to erosion from
rain. Denudation of vegetation from
soil slopes or the lack of vegetation cover on such slopes gradually progresses to
form
rills and gullies, and
if they remain unchecked,
it leads to surficial slide. The
various options available to Highway engineers to mitigate erosion related problems
due to water are explained in the following sections.

5.1
Simple Vegetative Turfing
Erosion
is
often a problem when there
is
not enough
protective cover on steep
slopes or
in drainage channels that have been designed to
rely on vegetation for
long
term
erosion
control.
Vegetation
is
ideal
for
erosion
control because
it
is
relatively
inexpensive
to
establish
and
maintain
and
it
presents
aesthetically
appealing
look.
Vegetative
turfing
has
proved
to
be,
by
and
large,
the
most
economical and simple means of protecting slope of hills and embankments against
erosion.
Obviously,
this method
should be adopted where
the
soil
has enough
nutrients and
the environmental
conditions are conducive
to promote vegetation
growth. The method consists of preparing the slope area into seedbeds by grading
the
slope
to
the
extent
possible
and
subsequently
broadcasting
the
seeds
or
saplings/plant roots of promising types of locally available plants.
In case the slope
has pockets of enriched and poor soils
in relation to promotion of vegetation, putting
seeds in isolated pockets of specially enriched soil should encourage plantation. The
rest
of the slope should be treated with some other techniques described
in
this
guideline.
On the basis
of
field
studies,
it has been established that shallow
surficial
slides
constitute a significant proportion
of landslides
in the areas with moderate
rainfall
intensity and
with a
soil cover
of medium cohesive
type. Most
of these
surficial
landslides occur as a result of loss of vegetation cover on
soil slopes due to a cut
being made
for road construction.
Surficial
slides extend
to only a shallow depth
below the slope surface and originate as a result of erosion due to flowing water.
If
erosion
is allowed to proceed unchecked, there
is every possibility that the damage
may spread laterally or the depth of erosion may increase, eventually resulting
in a
much
larger damaged slope
area. Vegetative
turfing
represents one
of the most
important corrective measures
in such cases.
In the case of freshly exposed cutting
made
for road construction, vegetative
turfing
is
important, even as a preventive
measure.
In the case of deep seated slides, however, vegetative turfing
is only one
of the several corrective measures which should be adopted and as such
it can
prove to be effective only when implemented along with other corrective measures.
The joint action
of trees, grass and other plant species for protection of
soil from
water and wind erosion has been recognised from several documented studies. The
above ground biomass of the trees and plants provide adequate canopy interception
to the falling
rain drops and saves the
soil from splash erosion, while the mass of
litter and Rhizomes
act as speed
breakers
for the
running water on
the
slope.

Besides soil protection, grass plays a significant role in binding the soil particles with
their fibrous
root system. The
root system
of different plant species varies and
its
mass increases with the age of the plant. The protective mechanism of vegetation in
preventing surficial erosion can be summarised as given below:
a)
Interception: Foliage and plant residues absorb
rainfall energy and
prevent soil detachment due to raindrop splash
b)
Restraint:
Root systems
physically
bind
or
restrain
soil
particles
while above ground part of the vegetation
filter sediments from the
runoff.
c)
Retardation:
Stems and
foliage
increase
surface
roughness and
slow down velocity of runoff
d)
Infiltration: Plants and their residues help to maintain porosity and
permeability
thereby
promoting
infiltration
and
delaying
onset
of
runoff
Deep rooted vegetation helps to prevent shallow mass movement by:
•
Reinforcement of the soil by the root system
•
Soil water depletion through transpiration and adsorption
•
Buttressing and soil arching action from embedded stems
Laboratory and
analytical studies carried out concerning the
role
of vegetation
in
improving the
stability of slopes, have established
that, the binding effect of roots
impart to the
soil, cohesive strength
of about 2.0 to 2.5 tonnes/sqm. Assuming an
effective
depth
of
penetration
of
0.5 m
and
increase
in
cohesive
strength
of
2.0 tonnes/sqm,
analysis
of slope with normal geometry has shown a
significant
increase
in the factor of safety for a slope height of about 6 m. Thus, by providing a
vegetative cover, not only the erosion of the soil
is checked, but also the possibility
of shallow slope failure is prevented, due to the strengthening of the top 0.5 m depth
of the soil slope. Some typical deep-rooted species of grasses and shrubs suited to
different topographical areas
of our country are given
in Annex-ll. These species
can be adopted for turfing of denuded slopes.
However, there are certain
limits to the successful application
of vegetative turfing
method. This method may fail in the following situations:
1)
On highly erodible slopes where seeding or sprigging
is
liable to be
washed down before they have had time to take root.
11



======================================================================

IRC:56-2011
2)
When seed
broadcasting work
is done
immediately
preceding
or
during very heavy downpour.
3)
In places where no artificial supply of water is available for promoting
growth
of vegetation
or where adequate supply of moisture to the
slopes by
light
rain or drizzle
is not available beyond the monsoon
season.
4)
At
locations, where vegetation growth
is
difficult to achieve due to
infertile nature of soil.
The density of sowing
is of great importance.
In general, while sowing a mixture of
grass and legume plants, seed rate should be normally 15 gm/m^.
Prior to sowing,
the
soil surface should be adequately prepared. The sowing procedure
is to place
the seed within a shallow furrow and cover
it with about 10 mm loose soil.
In steeper
slopes (1 V:2.5 H or less), broad casting
is used, the object being to spread the seed
on
the
slopes as
evenly as
possible.
Help from
botanists/agronomists may
be
sought
for
developing
vegetation
cover
on
infertile
soil
slopes.
Sometimes,
vegetation growth
in a
soil slope
is often met with problems
like absence of
initial
binding (cohesion)
in the soil, especially in case of silty or sandy slopes. Because of
lack of cohesion, plant growth
is inhibited in the initial stage itself.
In such conditions,
to enable
vegetation
to
grow,
it
requires a
reinforcing
material
for
its
root mat
system.
In such circumstances,
it
is advisable to go
in for special techniques, such
as the ones recommended in the succeeding paragraphs.
5.2
Transplantation of Readymade Turfs of Grass
It
is also possible to provide vegetative turfing by 'Sodding' which involves bodily
transplantation
of blocks
of turfs
of grass
(with 5-8 cm
of
soil covering the grass
roots) from the original
site to the barren slopes to be treated.
If found necessary,
pegs or nails could be used to hold down the grass sods in the
initial stage. By this
method, vegetation cover on a barren slope can be ensured
in a very short time
duration. Watering and other care
to be taken
for successful vegetation cover to
develop
would
be
similar
to
simple
vegetative
turfing
method
described
in
Section 5.1.
5.3
Application of Mulch
The
term
'mulch'
refers
to any
loose
or
soft
organic
material,
e.g.
straw
with
cowdung or wood shavings mixed with cowdung or saw dust and dung mixture, etc
12

laid down on the slopes to protect the roots of plants.
In the case of embankments
which are less than 3 m high, where the severity of the erosion problem
is not of a
high order, the mulch application would be very helpful for vegetation growth. The
approximate
thickness
of
mulch
cover
should
be
2.5
cm.
The
organic
mulch
covering the soil slopes can be held
in place and made resistant to being washed
downhill
or being blown away by pegging them down
with bamboos,
at suitable
intervals,
in a grid pattern and also laying bamboos horizontally connecting the pegs
and thus forming the grid.
5.4
Vetlver Grass (Botanical name: Chrysopogon Zizanioides)
Vetiver is a special type of grass which can be grown
in a wide variety of soil such
as clayey, sandy,
silty, gravely types or in other words from least erodible to highly
erodible soils. This type of grass does not require any special maintenance. Vetiver
is capable of growing in wide range of climates ranging from 300 mm annual rainfall
to
over 6000 mm
annual
rainfall
and
from -14°C
to
more
than
50°C
of
soil
temperature. Moreover,
it can withstand long and sustained drought for more than
six months.
The stabilisation and protection of slope by vetiver grass
is effective,
efficient and
low cost
vis-a-vis
other
traditional methods
of erosion
control
like stone
rip-rap.
Vetiver grass penetrates vertically below to considerable depths into the sub-soil,
its
roots have a significant strength and thereby improve the shear strength of sub-soil
at a depth
of 0.5 m by as much as 40 percent.
For best
result, the vetiver
root
divisions, or slips, should be planted in a double or triple line to form parallel hedges
across the erosion prone slope. Distance between consecutive hedge rows can be
kept between 30 to 50 cm. The slips should be planted at the beginning of the rainy
season to ensure that they get full benefit of the soil moisture. Planting operations of
vetiver slips
is similar to planting of
rice seedlings. The next
slip
is planted 10 to
15 cm from the already planted slip along the same contour furrow and the process
is repeated upto required length to cover the entire area. Once the hedge has been
established at the slope, only care needed is annual trimming,
if required.

Hydroseeding/Hydro-Mulching
Straw or hay can be chopped and driven

soil bed

sometimes secured to the ground surface by crimping, punching, tacking or netting,
but often mulch
is not secured firmly to the ground. Hence integrity of these mulches
can
be
severely
affected
by
rain,
wind,
surface
runoff
and
animal/
human
trespassing. As a
result, conventional mulches provide few weeks of protection to
the bare soil, often making grading and reapplication necessary. To overcome such
shortfall,
the
technique
of
Hydroseeding
(also known
as
Hydro-mulching) was
developed.
Hydroseeding
is a process which can be considered as alternative to sodding.
It
involves seed application
in a water based
slurry via a high pressure pump and
hoses or a spray gun. The basic ingredients used
in this process are water, seeds,
fertiliser, mulch, tackifier and bio-stimulant. Mulch can be made from recycled paper
or shredded wood or a mixture of both - wooden mulch breathes while paper mulch
forms a protective cover. Chopped straw cut to a length of 10 to 20 mm can also be
used as mulch. Tackifier
is required to make this mulch and seed stick to the
soil
surface
to
which
it
is
being
applied.
Mulch
protects
the
slope
until
the
seed
germinates and provides organic nutrients as the vegetation grows. These mixed
ingredients are stored
in a tank and applied using a pressure pump, on barren land
surface on which vegetation
is to be promoted. Hydroseeding method can also be
used by adopting cellulose based fibrous mulches. Cellulose based fibrous mulches
are spray applied with the seed in this method. The fibres are dispersed in a solution
that, when sprayed on bare soil, t^auses the fibres to stick to each other and to the
soil. Hydroseeding method
is specially suited for vertical or near vertical soil slopes
(steep slopes) on which 'simple vegetative turfing' or manual application of mulch
would
not be successful. Hydroseeding job
is specialised and expensive
but
for
some inaccessible slopes,
it offers the only practical method.
5.6
Promotion of Vegetative Turfing by Using Jute Netting
Many field experiments have been successfully carried out
in different parts of the
country under varying climatic conditions on manmade embankments and
natural
slopes using jute netting (also known as open weave jute geotextile) for promotion of
vegetation and control of soil erosion. The method involves laying the jute netting
firmly on the prepared slope after sowing seeds of suitable vegetation.
Before
laying
jute
netting,
the slopes which are being treated are
to be
initially
demarcated, graded and fertilised. The levelling of the area must be carried out so
that when netting
is
laid
it may cover the entire area flush to the ground ensuring
15



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 48
======================================================================
IRC:56-2011
that the runoff would flow over the nettings. Before laying the netting, a dose of seed
broadcasting of locally available suitable type of grasses
is done. Thereafter, jute
netting of
1 .25 cm to 2.5 cm opening size is laid on the prepared slope surface firmly
in the direction
of water flow. The
netting
is secured against displacement by an
overlapping of 5 cm to 8 cm and stitched or pegged down with 15 cm long steel nails
about
1 .0 m apart. The top and bottom ends of the fully stretched jute netting are
fixed/anchored
in
trenches
of 30 cm
depth.
Afterwards,
another dose
of seed
broadcasting or dibbling of locally available grasses 15 to 20 cm apart,
in rows
is
carried out.

IRC:56-2011
The jute net acts as a series of miniature checi< dams, thus, absorbing the force of
impact and dissipating the kinetic energy of surface runoff, and thereby reducing
its
erosion potential. The soil particles, seed, grass root slips are held securely in their
original
locations without being
dislodged, due
to
provision
of jute
nettings. Jute
netting absorbs water upto four times
its dry weight and transfers
it to soil, thereby,
giving
full benefit of moisture for growth of vegetation. After the
first rainy season,
the
seeded
and
sprigged
vegetation
soon
envelops
the
entire
surface
thus,
protecting the slopes against erosion. Jute netting has been observed to have a
life
of about
1 to 2 years in the field, which
is sufficient for fully promoting the growth of
vegetation
cover
on
the
denuded
slopes.
Once
vegetation
growth
has
been
established within two monsoon seasons, the mission
is accomplished for the jute
netting. At the end of jute netting's
life, the geogrid decomposes and
in the process
adds
nutrients
to the
soil.

5.7
Use of Coir Netting
Coir
netting
(also known as
'Coir Bhoovastra')
is another type
of biodegradable
material which can be
effectively used
in a manner similar to jute
nettings. Coir
nettings degrade much slower than jute nettings (expected field
life of about 2 to 3
years) and thus provide protection to the slopes for a longer time than jute nettings.
Coir
is also resistant to saline water and provides an ecological niche for a rapid
re-establishment of the vegetation cover. Coir resembles natural soil
in
its capacity
to absorb solar radiation. This means that there
is no risk of excessive heating as
it
happens sometimes
in the case of synthetic
nettings.
In a manner similar to jute
nettings,
coir
netting
also breaks up
runoff from heavy
rains and
dissipates the
energy
of
flowing
water.
Coir
also
promotes
the
growth
of new
vegetation
by
absorbing water and preventing the top soil from drying out. However, compared to
Jute nettings, drapability of coir netting is lesser and their water absorption capability
is also lower than jute nettings. Coir nettings are available
in densities varying from
400 to 1400 gm/m^ (higher density means a tighter mesh and less open area in the
netting). The length of the
rolls would be 50 m and width can be between
1
to 4 m.

of
coir
nettings,

Erosion Control Using Two Dimensional (2-D) Synthetic Geogrids/
Netting
With the provision of polymer geogrid mesh for root reinforcement, extremely high
density of grass growth can be achieved. Geogrid reinforced slope protection has
been shown to provide erosion protection equivalent to 250 mm thick revetment and
is treated as an attractive cost-effective alternative solution. Under erratic weather
conditions,
successful
vegetation
growth and
its
maintenance depends on
un-
seasonal
rainfall and hence longer
life of reinforcing material would be required for
ensuring vegetation growth apart from contribution from the mesh towards reduction
in velocity of surface
runoff. Most ordinary turfing as well as agro based nettings
may fail to provide erosion prevention in areas which experience repetitive change in
climate, prolonged drought
in
particular. Use of polymer geogrid mesh provides a
permanent protection as
it
is not biodegradable. When compared with such similar
root
reinforcing
concepts
by
using
natural
fibres,
it compares
very
favourably,
because of
its longer
life and almost unfailing success rate for vegetation growth
year after year.
The peak tensile strength or tensile strength at 10 percent strain, whichever is lower,
of the polymeric geogrid to be used for erosion control should not be less than 4
kN/m when tested as per ASTM D 5035 (minimum average
roll value
in machine
direction). Geogrid mesh
shall be stabilised against ultraviolet ray degradation for
continuous exposure
of about
10 years
(defined as
retaining 75
percent
of
its
original strength after 10 years of exposure) using finely divided carbon black (ASTM
D 4355 - 500 hour exposure). The installation and seed broadcasting procedures
would be similar to jute nettings.

Erosion

Products
Relying upon vegetation growth alone may be sometimes very unpredictable and
unreliable
as
it may
be
extremely
difficult
to
achieve
100
percent
vegetation
coverage,
leaving exposed areas vulnerable
to
erosion.
Furthermore,
vegetation
may sometimes dry up or become diseased, reducing
its erosion control capability.
Reinforced vegetation (or reinforced grass) is a better method that is being practiced
for enhancing slope stability and erosion control. The synthetic materials that have
been employed
in
reinforced grass technique have two forms. They can be two
dimensional polymeric meshes, a mesh being an extruded
net with apertures
to
allow grass growth. This product was explained
in section 5.8.
Alternatively, they
can
be
three
dimensional
mats,
these
being
multi-filamented
materials
having
specified
thickness.
Such
materials
are
also known
as
Rolled
Erosion
Control
Products (RECPs). 3-D Mats/RECPs can also be made using biodegradable natural
fibres such as straw, jute, coir or wood shavings (used individually or in combination)
stuffed into polymeric or organic nettings on either side to form a mat or blanket like
structure.
Obviously when
mats
are made
using
natural
fibres,
they would
be
biodegradable also, but they don't provide everlasting protection. RECPs are used in
combination
with seed beds
to enhance
the establishment
of vegetation. When
geosynthetic mattings (3-D Mats) are made exclusively from polymeric substances,
they
consist
of
UV
stabilised
synthetic
fibres
and
filaments
processed
into
permanent, high strength, three dimensional (3-D) matrices,
installation procedure
involves
levelling and
preparation
of
the
surface
to be
treated,
rolling
out and
fastening the geosynthetic mat in intimate contact with the soil sufface, then
in-filling
with fine soil and a prescribed seed mix. Seed can be applied to the surface either
before or after the mat is installed and the vegetation will develop unhindered by the
matrix.
A
geosynthetic
mat
installed
in
this
manner
is
also
called
as
'Turf
Reinforcement Mat
(TRM)'.
Polymeric mats
are used
in
situations where
these
products are required to
last a long time. Other way of installation involves direct
deployment
of the
material over a
freshly seeded
soil
surface.
This
allows
the
natural
sedimentation
process
to
in-fill
the
mat,
allowing
a
more
gradual
development of a reinforced vegetation cover.
Steel wire mesh
is sometimes included
in these mats optionally where these mats
are required to possess more strength against erosive forces,
like steeper slopes or
in heavy rainfall areas. The three dimensional mats shall be anchored to the surface
to be protected using staples or pins. The 3-D mat increases the soil's resistance to

erosion by providing an environment that enhances the growth of vegetation through
the
mat.
Initially
the mat works
to
shield
the
soil from washing
out
before
the
vegetation has a chance to become established. Then as the vegetation matures,
the roots anchor the mat to the soil to provide superior soil reinforcement strength,
capable of handling greater volumes of runoff water and higher flow velocities.
The three dimensional mat solutions protect the soil surface by:
•
Providing immediate protection of exposed areas from direct effects
of wind and rainfall impact
•
Protecting seeded
topsoil from washing out before vegetation has
established
•
Creating an environment
that enhances
the
growth
of vegetation
through the mat
•
Reinforcing the root system of plants, further binding the soil surface
.
and increasing shear resistance of the surface
•
Reducing the velocity and volume of runoff flow by increasing water
percolation into the soil
•
The steel wire mesh (optional) helps
in the retention of gravel sized
particles and also acts as an additional reinforcement.
3-D mats having a wide ranging variety of strength are available. The material used
for manufacturing these mats also varies. Hence following general specifications are
given for guidance:

Preformed Polymer Geocells or Webs
Often, steep slopes are to be constructed
in areas where vegetation may be difficult
to establish.
It may also be not possible to mitigate potential erosive forces that are
likely to overcome the strength of the root system.
In such cases 'Geocells' can be
adopted. Geocells are 3-dimensional honey combed
structures. They are
usually
made
by
a
single
continuous
extrusion
process.
They
can
be

150 mm.
In
very steep slopes exceeding
1:1
gradient,
particularly
in
waterfront,
placement of top
soil
in these cells enables retention
of
soil veneer. The geocells
prevent the
soil from slippages and thereby encourage vegetation growth. Multiple
layers of geocells placed one over another can also be adopted. Geocells placed on
the
slope
are
secured
to
adjoining
cell
at
suitable
intervals
by
using
a
clip
arrangement and these expanded cells should be secured to the slope using steel
staples
(typically 300 mm
long and 9.5 mm diameter). This process
is extremely
essential
to maintain
integrity
of geocells especially
in steep slopes. When these
cells are filled with soil, they physically confine the soil. The cell walls confine the soil
and decrease the
velocity
of water passing across the
surface. The confinement
forces
are
generated
by
the
resistance
of
the
cell
walls
and
by
the
passive
resistance of the soil. Geocell placement in the waterfronts can also be designed as
an alternative to revetment protection. Geocells can be used where heavy runoff or
channel scouring
is anticipated. Geocells filled with concrete can be used to protect
bridge aprons, guide bunds and pier areas, abutting waterfront as revetment as an
alternative
to
conventional
stone/boulder
pitching.
Geotextile
conforming
to
IRC:
SP:59 can
be adopted
in such
situations as
filter media
behind
geocells.
Thereby
geocells
can
replace
expensive
rip-rap
or
concrete
slope
protection.
Geocells
being
relatively
new
type
of
materials,
field
engineers may
consult
published literature/ product brochures regarding specifications and usage at site.

Erosion Control by Armour Systems
River/Stream bank
erosion
often
creates concern
for
road
agencies because
it
generally leads to toe erosion and disturb the
stability of slopes. Some degree
of
erosion
is natural. However, erosion can be accelerated or decelerated by certain
actions. For example, clearing shoreline vegetation will accelerate the process while

structures,
channelizing
runoff
or some combination
of these methods may be
appropriate. Soil banks or slopes exposed to constant concentrated flows, currents,
or waves cannot support vegetation and thus need to be protected by hard armour
systems.
23



======================================================================
PAGE 32 of 48
======================================================================
IRC:56-2011
The erosion control structures for bank protection are as follows:
1)
Rip-rap - Comprises
of stone
of
different
sizes
(conforming
to
specified gradation) placed
against the
river bank
to
deflect the
force
of
the
water
hitting
the
banks.
Stone
pitching
refers
to
placement of approximately single sized rocks along the slope to
serve the same purpose.
2)
Retaining walls, toe-walls or break walls and sheet piles that are
placed in such a way to form a barrier between the shore and the
water front.
3) Gabion
baskets/revet
mattresses
that
are
filled
with
stones
of
specified size and
provided on slopes
4)
Geotextile Bags - Bags made from geotextile material, which are
filled with sand/suitable type of soil and are kept on the slopes
in
place of stone pitching
When a hard armour system
is
in place, water can seep
in and out of the bank or
slope, but the force of water
is resisted by the armour. As the water seeps,
it can
gradually carry soil particles along with
it. The resulting voids cause armour support
to be
lost after some time. This process
is called
'piping' which can culminate
in
shifting,
rolling,
or other
instability
in
the hard armour system.
Typical
solutions
include placing a filter layer between the bank soil and the armour to prevent piping.
Traditional
filter layers have been graded sand and aggregate which are very costly
because they are constructed from
select graded
materials.
Also, the
filter layer
must be
of a
controlled
thickness. On a steep
slope,
it can be very
difficult
to
properly construct such aggregate filter layers.
Geotextiles have become .standard
filter layers for hard armour systems because
they overcome the drawbacks
of graded sand and aggregate
filters. These are
manufactured with specific hydraulic and soil retention properties to suit the soil that
needs protection. Also, they can be installed with ease on slopes, even under water.
Specifications and
other
details

of

armour protection system can be obtained from IRC SP:59, 'Guidelines for Use of
Geotextiles

6 BIOENGINEERING EROSION CONTROL
Stream bank and embankment side slope erosion can be severe,
in cases wliere
sliorelines are composed of easily erodible soil and where the road runs along the
stream. Traditional methods of controlling stream flow and wave induced erosion
have
relied on
structural practices
like
rip-rap,
retaining walls and sheet
piles.
In
many cases these methods are expensive
or may be
ineffective. An
alternative
approach
is
bioengineering, a method
of construction
using
live
plants alone
or
combined with dead or inorganic materials, to produce living, functioning systems to
prevent erosion, control sediment and provide habitat. Bioengineering involves the
use of live plants to add structural strength to soil.
Advantages of bioengineering solutions are:
1) Low cost and
lower long-term maintenance cost than
traditional
methods
2) Low
maintenance
requirement
of
live
plants
after
they
are
established
3)
Environmental
benefits
of
wildlife
habitat,
water
quality
improvement and aesthetics
4)
Improved strength over time as root systems develop and increase
structural stability
5)
Compatibility
with
environmentally
sensitive
sites
with
limited
access.
Limitations of bioengineering methods include:
1)
Installation season
is
often
restricted
to
plant dormant seasons,
when site access is limited
2) The availability of locally adapted plants may be limited
3)
Labour needs are intensive and
skilled, experienced
labour may
not be available
4)
Installers may
not be
familiar with
bioengineering
principles and
designs (untrained)
Plants that root quickly are used
in a variety of ways to control erosion. There are
several ways
in which bioengineering solutions can be implemented for protection
against erosion as explained in following sections.
6.1
Contour Wattling
One bioengineering technique that has been successfully used
is called 'wattling'.
It
is a bundle of dormant stem cuttings tied together. When the wattles are planted in a
bank along a contour, they sprout a continuous line of roots and shoots (resembling
25



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:56-2011
a retaining wall of plants) and quickly stabilises the soil than individual plants. Within
a few years, the "sprouts" look like a tree lining/continuous row of shrubs.
This method
is used to control surface erosion by breaking long slopes into shorter
slopes. Bundles of branches (wattles) are placed in shallow trenches along the slope
or stream bank contour (Fig. 16). Trenches are excavated by hand
in such a way
that depth of the trench
is equal to half of the diameter of wattle and branches are
secured with a twine. After the wattle is staked in place, the trench
is backfilled until
only the top of the bundle
is exposed. Wattles can be used for hill slope restoration,
road embankments, wide gullies, or slump areas. Installations start at the bottom of
the cut or fill and proceeds upslope.
Prepare Wattling: Tube Shaped Bundles of live brush with ends alternating.
20 - 25 cm diameter, tied at a spacing of 30 - 37.5 cm

IRC:56-2011
6.2
Brush Layering
This method
is used
to
restore slopes by
constructing a
fill-slope
consisting
of
alternating layers of live branches and soil, creating a series of reinforced benches.
Large quantities of dormant branches of suitable plant species are often used. While
about 75 to 80 percent of the branch
is buried, the tips are
left exposed (Fig. 17).
The layers of branches help reinforce the
fill area. Brush layering can be used to
place new
fill or repair old
fill areas, restore shallow slumps,
repair narrow gullies
and stabilise loose soil slopes. The vertical angle depends on slope angle.

6.3
Coir Fascines
Coir fascines are wattles made from the fibrous outer husk
of coconuts.
Coir
is
denser than water so
it will not float and
is very slow to decay. Coir fascines are a
readily available manufactured product and are popular for stream bank and wetland
restoration where a natural look is desired. Coir fascines are placed with their tops at
the water surface. Live plants can be placed
into coir fascines to create a natural
look. The coconut
fibre accumulates sediment and
biodegrades as
plant
roots
develop and become a stabilising system Fig. 18.

6.4
Pre-Vegetated Mats
P re-vegetated mats are
live plants grown on a movable mat of organic material.
P re-vegetated mats are made of coir or other slowly degradable material and can
use many types of plants. They come
in many sizes and materials and are moved
and
installed
in one
piece. They are generally
1.2 m by 2.4 m
in
size
for easy
handling. Vegetated mats are grown in nurseries for upto a year or more to provide
a good plant stand. Thin mats can be rolled up and shipped without special packing.
Thick mats are handled with heavy equipment because of their weight. Mats are
usually used
in wetland or lakeshore environments, so wetland plants are the most
common.
6.5
Interplanting Rip-Rap
Rip-rap is often used to protect stream banks and lakeshores. Live cuttings can be
interplanted in rip-rap to provide additional slope stability. Root growth below the rip-
rap
will improve
soil strength and
live vegetation
will hide the rocks, presenting a
more natural look.
6.6
Staking
Staking
is used extensively
in bioengineering
practice. Stakes can be
live or dry.
Live staking
is often done with willows to stabilise soil or to stake other materials
in
place. Manufactured timber stakes, 0.6 to 1.0 m
long, are used to secure wattles
and coir fascines. Timber stakes for upland application need to have a bias, or angle
cut, making
it easier to install. For wetland or streamside applications, stakes need
straight parallel sides to prevent heaving from water pressure.
Live cuttings should be soaked
in cold water for at least 24 hours before they are
used. This not only provides the cuttings with needed moisture but also improves
rooting.
Live potted plants are often used. Care
of
live plants before and during
planting
is critical for success. Live plants raised indoors need to be acclimatised to
the outdoor environment before planting.
6.7
Effectiveness of Bioengineering Techniques
Bioengineering can be
effective
in many stream
bank,
lakeshore and
hill
slope
erosion situations, but
it will not solve
all soil erosion or slope failure problems. The
29



======================================================================
PAGE 38 of 48
======================================================================
IRC:56-2011
success of a project hinges on many factors including proper design, plant selection,
proper installation, weather conditions and outside factors
like animal damage. Site
evaluation
is important to determine whether there
is adequate sunlight,
soil type
and water quality to support vigorous plant growth. Bioengineering solutions may not
be successful
in submerged areas or
in geologically unstable
sites. Nor are they
ideal for high stress areas with severe wave action, rapid or long-term water level
fluctuations or at locations where flow of water is very fast. The following
list includes
tips that may help ensure a successful bioengineering project.
Bioengineering solutions are not to be attempted in situations where:
a)
There is severe soil or water contamination
b)
The stream bottom is degrading
c)
Locations
where human
or
animal
traffic
at
the
site
cannot
be
controlled; or
d)
There is too much shade for selected plant species to thrive.
Further,
it
should
be
noted
that,
in
case
of
river bank
protection,
while
using
bioengineering techniques, water elevation
is the most critical element for successful
installation. Records of normal, high and low water elevations for the
site must be
available at any particular site. The seasonal changes
in water elevation and how
rapidly
these
changes
occur
must
also
be
known.
Before
implementing
bioengineering measures, one must be sure to fence out animals and people,
if
needed.
If the plants are damaged, supplemental planting may be necessary. An
awareness
of flood
or drought conditions
that could impact
installation must be
there. Severe weather
will reduce seedling
survival. Sometimes a combination
of
various
practices
is found
to be very
effective and has been adopted
at many
locations. There is a need to provide regular monitoring and maintenance, especially
in the first year, to assure adequate plant survival. There
is also need to involve the
proper design professionals and botanical/agronomy experts to provide information
on
hydrology,
plantings and
structural
design. A
multi-disciplinary approach
will
assure success.
7 SLOPES IN COHESIONLESS SOILS
In a purely cohesionless
soil,
it
is rather
difficult to establish vegetation. Even
if
it
were
possible,
the sand
grains in-between
the network
of root-system
are most
susceptible
of being 'piped our or washed
out', since the distant roots can hardly
30



======================================================================
PAGE 39 of 48
======================================================================
IRC:56-2011
afford
resistance
to the movement
of
individual
grains
at
tine
surface. Once the
movement starts,
it can become progressively unconfined and
is most liable to 'flow'.
The remedial treatment is therefore to provide 25 cm to 30 cm thick clayey soil (but
not heavy clays) as a blanket covering the slopes of the embankment, tamp
it well
on
the
slopes
and
subsequently
provide
the
simple
vegetative
treatment
/'
recommended
in
Section
5.1.
Alternatively,
root mat systems
like 3-D
mats
or
'
geocells can also be used in case of cohesionless soils.
8 SLOPES IN BLACK COTTON SOILS
Invariably,
there does
not appear
to be any need
for
special treatment
against
erosion on black cotton soil slopes, since this type of soil promotes natural growth of
grass and other types of vegetation. The main problem seems to be the formation of
shrinkage cracks. Therefore,
it is recommended that these slopes may be managed
with the simple method of providing vegetative turfing
if the natural growth of grass
happens
to
be
inadequate.
Artificial
watering
can
be
resorted
to
if
there
are
economic means of procuring water,
in the eventuality of the
rainfall proving to be
very scanty and
in
the event
of the work having
to be
carried
out beyond
the
monsoon season. Vetiver planting and any other suitable method can also be taken
up on these slopes.
9 SELECTION OF EROSION CONTROL METHOD
The
following
suggestions may be
generally
kept
in
view
for
adopting
suitable
method of erosion control for soil slopes:
a)
Developing vegetation cover would be the best method to prevent
soil
erosion.
This
may
be
attempted
by
using
'Simple
Turfing
Method'. At locations where turfing
is to be achieved within a short
time period, transplantation of readymade turfs can be tried.
b)
Organic mulch application (either manually or by using hydroseeding)
can
be
adopted
to
aid
simple
vegetative
turfing.
By
using
hydroseeding method, inaccessible and near vertical slopes can be
successfully vegetated and hydroseeding method can be used
in
combination with nettings/ mats to make them even more effective.
c)
At locations where simple turfing method cannot ensure vegetation
cover,
natural
fibre
based
netting
can
be
adopted
to
support
vegetation growth. When the site
is located
in a drought prone area
and
it is difficult to sustain green cover throughout the year, synthetic
geogrids can be adopted to provide long term protection.
31



======================================================================
PAGE 40 of 48
======================================================================
IRC:56-2011
d)
Where vegetation cover alone is insufficient and soil surface needs to
be protected
in the absence of vegetation cover
in certain patches,
root reinforcing geosynthetic systems (3-D mats or geocells) can be
used.
Depending
upon
the
duration
for which
protection needed
(short term - 2
to 3 years or for longer term),
either natural
fibre
based or polymer based 3-D mats can be adopted. For slope heights
more than 5 m, root reinforcing systems would be better suited.
e)
For slopes
in the waterfront having velocity of flow
in excess of 3
m/sec or having wave
uplift effect, having inundation or continuous
flooding
for many
days,
slope
protection
system
as
indicated
in
Section 5.11
shall be resorted
to. For floodable slope with
siity clay
type of
soil, combination of rip-rap and geogrids may be used upto
high flood level and for the remaining slope portion geogrid may be
used.
Should
occasional
flooding
is envisaged
in
slope
laid
with
geogrid,
appropriate
plant species which can
survive under short
term submergence shall be chosen.
In general, suggestions which may be kept
in view while selecting the appropriate
methodology for erosion control are given in Table 2.

Slope Erosion Protection Using Gabions and Mattresses
With mechanically woven double twisted steel wire mesh products such as Gabions,
it is possible to construct flexible structures that effectively sustain the eroding slope
and also preserve their natural
look, thus providing eco~compatible solutions. The
hexagonal shape of the mesh provides a better distribution of the working tensions
along the wires that form the mesh. Double twist avoids spreading of the damage
caused by the accidental breaking of any wire. The steel wire shall either be heavily
zinc
coated
or
zinc
plus PVC
coated
to
provide
adequate
protection
against
corrosion. Steel wire mesh Gabions and Revet Mattresses should conform to ASTM
specification A 975 or ISO 7989 and ISO 22034. Gabion baskets are also made
using welding
process.
While such welded
wire mesh
gabions do
not possess
flexibility as compared to woven wire mesh gabions, welded wire mesh gabions can
be made to any convenient size and also their protective coating thickness can be
easily varied.

Gabions
Gabions are rectangular wire mesh baskets filled with rock at the project site to form
flexible,
permeable,
monolithic
structures. They
are made
of hexagonal shaped
double twisted
steel woven wire mesh,
with high mechanical
characteristics. The
gabion is divided into cells by means of diaphragms positioned at approximately
1 m
centres. The steel wire used
in the manufacture of the gabion shall be coated with
zinc or zinc and polymeric coated for protection from corrosion.
In order to reinforce
the
structure,
all mesh
panel edges are selvedged
with a wire having a greater
diameter. With 30 per cent voids, gabion structures
offer free drainage providing
higher bank stability when used for river bank protection.

Gabions are provided on the eroding slopes at suitable locations to prevent the soil
from moving down the slope and thus protecting the slope. Gabions can be used for
construction of protection structures
like toe walls or breast walls. They serve both
purposes
of
protecting the slope from
being eroded and
provide
stability
to the
slope,
if the slope is unstable.
Gabion Mattress
Gabion mattress also known
revet mattresses,
is a special form
of gabion with a
large plan area/thickness ratio.
It is fabricated from a similar but smaller double-twist
hexagonal mesh to that used to manufacture the gabions. Diaphragms are spaced
usually at
1 .00 m centres, and a continuous panel of mesh forms the base, the side
and the end walls of the
unit to obtain the open-topped multicellular container.
All
panel's edges are selvedged with a wire of larger diameter than that used for the
mesh, so as to strengthen the structure.
These are used as mattresses on the slope to protect the bank from erosion. Gabion
mattresses can be sealed by hot poured sand asphalt mastic,
in order to provide an
impermeable revetment. These are mainly used
for
riveting the slopes and thus
prevent erosion of the slope.

Gabions made from Polymeric IVIaterials
Gabions and revet mattresses can be made using polymeric materials also. Such
materials can be easily used
in saline waters also. However, such type of gabions
may not be able to
retain the intended shape as effectively as compared to steel
wire gabions.
