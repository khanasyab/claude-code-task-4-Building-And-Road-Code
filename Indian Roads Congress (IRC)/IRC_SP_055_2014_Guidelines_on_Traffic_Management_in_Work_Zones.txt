GUIDELINES ON TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT IN WORK ZONES
SECTION
1
INTRODUCTION
The Guidelines on Safety
in Road Construction Zones; IRC:SP:55 was
first published by
Indian Roads Congress
in 2001. Since then, there has been development
in road safety
materials & technology. Therefore, a need was felt to bring out revised version of Guidelines to
include latest technology of Traffic Management and Road Safety Aspect during construction.
Accordingly, the work of revision of these Guidelines was taken up by the Transport Planning,
Traffic Engineering and Road Safety Committee (H-1) during the tenure 2009-2011 under
Convenorship of Shri S.C Sharma. The first draft of revised document was prepared by the
Sub-group comprising Shri
D.P. Gupta,
Dr. Geetam Tiwari, Ms. Nimisha
Pal,
Shri Sudhir
Kumar,
Dr. M. Parida,
Dr. Surinder Mohan, and Shri Pawan Kumar Singh. This draft was
discussed in various meetings of H-1 Committee during the tenure 2009-2011
.
The H-1 Committee was reconstituted in 2012 and was renamed as Transport Planning and
Traffic Engineering Committee. The reconstituted H-1 formed a new sub-group comprising
Shri A.P. Bahadur Prof. P.K. Sikdar, Dr. T.S. Reddy, Dr. S. Velmurugan and Mr. Jacob George.
The draft prepared by the Sub-group was discussed
in various meetings of H-1 Committee
and the document was subsequently approved by the H-1 Committee
in
its meeting held
on 23.3.2013 for placing before the HSS Committee. The same draft was placed before
the Highways Specifications and Standards Committee (HSS) during
its meeting held on
19
th July, 2013 and the HSS Committee approved
this document subject to modifications
in
light of comments of members offered during the meeting. The Executive Committee
in
its meeting held on 31
st July, 2013 approved the same document for placing
it before the
Council. The Council
in
its 200
th meeting held at New Delhi on
11
th and 12
th August, 2013
approved the
draft "Guidelines on
Traffic Management
in Work Zones"
(First Revision)"
subject to modifications
in the light of comments offered during the meeting and authorized
Convener of HSS Committee to finalize the document for printing.
The composition of the H-1 Committee is as given below:

1.1
Background
The road
construction and maintenance
activities are the
integral
part of road network
development particularly for developing and transitional economies. Improving and expanding
the roadway network
is critical to economic development as well as the quality of life and,
these activities create work zones
in the network. The road work zones are areas of conflict
between
normal
operating
traffic,
construction
workers,
road
building
machineries and
construction
traffic.
If
it
is a construction of new road, normal operating
traffic
will not be
there but the care has to be taken to avoid and or remove conflicts between workers and
construction machineries and construction traffic. Problem becomes more serious
if
it is an
urban road with significant proportion of vulnerable road users.
Work zone accidents are caused by several factors such as frequently changing environment
that occurs during road work whereby the driver is often surprised, insufficient warning signs for
normal and construction traffic, lack of audible warning to workers and, inadequate provisions
of safety devices to protect workers. At most work zones, normal traffic
is never more than
1 5 meters away from construction activities. Major contributing factors to work zone accidents

======================================================================
IRC:SP:55-2014
are not paying sufficient attention, going too fast for the prevailing conditions, failure to yield
the right-of-way and, following too close. An ideal way to reduce work zone accidents
is to
create a working area that does not influence the normal
traffic flow by segregating and
shielding the site.
Massive road building and development
is being taken up in India, under various schemes,
such as National Highway Development Project (NHDP) and Prime Minister's Rural Road
Development Schemes (PMGSY). Activities of improvement of about 45,000 kms of National
Highways and around 400,000 kms of rural roads besides numerous urban roads are going
on,
all across the country. To ensure safety of all, there
is a need to adopt an efficient and
effective plan for management of traffic in work zones. Work Zone Traffic Management Plans
(WTMPs) are required to meet the safety needs of regular traffic as well as works
traffic,
ensuring minimum disruption in access to properties and movement of pedestrians.
This document provides appropriate guidance and examples of best practice to improve the
safety for all those who could be affected by work zones. These guidelines do not prohibit
the use of new methods or devices provided that sufficient technical data is submitted to the
Road Authority to demonstrate that the new method or device
is equivalent and or better in
quality, effectiveness, durability, and safety compliance as specified in these guidelines.
1 .2
Purpose of Work Zone Traffic Management Plans (WTMPs)
The primary purpose of the Work Zone Traffic Management Plans (WTMPs) is to provide for
the reasonably safe and efficient movement of road users through or around the work zones
while reasonably protecting the workers and equipment. When the normal function of the
roadway
is affected with the presence of workers and equipment, the WTMP provides for
continuity of the movement for motor vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic, transit operations,
and access to properties and utilities.
It is equally important to ensure the safety of workers in Work Zones, who perform the varied
tasks within the work space. Work zones present constantly changing conditions that are
not expected by the road users, which creates an even higher degree of vulnerability for
the workers present near the roadway. A concurrent objective of the WTMP
is the efficient
construction and maintenance of the highway, as well as efficient resolution of traffic incidents,
if any, likely to occur in the work zone. The WTMP, therefore, should facilitate the smooth and
efficient flow of traffic as well as safe working environment.
1 .3
Who Should Prepare WTMPs?
One set of WTMPs cannot satisfy
all conditions of a work zone, and defining
all possible
applications also may not be practically possible. Therefore, typical applications that depict
common deployment of devices are described and illustrated
in these guidelines. The site
specific Work zone Traffic Management Plan would have to be prepared and implemented
with concurrence of road authority. The WTMP selected for each situation would depend on
the category of highway, geographical location, road user categories, physical constraints,
and the distance/separation from the working space coupled with duration of operation.
3



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 136
======================================================================
IRC:SP:55-2014
WTMPs should be prepared by persons knowledgeable and experienced with respect to
the fundamental principles of road safety, and the road work activities to be performed. The
officer/engineer handling the task of preparing the WTMPs
is required to be trained and
certified. The design of the layout and selection and placement of traffic control devices for a
WTMP would involve careful assessment of their effectiveness and considerable amount of
judgment from traffic engineering and safety considerations.
1 .4
What Can Make WTMPs Effective?
Improved road user performance can be better achieved through a well-prepared WTMP. The
efforts towards publicity giving the nature of the work, the time and duration of its execution,
the anticipated effects upon road users, and possible alternate routes and modes of travel are
also important. Such programs would result in a significant reduction in the traffic conflicts.
The WTMP should be considered at the planning phase and continue through the design,
construction, and restoration phases. Implementation of WTMPs shall be the responsibility of
the road authority or a public body having jurisdiction over the work zone. The road authority
through
its Concessionaire/Contractor shall have statutory right for the implementation and
enforcement of needed regulations and
controls, speed zoning, and the management of
traffic. Proper training of workers
is necessary for effective implementation. Such statutory
rights
shall provide
sufficient
flexibility
in the application
of WTMP to meet the needs of
changing conditions in the work zone.
1 .5
Judicious Application of WTMPs
The principles described herein should be judiciously applied to both rural and urban roads.
It would depend upon the hierarchy and type of road such as Expressways,
dual/single
carriageway National Highways, secondary/tertiary roads, urban arterial or access road. A
rural National Highway would normally have higher speeds, fewer turning conflicts, and less
conflict with pedestrians. An urban road or street
is typically characterized by relatively low
speeds, wide ranges of road user, varying traffic volumes, narrower roadway lanes, frequent
intersections and property accesses,
significant pedestrian
activity, and more businesses
and houses.
In these guidelines, the process of preparation and implementation of the WTMPs are also
included
to
help
in deciding the
responsibilities and functions
of the people
involved
in
managing the work zone operations and safety.
1 .6
Legal Aspects of WTMPs
Motor Vehicles Act 1988 provides the legal backing for erection of traffic signs and for traffic
operations on roads. Most of the construction and maintenance activities (except for short term
maintenance activities performed departmentally) in India are performed through contracts
signed between road authority and Contractor/Concessionaire. These contract/Concession
agreements signed between public authorities and private firms have their legal bases.
4



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 136
======================================================================
IRC:SP:55-2014
Normal
contracts are generally governed by FIDIC Conditions
of Contract which
cover,
besides other aspects, safety aspects
in construction
activities. For projects under Public
Private Partnership (PPP), the Model Concession Agreement and its Schedule L provides for
safety requirements for project development and construction.
Building
and
Other
Construction
Workers
(Regulation
of Employment and
Conditions
of Service) Act
1996,
the
Factories Act,
1948,
Central Rules
1998,
Building and Other
Construction Workers' Welfare Cess Act, 1996 are the legal provisions governing the safety
and welfare of construction workers in India.
The policy
is to keep the closure of the roads to a minimum and to ensure that traffic
is
delayed as
little as possible by the construction operations. Highest regard
is to be given
to traffic safety as well as to provide a safe working environment to the workmen. Before
starting the construction work, which
will influence traffic, the Contractor (Concessionaire,
in cases of projects with private sector participation) has to get the legal permission of the
road/traffic authority and local police about the means and extent of securing the construction
zone. The traffic management strategies to be used at construction zones should ensure that
traffic safety is an integral and high priority element of the project.

Advance Warning
Zone
Advance Warning Zone
is the section of the road
in which the road
users are warned
in advance about the presence of work zone ahead
and prepare them for the change in driving conditions.
Advance Warning
Length (AWL)
The Advance Warning Length (AWL)
is the road
stretch
(which
is
actually the Advance Warning Zone) in which series of warning signs
are placed and the length depends upon the approach speed.
It
is
the distance between first sign indicating the presence of road works
ahead to the start of the Approach Transition Zone.
Alternate
One-Way
Operations

the Right of Way is allowed to be used alternatively by the traffic moving
in one direction and then for the opposing directions, either with the
help of flag men or traffic signal.
Approach
Longitudinal
Buffer (ALB)
Approach
Longitudinal
Buffer
(ALB)
is

Length (ATL)
The Approach Taper Length (ATL)
is the length
in which the
traffic
is redirected from their normal path to a path parallel to work space
and the length
is directly proportional to the rate of taper, which also
depends upon the operating speed.
Arrow Boards
Arrow Boards are the static or dynamic signs with a matrix of elements
capable of either flashing or sequential displays. The Arrow Boards
provide
additional
warning
and
directional
guidance
to
assist
in
merging or diverging, and also to control the movement of the road
users through or around a work zone.

SECTION 3
PRINCIPLES OF WORK ZONE TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PLANS
3.1
Basic Principles of WTMP
The basic safety principles governing the design of roadways should also govern the design
of Work Zones Traffic Management Plans (WTMPs). While designing the WTMP,
all care
needs to be taken so that anyone coming along the road or the footpath from any direction
understands exactly what is happening and what is expected of him/her.
The aim should be to facilitate the passage of road users through such work zones using
roadway geometries, roadside features, and Traffic Control (TC) devices comparable to those
for normal highway operations. Thus, road user movement should be free from any hazard
with the following aspects in view:
•
WTMP at work sites should be designed on the assumption that drivers will
only reduce their speeds
if they clearly perceive a need to do so. Frequent
and abrupt changes
in geometries such as lane narrowing, dropped lanes,
or main roadway
transitions,
that
require
rapid maneuvers, need
to be
avoided.
•
Provisions should be made for the safe operation of work,
particularly on

3.2
Planning of WTMP
The
planning
and
designing
of WTMP
should
be
based
on some
of
the
important
considerations.
3.2.1
Provide safety for road users and workers
Safety provisions governing the design of road works should be followed, and a detailed
traffic control and management plan should be developed
in consultation with concerned
stakeholders.
It is important to maintain a continuously safe working environment and also to
maintain the work zone safety devices in every phase of the work. This should include using
basic safety principles governing the design of permanent roadways, and should consider
the needs of all road users (pedestrians, bicyclists, non motorized vehicles, cars and trucks,
etc.).
In urban areas,
particular consideration
is necessary for vulnerable road users, as
well as the needs of public transport and delivery vehicles and users.
It should warn road
users
in advance of the changing road environment; inform road users of the condition to
be encountered; guide road users through unusual sections of road; provide control for road
users at conflict points; and forgive road users' mistakes when accidents happen.
3.2.2
Minimize hindrance or delay to road users
The traffic control and management plan must assume that drivers will reduce speeds
if they
perceive a clear need to do so. A WTMP should be designed so that vehicles can reasonably
safely
travel through
the Temporary
Traffic Control (TTC) zone with
a speed
reduction
appropriate for the location. However, whatever speed limit is chosen and implemented,
it is
absolutely imperative that these are enforced. Experience has shown that to be effective and
to ensure they do not lose credibility with drivers, there must be a programme of enforcement.
Speed cameras are quite effective as they give drivers the opportunity to modify their behaviour
even
if they speed past the first camera. The key consideration
is to have the appropriate
speed for the prevailing conditions.
Abrupt, unrecognizable changes to lane position or roadway transition should be avoided,
and work should be scheduled to minimize the need for alternate routing. To avoid peak
periods - night work,
if carefully managed, can be a good way to accomplish this. For optimal
safety considerations, diversion of traffic to alternative routes that do not include the work
zones be examined and resorted to. On high speed roads, consideration should be given to
assess whether
it
is appropriate to close entrance ramps
in a grade separator. Pedestrian
and bicyclist movements must be considered.
3.2.3
Provide clear and positive guidance to road users
Appropriate warning, delineation, and channelization will ensure that road users have a good
understanding of what is happening and what is expected of them-minimizing the chance of
errors.
17



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 136
======================================================================
IRC:SP:55-2014
3.2.4
Ensure roadside safety maintenance
It
is important to make sure that there
is a roadside recovery area (clear zone), although
difficult to manage
in some work zones,
particularly for disabled vehicle and emergency
situations. Road worker's vehicles and equipment should NOT be stored
in this area, and
it
should not be used for material or debris from the work site.
3.2.5
Ensure that planners and decision makers have the necessary knowledge
Only those individuals who are trained in proper safe practices and have an understanding of
safe work zone principles should be permitted to plan and design TMPs.
3.2.6
Provide good public relations
Traffic enforcement should be considered as part of the planning process, and emergency
service providers should be consulted when developing the plan. News media can be of great
assistance in these tasks. Road Authorities should plan and set up the system for informing
the users regarding planned work zones through
print,
electronic media and pamphlets.
Providing the public with appropriate information about an upcoming work zone, possible
alternate transportation means and routes, and expected delays and duration will assist in
minimizing the inconvenience to the road users.
3.3
Primary Features of WTMP
The following
features
of the WTMP should be given adequate
attention
for achieving
maximum safety and efficiency
in
traffic operations,
involving the movement of men and
material in work zones.
•
Required appropriate warning,
delineation, and channelization should be
provided to assist in guiding road users in advance of and through the work
zone by using proper pavement marking, signing, or other devices that are
effective under varying conditions.
Providing information that
is
in usable
formats by pedestrians with visual disabilities should also be considered and
provided for.
•
Provisions
for
effective
continuity
of
accessible
circulation
paths
for
pedestrians should be incorporated
in temporary traffic management plan
where existing pedestrian routes are blocked or detoured, information should
be provided about alternative routes that are usable by pedestrians with
disabilities,
particularly those who have visual disabilities. Before any new
detour or temporary route is opened to traffic,
all necessary signs shall be in
place.
©
Access to temporary bus stops, reasonably safe travel across intersections
with
accessible
pedestrian
signals, and
other
routing
issues should be
considered where temporary pedestrian
routes are channelized.
Barriers
and channelizing devices that are detectable by people with visual disabilities
should be provided.

Traffic
control
devices
inconsistent
with
intended
travel
paths
through
the work zones should be removed or covered. As the work progresses,
temporary traffic controls and/or working conditions should be modified
in
order to provide reasonably safe and efficient road user movement and to
provide worker safety. Providing traffic control devices that are accessible to
and usable by pedestrians with disabilities should be considered.
Flagging
procedures, when
used,
should
provide
positive
guidance
to
road users traversing the work zone. Procedures of flagging the traffic are
separately explained.
Professionals who are knowledgeable, trained and/or certified in the principles
of proper traffic control should be assigned responsibility for safety
in work
zones. The most important duty of these
individuals should be
to check
that
all
traffic control devices of the project are reasonably consistent with
the traffic management plan and are effective
in providing reasonably safe
conditions for motorists, bicyclists, pedestrians, and workers.
Work zones should be carefully monitored under varying conditions of road
user behavior,
traffic volumes,
light, and weather conditions, to check that
applicable traffic control devices are effective, clearly visible, clean, and
in
compliance with the traffic management plan.
Coordination should be made between adjacent or overlapping projects to
check that duplicate signing
is not used and to check compatibility of traffic
control between adjacent or overlapping projects.
When warranted, an engineering study should be made in cooperation with
law enforcement
officials
of reported crashes occurring
within
the
traffic
control zone. Crash records
in traffic control zones should be monitored to
identify the need for changes in the work zone.
To accommodate run-off-the-road incidents, disabled vehicles, or emergency
situations, unencumbered roadside recovery areas or clear zones should be
provided where practical.
As part of the WTMP, the Contractor/Concessionaire to keep and maintain
crane facilities to tow away any disabled vehicle promptly from the work zone
area.
Work equipment, workers' private vehicles, materials, and debris should be
stored
in such a manner to reduce the probability of being impacted by run-
off-the-road vehicles.
Only those professionals who are trained
in proper traffic control practices
and have a basic understanding of the principles, established by applicable
standards
and
guidelines,
including
those
of
these
guidelines,
should
supervise the selection, placement, and maintenance of traffic control devices
used for work zones.

All TC devices shall be removed as soon as
practical when they are no
longer needed. When work
is suspended for short periods of time,
traffic
control devices that are no longer appropriate shall be removed or covered.
3.4
Requirements of Work Zone Traffic Management Plan
A WTMP should describe
traffic control measures to be used for facilitating the safe and
efficient movement of road users through a work zone. WTMP should play a
vital
role
in
providing reasonably safe and efficient road traffic flow for all road users when a work zone
temporarily disrupts normal traffic flow.
•
WTMPs may range
in scope from being very detailed to simply referring to
typical drawings contained in these guidelines or specific drawings contained
in the contract documents. The degree of detail in the TMPs depends entirely
on the nature and complexity of the works to be implemented.
•
WTMPs should be prepared by professionals, knowledgeable (for example,
trained and/or certified) about the fundamental
principles of safety,
traffic
control measures and work activities to be performed. The design, selection
and placement of
traffic control devices
for a TMP should be based on
engineering judgment.
•
The planning for traffic control for the work zone should be completed for all
highway construction,
utility work, maintenance operations, including minor
maintenance and
utility projects prior to occupying the work zone. Planning
for all road users should be included in the process.
3.5
WTMP in Urban Areas
Sn urban situations, where road works are to be carried out, more attention
should be given to the problems of pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles
in places where heavy traffic volumes are involved. As far as possible, the
road works should be carried out at night, and whenever night time road
repairs are not possible, then only day time repairs should be carried out.
Repairs during peak hours should also be avoided.
•
Road users should be channelized and routed through and around the area
under repair with minimum of delays. Driver behavior should be effectively
influenced so that the speeds are reduced to desired levels on approaches
to construction zones. The traffic control and construction activity should be
coordinated in such a manner as to provide for safe and efficient flow of traffic
together with safe, efficient and rapid progress of construction activity.
•
As pedestrians are
likely to be present at urban construction
sites, there
must always be safety or buffer zone between the outer pedestrian barrier
and the traffic.
20



======================================================================
PAGE 31 of 136
======================================================================
IRC:SP:55-2014
•
Availability of proper sight distance
for the movement of vehicles
at the
recommended speed for the stretch in the work zone should always be kept
in the mind.
3.6
WTMP in Project Development
There are five phases of WTMP for major projects:
•
Planning Phase
- To identify and include traffic control requirements, work
program and method of construction in the contract specification.
•
Design Phase - To design the Traffic Management Plan in detail, with regard
to types, location and layout of traffic control devices for submission to the
road authority for approval.
•
Implementation Phase - To install the temporary traffic control devices safely
in accordance with the approved Traffic Management Plan.
•
Operation and Maintenance Phase - To inspect the Traffic Management Plan
and devices regularly both
in day and night to ensure that they are effective
and absolutely safe.
o
Close out Phase
- To remove all the temporary traffic control devices safely
and reinstate the permanent traffic control scheme.

SECTION 4
TEMPORARY TRAFFIC CONTROL ZONES
4.1
Introduction
A work zone
is an area of a highway where road user operating conditions are changed
because
of construction and maintenance
activities. The
construction and maintenance
activities would involve movement of workers and construction equipment requiring dedicated
space for performing the activities and moving materials for the activities. The presence of
regular traffic and works traffic makes the work zone a potential zone of conflict resulting
in disruption
to normal
traffic and hazards. A work zone
is typically distinguished by the
presence of signs, channelizing devices, barriers, pavement markings, and/or work vehicles.
It extends from the first warning sign or high-intensity rotating flashing or oscillating or strobe
lights installed on roadside or a vehicle-mounted sign posted to indicate the work zone, and
continues to delineate the channelized vehicle paths
till up to the end road work sign.
4.2
Elements of Temporary Traffic Control Zone
The elements of Temporary Traffic Control Zone are
©
Advance warning zone
•
Approach transition zone
•
Activity zone
•
Terminal transition zone
•
Work zone end zone
Suggested
lengths
for Temporary
Traffic Control Zone
for
different speeds are given
in
Table 4.1 and illustrated
in Fig. 4.1. The normal posted speed of the highway shall be the
speed at the start of each traffic control zones. For example, the speed at the start of advance
warning zone shall be the approach speed of highway and length of the advance warning
length shall be chosen based on this approach speed. However, the speed to be considered
for taper rate or the radius of circular curve at the diversion shall be dictated by the geometric
properties of these elements, as traffic is expected to reduce the speed as they are adequately
warned through number of signs.
4.2.1
Advance warning zone
The "Advance Warning Zone"
is the area to warn the road user of the approaching hazard
and to prepare them for the change in driving conditions.
It should provide information on:
•
The presence of the hazard through the "Men at Work" sign, accompanied
by the distance to the hazard;
Any change affecting traffic arrangements (such as a reduction in the number
of lanes and/or in the speed limit) within the traffic control zone;

•
Extent of the hazard (for example; the length of restriction);
•
The type of hazard etc.
The advance warning zone
is where the reduction
in speed of vehicles should be notified.
The drivers should be advised to reduce their speed so as to achieve the desired speed of
transition zone. The information
in this zone
is conveyed through a series of traffic signs
along the length of the zone. Typical distances for placement of advance warning signs for
various approach speeds are also given in Table 4.1.
4.2.2
Approach transition zone
The transition zone
is that section of highway where road users are redirected from their
normal path, where the regular traffic
is guided to deviate from their normal path of travel
through this zone. Lateral shifting of moving vehicle from the normal pathway can be achieved
by strategic use of tapers or with circular curves.
The rate of taper and Approach Taper Length (ATL) for a few sample width are presented
in Table 4.1, where the speed reduction
is expected from the approach speed at the start
of taper,
and
it is illustrated
in Fig. 4.1.
If diversion
is achieved through circular curves, the
radii of the curves to be inserted between two tangents are also presented
in Table 4.1,
and shown pictorially in Fig. 4.1. The values suggested for curve radii will be applicable for
layouts of median crossovers. Tapers are created by using a series of channelizing devices
and/or pavement markings to move traffic out of or into the normal path.
4.2.3
Activity zone
The activity zone is the section of the highway where the construction activity takes place.
It
comprises the work space, the traffic space, and the buffer space.
Work Space
: The work space
is that portion of the highway closed to road users and set
aside for workers, equipment, and material. Work spaces are usually delineated for road
users by channelizing devices or to exclude vehicles and pedestrians in the work space by
temporary barriers. The work space may be stationary or may move as work progresses, and
therefore, the length of the work space may vary.
Traffic Space
: The traffic space is the portion of the highway in which road users are routed
through the activity zone. This space should be determined and designed keeping
in mind
the traffic expected to move through the activity zone.
Buffer Space
: The buffer space
is a lateral and/or longitudinal length/width that separates
the normal
traffic flow from the work space or an unsafe area, and might include some
recovery space for an errant vehicle. Neither work activity nor storage of equipment, vehicles,
or material should occur within a
buffer space.
Buffer spaces may be positioned
either
longitudinally or laterally with respect to the direction of traffic flow. The activity area may
contain one or more lateral or longitudinal buffer spaces. A longitudinal buffer space may be
placed
in advance of a work space. The lateral buffer space may be used to separate the
traffic space from the work space, as shown in Fig. 4.1, or at such areas as excavations or
25



======================================================================
PAGE 36 of 136
======================================================================
IRC:SP:55-2014
pavement-edge drop-offs. A lateral buffer space also may be used between two travel lanes,
especially those carrying opposing flows. The minimum values for various passing speed for
Approach Longitudinal Buffer, Exit Longitudinal Buffer and Lateral Buffer Space are given in
Table 4.1
. Placing of work zone at closer intervals will always be inconvenient for road users,
and hence the desirable distance between two work zones are given in Table 4.1
, which may
be maintained, as far as possible. However, at unavoidable situations, the distances given for
exceptional cases can be adopted subject to the approval of competent authority.
4.2.4
Terminal transition zone
In the terminal transition zone, the traffic will be redirected from the deviated path to their
normal path through the transition zone, which also can be achieved through tapering or
through circular curves.
The
rate of taper and Terminal Taper Length (TTL)
for a few sample width
of
shift are
presented
in Table 4.1.
In the terminal transition, a lower value than the approach transition
can be adopted as the traffic plying through a temporary diversion should be already at lower
operating speed than on normal approach road. The lateral shifts by tapering and by circular
curves are presented in Fig. 4.1. Channelizing devices and/or pavement markings should be
used to bring traffic back to the normal path.
4.2.5
Work zone end
The work zone end length shall extend from the end of terminal taper length to the last traffic
control device such as sign showing the end of road work,
if posted. An end road work sign,
a speed
limit sign, or other signs may be used to inform road users that they can resume
normal operations.

SECTION 5
TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES
5
Types of Devices
Traffic
Control
(TC)
devices
include
appurtenances
such
as
signs,
signals,
flashers,
delineators, markings, barriers and other devices used to regulate, warn, or guide road users,
and normally placed on, over, or adjacent to a street, highway, pedestrian facility, or cycle track
by the engineer responsible for managing the traffic operations efficiently and safely in the
work zones. All traffic control devices used on street and highway construction, maintenance,
utility laying or repair, shall conform to the applicable provisions of these guidelines. Traffic
control devices are broadly classified into three categories, and these are discussed
in the
following subsections.
•
Road Signs
•
Channelizing Devices
•
Lighting Devices & Variable Message Signs
5.1
Road Signs
Work zone signs convey both general and specific messages by means of words or symbols
and have the same three categories as in normal highway, viz.
(i) regulatory;
(ii) warning; and
(iii) informatory/guide signs.
The construction zones require more signs than that being used for normal highway to convey
site conditions. The regulatory sign to be used
in temporary traffic management plans are
subdivided as Normal Regulatory (NR) sign and Work zone Regulatory (WR) signs. Those
regulatory signs adopted
directly from IRC:67-2012 are grouped under normal regulatory
signs, and those regulatory signs specifically prepared and included
in
this guideline for
traffic management plan for work zones, are grouped under work zone regulatory signs. The
colour of normal regulatory signs
will be same as that given
in IRC:67-2012, whereas the
color of work zone regulatory signs shall be of white texts/arrows/borders on red background.
The warning signs are also classified as normal warning sign and work zone warning signs.
Normal Warning (NW) signs are those taken from IRC:67-201 2. In order to retain the familiarity
among the road users, the shape of the normal warning signs used
in work zone shall be
triangular, but
in yellow background for better conspicuity and to distinguish that the road

In business, commercial, and residential districts where parking and/or bicycle or pedestrian
movement
is
likely to occur, or where there are other obstructions to view, the distance
between the bottom edge of the sign and the top of the near edge of the traveled way shall be
at least 2.1 m. Neither portable nor permanent sign supports should be located on footpath,
bicycle facilities, or areas designated for pedestrian or bicycle traffic so that no obstruction is
caused in their movements.
Signs mounted on portable supports may be placed within the roadway
itself. Signs may
also be mounted on or above barricades. Typical mounting of signs on barricades is shown
in
Fig.
5.3. The signs mounted on barricades and
barricade/sign combinations
shall be
crash worthy. Signs mounted on barricades, or other portable supports, shall be no less than
0.3 m above the traveled way. Signs mounted on Type
III barricades should not cover more
than 50 percent of the top two rails or 33 percent of the total area of the three rails.

The Annexure
III and Plate
III of IRC:67-2012 lay the principles for designing various sign
boards involving texts in English, Hindi or other regional languages and arrows like the Work
Zone Regulatory Signs, Work zone Warning Signs and Information Signs. The sign boards
shall be designed for English and Hindi or other regional languages as appropriate for the
location.
5.1 .4
Regulatory signs
The regulatory signs to be used in work zones are subdivided as normal regulatory signs and
work zones specific regulatory sign. Regulatory signs are to instruct road users of traffic laws
or regulations and to indicate the applicability of legal requirements that would not otherwise
be apparent. For ensuring legibility and emphasis at night, the signs shall be retro-reflective
30



======================================================================
PAGE 41 of 136
======================================================================
IRC:SP:55-2014
of at least Grade Type
III,
i.e. high intensity grade conforming to 801
of Specifications for
Roads & Bridges, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. The material shall be smooth,
sealed outer surface or illuminated so as to depict the same shape and similar color for both
day and night. Sign illumination may be either internal or external and the sign boards may
be made of rigid or flexible material.
If a Temporary
Traffic
Control
(TTC) zone
requires
regulatory measures
different from
those existing, the existing permanent regulatory devices shall be removed or covered and
superseded by the appropriate temporary regulatory signs. This change shall be made
in
conformity with applicable ordinances or statutory order of the local jurisdiction.
It is essential,
therefore, that they are used only after consulting the local police and traffic authorities.
5.1.4.1
Normal regulatory signs
The Normal regulatory signs are the circular signs as prescribed in IRC:67-2012 and similarly
the color and shape pattern shall be the same as given
in IRC:67-2012. The speed of the
road governs the size of the signs and they vary from 600 mm to 1200 mm as given
in
Table 5.3. The 'STOP' and 'GIVE WAY' signs are the exceptions, where the height of an
octagonal 'STOP' sign shall be 750 mm, 900 mm, and 1200 mm respectively for an approach
speed of up to 50 kmph, 51 to 65 kmph and greater than 65 kmph.
In the case of 'GIVEWAY'
sign, the one side shall be 600 mm, 900 mm, 1200 mm respectively for approach speed up
to 50 kmph, 51 to 80 kmph and greater than 80 kmph. The applications of normal regulatory
signs are presented in Fig. 5.4 with brief description about the usage of sign.

Warning signs
The warning signs in work zone are classified into two categories namely normal triangular
warning signs and work zone specific warning signs.
5.1.5.1
Normal warning sign
The triangular warning sign when used for work zones shall be on yellow background in order
to highlight the hazardous situation in work zone. The size shall be governed by the speed as
given in Table 5.5. The application of normal warning signs is explained in Fig. 5.6.

As per actual design
5.2
Channelizing Devices
The function of channelizing devices is to warn and channelize the movement of road users
through changed path of movement due to the conditions created by work activities in or near
the roadway. Channelizing devices include cones, tubular markers, vertical panels, drums,
barricades, pavement markings and road studs.
Channelizing devices provide and facilitate smooth and gradual vehicular traffic flow from
one lane to another, onto a bypass or detour, or into a narrower traveled way. They are also
used to separate vehicular traffic from the work space, pavement drop-offs, pedestrian or
shared-use paths, or opposing directions of vehicular
traffic. Devices used to channelize
pedestrians shall be detectable to road users and visible to persons having low vision.
Where barricades are used to channelize pedestrians, there shall be continuous detectable
bottom and top rails with no gaps between individual barricades. The bottom of the bottom
rail shall be no higher than
1 50 mm above the ground surface, and the top of the top rail shall
be no lower than 900 mm above the ground surface.
If drums, cones, or tubular markers are
normally used to channelize pedestrians, they shall be located such that there are no gaps
between the bases of the devices, in order to create a continuous bottom.
Channelizing devices should be
constructed and
ballasted
to perform
in
a
predictable
manner when inadvertently struck by a vehicle. Channelizing devices should be crash worthy.
Fragments or other debris from the device or the ballast should not pose any significant
hazard to road users or workers.
The retro-reflective material used on channelizing devices shall have a smooth, sealed outer
surface that will display a similar color in day or night. Particular attention should be paid to
maintaining the channelizing devices to keep them clean, visible, and properly positioned at
all times. Devices that are damaged or have lost a significant amount of their retro-reflectivity
and effectiveness shall be replaced.

5.2.1
Traffic cones
Traffic cones may be of the
height of 500 mm, 750 mm and 1000 mm and
of 300
to
500 mm
in diameter or in a square shape. They shall be of brilliant red/orange/yellow and
shall be made of a material that can be struck without causing damage to the impacting
vehicle. Fig. 5.10 shows the traffic cones of 500 mm, 750 mm and 1000 mm.
Fig. 5.10 Traffic Cones
For nighttime use, cones shall be retro-reflectorized or equipped with
lighting devices for
maximum
visibility. Retro-reflectorization of cones that are 750 to 1000 mm
in height shall
be provided by a 150 mm wide white band located 75 to 100 mm from the top of the cone
and an additional 100 mm wide white band located approximately 50 mm below the 150 mm
band. Retro-reflectorization of cones that are more than 900 mm in height shall be provided
by
horizontal,
circumferential,
alternating
red and
white
retro-reflective
stripes
that are
100 to 150 mm wide. Each cone shall have a minimum of two red and two white stripes with
the top stripe being red. Any non-retro-reflective spaces between the red and white stripes
shall not exceed 75 mm in width.
Traffic cones may be used to channelize road users, divide opposing vehicular traffic lanes,
divide lanes when two or more lanes are kept open in the same direction, and delineate short
duration maintenance and
utility work.
Steps should be taken to minimize the possibility of cones being blown over or displaced by
wind or moving vehicular traffic.
Cones should not be used for pedestrian channelization or as pedestrian barriers
in work
zones on or along footpath unless they are continuous between individual devices.
Cones may be doubled up to increase their weight. Some cones are constructed with bases
that can be
filled with
ballast. Others have specially weighted bases,
or weight such as
sandbag rings that can be dropped over the cones and onto the base to provide added
stability. Ballast should be kept to the minimum amount needed. The application of traffic
cones for roadways with various speeds are presented in Table 5.9.

A minimum 300 mm clear distance shall be provided from the traffic edge lane marking to the traffic cones
Application
: The traffic cones are ideally proposed for temporary works and maintenance
activities. Since the traffic cones are easily portable and can be installed and removed quickly,
it can be used at places where they are required to be installed and dismantled quite often.
Traffic cones can also be tied up with reflective tape to provide longitudinal guiding line. The
traffic cones along with tape shall form a regular and smooth geometry of traffic path, so as
to streamline the traffic in a well-defined path.
5.2.2
Tubular markers
Tubular markers as shown
in Fig. 5.11 may be used effectively to divide opposing lanes of
road users, or to divide vehicular traffic lanes when two or more lanes of moving vehicular
traffic are kept open in the same direction, and to delineate the edge of a pavement drop-off
where space limitations do not allow the use of larger devices. These tubular structures shall
be flexible plastic bollards.

When a non-cylindrical tubular marker
is used,
it shall be attached to the pavement
in a
manner such that the width facing road users meets the minimum requirements. A tubular
marker shall be attached to the pavement to display the minimum 50 mm width of reflective
bands to the approaching road users. The application of tubular markers
is presented
in
Table 5.10.

*** Tubular Markers will be used in situation where there is acute space constraints to install larger devices in
roads of low traffic volume.
A minimum 300 mm clear distance shall be provided from the traffic lane marking to the tubular markers.
Application
: Tubular markers are suitable
in urban or in rural sections where pedestrian
and cyclist movements are there due to abutting roadside activities.
If the traffic approaching
in one direction
is required
to be diverted
into two different pathways,
it can be used
in
longitudinal direction along with
traffic lane line marking.
It
is generally used where traffic
moves at relatively slow speed and traffic volume is relatively high.
5.2.3
Hazard markers
The hazard markers shall be alternating yellow and
black retro-reflective stripes, sloping downward at
an angle of 45 degrees in the direction of vehicular
traffic.
With
respect
to
the
position
of
traffic
movement and road side hazard,
it can be for either
left or right i.e. OHM (Left & Right).
If traffic can pass
on both sides,
it shall be Two Way Hazard Markers
(TWHM). The one-way and two-way hazard markers
are shown in Fig. 5.12 and the placement of hazard
markers is presented in Fig. 5.13.

5.2.4
Drums
Drums are generally of lightweight and with deformable
materials. They shall be a minimum of 800 mm minimum,
in height and have at least a 300 mm minimum width
regardless
of orientation
Fig.
5.14. The markings on
drums shall be horizontal, circumferential, alternating red
and white retro-reflective stripes 100 to 150 mm wide.
Each drum
shall have a minimum of two red and two
white stripes with the top stripe being red. Any non-retro-
reflectorized spaces between the horizontal red and white
stripes shall not exceed 75 mm wide. Drums shall have
closed tops that will not allow collection of construction
debris or other debris.
Drums are highly visible and give the appearance of being formidable obstacles, and therefore,
command the respect of road users. They are portable enough to be shifted from place to
place within a work zone
in order to accommodate changing conditions, but are generally
used in situations where they will remain in place for a prolonged period of time.
Although drums are most commonly used to channelize or delineate traffic flow, they may
also be used alone or in groups to mark specific locations, including as crash attenuators.
Drums should not be used for pedestrian channelization or as pedestrian barriers
in work
zones or along sidewalks unless they are continuous between
individual devices. Drums
should not be weighted with sand,
ballast, water, or any material to the extent that would
make them hazardous to road users or workers when struck. Ballast shall not be placed on
the top of a drum. Drums used
in regions susceptible to freezing should have drain holes
in the bottom so that water will not accumulate and freeze causing a hazard,
if struck by
traffic.
The
application
of drum delineators
is permitted
in work
sites where there
is adequate
space to
install drums with adequate minimum clearance distance.
In
Indian
context,
in
areas of high vandalism the drum channelization can be explored and spacing indicated
in
Table 5.9 will be applicable for drum channelization also.
Application
: Drums are ideal for work sites of long construction period and also where
length of work site
is relatively long and they are placed parallel to traffic movement path.
Since drums occupy more space than other channelizing devices,
it can be used at locations
where
it can be placed with adequate lateral clearance set forth in this guideline. Drums shall
be tied up with proper reflective tape. The drums along with tape shall form a regular and
smooth geometry so as to streamline the traffic in a well-defined path.
5.2.5
Barricades
Barricades are intended to provide containment without significant deflection or deformation
under impact and to redirect errant vehicles along the barrier. They are designed to be easily

relocated and have four specific functions such as to:
i)
Prevent traffic from entering work areas including excavations or material
storage sites;
ii)
Provide protection and perceived safety to both traffic as well as construction
workers;
iii)
Separate two-way traffic; and
iv)
Protect construction, such as form work
for culverts and other exposed
objects, so as to avoid hazard to road users.
Barricades can be portable or permanent. Portable barricades should be stable under adverse
weather conditions and appear substantial but not so much as to cause excessive damage to
the vehicle,
if they are struck. Fig. 5.15 shows standard barricades; Type
I and
II are portable,
whereas Type
III and Type IV (Fig. 5.16) are permanent. The recommended dimensions of
various components are given in Table 5.11 and the details of Type IV barricades are shown

The horizontal members of Type
I and
II barricades may be of wooden planks and metal.
These should be 200 mm-300 mm wide and should be painted in alternate yellow and black
stripes of 150 mm width. The stripes should slope away at an angle of 45°
in the direction
traffic
is to pass. Where the barricades extend entirely across the carriageway, the stripes
should slope downward towards the direction the traffic must turn in detour. Where both
left
and right turns are provided for, the chevron stripes should slope downward in both directions
from the centre of the barricade. The entire area of chevrons should be reflectorised so as to
be visible from safe distance.
Application
: Type
I or Type
II barricades shall be used when traffic
is redirected. These
barricades can be used inter-changeably and are more useful in repair work that is generally
initiated on emergency basis. The support should be of an "A" frame configuration or hinged
or otherwise flattened at the top to permit convenient folding and stacking for transportation.
Since these barricades are susceptible to overturning in wind, their stability can be improved
through ballast.
Type
III barricades are the permanent type and can be made of wood or metal. These are
erected at the point of closure when a road section is closed to traffic in construction projects.
They may extend completely across a roadway and its shoulders or from kerb to kerb. Where
provision must be made for the access of construction and supervision vehicles, type
III
barricades must be provided with a gate or moveable section that can be opened and/or
closed as required. Signs such as "ROAD CLOSED" and "DETOUR ARROWS" should be
erected on the fixed barricade.
Type IV barricade are to be used in road construction works of long duration, in urban areas.
They serve the purpose of screening and separation of traffic from work area but should not
be expected to provide much protection. Therefore, they should be installed at such locations
which should prevent
all kinds of entry and exit by the road users/construction workers to
53

IRC:SP:55-2014
work space and also those works which are not intended to be seen by public,
lest
it can
distract the driving attention. These should not be used on roads/highways having high traffic
volume and speed since they do not provide much protection when impacted.
5.2.6
Direction indicator barricades
The direction indicator barricade Fig. 5.17 shall consist of a one-direction large arrow sign
mounted above a diagonal striped, horizontally aligned, retro-reflective rail.
900VM
Fig. 5.17
Direction Indicator Barricade
The one-direction large arrow sign shall be black on a yellow background. The stripes on the
bottom
rail shall be alternating yellow and black retro-reflective stripes sloping downward at
an angle of 45°
in the direction road users are to pass. The stripes shall be 100 mm wide.
The one-direction large arrow sign shall be of size 600 x 300 mm. The bottom rail shall have
a length of 600 mm and a height of 200 mm.
The direction indicator barricade, including any associated ballast or lights, should be crash
worthy.
Application
: The direction indicator barricade may be used in tapers, transitions, and other
areas where specific directional guidance to drivers is necessary.
If used, direction indicator
barricades should be used
in series to direct the driver through the transition and into the
intended travel lane.
5.2.7
New jersey barrier
The New Jersey Barriers are
1 .5 m to 2.0 m long pre-cast reinforced concrete modular pieces
with shaped ends that can be interlocked and connected. Where the road works are to be
undertaken which would continue for some time or where the space is limited and there is a
need for the protection of the work force, particularly where the speed of passing traffic may
be high, New Jersey Barrier as shown in Fig. 5.18 may be used.

Application
: New Jersey barrier is to be used to barricade or segregate work space from
traffic, where traffic moves parallel to barricading.
It is intended to minimize damage in case
of any accident. New Jersey barrier shall be provided at location especially where there
is
edge drop of more than 300 mm between the carriageway and adjacent strip of land as part
of work area. While installing barricade, the minimum clearance as shown

portability
is important. These plastic barriers are normally filled with water after placement
on-site to provide a moderate level of stability and crash protection. These barriers can also be
filled with soil/sand, or concrete to produce a heavier barrier with greater crash protection, at
the cost of reduced portability. Their use should be carefully controlled until more experience
is gained with them. They will enable narrower traffic lanes and buffer zones to be employed,
where space is a premium and vehicle speed
is likely to be high.

barricading
the workspace and vehicular movement, where
traffic
is expected to change direction of
movement on account of temporary diversion plan. Forgiving type water filled barricade are
required
in transition area, where vehicles are likely to
hit them
if they fail to negotiate the
deflected pathway provided as part of temporary diversion plan. The water filled barricade
shall be conspicuous enough to be seen by drivers under the headlight beam.

Detectable edging for pedestrians
Various detectable edging and their application for pedestrians include:
•
Prefabricated lightweight sections of plastic, metal, or other suitable materials
that are interconnected and fixed
in place to form a continuous edge.
•
These are placed at ground level to provide a continuous connection between
channelizing devices located at intervals along the edge of the sidewalk or
walkway.
•
Sections of lumber interconnected and fixed
in place to form a continuous
edge.
©
In-situ asphalt or concrete kerb.
•
Prefabricated concrete kerb sections that are interconnected and fixed
in
place to form a continuous edge.
•
Continuous temporary traffic barrier or longitudinal channelizing barricades
placed along the edge of the sidewalk or walkway that provides a pedestrian
edging at ground level.
•
Chain link or other fencing equipped with a continuous bottom
rail.
Detectable pedestrian edging should be red or yellow and should match the color of the
adjacent channelizing devices or traffic control devices,
if any are present. Figs. 6.2 and 6.3
may be referred.
5.2.10
Delineators
Delineators are generally combined with or are used to supplement other traffic control devices.
They shall be mounted on crash worthy supports so that the reflecting unit is approximately
1.2 m above the nearside carriageway edge. The standard color for delineators used along
both sides of two-way streets and highways and the right side of one-way roadways shall be
white. Delineators used along the left side of one-way roadways shall be yellow. The tubular
markers shown in Fig. 5.11 and other similar devices as given in IRC:79 including the cones
(Fig. 5.10), drums (Fig. 5.14) can be used as delineators.
Spacing along roadway curves should be such that several delineators are always visible to
the driver. Delineators may be used
in work zones to indicate the alignment of the roadway
and to outline the required vehicle path through the work zone.
Application
: Delineators are appropriate at location where there is no edge drop at all and
should serve as alignment marker so that driver can judge the carriageway edges while
passing through the work zone. The retro-reflective delineators can be suitably placed at
regular interval,
e.g. 2 m spacing
if used
in transition portion and 9 m spacing
if used
in
straight reaches. Delineators when tied up with proper reflective tape shall form a regular and
smooth geometry to guide the traffic in the changed path at the intended speed.

5.3
Temporary Pavement Markings & Road Studs
Pavement markings shall be maintained along paved streets and highways
in
all long- and
intermediate-term stationary work zones. All pavement markings shall be in accordance with
IRC:35. Pavement markings shall match the markings
in place at both ends of the work
zone. Pavement markings shall be placed along the entire length of any surfaced detour or
temporary roadway prior to the detour or roadway being opened to road users.
Warning
signs,
channelizing devices and
delineation
shall be used
to
indicate
required
road user paths
in work zones where
it is not possible to provide a clear path by pavement
markings. All pavement markings and devices used to delineate road user paths shall be
carefully reviewed during daytime and also during night time.
For long-term stationary operations, pavement markings in the temporary traveled way that
are no longer applicable shall be removed or obliterated as soon as
practical. Pavement
marking obliteration shall leave a minimum of pavement scars and shall remove old marking
material. Painting over existing pavement markings with black paint or spraying with asphalt
shall not be accepted as a substitute for removal or obliteration.
Road users should be provided pavement markings within a work zone comparable to the
pavement markings normally maintained along such roadways, particularly at either end of
the work zone.
The intended vehicle path should be defined by markings
in day, night, and twilight periods
under both wet and dry pavement conditions.
The colour of pavement markings shall be white or yellow conforming to IRC.35. The material
used should be hot/cold thermoplastic or ordinary paint.
If ordinary marking paint is used, the
conspicuity shall be ensured throughout the construction phase and
if required reapplication
for a few times, as ordinary road marking paint get defaced within a short time. The word
messages
like 'DO NOT PASS', 'PASS WITH CARE' and 'NO PASSING ZONE' can be
written upon the pavement surface, and for this principles and dimensions laid out in IRC:35
may be followed. The WTMP shall include location and type of payment markings to meet
the site requirements and conforming to IRC 35. Atypical pavement marking details is shown
in Fig. 5.21.

The pavement markings shall be reinforced with road studs and the color of the road studs
shall be amber. Where
it
is essentially required
to divide the two streams of traffic, and
bi-directional road studs shall be provided at 1 .5 m to 9 m spacing. Roads studs shall be used
at acute temporary diversions to reinforce the temporary continuous marking and also where
contra-flow situation
is required to be adopted as part of work zone traffic management plan

Lighting Devices & Variable Message Signs
5.4.1
Lighting devices
Lighting devices should be provided
in work zones based on engineering judgment. When
used
to supplement channelization, the maximum spacing
for warning
lights should be
identical to the channelizing device spacing requirements.
Four types of lighting devices are commonly used in work zones. They are floodlights, flashing
warning beacons, warning lights, and steady-burn electric lamps.
Lighting
devices may
be
used
to
supplement
retro-reflectorized
signs,
barriers,
and
channelizing
devices.
During
normal daytime maintenance
operations,
the
functions
of
flashing warning beacons may be provided by high-intensity rotating, flashing, oscillating, or
strobe lights on a maintenance vehicle. Some illustrations are given in Fig. 5.23.
5.4.2
Floodlights
Utility, maintenance, or construction activities on highways are frequently conducted during
nighttime periods when vehicular traffic volumes are lower. Large construction projects are
sometimes operated on a double-shift basis requiring night work.

Flashing Warning Beacons
Rotating Amber Light
Fig. 5.23 Types of Lighting Devices
When nighttime work
is being performed, floodlights should be used to illuminate the work
area, equipment crossings, and other areas.
The adequacy
of the
floodlight placement and
elimination
of
potential
glare should be
determined by driving through and observing the floodlighted area from each direction on all
approaching roadways after the initial floodlight setup, at night, and periodically.
Desired illumination levels vary depending upon the nature of the task involved. An average
horizontal luminance of 50 lux can be adequate for general activities. Tasks requiring high
levels
of precision and extreme care may
require an average
horizontal luminance
of
216 lux.
5.4.3
Flashing warning beacons
Flashing warning beacons are often used to supplement a traffic control device. Flashing
warning beacon
shall
be
a
flashing
yellow
light
with
a minimum
nominal
diameter
of
200 mm with rotating amber lights equipped to be operated over the entire 24 hour duration.
The temporary terminus of an expressway is an example of a location where flashing warning
beacons alert drivers to the changing roadway conditions and the need to reduce speed
in
transitioning from the expressway to another roadway type.

======================================================================
PAGE 71 of 136
======================================================================
IRC:SP:55-2014
5.4.4
Warning lights
Type A, Type B, Type C, and Type D 360° warning lights are portable, powered, yellow, lens-
directed, enclosed
lights. When warning
lights are used, they shall be mounted on signs
or channelizing devices
in a manner that,
if hit by an errant vehicle, they will not penetrate
through the windshield. The maximum spacing for warning lights should be identical to the
channelizing device spacing requirements.
Flashing warning
lights
shall not be used
for delineation, as a series of flashers
fails to
identify the desired vehicle path.
Type A low-intensity flashing warning
lights, Type C steady-burn warning
lights, and Type
D 360° steady-burn warning lights shall be maintained so as to be capable of being visible
on a clear night from a distance of 900 m Type B high-intensity flashing warning lights shall
be maintained so as to be capable of being visible on a sunny day when viewed without the
sun directly on or behind the device from a distance of 300 m. Warning lights shall have a
minimum mounting height of 750 mm to the bottom of the lens.
Type A low-intensity flashing warning
lights are used to warn road users during night time
that they are approaching or proceeding
in a potentially (isolated) hazardous area. Type A
warning lights may be mounted on channelizing devices.
Type B high-intensity flashing warning lights are used to warn road users during both daylight
and nighttime hours that they are approaching a potentially hazardous area.
Type C steady-burn warning lights and Type D 360° steady-burn warning lights may be used
during night time to delineate the edge of the traveled way and channelize traffic.
When used to delineate a curve, Type C and Type D 360° warning lights should only be used
on devices provided on the outside of the curve, and not on the inside of the curve as these
may be hit by the passing traffic.
5.4.5
Temporary traffic control signals
Temporary traffic control signals used to control road user movements through work zones
and in other work zone situations shall meet the applicable provisions.
Temporary traffic control signals are typically used in work zones such as temporary haul road
crossings; temporary one-way operations along a one-lane, two-way highway; temporary
one-way operations on bridges, reversible lanes, and intersections.
One-lane, two-way vehicular traffic flow requires an all-red interval of sufficient duration for
road users to clear the portion of the work zone controlled by the
traffic control signals.
Safeguards shall be incorporated to avoid the possibility of conflicting signal indications at
each end of the work zone.
Temporary traffic control signals may be portable or mounted on temporarily fixed supports.
Temporary traffic control signals should only be used
in situations where temporary traffic
61



======================================================================
PAGE 72 of 136
======================================================================
IRC:SP:55-2014
control signals are preferable to other means of traffic control, such as changing the work
staging or work zone size to eliminate one-way vehicular traffic movements, using flaggers
to control one-way or crossing movements, using STOP or YIELD signs, and using warning
devices alone.
5.4.6
Portable variable message signs
Portable message signs shall be the devices with the flexibility to display a variety of messages.
Each message shall consist of either one or two phrases. A phrase shall consist of up to three
words of eight characters per word. The message to be conveyed should not exceed three
phrases displayed
in three lines. Portable variable message signs have a wide variety of
applications
in work zones including: roadway, lane, or ramp closures, crash or emergency
incident management, width restriction information, speed control or reductions, advisories
on work scheduling, road user management and diversion, warning of adverse conditions,
and other operational control.
The primary purpose of portable variable message signs in work zones is to advise the road
user of unexpected situations. Some typical applications include the following:
a)
Where the speed of vehicular traffic is expected to drop substantially;
b)
Where significant queuing and delays are expected;
c)
Where adverse environmental conditions are present;
d)
Where there are changes in alignment or surface conditions;
e)
Where advance notice of ramp, lane, or roadway closures is needed;
f)
Where changes in the road user pattern occur.
The components of a portable variable message sign should include: a message sign panel,
control systems, a power source, and mounting and transporting equipment.
The front face of the sign should be covered with a protective material. The color of the
elements should be yellow on a black background.
Portable variable message signs should be visible from 800 m under both day and night
conditions. For a trailer or large truck mounted sign, the letter height should be a minimum
of 450 mm. For variable message signs mounted on service patrol trucks, the letter height
should be a minimum of 250 mm.
The message panel should have adjustable display rates (minimum of 3 seconds per phrase),
so that the entire message can be read
at least twice at the posted speed, the off-peak
85th-percentile speed prior to work starting, or the anticipated operating speed.
Messages should be designed taking into account the following factors:
a)
Each phrase should convey a single thought.
b)
If the message can be displayed
in one phrase, the top line should present
the problem, the center line should present the location or distance ahead,
and the bottom line should present the recommended driver action.
62



======================================================================
PAGE 73 of 136
======================================================================
IRC:SP:55-2014
c)
The message should be as brief as possible.
d)
When a message
is longer than two phrases, additional Portable Variable
Message signs should be used.
e)
When abbreviations are used, they should be very conventional and easily
understood.
The message sign panel may vary
in size. Smaller letter sizes may be used on a Portable
Variable Message sign mounted on a
trailer or large truck provided that the message
is
legible from at least 200 m, or mounted on a service patrol truck provided that the message
is legible from at least 100 m.
Two portable variable message signs may be used for the purpose of allowing the entire
message to be read twice at the posted speed.
The control system shall include a display screen upon which messages can be reviewed
before
being
displayed on
the message
sign. The
control system
shall be capable
of
maintaining memory when power is unavailable.
Portable variable message signs shall be equipped with a power source and a battery back-
up to provide continuous operation when failure of the primary power source occurs.
The mounting of portable variable message signs on a trailer, a large truck, or a service patrol
truck shall be such that the bottom of the message sign panel shall be a minimum of 2.1 m
above the roadway in urban areas and 1.5 m above the roadway in rural areas when
it is in
the operating mode.
The text of the messages shall not scroll or travel horizontally or vertically across the face of
the sign. Portable variable message signs should be used as a supplement to and not as a
substitute for conventional signs and pavement markings. When portable variable message
signs are used
for route diversion, they should be placed
far enough
in advance of the
diversion to allow road users ample opportunity to perform necessary lane changes, to adjust
their speed, or to exit the affected highway.
The portable variable message signs should be
sited and aligned
to provide maximum
legibility. Multiple portable variable message signs should be placed on the same side of the
roadway. Portable Variable Message signs should be placed on the shoulder of the roadway
or,
if practical, further from the traveled lane. They should be delineated with retro-reflective
traffic control devices. When Portable Variable Message signs are not being used, they should
be removed;
if not removed, they should be shielded; or
if the previous two options are not
feasible, they should be delineated with retro-reflective traffic control devices.
5.4.7
Arrow boards
An arrow panel shall be a sign with a matrix of elements capable of either flashing or sequential
displays. This sign shall provide additional warning and directional information to assist
in
merging and controlling road users through or around a work zone.
63



======================================================================
PAGE 74 of 136
======================================================================
IRC:SP:55-2014
An arrow panel in the arrow or chevron mode should be used to advise approaching traffic of
a lane closure along major multi-lane roadways in situations involving heavy traffic volumes,
high speeds, and/or limited sight distances, or at other locations and under other conditions
where road users are less likely to expect such lane closures.
If used, an arrow panel should be used
in combination with appropriate signs, channelizing
devices, or other traffic control devices.
An arrow panel should be placed on the shoulder of the roadway or,
if practical, further from
the traveled lane.
It should be delineated with retro-reflective traffic control devices. When an
arrow panel
is not being used,
it should be removed;
if not removed,
it should be shielded;
or
if the previous two options are not feasible,
it should be delineated with retro-reflective
temporary traffic control devices.
Arrow panels shall meet the minimum size, legibility distance, number of elements, and other
specifications shown
in Table 5.12 and Fig. 5.24. Type 'A arrow panels are appropriate for
use on low-speed urban
streets. Type
'B' arrow panels are appropriate for intermediate-
speed
facilities
and
for
maintenance
or
mobile
operations
on
high-speed
roadways.
Type 'C arrow panels are intended to be used on high-speed, high-volume motor vehicle
traffic control projects. Type 'D' arrow panels are intended for use on authorized vehicles.

shall conform to the shape of the arrow. All arrow panels shall be finished
in non-reflective
black. The arrow panel shall be mounted on a vehicle, a trailer, or other suitable support. The
minimum mounting height of an arrow panel should be 2.1 m from the roadway to the bottom
of the panel, except on vehicle-mounted panels, which should be as high as practical. A
vehicle-mounted arrow panel should be provided with remote controls. Arrow panel elements
shall be capable of at least a 50 percent dimming from full brilliance. The dimmed mode shall
be used for nighttime operation of arrow panels.
Full brilliance should be used for daytime
operation of arrow panels. The arrow panel
shall have suitable elements capable of the
various operating modes. The color presented by the elements shall be yellow.

the caution mode. For a stationary lane closure, the arrow panel should be located on the
shoulder at the beginning of the merging taper. Where the shoulder
is narrow, the arrow
panel should be located
in the closed lane. When arrow panels are used to close multiple
lanes, a separate arrow panel shall be used for each closed lane.
When arrow panels are used to close multiple lanes,
if the first arrow panel
is placed on the
shoulder, the second arrow panel should be placed
in the first closed lane at the beginning
of the second merging taper. When the first arrow panel is placed in the first closed lane, the
second arrow panel should be placed
in the second closed lane at the downstream end of
the second merging taper.
For mobile operations where a lane is closed, the arrow panel should be located to provide
adequate separation from the work operation to allow for appropriate reaction by approaching
drivers. A vehicle displaying an arrow panel shall be equipped with high-intensity rotating,
flashing, oscillating, or strobe lights. Arrow panel(s) shall not be used to laterally shift traffic.
A portable Variable Message Sign (VMS) may be used to simulate an arrow panel display.

SECTION 6
MEASURES FOR VULNERABLE ROAD USERS (VRUs)
6.1
Measures for VRUs
Where pedestrians, including differently abled persons and people with visual impairment,
have to negotiate a work site or to cross the road within a work site, they shall be provided
with and directed to suitably constructed and protected temporary footpaths and crossing
points, or formal pedestrian crossings, and also refuges, where such provisions are made.
Such
facilities shall meet the requirements described
in these guidelines. Pedestrian and
cycle tracks shall be of same width and facilities that were existing prior to the works.
6.2
Guidance
In proposing measures for devices for pedestrians, people of disabilities and for cyclists/
other non motorized vehicles, in an area of road works, the following guidance shall prevail:
•
It should be ensured that there is no danger to pedestrians from falling objects
or sharp edges, and these road users will not fall over or bump into anything
causing personal injury.
•
Scaffolding be marked with white bands at eye level and allow at least 2.1 m
head room.
It should be ensured that the barriers can be detected easily by
a visually impaired person using a cane stick.
•
Kerb ramps or raised footpath should be provided to help blind, poorly sighted,
elderly and disabled people and for those with prams or wheelchairs.
•
Pedestrian safety shall be ensured by provision of devices such as raised
rumble strip markings and speed humps near pedestrian crossings, where
traffic speed is likely to be high.
If excavations are deeper than 0.3 m, stronger
barricades will be required like water filled barricades to protect pedestrians
and cyclists.
•
The safety buffer is provided in the carriageway,
if the works are closer to the
kerb than the width of the lateral safety buffer clearance.
•
If the works are on or near formally marked pedestrian crossings, care must
be taken to avoid confusion to pedestrians.
•
Clear guidance must be given as to where they are expected to cross while
the works are ongoing.
6.3
Barriers for Pedestrians & Cyclist
Pedestrian barrier should be used to mark out any temporary footpath. Water filled barricades
must always be used to protect pedestrians from
traffic, excavations, plant or materials as
shown in examples in Fig. 6.1.
67



======================================================================
PAGE 78 of 136
======================================================================
IRC:SP:55-2014
Fig. 6.1
Protective Pedestrain Walking Space
Place warning lights at the end of the barriers at night. Portable pedestrian barriers, which
may include mesh,
if used, should be reasonably rigid and have:
a hand
rail fixed at between
1.0 m and
1.2 m above ground
level, which
should be reasonably smooth and
rigid
for pedestrians to hold
to obtain
guidance and some measure of support;
a visibility panel at least 150 mm deep which may be integral with the hand
rail or if separate must be fixed, so that its upper edge is a minimum of 0.9 m
above ground level. Visibility panels of yellow, white or orange color are best
for detection by partially sighted people, while the red and white rail gives a
good contrast and provides interchangeability with traffic barriers; and
a tapping rail (for blind people with a white stick) of min depth
1 50 mm with a
lower edge at ground level or up to a maximum height of 200 mm above the
ground.
When covers are required to be removed from underground chambers or manholes, a flag
man shall always be there, and also a barrier with a handrail fixed no lower than 0.8 m above
ground level will be satisfactory. In this case, the barrier must be large enough to enclose the
opening. Pedestrian barrier can be used to block and to redirect the pedestrian movement,
and
plastic mesh barrier can segregate the pedestrians and construction
activity area as
given
in Fig. 6.2. The illustration of how to put them into practices is shown in Fig. 6.3.
Plastic pedestrian barrier shall be stable and not easily blown over, or displaced by moving
traffic or pedestrians.
It is sometimes a proprietary-made product of plastic post/frame with
mounting devices with reflective discs or lamps. The material of the barricade and the ballast
added
to the base to provide
stability shall not become a potential hazard
if struck. The
portability of these devices is of particular advantage in emergencies or work that involve their
regular displacement.
It shall be erected without gaps along pedestrian paths throughout the
work zone for the control of pedestrian movement to prevent injury or interference with the
construction work activity. They may be erected at spacing not exceeding 20 m along existing
68

or new roads to inhibit access,
if road is closed to traffic use. Plastic pedestrian barrier shall
not be used next to deep excavations or steep falls where heavy pedestrian movement
is
expected. They shall be placed such that a minimum distance of 0.5 m space separates
the plastic barricade and the excavated
pit. Water-filled barricade shall be used
if heavy
pedestrian movement is expected.

Works on Footpath
: Alternative Way for Pedestrians
An alternative safe route for pedestrians must be provided
if it is necessary to close a footpath
or part of a footpath as shown
in Fig. 6=4. Additional equipment may be required to do this.
Pedestrian access to property must always be ensured. Temporary pedestrian ways should
never be less than
1 m wide and, wherever possible, they should be
1 .5 m or more in width.
It must be ensured that pedestrians are not diverted onto an unguarded carriageway.

temporary footpath
is
in the carriageway, the approach should be properly guarded and
provided with signs. The lateral safety buffer clearance(s) must be on the traffic side of the
pedestrian barriers. The signage and barricades should be
in place before the footpath
is
blocked.
Fig. 6.4 Works on Footpath
: Alternative Way for Pedestrians
In exceptional cases, the use of the other footpath may be acceptable in some quiet roads,
but
if this option
is selected, the alternative route must be safe to use, and the needs of
children and of people with disabilities must be taken into account.
6.5
Speed Reduction Measures
Most desirable speed reduction
shall be by enforcement system using radar speed gun
for violation of posted speed
limit at the work zone.
In urban roads and highways passing
through urban areas, physical measures like speed breaker or raised rumble strip markings
may be adopted. But they must be located after a careful assessment of the needs and most
appropriate location. Such installation of speed breaker must be with adequate warning signs
on approaches and proper lighting of the area for clear conspicuity of the speed breaker to
approaching vehicles.
Speed breaker can be of various chord lengths which will permit different passing speed over
the speed breaker (hump) as shown
in Fig. 6.5. For construction of speed hump, the chord
length can vary from 3 m to 9.5 m. In all cases the height shall be
1 00 mm only, and care shall
be exercised to ensure that the height does not exceed 100 mm.
The raised rumble strip markings using thermo plastic paint or mastic sheets can be used
with
installation across the carriageway for deliberate reduction
of speed
in work zones
in urban areas. The
first application can be of 300 mm wide strips and second can be of
150 mm. These
strips
shall be provided
at 500
to 1000 mm
spacing's
in a
series/set
comprising 15 to 20 strips at the distance of 130 m to 180 m from the start of work zone, for
both directions of traffic, as shown in Fig. 6.6.

TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AT WORKSITES
7
Introduction
To manage the
traffic flow through the work zone, a number of practices are available.
Common practices are described below, and selecting the appropriate strategy is crucial to
planning of WTMP for a safe work zone.
7.1
Alternate One Way Operations
The Alternate One-way operations can be put
in place on a two lane bi-directional road;
however this approach
is suitable for very low volume roads.
While one lane of travel
is
taken up with construction activities, the remaining lane is alternately used to accommodate
traffic travelling
in opposite direction. This strategy is generally limited to low volume roads,
and requires at least two flaggers, or temporary traffic lights to safely handle the 'Stop' and
'Go' arrangement of traffic.
Different traffic control methods employed for alternate one-way operation are:
o
"Give and take" system
•
Priority sign
•
"STOP/GO" boards or flags
•
Portable traffic signals
When traffic in both directions must use a single lane for a limited distance, movements from
each end shall be coordinated. Provisions should be made for alternate one-way movement
through the constricted section via traffic control methods given below and choice of method
depend condition shall be as per Table 7.1. The choice of traffic control method
is governed
by the following conditions,

7.1.1
Traffic control by give and take system
Fig.
7.1
illustrates the Give-and-Take system of shuttle working. This
is intended for low
volume of traffic and very low volumes of trucks and no buses. The following conditions must
apply:
Total two-way traffic flow of less than 400 veh/hour;
Less than 20 trucks/hour;
Speed limit is 50 km/h or less
Length of the works from the start of the lead-in taper to the end of the exit
taper is not more than 50 metres
Drivers approaching from either direction can see both ends of the site.

Drivers approaching from either direction can see through the site from a
point 60 m from their transition zone to a point 60 m beyond their termination
zone (coned area), for roads with a 50 km/h speed
limit, on higher speed
roads, the appropriate clear visibility distances are
70 m on 60 km/h roads;
Not applicable above this speed limit.
In Indian conditions,
its use is not recommended on higher speed roads.

Traffic control by portable traffic signals
a)
Portable Traffic Signals for traffic control Fig. 7.4 can be used at most sites
that have a length of 300 m or less. However,
it should be ensured that the
exit from the restricted length of road
is not blocked. Otherwise tailbacks will
occur which will stop traffic travelling
in the opposite direction from moving
when the lights change to green.
b)
Under no circumstances should portable traffic signals be used at works that
straddle railway level crossings, nor to control road traffic within 50 m of a
level crossing equipped with twin red light traffic signals.
c)
If
it
is considered that portable
traffic signals used elsewhere may cause
road
traffic
to block back to a
level
crossing,
railway management must
be consulted before work starts. The solution
will probably be to move the
traffic control to a point on the side of the crossing opposite the works so
that traffic can be stopped before reaching the crossing. The portable traffic
signals must be controlled manually. The crossing's own road traffic signals
and advance warning and informatory signs should remain clearly visible to
approaching vehicle drivers.

d)
The road authority and traffic police must be informed when Portable Traffic
Signals are going to be used. Authorization will be required
if these signals
are to be used at road junctions.
e)
The traffic signal timings must be correctly set up to correspond to the length
of the works and the speed of the traffic past the site. The detectors must be
tested, which are sometimes provided on the signals, to make sure that they
are working properly before they are used.
f)
As back up, Stop/Go boards should be available in case the Portable Traffic
Signals break down.
7.2
Detours
In this strategy, traffic is rerouted on to an alternate road and the traffic totally avoids the work
zone. Fig. 7.5 gives a detour situation. When
traffic
is directed from a road stretch under
construction/improvement, to an alternative traffic route, construction operations can proceed
rapidly. This can improve construction efficiency
(i.e., reduce cost) and quality and ensure
safety for the workers from passing vehicles. The detour can be applied for all categories of
vehicles or applied to certain categories. Detouring traffic imposes additional capacity and load
demands on the alternative route and may result in congestion. Safety considerations on the
detour route should be considered as well, particularly
if the detour route goes through areas
with a large volume of vulnerable road users (residential areas, school zones, etc.). Detours
should be carefully evaluated to ensure that they are capable of safely accommodating the
volume and types (configuration, size, and weight) of detoured vehicles.
7.3
Diversions
The traffic in one or both directions
is routed onto a temporary road constructed around the
work zone and reconnected with the permanent infrastructure of the designated route.
This
provides positive separation between traffic and the work zone.
Diversions can carry one-
way or two-way traffic. This
is especially useful
in construction of bridges and culverts. The
Fig. 7.6 shows a temporary road for culvert construction.
7.4
Full Road Closures
Although dramatic, this strategy,
if properly executed, leads to safe work zones, and reductions
in work time such that the full closure is actually better in terms of delay. This can be effective
and successful on road strategies with
low, medium or high volume
traffic.
If a
full road
closure is chosen, whether
it be short term or long term, the need for detours, as discussed
above, must be weighed against the safety and operational benefits of the full road closure.
7.5
Intermittent Closures
With
this strategy,
traffic
in one or both direction
is stopped
for relatively short period to
allow for construction. This work zone strategy, alone, is generally not adequate for an entire
construction project.
It is more suitable for specific operations such as setting bridge beams,
and moving construction machinery. Intermittent closure should be used for short duration
(less than thirty minutes), outside peak periods and only during good weather conditions to
minimize traffic disruptions and maximize safety.

7.6
Lane Closures
In this strategy one or more traffic lanes and any adjacent shoulders are closed to traffic on
one-lane of a multi-lane highway. When lane closures are used for long term projects, use of
barriers should be considered, which can increase implementation costs. The strategy can
be adopted for a short period (hours),
if barriers are not provided.
7.7
Lane Constrictions
This strategy entails reducing the width of one or more travel lanes. This strategy should be
adopted when maintaining traffic with less than desirable travel lane width
is preferable to
other alternatives. This can raise safety concerns, and therefore, reduced speeds are critical
for this strategy to be successfully implemented. Refer Fig. 7.7.
7.8
Median Crossovers
This strategy
is most suitable on expressways and divided carriageway highways whereby
two-way traffic on a normally divided facility is allowed. A number of steps are necessary to
implement this strategy including.
•
Reducing the number of lanes in both directions of travel (lane closure);
•
Routing
traffic
in
one
direction
across
the
median
to
the
opposite
carriageway;
•
Maintaining two-way traffic on one carriageway while the opposite direction
carriageway is closed.
Substantial
separation
of
traffic from
the work zone
is
provided
by
this
strategy and
construction of an entire one-way carriageway (e.g., travel lanes, shoulders, structures, and
appurtenances) is facilitated with
little conflict between main highway traffic and equipment,
workers, or onsite material movement.
Traffic impacts in terms of speeds, queue formation,
and delay should be assessed, and overall median crossover length should be carefully
considered. Clearly this strategy is only used for long term road works.
While designing curves for median cross over, the radius given for various approach speed
in Table 7.3 can be adopted. The cross over length
is depended upon the radius as well as
the lateral shift as shown the Fig. 7.8.

Use of Shoulder as a Travel Lane
In
this
strategy,
the outside
or
inside (median) shoulder
is used as a temporary
traffic
lane.
This strategy may require constructing or upgrading shoulder pavement structures
to adequately support expected
traffic loads. This strategy uses existing roadway width to
compensate for the capacity lost by closing a permanent travel lane and can be adopted
on
facilities such as divided
multilane, un-divided multilane and two-lane highway (Refer
Fig. 7.9). The existence, proximity, and nature of roadside features (e.g., bridge piers) should
be considered in assessing this strategy.
Fig. 7.9 Shoulder as Travel Lane
7.10
Night Construction
In many situations night construction may be preferred as the volume of traffic
is generally
lower and conflicts are minimized. Consideration must be given to the effect of night operations
on the surrounding environment as well as the workers.
Further, even
if the work occurs at
night, a lane or lanes may need to remain closed during higher traffic times.

SECTION 8
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
8.1
Introduction
Many agencies and professionals are involved
in the safety of a work zone and to avoid
confusion,
it is helpful to clearly define their roles and responsibilities. Roles describe the proper
and customary functions of each player, while responsibilities are linked to the obligations
of that party including funding of the provisions. All the necessary responsibilities must be
assigned and completed without which the safety of the work zone will be compromised.
By clearly defining the roles and responsibilities addresses the critical issues of who must do
what and when! Furthermore, these concepts allow to clearly defining where the responsibility
lies, and assists in ensuring that important safety issues are not overlooked at any time.
8.2
Critical Players or Stakeholders
Critical players in road construction and maintenance activities are:
•
Road Authority
•
Road Operator
©
Project Director/Engineer In-charge
•
Designers
•
Road Safety Auditors
o
Concessionaire in PPP projects
•
Contractor
•
Supervision Consultant/Independent/Resident Engineer
•
Local Police
•
Road User
•
General Public/Communities
8.2.1
Road authority
The Road Authorities with the support of politician's and/or decision/policy makers must
support and demand:
•
responsible
work
zone
planning
and
design
from
transportation
professionals;
•
safe behaviour within the work zone from the workers; and
•
Safe driving behavior through the work zone from the travelling public.
Political support and commitment is crucial in the supervision and enforcement of standards
in road works, otherwise, even the best designs and plans cannot logically provide for the
safety of road users and workers.
84



======================================================================
PAGE 95 of 136
======================================================================
IRC:SP:55-2014
Road Authorities should support appropriate legal and safety requirements, standards and
regulations for work zones and clearly establish the responsibilities of parties involved. They
would ensure that other Agencies, such as local police and local administration etc. share and
act in accordance with the requirements of WTMR The authorities are also responsible,
in
the long run, for ensuring that sufficient funding is provided not only for safety in work zones,
but for overall road safety. The authority is also responsible for educating and informing the
public about safety in work zone so as to promote responsible driving, through outreach and
safety campaigns. The Road Authority shall ensure that the provisions for all traffic control
devices of WTMP are included
in the
Bill of Quantity (BoQ) while preparing the estimate for
projects taken up under PPP or non-PPP modes of implementation.
8.2.2
Road operator
The
road
operator must
insist
that
the
legal and
safety
requirements,
standards and
regulations for work zone safety that have been established by the authorities are complied
in letter and spirit. The Road Operator shall ensure that Work zone Traffic Management Plan
has been prepared before taking up the work of building and or improving the road and being
implemented effectively.
If necessary, the road operator may demand additional requirements
that should be
in writing and publicly available. These additional demands regarding safety
and traffic management issues include:
•
Requiring additional safety equipment such as barriers for worker's safety,
channelizing traffic flow,
traffic guidance, and additional signs (with clearly
defined sizes and colors prescribed
in these Guidelines and based on the
traffic environment);
•
Defining set of working
hours,
like 24 hours or 12 hours on busy roads
(depending on the level of technology used in the process of work);
•
Maximum
length
of detours and minimum requirements
or condition
for
determining
if a bypass is needed; and
•
Requirements for the roadway that will be used for detour (including design
and pavement standards and capacity requirements to ensure that safety is
not compromised).
Before beginning the road works, the road operator
in coordination with the contractor/
concessionaire (for PPP projects) as the case may be, must inform the public and residents
of the location, about duration and possible deviation and time of road closure. Police and
emergency services should also be fully engaged
in understanding where and how a work
zone is being implemented, along with the type of work being done and any detour, etc. that
are planned.
The road operator can demand that the contractor (or whoever requires a work zone to
implement their work, such as the laying of cables, pipes, utilities, etc.), design and implement
a safe work zone and use all necessary means to ensure safety for workers and road users,
as well as sufficient
traffic capacity. The operator may ask the contractor to take on the
85

IRC:SP:55-2014
responsibility
for
informing
the
general
public and
surrounding community
of important
information such as the work zone location and duration, the access issues, possible detours
and other means of travelling through the area.
A variety of methods should be considered to inform the general
public and surrounding
community, including media (radio, TV, newspaper, websites) or through public gatherings or
hearings. The permission of the road operator must be gained for any intervention along the
roadway, including issues related to access management. Thus, the road operator will order
the contractor to design and implement a safe work zone. The road operator can request
that the supervisor pay
particular attention
to a work zone
that
is
particularly complex,
demonstrates clear risks, or has a history of accidents or incidents.
8.2.3
Project director/in-charge
The Project Directors/ln-charge shall be responsible for overseeing and ensuring adherence
to the norms/guidelines and
contractual
provisions
required
to be complied
with by the
consultants and the contractors/concessionaires. He would review the site specific WTMP
prepared and ensure
its implementation effectively.
The Project Director may designate one of the officers from his team, to be responsible for
safety besides environment and social aspects.
8.2.4
Designer
The
"approved"
designer should
be
a company
(or
individual)
that has
expertise and
knowledge of (and,
if appropriate, certification
in) work zone design and safety issues. The
designer's primary responsibility is to include all required provisions in the design to ensure
traffic safety for road users and workers. The designer should alert the road operator to key
issues with regard to safety.
The designer will be responsible for ensuring that all technical solutions are described and
can be implemented
in accordance with the appropriate laws and standards. The designer
will be the legally responsible party for the work zone layouts. The designer must:
•
Gather all necessary information on traffic volume, traffic mix, and types of
road users that are expected;
•
Understand technical elements of the site of the work zone, as well as roads
that might be used for detours/diversions/bypasses;
c
Coordinate and manage detours;
•
Consider road signs and markings, including existing permanent signs that
might need to be removed or covered as well as to provide necessary work
zone signs;
•
Harmonize the technical and scheduling aspects of the work zone with regard
to implementing, managing and removing the work zone; and
•
Identify the necessary
lighting of the work zone,
if night works are being
considered.
86



======================================================================
PAGE 97 of 136
======================================================================
IRC:SP:55-2014
The designer should develop a work zone that allows emergency vehicles sufficient access
and passage of transit vehicles.
If a road
is closed and emergency vehicles must use a
detour, the designer should provide that information in writing. Furthermore, transit agencies
should be informed
in advance before detours are established so that they can plan their
trips and stops. The designer
is likely to take on the responsibility of participating
in public
hearings or community outreach meetings to explain the work zone to the community.
8.2.5
Road safety auditors
The road safety auditors shall be independent of design and execution process and
will
carry out safety audits to identify the potential safety deficiencies
in the Work zone Traffic
Management Plan (WTMPs)
at
its design
stage. The observations and safety concerns
along with specific recommendation
will be forwarded by the road safety auditors to the
Road Authority, Road Operator, Concessionaire, and contractor as the case may be. The
road safety auditors while undertaking the field audit will come up with recommendations
which are either due to non-compliance of approved WTMPs or sometimes due to distortions
in the
traffic control devices caused by poor maintenance regime for WTMPs. Since the
deficiencies observed by safety auditors have direct impact upon the safety of road users
and construction workers, the recommendations made by the auditors shall be complied
without fail. On the other hand, the road safety auditor shall be liable for any irresponsible
recommendations made through worksite safety audit report, which are illogical and are not
suitable for site condition or not approved at the time of design of WTMP.
8.2.6
Contractor
Contractor has a contract with the road operator to execute the work zone and conduct the
work. He
is responsible for preparation of WTMP and for coordinating with the designer to
ensure that they understand how the work zone should be set up and operated over the
course of the works.
If the contractor is not qualified to install, operate, maintain and remove
the work zone, then they must hire a special contractor which
is qualified for these critical
activities.
An expert on safety or an engineer trained on work zone safety from a qualified company
should be named to implement the work zone, including
installing, operating, maintaining
and removing the work zone. The work zone must be checked daily (or more frequently,
if
necessary) to ensure
it meets the designer's scheme. Daily meetings should take place to
ensure that all workers and staff are knowledgeable on the work zone activities and damaged
equipment must be immediately replaced.
It is contractor's responsibility to qualify and train the workers and ensure that they have the
necessary safety equipment (see Section
7). Those working on roads
in the presence of
operating traffic should have proper knowledge and training and should wear high visibility
clothing with light reflecting material. Those managing the traffic flow (flaggers) should have
87



======================================================================
PAGE 98 of 136
======================================================================
IRC:SP:55-2014
knowledge on guiding of traffic and
(if appropriate based on national standards) be certified.
In general,
all workers should have proper knowledge and be trained about how to avoid
risks and maintain work safely; and the contractor is responsible for ensuring that the workers
have that knowledge.
8.2.7
Concessionaire
For PPP
projects,
the Concessionaire
shall observe
his obligations,
responsibilities and
requirements as spelt out in the Model Concession Agreement (for road sector) as well as
in the Concession Agreement, during the design, development, construction, operation and
maintenance. He shall ensure that safety of road users and workers remains the paramount
consideration
in planning and executing the
project implementation, and findings of the
deficiencies by Safety Auditor are promptly rectified.
For PPP projects, the Concessionaire shall prepare detailed layouts for temporary traffic
management plan (WTMP)
with
all
traffic control devices and submit
to the competent
authority as per the Concession Agreement for their review and approval before taking up
works on the ground.
8.2.8
Supervision consultant/independent/resident Engineer
The Supervision Consultant/lndependent/Resident Engineer must have a highly trained road
safety expert. They must be officially approved and certified through the relevant institute or
agency for conducting trainings on work zone safety.
He should have responsibility to the agency hiring them (the authority, the road operator or
the contractor) to check the work zone design and to ensure that
it is implemented in a way
that safety needs are realized.
He will check the actual work zone to ensure that
it
is set up (signs, markings, and other
equipment) consistent with the approved design of WTMP and
•
It is consisted with legal requirements; and
o
It provides safety for road users and workers.
If
it
is found that the design
is deficient, he or she should advise the designer to make the
necessary design improvements.
If the actual work zone is not set up in accordance with the
design, the supervisor should ask the contractor to make the necessary changes.
He should coordinate with local police to pay extra attention
in work zones, with particular
emphasis on vehicle speeds.
8.2.9
Local police
Local
police shall provide
all the required support for the enforcement of the necessary
restrictions,
if imposed, and for the safety measures as warranted by WTMP. The control for
speeding and careless driving in work zones should be strictly enforced.
88



======================================================================
PAGE 99 of 136
======================================================================
IRC:SP:55-2014
Road user
All road users need to pay particular attention while travelling
in work zones. Drivers need
to appreciate and respect that workers often have very
little physical protection from fast
moving vehicles that are travelling past their place of work. They should drive in such caution
that they do not pose a threat to other traffic or to workers. Drivers should be educated about
the risks of travelling
in work zones and
fully informed that safe driving behaviors
will be
strictly enforced by the police. They shall respect and observe any restriction, especially for
speeds.
8.2.10
General public/community
The community has a responsibility to participate
in public hearings and be informed about
work zones, detours, and possible transportation options. As they have the best knowledge of
their environment, they can contribute to improve work zone safety by providing information
about the situation, especially with regard to detours.

SECTION 9
DEPLOYMENT OF PERSONNEL AND SAFETY COMPLIANCE
9.1
Introduction
Many individuals are involved
in the safety of a work zone and
to avoid confusion,
it
is
advisable to deploy the specific and assigned personnel for controlling the traffic during the
peak and off-peak hours of traffic flow at the construction zones.
9.2
Deployment of Flagman
The flagmen or flaggers shall be deployed where:
o
Workers or equipment intermittently block an unprotected traffic lane
•
One lane is used for two direction of traffic
•
Guidance, warning and control of traffic is considered necessary
The flagman
shall be physically
fit,
well
trained,
alert and capable enough
to
effectively
perform the assigned duties. Flagman shall be provided with hand signaling devices such as
flags and sign paddles. Flagmen must be provided with and must wear warning garments,
safety headgear, footwear and gloves for their protection and for conspicuity, while flagging.
Warning garments worn at night must be of reflective material. Flags for signaling shall be
minimum 600 mm x 600 mm
in size and made of good red cloth and securely fastened to a
staff of approximately
1 m in length. Sign paddles should be at least 600 mm wide provided
with a
rigid handle. The background color of STOP should be red and
its shape shall be
octagonal conforming to IRC:67-2012. The word STOP would be
in white colour. Similarly,
the background of SLOW sign should be yellow with black letters, and the GO sign shall be
with green background with white letters.
The
control
of
traffic through work area
is an
essential
part
of road
construction and
maintenance operations. Flagmen with hand signaling devices such as sign paddles play
crucial
role
in
this context. STOP, SLOW and GO paddles are used, and
in some cases
temporary traffic lights are used in controlling traffic through work area.
a)
Besides red and green flags, octagonal and round shaped hand paddles of
600 mm x 600 mm should be used with red, yellow and green retro reflective
Class B sheeting as per IRC:67-2012,
if used in nighttime, whereas red and
green flags can be of visible fabric materials for daytime usage.
b)
Since, Flagmen are responsible for safety of road users and the workers,
it
is important that qualified personnel be selected. The flagmen at the work
sites are expected to stop traffic intermittently and to maintain continuous
traffic flow at work site at reduced speeds to help protect the workmen. For
both of these functions, the flagmen must, at
all times be clearly visible to
approaching traffic for a distance sufficient to permit proper response by the
90

IRC:SP:55-2014
drivers to the flagging instruction and to permit traffic to reduce speed before
entering the work site. This distance
is basically related to approach speed
and
site conditions; however 60 m to 100 m
is desirable.
In urban areas,
this distance shall be reduced to 20 m to 50 m. The use of sign paddle
is
illustrated in Fig. 9.1. Other modern method is Marshalling torches as shown
in Fig. 9.2, and are

for
impending
hazard
or
danger
on
construction work zone, repair sites, trenches, digging of road tunnels
etc.

in construction work zones to guide the traffic and
in roadways for
meeting emergency situations. Roll up signs shall be portable, changeable and shall have
provisions for application on different objects depending on the need for temporary sign.
Such sign shall be made of retro-reflective sheeting, which shall conform to Class B as per
IRC:67-2012.

Stage-1 of Developing Major Cross Road Junction to a Cioverieaf Interchange
APPLICATION
:
In the first stage of the development of a heavy trafficked major road junction to grade separated full cioverieaf
interchange, the slip road
in four quadrants will be constructed along with acceleration and deceleration lanes
for the two major roads. During this stage, traffic will continue to ply through the existing roads and the junction.
Layout of signs and barriers would be as shown.
Fig. 10.29
Stage-2 of Developing Major Cross Road Junction to a Cioverieaf Interchange
APPLICATION
:
Once the slip roads in four quadrants are constructed, in the second stage, the traffic will be diverted into these
newly developed
slip roads. The major road movements through the junction
wiil now become circulatory
system around the work area as shown in the layout, with proper direction information signs. During this stage,
the central area will be taken up for construction of the structures and loops.
