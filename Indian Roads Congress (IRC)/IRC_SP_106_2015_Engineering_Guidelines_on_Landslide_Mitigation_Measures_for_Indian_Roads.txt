Engineering  Guidelines  on  Landslide  Mitigation   
Measures  For  Indian Roads
definition 
Abandoned: Inactive landslide no longer affected by its original causes.
Acceptable Risk – A risk for which, for the purposes of life or work, we are prepared to accept 
as it is with no regard to its management. Society does not generally consider expenditure in 
further reducing such risks justifiable.
Accumulated Mass; Accumulation: Volume of displaced material that lies above the original 
ground surface of a landslide.
Active: Landslide that is currently moving, first-time movement or reactivated.
Activity: Stage of development of a landslide, including the state of activity, distribution of 
activity, and style of activity.
Advancing: Activity the rupture surface extends in the direction of movement.
ALARP: As Low as Reasonably Practicable; with reference to risk.
Analysis: Process to determine the nature and level of hazard and risk; typically includes 
scope definition, identification and estimation.
Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) – The estimated probability that an event of specified 
magnitude will be exceeded in any year.s
Assessment: Overall process of hazard or risk identification, analysis and evaluation.
Complex: Activity where a landslide exhibits at least two types of movement (fall, topple, 
slide, spread, or flow) in sequence.
Composite: Activity where a landslide exhibits at least two types of movement (fall, topple, 
slide, spread, or flow) in different parts of the displaced mass at the same time.
Confining: Activity where there is a scarp but no rupture surface visible at the foot of the 
displaced mass.
Consequence: Probability of total loss or damage, or a proportion of loss or damage, to an 
element at risk; combination of spatial probability, temporal probability and vulnerability.
Control: Process of decision making for managing hazard or risk, and implementation or 
enforcement of hazard or risk mitigation measures and re-evaluation of the effectiveness 
from time to time, using the results of hazard of risk assessment as one input.
Criteria: Terms of reference against which the significance of a hazard or risk are 
evaluated.

Danger (Threat): Natural phenomenon that could lead to loss, disadvantage, damage, injury 
or loss of life; does not include any forecasting; also see Hazard.
Disaster: A serious disruption of the functioning of society, causing widespread human, 
material or environmental losses, which exceed the ability of affected society to cope using 
only its own resources.
Dormant: Inactive landslide that can be reactivated by its original or other causes.
Early Warning: Provision of timely and effective information, through identified institutions, 
that allows individuals exposed to a hazard to take action to avoid or reduce their risk and 
prepare for effective response.
Elements at Risk: population, buildings and engineering works, economic activities, public 
utilities, other infrastructure, and environmental values in an area affected, or potentially 
affected by a landslide.
Enlarging: Activity where the rupture surface of a landslide is extending in two or more 
directions.
Erosion: Process of weathering and transport of soil and rock from their natural environment 
or source. Agents of erosion include wind, water, ice, gravity and living organisms 
(bioerosion).
Estimation: The determination of hazard or risk.
Evaluation: Using values and judgments in the decision process, either explicitly or implicitly, 
to determine the importance of the estimated hazard or risks, and there by identify alternatives 
to manage the hazards or risks.
Event: Occurrence or change of a particular set of circumstances; a landslide is an example 
of an event.
Frequency: Probability or likelihood of occurrence of a repeating event, such as a landslide, 
expressed as the number of occurrences per unit time; also a measure of past occurrences 
per unit time; also see Probability and Likelihood.
Hazard: Condition with the potential for causing an undesirable consequence; source of 
potential harm; also see Danger; or
Inactive: Landslide that has not moved within the last 12 months; can be sub-divided into 
dormant, abandoned, stabilized, relict, and repaired.
Individual Risk: Risk of the fatality or injury to an identifiable individual who lives or otherwise 
occupies an area affected, or potentially affected, by a landslide.
Intensity: Set of spatially distributed parameters related to the destructive power of 
landslide; can be described quantitatively or qualitatively; can include maximum velocity, 
total displacement, differential displacement, depth of moving mass, peak discharge per unit 
width, kinetic energy per unit area.

characteristics of landslide within an area.
Involuntary Risk: Risk that typically is imposed on an individual or society.
Landslide: Down slope movement of a mass of soil (earth or debris) or rock down a slope.
Level of Hazard or Risk: Magnitude of a hazard or risk, expressed in terms of probability or 
likelihood (for hazard) and in terms of probability or likelihood and consequences (for risk).
Likelihood: Chance of an event occurring; a qualitative description of probability of a 
landslide.
Management: Process of hazard or risk assessment and control or treatment.
Marginal: Inactive landslide, between preparatory and active, where a trigger can initiate 
movement.
Mitigation: Strategy to reduce the effect of a landslide.
Monitoring: Continual or frequent checking, critically observing or determining the status of 
activity of a landslide to identify change.
Multiple: Activity where a landslide shows repeated development of the same type of 
movement.
Partial Risk: Combination of the probability of a (hazardous) landslide and probability of the 
landslide affecting the site of an element at risk at the site when the landslide occurs; does 
not consider vulnerability; P(HA) = P(S:H) x P(T:S).
Passive: From of mitigation that requires no design engineering; includes avoidance, land 
use regulations, education and warning systems.
Preparatory: Inactive land area where destabilizing processes are insufficient to cause a 
landslide.
Preparatory Causes: Reasons(s) that a landslide occurred at a particular location and time; 
mechanism(s) that put a landslide into a preparatory state of activity; can include geological 
factors (e.g. sensitive material, joints and fissures), geomorphological factors (e.g. slope 
angle, erosion), physical factors (e.g. rainfall, earthquake) and factors associated with human 
activity (e.g. addition of a load or excavation).s
Probability:
	
a)	
Estimate of the degree of certainty between 0 (impossible) and 1 (certain) of 
an event occurring; also see Likelihood and Frequency; can be statistical or 
subjective; or

artificial remedial measures.
Retrogressing: Activity where the surface of rupture extends in the direction opposite to the 
movement of the displaced material.
Residual: Hazard or risk remaining after mitigation.
Risk: A measure of the probability and severity of an adverse effect to individuals or 
populations, property or the environment.
Run-Out: Maximum travel distance of a landslide.
Run- Up: Maximum height reached by a landslide mass.
Single: Activity where a landslide exhibits only one type of movement (fall, topple, slide, flow, 
spread).
Slope Instability: The predisposition of a slope to mass movement. The condition may 
be recognized by analysis of stress within the slope, by various slope characteristics or by 
analysis of historical records of slope development.
Slope Stability Analysis: Analysis of static and dynamic stability of engineered and natural 
slopes of soil and rock.
Slump: A short, downslope movement of a coherent mass of loosely consolidated soil or 
rock; not a recommended term.
Societal Risk: Risk of the multiple injuries or fatalities, financial, environmental, and other 
losses from a landslide, the burden of which society has to carry.

to a landslide.
Subsidence: Vertical downward movement of the ground surface; frequently occurs in karst 
terrains or can be related to mining activities.
Successive: Activity where a landslide exhibits the same type of movement as a nearby, 
earlier landslide but does not share displaced material or a surface of rupture.
Susceptibility: Qualitative or quantitative analysis of the classification, volume, and spatial 
distribution of landslide that exist or potentially can occur in an area; can also include a 
description of the velocity and intensity of the existing or potential landslide; a time frame is 
explicitly not taken into account.

present.
Temporal Probability: Probability that an element at risk is at the site when the site is 
affected by a landslide; P(T:S).
Tolerable Risk: Risk within a range within which society can live in order to have and secure 
certain benefits; a range of a risk regarded as non-negligible but needing to be kept under 
review and reduced further if possible.
Translational: Type of landslide that moves along a roughly planar surface with little rotation 
or backward tilting.
Trigger: Cause that puts a slope into a marginal state of activity leading to a landslide.
Velocity: Rate of movement of a landslide that can range from extremely slow (<16 mm/ year 
or 0.5 x 10-6 mm/second) to extremely rapid (>5 m/second).
Voluntary Risk: Risk that an individual or society typically takes willingly.
Vulnerability – The degree of loss to a given element or set of elements within the area 
affected by the landslide hazard. It is expressed on a scale of 0 (no loss) to 1 (total loss). 
For property, the loss will be the value of the damage relative to the value of the property; for 
persons, it will be the probability that a particular life (the element at risk) will be lost, given 
the person(s) is affected by the landslide.
Widening: Activity where the rupture surface extends into one or both flanks of a landslide.
Zoning: Division of land into somewhat homogeneous areas or domains, and their ranking 
according to degrees of actual or potential landslide susceptibility, hazard or risk or applicability 
of certain landslide-related regulations.

INTRODUCTION
India, a country blessed with widely diverse physiographic, geological and climatological 
aspects, has a history of multi-hazard events like earthquakes, landslides, floods etc. Extreme 
weather events such as cloudbursts followed by heavy flash flood and landslides have lately 
become a frequent phenomena compare to the yester years. Many a times these events 
of hazards transform into disasters/catastrophes/calamities as happened during June 2013 
in Uttarakhand. During June 16th-17th of 2013 heavy rain resulting in flash flood, breach of 
glacial lakes, heavy erosion etc. have caused wide spread damages and deaths of over 5000 
innocent people. It was again realized that communication, particularly road communication 
is the one which is wanted most during such tragedies. Unfortunately it is the one which is 
also most severely effected.
The increasing pressure of urbanization due to rising population has forced humans to reach 
unstable slopes or make slopes unstable by their illegitimate intrusion in the territory of 
nature. Every year we get to hear about the incidences of landslides from some or other parts 
of India which cost us thousands of human lives and huge monetary losses by destruction 
of infrastructures and settlements. Highways which are primary surface communication 
means for catering all the needs of the inhabitants, tourists, pilgrims and armed forces in the 
border areas are among the most widely suffered infrastructure. The severity of this hazard 
is not obscured but still there are no guidelines regarding landslide management in the 
country.
These guidelines on “Management of Landslides on Indian Roads and Highways” are 
designed to help professional such as engineers, geotechnical engineers and geologist to 
have a good understanding of landslide hazard so that they can take appropriate steps at 
desired time to manage them in proper way. This document is compiled after comprehensive 
study of literature pertaining to landslides from all over the world including India. Best technical 
aspects suitable for Indian condition are considered. The guidelines are divided into eight 
chapters covering every aspect of the landslide mitigation and management strategy and to 
get a deep understanding of the hazard. Every aspect is described in simple language. The 
topics covered in the eight chapters are landslides features and geometry; classification of 
the phenomena; landslide hazard mapping; vulnerability and risk assessment; methods of 
scientific investigation of landslides; instrumentation, monitoring, forecasting and early warning 
of landslides; landslide risk reduction through improved planning, design and construction 
practices and technology for landslide prevention and remediation. These guidelines provide 
assistance to study landslide hazards in two situations, one when alignment is set to be 
constructed and second where road already exists. 
The Disaster Management Committee (G-6) felt the necessity to draft this document and 
constituted a sub-group comprising of Dr. Kishor Kumar, Dr. P.K. Champti Ray; Ms. Minimol 
Korulla; Dr. Surya Prakash and Ms. Dola Roy Choudhari. The draft document prepared by 
the sub-group was discussed by the Committee in series of meetings. The G-6 Committee 
approved the draft document in its meeting held on 26th May, 2014 for placing before the 
General Specifications & Standards Committee (GSS).

1  OVERVIEW  OF  LANDSLIDE  HAZARDS  IN  INDIA
Slope instability occurs in many parts of peninsular and extra-peninsular India and offer 
impacts on settlements, highway, dams, irrigation facility and other development. This has 
been recognised by most of the Government and Private authorities of hill state and coastal 
regions which has led to preparation of guidelines on landslides by a panel of specialists of 
the country and selected by NDMA in the year 2006-2009. These guidelines however are 
prepared for administrative purpose and do not include technical matters which can guide the 
user agencies about the stability assessment prior to allowing the development.
In India, the response to landslide hazard is still fragmented, reflecting the diverse nature 
of the hazard, incomplete database, jurisdictional overlaps, diverse and competing stake 
holders and the multi disciplinary nature of the issue.
1.1	
Landslide Scenario in the Country
Landslides present a threat to life and livelihood throughout the world ranging from minor 
disruption to social and economic catastrophic[108]. Landslides are distributed in all geographic 
regions of the country not confined to the only hilly or mountainous areas but also in coastal 
areas and offshore too. 22 states and 2 union territory of the country are affected by 
landslides (Fig 1.1), although they differ from the scale of severity of disaster. Generally, the 
areas uninhabited and away from human 
intervention are found unaffected or less 
affected by such phenomena. While, the 
areas where human intervention increased 
vulnerability to landslide occurrences has 
also increased. As the population has 
increased quite rapidly over the last century, 
people had to venture in new areas, not 
inhabited earlier. These areas have not 
generally been considered based on their 
vulnerability to landslide disasters. As a result 
landslide occurrences in these areas have 
become common phenomena. These areas 
which have already experienced landslides are 
generally vulnerable to repeated recurrences. 
Most of the highways and roads planned 
and constructed without  consideration of 
the probability of landslide recurrence have suffered due to repeated recurrence of such 
phenomena resulting in frequent interruption of traffic, road damage, loss of life and hardship 
to the commuters.

Every time the tragedy strikes, huge amount of budgetary funds are pumped into the 
rehabilitation and restoration works without giving a least thought to pre-disaster planning. 
By the time the tragedy stricken areas are rehabilitated, monsoon reappears again and this 
vicious process repeats again and again. The restoration and rehabilitation process never gets 
completed and an unimaginable sum of tax payers’ money washes off without much fruitful 
results. The cost on direct losses such as the costs of repair and maintenance, restoration, 
rehabilitation or the replacement of the damaged properties is met out of maintenance budget 
allocated for the whole year excluding such exigencies; as a result, overall maintenance of 
the roads is also affected. The frequent and long duration blockade of national highways 
in critical landslide locations create social unrest amongst the communities living at both 
the sides of the blockade location because of their inability to attend the social obligations, 
hardship in reaching the destinations through the tougher and longer alternate routes, inability 
to provide medical aids to the critical patients, steep hike in prices of the commodities, inability 
to run their business etc. These scenes with series of sufferings are repeated during every 
monsoon.
The failure to lessen the problem, pertaining to landslides, is primarily due to the ever 
increasing pace of development in the terrain prone to geological hazard and failure of the 
respective authorities to recognise such hazards and apply appropriate methods for their 
prevention/mitigation even though there is a overwhelming evidence that landslide hazard 
mitigation purpose serve both public and private institutes by saving many times the cost of 
implementation.
1.2 	
Purpose of Guidelines
The above examples illustrate the wide distribution of the landslide and their destructive 
potential. Not every landslide results in catastrophic, but even small landslides have the 
potential to cause damage and loss of life. The proposed guidelines aim to demonstrate as 
how the loss of life and damage from landslide can be reduced following good practices of 
land use planning.
Since no new land formation can take place, we have to live with whatever we have with wise 
and judicious use and prevent the gradual or fast degrading land due to landslides and other 
mass movements by adopting certain measures and guidelines. Guidelines, particularly for 
the areas where planning is under progress and development is due to take place would be 
more important because in most of the area severity of naturally caused landslide has not 
increased. What has increased is the extent of human occupation of these lands and the 
impact of human activities on the environment.
The frequency of landslide events has got increased many folds, all over the hilly areas of the 
country, and there is practically not a single day when a landslide does not happen in some 
or other parts of the country. Recent examples of loss of life and property worth billions tell

the tale of the devastation caused by landslides. Many landslide damages that have occurred 
might have been prevented or avoided if accurate landslide hazard information had been 
available and used. In order to cope with the demand of modern industrialized need of the 
country large number of the developmental projects for communication, highways, dams, 
reservoirs have been launched and are in different stages of development and many more 
will be launched. Planners and executors of innumerable developmental schemes should 
desire and demand an advance, as far as accurate and understandable information for slope 
instability assessment prior to execution of such developmental program. Population, living in 
vulnerable areas also needs adequate information about the hazard, risk and consequences 
of such hazard, how the local communities could be made aware of landslide hazards in their 
respective areas, and trained in the management of landslides to avert disasters? In view of 
these there is a need for guidelines for management of landslides in hill areas. However, the 
present guidelines are to be exclusively used for the highways/road only. The guidelines will 
have following purpose:
	
●	
To establish a uniform terminology and classifications of landslides
	
●	
Define a general framework for landslide management on Indian Highways-	
based on national and international experience.
	
●	
Provide guidance on methods which should be used to carry out the 
investigation, mapping, analysis and mitigation. 
1.3 	
Whom the Guidelines
These guidelines are prepared primarily to assist the local authorities (planner) involved in the 
constructions and maintenance of the roads. However will also be of interest to developers, 
engineering geologist, geotechnical engineers who specialise in landslide hazard and risk 
assessment.
In case the new development the planners should be interested in early consultation with the 
engineering geologist and geotechnical engineers for assessment of the slope conditions 
prior to the development. Obviously, a planner is not expected to make technical judgement 
about the landslide hazard and risk, but should understand the process by which a landslide 
specialist provides advice. By seeking appropriate advice the planner can get information 
about the kind of measures and methods to prevent, minimise or avoid the negative impact 
of the landslides.
In case of the aleady developed area the concerned authorities, engineers should know as 
how to assess the hazard and associated risks from the existing landslides and what could 
be the best economically viable remedial measure for preventing/mitigating the impact of 
such hazards.
From these guidelines, the planner will gain a basic knowledge of the concepts and issues to 
be considered when incorporating landslide hazard information and assessment into planning

process. It is envisaged that these guidelines will be regularly reviewed and updated as 
knowledge, technical standards and practices evolve.
The landslide guidelines a produced based on the extensive literature review from within 
and outside the country. A few selected guidelines of other countries have also been 
reviewed and used for preparation of the present document. The bibliography of the 
referred literature is given at the last of the document while references in the running text 
are avoided.
2  LANDSLIDE  FEATURES  AND  GEOMETRY
The significance of identifying landslide features is that they provide clues on the nature 
of motion in the past as well as current and therefore, indicate potential hazards along the 
transportation routes and where protective measures are necessary.
2.1 
Definition
Landslide definition has been covered widely in world literature including books and individual 
papers and to reproduce the same may not be worth. However, it would be appropriate to 
discuss the basic definition indicating the concepts of such a phenomenon before discussing 
the features etc. The landslide phenomenon has been defined by number of ways but the 
basics remain same in all.
“A landslide can be portrayed as an episode of downward and outward displacement/
movement ranging from very slow to rapid in velocity, of any kind of slope forming materials 
(rock, soil or their combination) under the influence of gravity.”
2.2	
Landslide Features 
The landscape is read for signs that tell of past processes. The identification of features on 
the terrain or slope forms an integral part in the prediction of potential instability. Features 
observed in the field during mapping give direct evidence of activity/processes the slope has 
undergone and in a way; features can indicate whether a landslide is active or inactive, old 
or new etc. Recognition of these features makes it possible to identify landslides from aerial 
and ground inspections. Several diagnostic landslide features tell of past movement on the 
terrain. For example as indicated in Fig 2.1. Fig 2.1 shows that the features which could be 
identified in the field directly by the working engineers before, during and after construction. 
Important concepts to consider include[30]: 
	
●	
The un-failed slope can be termed the original ground surface.
	
●	
The mass that moves is called the displaced material. It may be intact or it 
may be in deformed state debris.
	
●	
The displaced mass overlies two zones: i.e. zone of depletion and zone of 
accumulation. The depletion zone may lie below the original ground surface 



======================================================================

12
and is defined by the zone of rupture or shear plane. The accumulation zone 
is the area where the displaced mass lies above the surface and includes 
areas to which the displaced material has moved (Figs.2.1 and 2.2).
Ground features associated with slope instability are given in Table 2.1 and Fig 2.3.[30, 48]
Table 2.1 Guide to Read and Classify Landslide Features

Features 
associated 
with 
landslides are:
●	 extensional 
features 
like 
scarps
●	 tension cracks;
●	 shear features (shear zones)
●	 shortening features like toes, 
transverse ridges and snouts 
on the ground, signs of slope 
instability include:
●	 Cracking
●	 hummocky terrain
●	 undrained  crescent-shaped 
depressions and ponds
●	 scarps and benches
●	 crooked fences, trees or 
lamp posts leaning uphill or 
downhill
●	 uneven road surfaces
●	 swamps or wet ground in 
elevated positions
●	 plants like rushes growing on 
a slope, and water seeping 
from the ground
Some of the important notable features are indicated in Table 2.2.
2.2.1	
Landslide Dimension
The quantities Ld, Wd, Dd, Lr, Wr, Dr (Fig. 2.4 and Table 2.3) are introduced because, 
with an assumption about the shape of the landslide, their products lead to estimates of the 
volume of the landslide that are useful in remedial work.
The volume of the slide mass is given as the product of various dimensions as:
	
	
	
VolIs = 1/6πDrxWrxLr
The volume of displaced material is estimated as:

Slope Surface Appearance
2.2.2.1	
Terrain/morphologic features indicating landslide
The features of any landslide in the field will be reflective of the type of landslide and its 
age[30]. For example, a rotational slide will be characterized by a steep, near vertical head 
scarp, gentle mid-slopes and a convex toe (Example Fig. 3.3 of chapter classification of 
guidelines). A slope undergoing rock fall will have scree (or debris) at the base of the slope 
which can range in size from small, sand-like particles up to large boulders. Rocks or an 
accumulation of debris at the base of the slope indicates activity from above. Fresh activity 
will be characterized by sharp edges and features, as well as distinct color changes where 
materials have parted from the parent rock or slope. Older failures may have very degraded 
features included rounded head scarps and worn edges and will be reflective of the on-going 
weathering and erosional processes which continually modify the landscape. Diagnostic 
features of different types of landslides are briefly described/illustrated in many textbooks. 
Table 2.4 summarizes diagnostic geomorphic features used to identify landslides & provides 
the significance.

 Morphological changes of landslide features with time
The geomorphic features being recorded during the field mapping portion are not all the 
same age. They may be currently active, inactive but young and inactive but mature. The 
field engineers/geologists can visualize these changes and accordingly classify the terrain 
as given in Table 2.5. This gives an understanding of the history of morphological changes 
with time.

The identification of features makes it easy to understand the terrain, type of denudational 
processes including landslides and also the probability of the terrain to be affected by like 
processes after construction of roads, based on which one can plan a strategy for type 
of survey, mapping, investigation etc, for selecting an alignment/correcting the new one/
landslide mitigation etc.
3  classification 
Since the type of landslide will determine the potential speed of movement, likely volume 
of displacement, distance of run-out, as well as the possible effects of the landslide and the 
appropriate mitigation measures to be considered, it is important to classify them appropriately 
as per established international practices.
3.1 
Classification Schemes
Landslides come in a great variety of shapes and sizes[107]. Some are very large and cause 
great devastation while others are very small and cause little or no damage at all. They can 
be single events of slope instability, or they can be complex in nature with multiple events at 
one site. They can occur in a wide range of earth materials and be due to a variety of failure 
mechanisms. They can be classified in number of ways, each having some usefulness in 
emphasizing features pertinent to recognition, avoidance, control, correction or other purpose 
of classification. There are several attributes that have been used as different discriminating 
factors and criteria for identification and classification (Table 3.1) of landslides. Mostly, the 
chief criteria used in landslide classification are type of material and the type of movement 
(Table 3.2)[30, 49, 54, 72, 107, 108, 110, 136 and 154]. The type of movement describes the actual internal 
mechanics of how the landslide mass is displaced. The five kinematically distinct types of 
movement are described in the sequence fall, topple, slide, spread and flow. Hence the 
combination of the type of movement and material involve gives a basic description of the 
landslide e.g. rock fall, debris flow etc (Table 3.3). Since the type of landslide will determine 
the potential speed of movement, likely volume of displacement, distance of run-out, as 
well as the possible effects of the landslide and the appropriate mitigate measures to be

considered, it is important to classify them appropriately. Further description of a landslide 
incorporates terms on the state and style of activity (Table 3.4).
Table 3.1  Different Discriminating Factors
Discriminating 
Factors
Description
Type of movement
The main movements are falls, slides and flows, but usually topples, lateral spreading 
and complex movements are also added to these.
Type of material
Rock, earth and debris are the terms generally used to distinguish the materials 
involved in the landslide process. (If the weight of the particles with a diameter greater 
than 2 mm is less than 20%, the material will be defined as earth; in the opposite 
case, it is debris.)
Activity
The concept of activity is defined with reference to the spatial and temporal conditions 
i.e. the state, describes the information regarding the time in which the movement 
took place; the distribution, the second term describes, in a general way, where the 
landslide is moving and style, the third term indicates how it is moving.
Movement velocity
This factor has a great importance in the hazard evaluation. A velocity range is 
connected to the different type of landslides, on the basis of observation of case 
history or site observations.
The age of the 
movement
The evaluation of age of landslide gives its frequency and the specific condition under 
which it could have occurred. It should be noted that, it is possible that phenomena 
could be occurred in past geological times, under specific environmental conditions 
which no longer act as agents today.
Geological conditions:
These represent a fundamental factor of the morphological evolution of a slope. 
Bedding attitude and the presence of discontinuities or faults/thrust control the slope 
morphogenesis.
Morphological 
characteristics
As the morphology is the manifestation of past and ongoing geological changes on the 
terrain; morphological characteristics are extremely important in the reconstruction of 
the technical model.
Geographical location
Landslides on their spatial context are referred so that not only geography is known 
but the correlation with landslide morphology and geology is also made.
Topographical criteria
With these criteria, landslides can be identified with a system similar to that of the 
denomination of formations. Consequently, it is possible to describe a landslide using 
the name of a site. In particular, the name will be that of the locality where the landslide 
happened with a specific characteristic type.
Type of climate
Given the changing climatic condition this criteria give particular importance to 
climate in the genesis of phenomena for which similar geological conditions can, 
in different climatic conditions, lead to totally different morphological evolution. As a 
consequence, in the description of a landslide, it can be interesting to understand in 
what type of climate the event occurred.
Causes of movements In the evaluation of landslide susceptibility, causes of the triggers are an important 
step. The causes may be as “internal” and “external” referring to modifications in the 
conditions of the stability of the bodies. Whilst the internal causes induce modifications 
in the material itself which decrease its resistance to shear stress, the external causes 
generally induce an increase of shear stress, so that block or bodies are no longer 
stable. The triggering causes induce the movement of the mass. Predisposition to 
movement due to control factors is determining in landslide evolution. Structural 
and geological factors, as already described, can determine the development of the 
movement, inducing the presence of mass in kinematic freedom.

One type of slope failure may grade into another, slide often turn into flows. Complex slope 
movements are those in which there is a combination of two or more principle types of 
movement. There are also cases of multiple movements in which repeated failure of the 
same type occur in succession and compound movement are those in the failure surface is 
formed of a combination of curved and planar sections.

that have undergone most recent movement 
more than 10,000 year before present (Late 
Pleistocene)
III-Potentially 
Unstable Slopes
Slopes that show no evidence of previous landslide activity but that are considered 
likely to develop landslides in the future; landslide potential is indicated by analysis or 
comparison with other slopes.
IV- Apparently 
Stable Slopes
Stabilized
Slopes with evidence of previous landslide 
activity but that have been protected from its 
original causes by remedial measures.
Abandoned
An abandoned landslide is an inactive landslide 
which is no longer affected by its original 
causes.
Relict
A relict landslide is an inactive landslide which 
developed under climatic or geomorphological 
conditions not currently present.
Stable
Slopes that show no evidence or previous 
landslide activity and that by analysis or 
comparison with other slopes are considered 
stable

Complex
A complex landslide exhibits at least two 
types of movement (falling, toppling, sliding, 
spreading and flowing) in sequence. In the 
example shown a gneiss and a pegmatite vein 
toppled with valley incision. Alluvial deposits 
fill the valley bottom. After weathering had 
weakened the toppled material some of the 
displaced mass slid further down slope.
Composite
A composite landslide exhibits at least two 
types of movement simultaneously in different 
parts of the displacing mass. In the example 
shown the limestones have slid on the 
underlying shales causing toppling below the 
toe of the slide rupture surface.
Successive
A successive landslide is the same type as a 
nearby, earlier landslide, but does not share 
displaced material or rupture surface with it. 
In the example shown the later slide AB is the 
same type as CD but does not share displaced 
material or a rupture surface with it.
Single
A single landslide is a single movement of

Triggering Mechanism
Fall
The detachment of slope material i.e. soil or rock, or both, from a steep slope along a surface on which little or 
no shear displacement has occurred is termed as fall. The material descends mainly by falling, bouncing, or 
rolling. The volume of material in a fall can vary substantially, from individual rocks or clumps of soil to massive 
blocks thousands of cubic meters in size. The velocity of movement is very rapid to extremely rapid. Except 
the rolling velocity of displaced mass which depends on slope steepness. The fall is prefixed with some nouns 
like rock, debris and soil depending upon the type of material. Rockfall is a fall of newly detached mass from 
an area of bed rock. Debris fall is a fall of debris which is composed of detrital fragments prior to failure.
Undercutting of slope by natural processes such as streams and rivers or differential weathering 
(such as the freeze/thaw cycle), human activities such as excavation during road building and 
(or) maintenance, and earthquake shaking or other intense vibration. Effects (direct/indirect) 
Falling material can be life-threatening. Falls can damage property beneath the fall-line of 
large rocks. Boulders can bounce or roll great distances and damage structures or kill people. 
Damage to roads and railroads is particularly high: rockfalls can cause deaths in vehicles hit by 
rocks and can block highways and railroads.
Topple
Topples 54 can consist of rock, debris (coarse material), or earth materials (fine grained material). 
The material involved usually leans forward in bulk but when it fails, at the base, it rapidly rotates 
onto the slope below and breaks up, bounces, roles or slides forward. Topples range from extremely 
slow to extremely rapid, sometimes accelerating throughout the movement. This kind of movement 
can be extremely destructive, especially when failure is sudden and (or) the velocity is rapid.
Sometimes driven by gravity exerted by material located upslope from the 
displaced mass and sometimes by water or ice occurring in cracks within 
the mass; also, vibration, undercutting, differential weathering, excavation, 
or stream erosion.
Rotational Landslide
A landslide on which the surface of rupture is curved upward (spoon-shaped) and the slide movement is 
more or less rotational about an axis that is parallel to the contour of the slope. The displaced mass may, 
under certain circumstances, move as a relatively coherent mass along the rupture surface with little internal 
deformation. The head of the displaced material may move almost vertically downward, and the upper surface 
of the displaced material may tilt backwards toward the scarp. If the slide is rotational and has several parallel 
curved planes of movement, it is called a slump. As rotational slides occur most frequently in homogeneous 
materials, they are the most common landslide occurring in “fill” materials.
Intense and (or) sustained rainfall or rapid snowmelt can lead to the saturation 
of slopes and increased groundwater levels within the mass; rapid drops in river 
level following floods, ground-water levels rising as a result of filling reservoirs, or 
the rise in level of streams, lakes, and rivers, which cause erosion at the base of 
slopes. These types of slides can also be earthquake-induced.
Translational Landslide
The mass in a translational landslide moves out or down and outward along a relatively planar surface 
with little rotational movement or backward tilting. This type of slide may progress over considerable 
distances if the surface of rupture is sufficiently inclined, in contrast to rotational slides, which tend 
to restore the slide equilibrium. The material in the slide may range from loose, unconsolidated soils 
to extensive slabs of rock, or both. Translational slides commonly fail along geologic discontinuities 
such as faults, joints, bedding surfaces, or the contact between rock and soil.
Primarily intense rainfall, rise in ground water within the slide due to rainfall, 
snowmelt, flooding, or other inundation of water resulting from irrigation, or 
leakage from pipes or human-related disturbances such as undercutting. 
These types of landslides can be earthquake-induced.
Lateral Spreads
Lateral spreads usually occur on very gentle slopes or essentially flat terrain, especially 
where a stronger upper layer of rock or soil undergoes extension and moves above an 
underlying softer, weaker layer. Such failures commonly are accompanied by some general 
subsidence into the weaker underlying unit. Velocity of movement may be slow to moderate 
and sometimes rapid after certain triggering mechanisms, such as an earthquake.
Triggers that destabilize the weak layer include: ① Liquefaction of lower weak layer by 
earthquake shaking, ② Natural or anthropogenic overloading of the ground above an 
unstable slope, ③ Saturation of underlying weaker layer due to precipitation, snowmelt, 
and (or) ground-water changes, ④ Liquefaction of underlying sensitive marine clay 
following an erosional disturbance at base of a riverbank/slope, ⑤Plastic deformation of 
unstable material at depth (for example, salt).
Debris Flows
A form of rapid mass movement in which loose soil, rock and sometimes organic 
matter combine with water to form a slurry that flows downslope. Debris flows can be 
deadly as they can be extremely rapid and may occur without any warning.
Debris flows are commonly caused by intense surface-water flow, due to 
heavy precipitation or rapid snowmelt that erodes and mobilizes loose soil 
or rock on steep slopes. Debris flows also commonly mobilize from other 
types of landslides that occur on steep slopes, are nearly saturated, and 
consist of a large proportion of silt- and sand-sized material.
Debris Avalanche
Debris avalanches are essentially large, extremely rapid; often open-slope flows 
formed when an unstable slope collapses and the resulting fragmented debris is 
rapidly transported away from the slope. In some cases, snow and ice will contribute 
to the movement if sufficient water is present, and the flow may become a debris flow 
and (or) a lahar.
In general, the two types of debris avalanches are those that are “cold” and those that are “hot.” 
A cold debris avalanche usually results from a slope becoming unstable, such as during collapse 
of weathered slopes in steep terrain or through the disintegration of bedrock during a slide-type 
landslide as it moves downslope at high velocity. At that point, the mass can then transform into 
a debris avalanche. A hot debris avalanche is one that results from volcanic activity including 
volcanic earthquakes or the injection of magma, which causes slope instability.
Earth flow
Earth flows can occur on gentle to moderate slopes, generally in fine-grained soil, commonly clay or silt, but also in 
very weathered, clay-bearing bedrock. The mass in an earth flow moves as a plastic or viscous flow with strong internal 
deformation. Susceptible marine clay (quick clay) when disturbed is very vulnerable and may lose all shear strength 
with a change in its natural moisture content and suddenly liquefy, potentially destroying large areas and flowing for 
several kilometers. Size commonly increases through head scarp retrogression. Slides or lateral spreads may also 
evolve downslope into earth flows. Earth flows can range from very slow (creep) to rapid and catastrophic.
Triggers include saturation of soil due to prolonged or intense rainfall or snowmelt, 
sudden lowering of adjacent water surfaces causing rapid drawdown of the ground-
water table, stream erosion at the bottom of a slope, excavation and construction 
activities, excessive loading on a slope, earthquakes, or human-induced vibration.
Creep
Creep is the imperceptibly slow, steady, downward movement of slope-forming soil. 
Movement is caused by shear stress sufficient to produce permanent deformation, but too 
small to produce shear failure. There are generally three types of creeps: (1) seasonal, 
where movement is within the depth of soil affected by seasonal changes in soil moisture 
and soil temperature; (2) continuous, where shear stress continuously exceeds the strength 
of the material; and (3) progressive, where slopes are reaching the point of failure.
For seasonal creep, rainfall and snowmelt are typical triggers, whereas for 
other types of creep there could be numerous causes, such as chemical or 
physical weathering, leaking pipes, poor drainage, destabilizing types of 
construction, and so on.

4  LANDSLIDE  HAZARD  MAPPING,  VULNERABILITY   
and  RISK  ASSESSMENT
Landslide susceptibility, hazard and risk mapping of any hilly terrain, prior to development, 
are the basic need not only for minimizing the risk to life and property and safety of the public 
and infrastructure from landslides and like phenomena but also for the quality and durability 
of the infrastructure in disaster prone areas. 
The landslide hazard, vulnerability and risk assessment is based upon the use of three major 
steps: susceptibility mapping, hazard mapping and risk mapping (Fig. 4.1). In susceptibility 
mapping, the locations of areas liable to undergo landslide are identified. In hazard mapping, 
the probability of failure is estimated using a number of techniques. In risk mapping, the 
landslide hazard assessment is combined with an estimate of the vulnerability of the total 
infrastructure and population to produce an estimate of landslide risk.

4.1	
Recommended Landslide Mapping Scale and their Application
Landslide zoning maps should be prepared at a scale appropriate for displaying the 
information needed at a particular zoning level understandable to the working engineers 
and the policy makers. The scale of mapping is generally controlled by the aim of the project 
for which the maps are being planned. Table 4.1 below summarizes map scales and the 
landslide inventory, susceptibility, hazard and risk mapping to which they are usually 
applied[51].

Landslide Hazard Analysis Techniques and Maps
Existing landslides and their relationship with the key factors such as slope steepness, 
lithology variation, groundwater conditions etc. gives an understanding of the conditions and 
processes controlling landsliding and forms the basis for assessing landslide susceptibility 
and ultimately hazard[50]. Table 4.3 provides a summary of hazard analysis techniques and 
mapping.

Heuristic or qualitative methods use expert interpretation of geological and historical information 
on landslides to estimate the susceptibility of areas to landslide events. A combination of 
qualitative and quantitative information form the basis of relative hazard that can be classified 
into landslide susceptibility classes (e.g. high, medium, low).
Statistical hazard analysis methods use landslides, geological, topographic and vegetation etc 
information to calculate the susceptibility to landslide or the probability of landslide events. By 
definition, determining landslide hazard requires determining the magnitude and frequency 
of landslide events. However, both the parameters are difficult to be determined, particularly 
when the data are scar. 
Determining the spatial and temporal extent of landslide hazard involves identifying areas 
which are, or could be, affected by a landslide and assessing the probability of similar 
landsliding occurring within a specified time period. Specifying a time frame for the future 
occurrence of a landslide is difficult and often not possible.
The prediction and forecasting of landslides relies on the knowledge gained from the production 
of hazard maps. The stability and the possible vulnerabilities of slopes are researched to 
determine how safe the area around the slope is from possible landslides.
4.3	
Landslide Database Inventory
The landslide database and inventory is an important and, in fact, a first step towards not 
only the landslide hazard mapping and risk assessment but also towards any of the landslide 
hazard mitigation and management programs. The inventory of landslides before zonation 
is prerequisite because an area can be said susceptible for landslides, when the terrain 
conditions are comparable to those where a slide has occurred[45]. Landslide inventory maps 
show the distribution of past and active landslides[4], their relative activity, landslide density 
and/or geomorphic attributes, within an area. Some geomorphic attributes include slope, 
slope aspect, bedrock lithology and structure, soil type, depth of overburden, moisture content 
and geomorphic processes such as gullying and soil erosion etc. Each landslide is typically 
mapped as a geographically referenced polygon; small landslides can be represented by a 
geographically referenced point. If possible, each landslide should be assigned a landslide 
type and, where possible, other information should be included such as date of occurrence, 
state of activity and approximate volume.
For small landslides in natural slopes, the quality of the inventory will be enhanced by carrying 
out surface as well as aerial photograph-based interpretation. Basic small or medium scale 
landslide inventory mapping at regional or local level may be followed by intermediate or 
advanced mapping of higher susceptibility areas (Table 4.4). The inventory should be mapped 
at a larger scale than the susceptibility, hazard or risk zoning maps. Different information can 
be mapped depending on the scale[33].

Landslide Information Form[163]
4.4	
Landslide Susceptibility Mapping 
Landslide susceptibility mapping usually involves developing an inventory of landslides 
which have occurred in the past together with an assessment of the areas with a potential 
to experience landsliding in the future, but with no assessment of the frequency (annual 
probability) of the occurrence of landslides[51]. Susceptibility mapping involves the rating of 
the terrain units according to their propensity to produce landslides. This is dependent on 
the topography, geology, geotechnical properties, climate, vegetation and anthropogenic 
factors such as development and clearing of vegetation. The scale of susceptibility is usually 
a relative one.
It should be recognized that the study area may be susceptible to more than one type of 
landslide e.g. rock fall and debris flows, and may have a different degree of susceptibility 
(and in turn hazard) for each of these[33]. In these cases it will often be best to prepare 
separate susceptibility maps for each type of landslide and to combine them to obtain the 
global landslide hazard map of the area.
Procedure for landslide susceptibility mapping:  
	
●	
Defining the Aim for which the landslide susceptibility or hazard information 
is needed
	
●	
Based on the aim for which the map is needed, scale of mapping etc. are to 
be selected
	
	
Find out whether topographic & other information are available on that 
scale, if yes - move further, if not - decide whether such base maps are 
to be created
	
	
If base map to the desired scale are not available we look for Aerial 
Photographs/imageries of an appropriate resolution which will be 
helpful in developing the base map.

4.5 	
Landslide Hazard Zonation (LHZ) Mapping
Susceptibility maps are prepared to locate/identify the areas susceptible to future stability 
problems and the landslide hazard mapping is a step further of susceptibility. Such analysis 
is an iterative process, whereby initially a broad appreciation of the hazard, events, and then 
likelihood (probability) of occurrence, and the resulting consequences are developed. This will 
assist in determining which 
aspects need more in depth 
investigation. The technique 
used in the Hazard mapping 
take into consideration the 
knowledge of past events, 
present condition prevailing 
in the area and anticipation 
of future behavior of slope 
stability. The hazard may 
be 
expressed 
as 
the 
frequency of a particular 
type of landslide of a certain 
volume or landslides of 
a particular type, volume 
and velocity (which may 
vary with distance from the 
landslide source)[52]. Fig. 4.2 
shows the methodologies 
used to prepare landslide hazard mapping[64].

The preparation of landslide hazard map required all the steps of susceptibility mapping in 
preceding section with addition of assessment of landslide frequency, velocity and run out 
distance.
	
*	
In India, Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has formulated guidelines for 
preparation of landslide hazard zonation maps in the year 1998 (BIS -code; 
IS 14496 (Part 2).
	
* 	
“Guideline for Landslide Susceptibility, Hazard and Risk Zoning for Land Use 
Planning” Ref: AGS (2007a) also devised preparation of landslide hazard 
map.
4.5.1	
Recommended Landslide Hazard Zoning Descriptors
The manner in which landslide hazard is described depends on the type of landslide[51]. For 
small slides and rock falls the hazard is described in terms of the number of slides per length 
of source area/annum, or the number of landslides per square kilometer of source area/
annum. For large landslides hazard is described in terms of the annual probability of active 
sliding, or for active slides the annual probability movement will exceed a defined distance or 
the annual probability that cracking within a slide exceeds a defined length.
Table 4.5	 presents recommended descriptors (as given in Australian guidelines) for the most 
common landslide and rock fall situations.
Table 4.5  Recommended Descriptors for Hazard Zoning
Hazard Descriptor

Railways and Small Landslides on Natural Slopes
Number/annum/km
Very High
>10
High
1 to 10
Moderate
0.1 to 1
Low
0.01 to 0.1
Very Low
< 0.01
4.5.2	
Frequency Assessment 
The frequency of landslide may be expressed in terms of the number of landslides of certain 
characteristics that may occur (probability) in the study area in a given span of time (generally 
per year, but the period of reference might be different if required).
For better understanding and useful references of landslide frequency assessment refer to 
Australian Geomechanics “Commentary on Guideline for Landslide Susceptibility, Hazard 
and Risk Zoning for Land Use Planning” AGS (2007b). 
4.5.3	
Intensity Assessment
Intensity is the measure of the damaging capability of the landslide. In slow moving landslides 
persons are not usually endangered while damages to buildings and infrastructures might 
be high although, in some cases, only evidenced after long periods of time. By contrast rapid 
movements of small and large masses may have catastrophic consequences for both persons 
and structures. For this reason it is desirable to describe the intensity of the landslides in the 
zoning study. 



======================================================================
PAGE 37 of 121
======================================================================
IRC:SP:106-2015
30
The same landslide may result in different intensity values along the path (for instance, the 
kinetic energy of a rock fall changes continuously along its trajectory)[33].
4.5.4	
Landslide Characterization, Travel Distance and Velocity
For landslide characterization, travel distance and velocity, refer to Australian Geomechanics 
“Commentary on Guideline for Landslide Susceptibility, Hazard and Risk Zoning for Land Use 
Planning” AGS (2007b). It provides more detail on the activities required to characterize the 
landslides for the four main classes of landslides and suggested useful references. In most 
of the cases where intermediate methods are being used basic methods will also be used. 
For advanced methods, intermediate and basic methods will also be used. Note that much 
of these activities will be carried out in GIS and the terms used here are generic. It should be 
noted that the more advanced the characterization method the larger scale of the mapping 
and level of detail of information and understanding of slope processes is required.
4.6	
Landslide Risk Management 
Figure 4.4 illustrates fundamental framework for landslide risk management[114].
4.6.1	
Landslide Risk Mapping
It takes the outcomes of hazard mapping and assesses the potential damage to persons 
(annual probability the person most at risk loses his or her life) and to property (annual value 
of property loss) for the elements at risk, accounting for temporal and spatial probability and 
vulnerability[51]. In current case it includes risk of life to commuters, travelling vehicles and 
highways.
4.6.2	
Principles for Planning Approaches
1.	
Gather accurate landslide hazard information. 
	
Identifying landslide-prone areas and plotting them on planning maps is essential 
for communicating the risk they may present and mitigating such hazards[50].
2.	
Plan to avoid landslide hazards before development and subdivision.
	
Landslide hazards can be avoided by preventing development on known landslide 
hazard areas. Where avoidance is not possible, mitigation measures can be applied 
to reduce the risk can reduce risk through appropriate engineering works.
3.	
Take a risk-based approach in areas already developed or subdivided.
	
Planning for land use in landslide-prone areas helps to avoid or mitigate the 
increased risks from landslide hazards caused by land-use intensification (such 
as urban in fill) and inappropriate building.
4.	
Communicate risk of landslides in built-up areas.
	
One of the most difficult problems concerning landslide hazards is dealing with 
existing urban areas where buildings/highways are constructed on or close to a 
landslide. The ideal approach in this situation is to avoid further development in 
high-risk landslide prone areas, limit existing-use rights to rebuild, and limit the

Recommended Landslide Risk Zoning Descriptors
Table 4.7 & 4.8 presents the recommended descriptors for landslide risk zoning using life 
loss and property criteria. These are based on annual individual risk for the person most at 
risk. If there is a potential for a large number of persons to be killed in one landslide event 
there should be an assessment of societal risk.

4.6.4	
Risk Analysis
Risk analysis involves acquiring information on landslide hazards, as well as considering 
the consequences if people and property are affected by landslides[50]. Firstly, a thorough 
assessment of the types, characteristics and frequency of landslides in the area of interest is 
carried out as part of the hazard identification. Secondly, a consequence analysis establishes 
the elements at risk (people/property/assets).
4.6.5	
The Elements of Hazard and Vulnerability
These two elements - hazard and vulnerability - are essential in risk assessment: hazard, as 
the probability of occurrence of a harmful natural event, and vulnerability as susceptibility to 
injury or damage if the event occurs, and the ability to protect you against it. This leads to risk 
as the product of the two, expressing the probability of occurrence and the magnitude of the 
possible damage – in other words, the probable loss or injury.
Risk = hazard x vulnerability
However, it is important to remember that a large part of the vulnerability can be reduced 
through human capability for prevention or self-protection (“coping strategies”)[53].The 
absence of coping strategies is part of vulnerability, and has to be taken into account in the 
vulnerability analysis.
4.6.6	
Elements at Risk  
Different levels of hazard can be acceptable to various elements at risk depending on the 
consequences of a landslide occurring at a particular site[50]. The elements at risk are the 
population, buildings and engineering works, economic activities, public services utilities, 
infrastructure and environmental features in the area potentially affected by the landslide 
hazard[33]. These need to be assessed for existing and proposed development.
4.6.7	
Voluntary and Involuntary Risk
Individual and organizations are willing to accept greater voluntary risks, that is, risks that 
are perceived to be within their control. Residential occupants, rarely consider landslide risks 
as voluntary. Such landslide risks are typically considered involuntary and thus landslide 
safety criteria values are likely to be less than the values reported earlier. As normally noticed 
in India, workers are generally at work at even high risk landslide areas in that case risk 
to workers from landslides considered voluntary because employees know that benefits 
(income) are, at least, partial compensation for the perceived risks, provided the risk are 
adequately understood and communicated.
4.6.8	
Measures of Consequence
The consequences of a landslide are commonly described in terms of the cost of damage, 
and the number of deaths or injuries (casualties)[50]. The consequences are often calculated 
using the vulnerability (V) of the elements at risk to the landslide.

IRC:SP:106-2015
33
The factors which most affect vulnerability of property /individual are:
	
 The volume of the slide in relation to the element at risk.
	
	
The position of the element at risk, e.g. on the slide, or immediately down 
slope. 
	
	
The magnitude of slide displacement, and relative displacements within the 
slide (for elements sited on the slide).
	
 The rate of slide movement. 
	
	
Whether the landslide debris buries the person(s).
	
 Whether the person(s) are in the open or enclosed in a vehicle or building.
	
	
Whether the vehicle or building collapses when impacted by debris.
	
	
The type of collapse if the vehicle or building collapses.
It should be noted that the vulnerability refers to the degree of damage (or damage value in 
absolute or relative terms) which is judged to be likely if the landslide does occur.
4.6.9	
Risk Estimation
Risk is the combination of the likelihood and potential consequences of (or vulnerability to) 
a hazard. A landslide hazard may be assessed as “extreme”, but if there are no vulnerable 
elements then there is no risk[50]. Landslide risk analysis is an iterative process, whereby initially 
a broad appreciation of the hazard, events, and then likelihood (probability) of occurrence, 
and the resulting consequences are developed. This will assist in determining which aspects 
need more in depth investigation.
4.6.10	
Quantitative Risk Estimation
Quantitative risk estimation involves integration of the frequency analysis and the 
consequences[138].
The risk can be calculated:
	
	
	
R = PH* PS: H* PT: S* V*E
where,
	
R	
=	
risk (annual probability of loss property value/life).
	
PH	
=	
annual probability of the landslide occurring.
	
PS: H	 =	
spatial probability that the landslide will reach the property/individual, 
	
taking into account the travel distance and travel direction.
	
PT: S	 =	
temporal spatial probability that the individual will be present when 
	
landslide occurs. For houses and other buildings P (T: S) = 1.0. For 
	
Vehicles and other moving elements at risk 1.0 < P (T: S) > 0.
	
V	
=	
vulnerability or probability of life loss/property value loss.
	
E	
=	
element at risk (the value or net present value of the property and number 
	
of people at risk).

4.6.11	
Risk Assessment
Risk assessment involves evaluating risks, making judgments on the acceptability of the 
risks and evaluating remedial options and mitigation measures [50]. Such assessments 
depend on the likelihood (probability) and consequences of the landslide hazard events being 
considered, and societal acceptance of certain risk levels. This is where policy and decision 
makers overlap with the geological and geotechnical professionals in making decisions about 
acceptable risk and appropriate development options.
In assessing the landslide hazard and risk, a local authority should also take account of:
	
●	
community values and expectations (what the community wants and what it 
does not want)
	
●	
which areas are, or are likely to be, under pressure for development
	
●	
what infrastructure already exists near a landslide hazard (buildings, network 
utilities etc) and the value of that infrastructure
	
●	
what level of risk the community is prepared to accept or not accept (in 
practice, it is easier to define what the community will not accept using 
community reactions to past events as a guide)
	
●	
Consideration of the feasibility (effectiveness versus cost) of possible 
engineering solutions or other risk reducing mitigation works.
Landslide risk assessment requires an understanding of the likely magnitude or consequences 
of different types of landslide events, and the risks of injury or loss of life and damage to 
property and investment. It also requires consideration of the cost of clean-up, or repair or 
replacement of damaged property or services after the event. The estimation of risk is relatively 
simple due to the use of a risk matrix, whereby the product of likelihood and consequence 
indicates the level of risk[31].
4.6.12	
Landslide Risk Treatment/Remedial Measures
Risk Treatment is the final stage of the landslide risk management process and provides 
the methodology of controlling the risk. Feasible options for risk mitigation for each risk 
assessment are to be identified and discussed including the reduced risk by adoption of 
those options.
Alternative methods to be explored include[138]:
	
●	
Accept the risk, which is only an option subject to the criteria set by the 
regulator. Where the risk is not tolerable then risk mitigation measures are 
required.
	
●	
Avoid the risk, such as relocation of the site of proposed development, or 
revise the form of the development, or abandon the development (though 
this may still require some risks to be controlled due to possible effect on 
third parties adjacent or nearby).
	
●	
Reduce the frequency of landslide, by stabilization measures to control 
the initiating circumstances, such as by re-profiling the surface geometry 



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:SP:106-2015
35
where existing slopes are ‘over steep’, by provision of improved surface 
water drainage measures, by provision of subsurface drainage scheme, by 
provision of retaining structures such as retaining walls, anchored walls or 
ground anchors etc.
	
●	
Reduce the consequences, by provision of defensive stabilization measures 
or protective measures such as a boulder catch fence, or amelioration of 
the behavior of the landslide, or by relocation of the development to a more 
favorable location.
	
●	
Manage the risk by establishing monitoring and warning systems, such as 
by regular site visits, or by survey, which enable the risks to be managed 
as an interim measure in the short term or as a permanent measure for 
the long term by alerting persons potentially affected to a change in the 
landslide condition. Such systems may be regarded as a method of reducing 
the consequences provided it is feasible for sufficient time to be available 
between the alert being raised and appropriate action being implemented.
	
●	
Transfer the risk, such as by requiring another authority to accept the risk 
(possibly via a court appraisal) or by provision of insurance to cover potential 
property damage.
	
●	
Postpone the decision, where there is sufficient uncertainty resulting from 
the available data, provided that additional investigations or monitoring are 
likely to enable a better risk assessment to be completed. Postponement 
is only a temporary measure and implies the risks are being temporarily 
accepted, even though they may not be acceptable or tolerable.
4.6.13	
Disaster Risk Management - Concept and Areas for Action
Disaster management (DM) includes measures for before (prevention, preparedness, 
risk transfer), during (humanitarian aid, rehabilitation of the basic infrastructure, damage 
assessment) and after disaster (disaster response and reconstruction)[53]. Disaster risk 
management (DRM) (Fig 4.5) is part of disaster management, focusing on the before (risk 
analysis, prevention, preparedness) of the extreme natural event, and relating to during and 
after of the disaster only through risk analysis. DRM is an instrument for reducing the risk 
of disaster primarily by reducing vulnerability, based on social agreements resulting from 
risk analysis. These social agreements are the result of a complex social process in which 
all social strata and interest groups participate. They are a necessary basis for resisting the 
future effects of extreme natural events (prevention, preparedness). The primary area of 
action of a DRM is reducing vulnerability and strengthening self protection capabilities.
Disaster prevention includes those activities which prevent or reduce the negative effects of 
extreme natural events, primarily in the medium to long term. These include political, legal, 
administrative, planning and infrastructural measures.
Preparedness for disasters is intended to avoid or reduce loss of life and damage to property 
if an extreme natural event occurs. The participating institutions and the population at hazard

are prepared for the situation that might arise, and precautions are taken. In addition to 
increasing the alert level, mobilizing the self-help resources of the population for the emergency 
and operating a monitoring system, this includes the following measures:
	
1)	
Participative formulation of emergency and evacuation plans;
	
2)	
Coordination and deployment planning;
	
3)	
Training and upgrading:
	
4)	
Infrastructural and logistical measures, such as emergency accommodation, 
etc and stockpiling food and drugs;
	
5)	
Establishing and/or strengthening local and national disaster protection 
structures and rescue services;
	
6)	
Disaster protection exercises;
	
7)	
Early warning systems. 
Preparedness and prevention measures also include designing and implementing risk 
transfer concepts.

5  METHODS  OF  SCIENTIFIC  INVESTIGATION  OF  SLOPES  AND  LANDSLIDES
The investigation and characterization of surface as well as subsurface conditions form the 
core of landslide studies. The success of mitigation and management agenda of any landslide 
depends upon the quality of investigation carried out on that particular landslide site.
In case of new roads/corridors, the emphasis is on planning, at a stage where there is an 
opportunity to choose the most favorable location for the alignment involving lowest overall 
hazards and risk. The evaluation of terrain through investigations will lead to predict the 
problems or hazards which may likely to occur after construction and consequently suitable 
schemes or plans for mitigation and management of the indentified trouble areas can 
be taken up. But for an existing road network, the focus on effective slope maintenance 
programme, i.e. maintain the slopes at minimal economic cost and identifying slopes most 
at risk, and providing remedial measures to minimize or eliminate risk. The investigation 
should be comprehensive enough that appropriate corrective measures can be taken[58]. So 
investigation is the first step towards understanding the phenomena.
Landslide investigations should be designed with reference to four basic guidelines that have 
evolved over many years of experience:
	
●	
Most landslides or potential failures can be predicted if proper investigations 
are performed in time;
	
●	
The cost of preventing landslides is less than the cost of correcting the 
affected elements, except for small landslides that can be handled by normal 
maintenance procedures;
	
●	
Massive landslides that may cost many times the cost of the original facility 
should be prevented and
	
●	
The occurrence of initial slope movement can lead to additional unstable 
conditions and movements. 
5.1	
Investigation phases
The investigations of landslides have different phases[118] (as shown in Fig. 5.1). As already 
mentioned there are two different conditions (virgin areas i.e. where roads are planned but 
not constructed and non-virgin areas i.e. existing roads which are already affected due to 
landslides) requiring investigation. The purpose of investigation is different for planned and 
existing roads, although some primary phases of investigation are similar in both the cases.
	
	
For the virgin areas, in case of proposed road construction, the susceptibility 
of terrain to landslides and probability of recurrence of such processes is 
determined; Refer to chapter IV for landslide susceptibility mapping.
	
	
While in case of existing landslides on highways, investigation leads 
to identification of the factors, causes, mechanisms, etc; and design of 
preventive measures preferably innovative and cost-effective. It would also 
cover probability of recurrence of existing landslides and susceptibility of 
the terrain to new landslides in future. The landslide susceptibility procedure

as explained in the chapter IV is to be followed in both the cases as per 
requirement.
Fig. 5.1  Flowchart of Methodology Followed for Investigation of Landslides
5.1.1	
Preliminary Investigation
The purpose of the preliminary site investigation is to establish the geological/geotechnical 
feasibility of the site and to determine the extent and precision of detailed surface/subsurface 



======================================================================

investigation required to obtain information needed for design and construction of control/
preventive mitigation measures. The preliminary investigation consists of two parts:
5.1.1.1	
Desk study
The availability of desk study information, together with its scale and level of details, will 
determine the extent to which desk studies can advance feasibility studies prior to embarking 
on detailed fieldwork. The scope of desk study will depend on the availability and quality of 
available information’s.
For detailed information on desk study and its parameters readers may refer to BSI BS 
5930:1981 Code of practice for site investigations 2001. These phases are discussed in 
detail in Special Report 15, IRC State of the Art: Landslide correction technique.
5.1.1.2	
Reconnaissance survey
The site reconnaissance may include both site inspection and local enquiries concerning 
existing and proposed features on and adjacent to the site. With an approximate understanding 
of the overall topographic feature and knowledge of the distinction(s) of movement and aerial 
extent of the slide, a detailed field investigation plan can be developed to delineate the aerial 
extent and a general direction of movement of the landslide zone, assess the geology and 
geologic structure, estimate the cause(s) of the sliding, and predict future movement.
For further consideration of reconnaissance survey for new roads refers to clause 7 of 
IRC:SP:19-2001 & Clause 5.3 of IRC:SP:48-1998. 
5.1.2	
Detailed Field Investigations and Mapping	 	
	
	
The field investigation is the central and decisive part of a study of landslides and landslide-
prone areas[158]. With an approximate understanding of the overall topographic feature and 
knowledge of the distinction of movement and the extent of the sliding blocks, a detailed field 
investigation plan can be developed to delineate the aerial extent and a general direction 
of movement of the landslide zone, assess the geology and geologic structure, estimate 
the causes of the sliding, and predict future movement. A detailed investigation plan can be 
drafted to delineate the:
	
 Type of landslide, its size and mechanism
	
	
Aerial extent of the slide, identification of the direction of deformation
	
 Location and shape of slide plane(s)
	
	
Nature of landslide block(s)
	
	
Possibility of further or future movement on slopes above the existing slide
	
	
Distribution of ground water
	
 Type of soil in the site area

5.1.2.2	
Landslide hazard inventory, susceptibility, zonation and risk assessment
In landslide investigation use of inventory, susceptibility and zonation maps can cut the cost 
of road maintenance to a great extent. The utilization of these maps allows understanding the 
degree of vulnerability the terrain is having for landslide hazard and the location of existing 
landslides. This can help in optimizing the loss of construction of road, reduction in cost and 
time for maintenance after construction; reduce risk to life and property etc.
For further description of above topic refers to chapter four “Landslide Hazard Mapping, 
Vulnerability and Risk Assessment”.
5.1.2.3	
Investigation of surface deformation
The investigation of surface deformation is conducted to define the boundaries of the landslide, 
size, level of activity and direction(s) of the movement, and to determine individual moving 
blocks of the main slide. Instrumentation used for the surface deformation investigation 
includes extensometers, ground tilt meters, and movement determination by survey methods 
including transverse survey, grid survey, laser survey from the opposite bank, movement 
determination by aerial photographs, and G.P.S. (Chapter VII gives detailed information 
about the types of instruments required for an investigation).
During this phase, a detailed identification of terrain conditions, geologic formations, buried 
stream beds, soil and rock formations need to be carried out with extensive use of aerial 
photography and remote sensing and other types of mapping like topographical maps, 
geological maps, geomorphological maps etc.
5.1.2.4	
Geotechnical investigation
In order to conduct slope stability analyses and to design appropriate control measures 
for landslides, physical properties such as strength of slide plane, location and depth of 
slide plane and stable ground areas must be determined. The following tests are generally 
performed;
	
	
Physical tests, Standard Penetration Tests (Refer to section 21.2.1 of 
Geoguide 2, Hong Kong, 1987: page 111),
	
	
Soil mechanic tests (unconfined compression, tri-axial compression box 
shear, ring shear, and in-situ shear (refer to IS:7746-1991 for in-situ data 
sheet of shear test of rocks; IS:13047-1991; section 3.2 of chapter 12 of 
the TRB Special Report 247, Landslides; Investigation and mitigation). 
IS:11229-1985; IS:11593-1986 covers specifications for shear box used as 
an assembly for testing of soils. BIS (IS:13365-1998; IS:13365-1992; 13365;

on geomechanics classification system which is also called the Rock Mass 
Rating (RMR) system.
5.1.2.5	
Subsurface investigation
Generally there are five types of field subsurface investigation methods:
1)	
Disturbed sampling: Disturbed samples are generally obtained to determine the 
soil type, gradation, classification, consistency, density, presence of contaminants, 
stratification, etc. Clause 5.1 of IS:1892:1979 gives the types of samples and 
methods of sampling to be used for both soil and rock.
2)	
Undisturbed sampling: These samples are used to determine the in-place 
strength, compressibility, natural moisture content, unit weight, permeability, 
discontinuities, fractures, fissures of subsurface deposits. The various tests 
that are necessary for different phases of exploration are given in Table 3; 
IS:1892-1979 (Reapproved 2002). Appendix E of IS:1892: 1979 (reapproved 
2002), gives an outline for handling and sampling of rock and soil samples. ASTM 
D420-87: presents the standard guide for investigating and sampling soil and 
rock.
3)	
In situ investigation: In situ methods can be particularly effective when they are 
used in conjunction with conventional sampling to reduce the cost and time for 
field work. In-situ tests are used to provide field measurements of soil and rock 
properties. The common in-situ tests performed are presented in Table 5.1.:

Geophysical investigation
Geophysical methods are used for prospection of landslide bodies, detection of discontinuities 
and shear surfaces, as well as for investigation of hydrological regimes. However gaps exist 
and wider application of geophysics in landslide research have been hindered for two reasons: 
geophysical methods provide images of geophysical parameters which are not directly 
linked to geological parameters required by geotechnical engineers and geomorphologists; 
and the overestimation of the quality and reliability of results among some geophysicists. 
The development of 2D and 3D geophysical techniques has aroused a growing interest 
for assessing the landslide volume, characterizing the physical properties of the landslide 
material and locating the groundwater flows within and around the slide.

Methodology for the measurement of subsurface conditions by seismic refractions and 
planning of the survey is given in IS:15681-2006. Appendix B of IS:1892-1979 (Reapproved 
2002) gives an outline of electrical resistivity and seismic methods used. Refer to Clause B.1 
of Appendix B of IS:1892-1979 (Reapproved 2002).
For detailed account about the methods of site exploration refers to “Code of practice for 
subsurface investigation for foundations are given in IS:1892:1979 (Reapproved 2002)”. 
Subsurface explorations should be carried out in two stages; preliminary and detailed as 
mentioned in IS:1892:1979 (Reapproved 2002).
Laboratory testing for soils: The geotechnical engineer should conduct sufficient in situ 
and/or laboratory testing to characterize the physical geotechnical parameters of the earth 
materials affecting the proposed development.
A method for various tests of soils and preparation of samples can be found in IS 2720 from 
Part I-41.
Laboratory testing for rocks: Table 5 of BS 5930:1981 gives the standard practice for 
laboratory tests on rock. Also Table 9 of BS 5930:1981 gives a guide for identification of 
rocks for engineering purposes. Reference should be made to Section 6 BS 5930:1981 of

Ground water investigation
Investigation of ground water, which is a driving force of sliding, includes determining ground 
water level, pore water pressure, ground water logging, ground water tracing test, pumping 
test, water quality analysis, electricity survey, geothermal survey, and geophysical logging 
(electric logging and radioactive logging). Based on the results of the above measurements 
and tests, ground water control works can be planned and designed.
Different types of piezometers are explained in IS:7436 (Part I-1993); IS:8282 
(Part II-1996); Section 20.2.3., 20.2.4., 20.2.5., 20.2.6 of Geoguide 2, Hong Kong., 1987 
and their installation procedure is discussed in 20.2.7). Detailed information regarding 
groundwater level observations can be obtained from ASTM D 4750.
5.2	
Enforcing Remedial/Control Measures
Identifying, the need for corrective works and remediation procedures is a critical component 
of any investigation report in order to prevent the initiation of future landslide from the unstable 
and weak geometry of the Relic of the slide. Measures should be provided in order to stabilize 
the slide and prevent the formation of other slides in the disturbed areas.
Chapter VIII is exclusively dedicated to remedial measures. 
6  Instrumentation,  Monitoring,  Forecasting  and   
Early  Warning  of  Landslides
Instrumentation, monitoring, forecasting and early warning of landslides empower individuals 
and communities to respond timely and appropriately to the hazards in order to reduce the 
risk of death, injury, property loss and damage.
Monitoring provides means of accurately and objectively gauging the stability conditions of 
unstable or potentially unstable slopes; it can also play an important role in assessing risk. 
Landslide monitoring includes the comparison of landslide characteristics like areal extent, 
speed of movement, surface topography and soil humidity from different periods in order 
to access landslide activity[149]. Long-term risk monitoring to identify developing trends and 
provide early warning information. Monitoring and predicting systems, when associated with 
communication system and response plans, is considered early warning systems (EWS)[49] 
(See Fig. 6.1). The capacity to observe, predict landslides and map vulnerabilities requires 
a huge technological investment in observing networks, forecasting systems, monitoring 
instruments, communication and dissemination platforms and modern sensors. Therefore 
only selective landslides of critical nature are required to be identified and monitored.

Objectives of Instrumentation, Monitoring, Forecasting and Early Warning
	
●	
Determining the depth, shape, rate and scale of slope/ground movements so 
that calculations can be made to define the appropriate strength parameters 
at failure and design remedial treatments.
	
●	
Monitoring of the activity of marginally stable natural or cut slopes and 
identification of effects of construction activity or precipitation.
	
●	
Monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of various control 
measures[171].
	
●	
To take action to protect or reduce loss of life or to mitigate damage and 
economic loss, before the disaster occurs.
	
●	
Primary objective of a EWS is to empower individuals and communities to 
respond timely and appropriately to the hazards in order to reduce the risk of 
death, injury, property loss and damage[178].
6.2	
Why and Where the Instrumentation
The increasing trend of the landslide incidences and recurrences along the highways is quite 
alarming and raise concerns regarding the stability of landslide prone areas along these 
highways and their potential impact to the safety of the travelling public, infrastructure, their 
property and environment. There are many major landslides along the Highways which are 
critical in nature and recurring every year. Thereby not only disrupting communication but 
also in many instances killing people. Many of such landslides are source of continuous 
trouble for the travelling public as well as the inhabitants. In addition to that these slides act 
as a bottleneck at the time of dire need during any disastrous situation where evacuation and 
early response is key to successful disaster management. Such identified critically known 
landslides should be monitored suitably for early warning to take timely steps to avoid, life

loss, property and hardship on long traffic closures etc. The information about forecasting of 
the critical landslides should be integrated with the web server so that the same is available 
to all concerned to avoid risk and danger to public as well as alarm to the communication and 
transportation managers.
6.3	
Techniques of Monitoring Landslides
Monitoring of landslides can be done in 3 ways:
	
●	
Measuring inherent factors like strength and stress parameters of slope 
masses.
	
●	
Measuring external factors like earthquake vibrations, rainfall and climatic 
conditions.
	
●	
Measuring strains, displacements, or release of energy due to slope 
movements or failures.
6.3.1	
Step Required in Monitoring of Landslides
	
●	
Selection of specific location depending upon the type of movement, location, 
hazard and risk value of slope failure.
	
●	
Selection of monitoring methods and frequency of data collection.
	
●	
Data processing and methods/instruments of presentation of results.
6.3.2	
Surface Monitoring
Surface movement may be horizontal or vertical. Horizontal movements are measures with 
surveying methods. This primarily involves distance measurements. Vertical movements are 
measured with settlement gauges. Surface methods to measure development of cracks, uplift 
and subsidence include repeated conventional surveying and installation of instruments to 
measure movements directly. Deformation measurement on surface of entire slope indicates 
existence of instability. Geotechnical and geophysical equipments used in surface/subsurface 
deformation are discussed in Annexure 1 Table 8.
6.3.2.1	
Surveying methods and equipments
Surveying methods (Table 6.1 & Annexure 1 Table 4) are generally used for monitoring the 
magnitude and rate of vertical and horizontal movement of the ground surface, structures, 
and accessible parts of subsurface instruments. Two basic methods for the design of a 
deformation survey can be used:
	
●	
A horizontal or vertical control network is established in the area under 
investigation with control points located in the deforming region[154].
	
●	
Geodetic Surveying: Several surveying methodologies are used to investigate 
the activity of existing landslides. Two main classes are identifiable: point 
based (Total Station, GPS) and area based techniques (Photogrammetry,

Laser Scanning and Remote Sensing, in particular spaceborne radar 
interferometry). The geodetic methodologies like triangulation and distance 
measurements with electronic instruments permit a very high accuracy. By 
means of GPS (Global Positioning System) or Total Stations it is possible 
to detect movements on the order of mm/yr or cm/yr, and estimate the 
boundary of the landslide area. There are also several promising Remote 
Sensing techniques used to generate DEMs for landslide monitoring and 
characterized by high level of accuracy, in particular the new generation of 
high-resolution satellite imagery and mostly Interferometric SAR (Synthetic 
Aperture Radar). Photogrammetry is the technique most commonly used for 
this kind of survey, permitting to reconstruct the three dimensional landslide 
shapes with great wealth of information and to study its 3D. evolution over 
time. The development of digital photogrammetry offers today new possibilities 
and innovative procedures, like the creation of DSMs (Digital Surface Model) 
in automatic mode for the reconstruction of surfaces and the generation of 
orthoimages.

designed steel pedestals have been installed in preselected locations within the slide body 
and adjacent area[84]. Their original position was recorded using DGPS (Differential Global 
Positioning System) and TS (Total Station). Subsequent monitoring with DGPS and TS was 
done. It was noticed that the pedestals installed within the slide boundary did not move much 
except at only few locations. These locations were on the loose debris mass and rest of 
the pedestals which, have shown movement were located near and around the crown part 
indicating the movement only above the crown. Monitoring results when matched with field 
condition indicated surficial movement from the crown part. These results coincide with the 
activity of slide observed mostly from above the crown part. At that stage sufficient warning 
was passed to take immediate measures before the coming monsoon season.
6.3.2.2	
Monitoring through remotely sensed methods
New tools of mapping like Earth observation satellites and remote sensing are able to provide 
significant information for mapping the extent and properties of landslides. The powerful In 
SAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) tools, which provide accurate topography 
and motion maps, can make significant contributions to the assessment and mitigation of 
landslide hazards[154].
	
●	
Interferometric SAR, whether satellite or ground-based (InSAR and DInSAR 
(Differential Interferometric SAR)) are the techniques most used for slope 
motion monitoring.
	
●	
Optical and infrared regions of the spectrum are used for monitoring purposes 
using high resolution images like IKONOS and QUICKBIRD, multi-temporal 
aerial photogrammetry.
	
●	
Space and air-borne microwave applications for monitoring movement 
using SAR interferometry from satellites like the Radarsat, ERS (European 
Remote Sensing), Envisat ASAR (Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar) 
or forthcoming Terra SAR-X, ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite), 
and Cosmo (Constellation of small Satellites for the Mediterranean basin 
Observation)/Skymed.
	
●	
Ground based differential SAR interferometry.	
	
●	
Visual interpretation of aerial photography is still the most commonly used 
technique to support the elaboration of landslide inventories and also 
commonly used to reconstruct the evolution of landslide over time.
The contribution of remote sensing to the mapping, monitoring, spatial analysis and hazard 
prediction of mass movements has largely been in the form of stereo air photos and satellite 
images interpretations of landslide characteristics (e.g., distribution and classification) and 
factors (e.g., slope, lithology, geostructure, landuse/land cover, rock anomalies). Refer to 
Table 5 of Annexure 1 for information of types of microwave satellites.

6.3.3	
Subsurface Monitoring
Subsurface deformation measurements is required if sliding occurs and depth of sliding is not 
apparent from surface measurements and visual observations. Subsurface measurement 
includes horizontal deformation, vertical deformation and groundwater pressure which 
normally are required. Measurements of subsurface horizontal deformation provides basis for 
effective safeguard, install monitoring instruments that can identify mechanism of movement 
and any time-related change of stability-affecting factors[36].
Primary instrument for monitoring lateral, subsurface deformations is the inclinometer, rod 
extensometer, the details of which are given in Table 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4.

Monitoring of Groundwater
Monitoring of ground water, which is a driving force of sliding, includes determining ground 
water level, pore water pressure, ground water logging, ground water tracing test, pumping 
test, water quality analysis, electricity survey, geothermal survey, and geophysical logging 
(electric logging and radioactive logging)[118]. Based on the results of the above measurements 
and tests, ground water control works can be planned and designed.
Monitoring of pore water pressure is essential for effective stress analysis of the slide prone 
area. Pore pressure measurements are required especially around the failure plane for 
control measures to be adopted as well as for mitigating potential slides. The installation of a 
suitably placed piezometer is however preferable as the information obtained is more easily 
interpreted. Piezometers are instruments installed in the ground to measure pore-water 
pressures. Commonly used for landslide monitoring applications; standpipe, pneumatic, and 
electric.
Refer Annexure 1 Table 6 and 7 for different types of piezometers and the factors on which 
they should be selected.
For detail description of piezometers refer to IRC Special report 15 “State of the art: Landslide 
Correction Techniques”

Planning of instrumentation
Adequate planning is required before a specific landslide is instrumented. The plan should 
proceed through the following stages[171]:
	
●	
Identification of landslides to be monitored its purpose and outcome 
expected.
	
●	
Determination of types of measurements required and selection of the specific 
types of instrument best suited to make the required measurements;
	
●	
Definition of the location and depth of instrumentation and number of 
instruments;
	
●	
Development of the data acquisition techniques (manual, online) and
	
●	
Decision as to the management and presentation of the data acquired
6.4.1	
Instrument Selection, Installation, Monitoring and Interpretation
In field instrumentation monitoring, plans are developed to select and install the appropriate 
instrumentation (Table 6.5 gives various parameters on which instruments are selected and 
used.) and collect and interpret the data. This step is often the most difficult to accomplish.
Table 6.5  Various Parameters on which Instruments are Selected and Used
Concerning elements
Description
Critical parameters
When the parameters are identified, the specification for instruments should include the 
required range, resolution, and precision of measurements.
Complementary Parameters
The behavior of a soil or rock mass typically involves not one, but many parameters. In 
some cases, it may be sufficient to monitor only one parameter, but when the problem is 
more complex, it is useful to measure a number of parameters and to look for correlation 
between the measurements.
Ground Conditions
Ground conditions sometimes affect the choice of instrument. For example, a standpipe 
piezometer is a reliable indicator of pore-water pressure in soil with high permeability, but 
is much less reliable in soil with low permeability. A better choice in this case would be a 
diaphragm-type piezometer.
Environmental Conditions
Temperature and humidity also affect instrument choice. Instruments such as hydraulic 
piezometers and liquid settlement gauges have limited use in freezing weather. In tropical 
heat and humidity, simple mechanical devices may be more reliable than electrical 
instruments.
Data Acquisition
An automatic data acquisition system may be required when there is a need for real-time 
monitoring and automatic alarms. If a data acquisition system is required, the choice of 
instruments should be narrowed to those that can be connected to the system easily and 
inexpensively.
Instrument Life
Are readings needed only during project or will they be needed for years afterwards? 
Instruments, signal cables, and protective measures should be selected accordingly.
Instrument Quality
The difference in cost between a high-quality instrument and a lesser-quality instrument 
is generally insignificant when compared to the total cost of installing and monitoring an 
instrument. For example, the cost of drilling and backfilling a borehole is typically 10 to 20 
times greater than the cost of the piezometer that goes in it.
Instrument
Performance
Instrument performance is specified by range, resolution, accuracy, and precision. The 
economical designer will specify minimum performance requirements, since the cost of an 
instrument increases with resolution, accuracy, and precision.

Reading, Recording and Data Transmission
The frequency of reading will depend upon the situation and the nature of the changes which 
the instruments are being used to monitor. Any readings which indicate a marked change in 
conditions should be checked immediately. The calibration of some instruments can change 
with time and re-calibration may become necessary. Duplication of instruments in critical 
areas will aid the interpretation of readings[48]. All instrument readings should be plotted on a 
time base so the significance of variations can be assessed more easily.
Automated data recording and transmission can be undertaken in several ways, each 
reflecting different levels of automation, investment, and sophistication. This type of system 
requires periodic visits to the site to download the data. Remote data acquisition equipment 
includes:

Power source.

In addition, specialized software is necessary to program and interact with 
the datalogger.
6.5	
Developing Technologies for Monitoring Ground Movement[121]
	
●	
TDR Cable: Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) is an alternative method 
of detecting ground movements that utilizes coaxial cables grouted within 
boreholes or embedded within fills or structures. Ground displacements 
deform the cable and change the travel time of an electrical pulse. In theory, the 
signal alteration through the deformed section also provides an approximate 
measure of the magnitude of displacement. The benefits of this system 
include simple–quick readout, remote monitoring and data acquisition, and 
ability to survive large ground deformations. A limitation is the inability to 
measure the direction of sliding and small rates of movement.
	
●	
Digital Bluetooth inclinometer: Digital inclinometer probes have recently 
been introduced by several manufacturers. Micro-Electro Mechanical 
Systems (MEMS) accelerometers are positioned within the inclinometer 
probe. MEMS are designed to integrate small sensors on a single chip.
	
●	
Wireless In-Place MEMS Systems: This type of instrumentation consists 
of a string of closely spaced MEMS accelerometers combined with an 
Automated Data Acquisition System (ADAS) that provides near real-time in-
place monitoring. 
	
●	
Vibrating Wire Inclinometer: These instruments are being developed for 
IPIs and other ground movement instrumentation.
	
●	
Fiber Optic Inclinometer: Fiber-optic sensors use light guided in the fiber to 
perform high-resolution measurements. The measuring core is flexible and 
contains an optical setup with mirrors. The fully symmetric internal structure 
of the inclinometer makes it insensitive to temperature variations that affect 
the whole measuring core.
Recently, Electromagnetic Pulse Radiation, a geophysical method for detecting landslide 
areas of the types sliding, spreading and flowing has been developed. It is based on the 
registration of natural electromagnetic emissions. The new method can be used on the 
surface and in boreholes to identify not only landslide areas but also volcanic and earthquake 
prone zones. The instrument, called Cereskop, can be operated by just one person. (Refer 
to: Krauter. E- New methods of investigation and controlling of landslides)
6.6	
Prediction
Slopes which are already in movement, monitoring is often the only chance for a prediction[30]. 
The prediction accuracy for the location and size of the landslide event will continue to improve 
as more data is collected by the monitoring system.

Amrita Center for Wireless Networks and Applications provides a framework for Wireless 
Sensor Network (WSN), focused on is for purpose of detecting natural disasters[139]. WSN 
can be useful to disaster management in two ways. Firstly, WSN has enabled a more 
convenient early warning system and secondly, WSN provides a system able to learn 
about the phenomena of natural disasters. Wireless Sensors are one of the cutting edge 
technologies that can quickly respond to rapid changes of data and send the sensed data 
to a data analysis center in areas where cabling is inappropriate. WSN technology has the 
capability of quick capturing, processing, and transmission of critical data in real-time with 
high resolution. However, it has its own limitations such as relatively low amounts of battery 
power and low memory availability compared to many existing technologies. It does, though, 
have the advantage of deploying sensors in hostile environments with a bare minimum of 
maintenance. This fulfills a very important need for any real time monitoring, especially in 
hazardous or remote scenarios.
This landslide detection system using a WSN is the first in India, one of the first in the world 
of its kind. It is also one of the first landslide field deployments backed up by a laboratory 
setup and modeling software. The current system (Fig. 6.4) can be replicated in other rainfall 
induced landslide prone areas around the world.
Fig. 6.4  Wireless Sensor Network Architecture for Landslide Detection
A new type of sound sensor system (Fig. 6.5) has been developed to predict the likelihood 
of a landslide. Developed by researchers at Loughborough University, in collaboration with

the British Geological Survey, it works by measuring and analyzing the acoustic behavior 
of soil to establish when a landslide is going to occur so that preventive measures can be 
undertaken. Noise created by movement under the surface builds an increasing growth of 
loudness as the slope becomes unstable and so gauging the increased rate of generated 
sound enables accurate prediction of a soil collapse. The detection system consists of a 
network of sensors buried across the hillside or embankment that presents a risk of collapse. 
The sensors, acting as microphones in the subsoil, record the acoustic activity of the soil 
across the slope and each transmits a signal to a central computer for  analysis. 
Fig. 6.5  A New Sensor for Early Warning of Landslides
This technique can also be used in monitoring the condition of potentially unstable slopes 
built to support transport infrastructure, such as rail and road embankments. The system is 
now being developed further to produce low cost, self-contained sensors that do not require a 
central computer. It is now focused on manufacturing of very low cost sensors with integrated 
visual and/or audible alarms, for use in developing countries.
Central Scientific Instruments Organization (CSIO), a laboratory of Central Scientific Industrial 
Research (CSIR) presents a case study of landslide monitoring and early warning of Mansa 
Devi (Haridwar), located at Haridwar by pass road. Data recorded by instrumentation network 
installed at Mansa Devi landslide site by five sensors (Rain Gauge, Inclinometer, Tiltmeter, 
Crack meter and Earth pressure cell) was analyzed and a relationship between rainfall 
intensity-surface parameters and landslide occurrence drawn with neuro-fuzzy approach for 
predation of landslide and concept of early warning system is also described. For further 
description refer to paper “Mittal et al 2011, Analysis of data using neuro-fuzzy approach 
recorded by instrumentation network installed at Mansa Devi (Haridwar) landslide site”.

Forecasting
In terms of time, forecasts can be roughly divided into three classes of lead time:
	
I.	
Long-term forecasts mostly indicate a potential hazard within a certain region, 
years before they actually occur. 
	
	
First step towards a landslide forecast is a systematic collection of data in 
a landslide hazard zonation map[28]. An ideal map of slope instability hazard

should provide information on the spatial probability, type, magnitude, velocity, 
runout distance and retrogression limit of the mass movements predicted in 
a certain area. These maps can be interpreted as first long-term forecast. 
Although, they cannot predict the exact time of an event and cover a region, 
rather than a specific slope, they indicate a potential hazard several years in 
advance of an event.
	
II.	
Mid-term forecasts predict failures several months ahead and
	
	
A routine survey of landslide prone areas or slopes provides information 
about the progress of unstable masses[28]. Routine surveys allow monitoring 
with lead times of years to months for mid-term forecasts.
	
III.	
Short-term predictions have a lead time of months to days 
	
	
Digital tools such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Digital Image 
Processing, Digital Photogrammetry and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) 
are applied in forecasting landslides. Of late generation of Digital Elevation 
Models (DEM) obtained from different sources like Synthetic Aperture Radar 
(SAR) or Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) are also applied.
Forecasting the time of slope failure can be done by the following procedure
	
I.	
Measurement of the relative displacements of a slope across tension cracks 
or along the centre line, depending on field conditions.
	
II.	
Determination of the beginning of the unstable state of the slope through the 
relative displacement curve.
	
III.	
Calculation of the constant strain rate from the relative displacement curve.
	
IV.	
Estimation of creep rupture life corresponding to the strain rate, using the 
relationship between strain rate and creep rupture life.
6.8	
Early Warning and its Importance
Early Warning (EW) is “the provision of timely and 
effective information, through identified institutions, 
that allows individuals exposed to hazard to take 
action to avoid or reduce their risk and prepare for 
effective response[49].”, and is the integration of four 
main elements (i.e. design, monitoring, forecasting 
and education) Fig. 6.6.
6.8.1	
Early Warning Systems for Landslides
EWS are based on either spatial warnings with 
to respect triggers and specifically to hydro-
meteorological events, or on locally installed 
monitoring devices. These systems focus on the 
technical aspects of early warning and do not take 
into consideration the whole chain of early warning 
including monitoring, analysis, establishing alert Fig. 6.6  Main Elements of Early Warning

thresholds, and issuing warnings and up to the societal responses including responsibilities. 
EWSs are extremely site-specific and may greatly vary depending on the scale, type of 
landslide, element at risk, etc[61]. Some of the early warning systems are described below:
	
1.	
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN): WSN consist of spatially distributed 
autonomous devices using sensors to cooperatively monitor physical or 
environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound, vibration, pressure, 
motion or pollutants, at different locations. Each node in a sensor network is 
typically equipped with a radio transceiver or other wireless communications 
device, a small micro controller, and an energy source, usually a battery.

systems, as well as the modern information systems under consideration

on three sensor types measuring acceleration, inclination and pressure to 
monitor landslide initiation. (Arnhardt, C et al. 2007. Sensor based Landslide

vibrations, an alert is released and for traffic can be stopped outside the 
danger zone. (Matthias Busslinger, 2009. Landslide time-forecast methods, A

6.8.2	
Challenges of Early Warning Systems
The key challenge in EWS is translating warning into concrete local action, even for those 
with effective capacities for forecasting, detecting and monitoring hazards and suitable 
technologies for disseminating advance warnings. Along with technical difficulties of landslide 
hazard prediction, legal, social and political dimensions add to the complexity of early warning.

7  LANDSLIDE  RISK  REDUCTION  THROUGH  IMPROVED  PLANNING,   
DESIGN  AND  CONSTRUCTION  PRACTICES
The standard of good practices for landslide reduction and their management for effective 
planning, investigation, design and construction of projects that involve highway slopes and 
their maintenance is must.
7.1 
Planning of Highways Projects
The problem of coping with slope hazards revolves around two questions:
	
	
On intended new road alignments, how to minimize the incidence of 
potential damage from landslides. In this case, corridors or alignments need 
to be compared so that the route involving the lowest overall hazard can 
be selected. The emphasis is on planning, at a stage where there is an 
opportunity to choose the most favorable location for the alignment,
	
	
For an existing network, how to manage a slope maintenance programme, 
i.e. maintain the slopes at minimal economic cost. Here, the focus is on 
identifying slopes most at risk, and measuring or monitoring an existing 
geotechnical asset.
7.1.1	
Planning of new Highway Projects
7.1.1.1	
Alignment selection
Planning of a new highway is a repetitive process which involves transport, highway, 
environmental, geological and geotechnical professionals. The purpose here is to find a safe 
alignment or review options for alignments. This involves defining potential hazardous zones 
in the landscape, avoiding them where possible or identifying appropriate design options 
where avoidance is not possible[116]. Decisions made at the route selection stage for highways 
may have long-term effects on road construction and maintenance costs, user safety, and 
other resources. Routes must be selected and located to meet the objectives of higher-level 
plans within the constraints of any approved operational plans or permits.
Most of the things required for above purpose are already mentioned in example every 
important details of pertaining to landslide and other mass movement.
The IRC:SP:20-2002, Rural Roads Manual & IRC:SP:48-1998, “Hill Road Manual” gives 
detailed guidance on selection of the alignment.
7.1.1.2	
Report
The reconnaissance report should identify and or confirm:
	
	
Terrain conditions and road sections that are in unstable or potentially 
unstable terrain.
	
	
Control points and topographic features (e.g., rock bluffs, swamps, avalanche 
paths, landslides, and debris slides), including those that may be used as 
photo ties.



======================================================================
PAGE 66 of 121
======================================================================

IRC:SP:106-2015
59
	
	
The sections of road that encroach on public utilities.
	
	
All continuous and intermittent drainage flow channels, springs, seeps, and 
wet areas.
	
	
Riparian areas.
	
 Forest covers (species composition, timber quality, and volume per 
hectare).
	
 Recommended slash and debris disposal methods and additional clearing 
widths required for the slash and debris disposal.
	
	
Soil types based on visual observations of exposed cuts, shallow hand dug 
test holes and probing, and the location of these soils on maps or aerial 
photos (see Appendix 1 for a method of identifying soils).
	
 Maximum road grades and minimum curve radii.
	
	
Location and extent of bedrock, if rippable, and the potential as ballast.
	
	
Location and extent of gravel sources and the potential for use as subgrade 
and surfacing materials.
	
 Geological details encompassing type of lithology, their stratigraphic 
sequence, structural setup such as faults/thrust/joints/fractures etc.
7.1.1.3	
Survey level selection
There are two general types of surveys: a field traverse and a location survey. To determine 
which survey type and level to recommend in the reconnaissance report, the physical 
characteristics of the terrain, design complexity, and desired road prism geometry should be 
considered.
7.1.1.4	
Road plans to mitigate slope hazard
In areas of complex geology a balance has often to be achieved between what is theoretically 
desirable in terms of frequent design variation along an alignment and the practicalities of 
construction and cost. A pragmatic approach is to develop a few standard, generic slope 
designs for costing purposes, knowing that these will be modified in the light of information 
recovered when the ground is opened up during construction[116].
7.1.1.5	
Criteria for measures to maintain slope stability
If a proposed road will cross areas with a moderate or high likelihood of landslides, the 
measures to maintain slope stability must be prepared by a qualified professional. The 
recommendations should be site specific and precise so that the road designer cannot 
misunderstand them. He or she should also provide the results of the measures to maintain 
slope stability as they apply to the road prism, or adjacent to the road prism, separately from 
other recommendations.
It must include measures to maintain slope stability that satisfy either:
	
	
Criteria 1 (hazard-based) – In these criteria, the selected measure is the 
least likely measure to result in a landslide, and the qualified professional 
provides a statement to this effect.



======================================================================
PAGE 67 of 121
======================================================================
IRC:SP:106-2015
60
	
	
Criteria 2 (risk-based) - In this criteria, the selected measure is based on an 
analysis (i.e., landslide risk assessment) made by a qualified professional.
7.1.1.6	
Geotechnical Review
It is mandatory to carry out some form of geotechnical review for planning of new highway/
alignment as it will help in identifying the landslide hazard and critical issues that can influence 
a highway project. Geotechnical review provides relevant information on:
	
●	
Scope of the geotechnical work,
	
●	
Cost and time requirements, for investigation, design , construction and 
maintenance of the geotechnical work,
	
●	
Hazard mitigation measures, land-take, cost, programming, professionals 
required for investigation, design, construction and maintenance of the 
chosen route alignment.
In Geotechnical Review, following tasks is to be carried out:
STEP 1:
1)	
Search for, obtain and study;
	
i.	
Information relevant to the project from all potential sources including the 
landslide database, landslide inventory maps, boulder inventory maps, 
records of annual rainfall and landslide reports, landslide study reports etc.
	
ii.	
Relevant past site investigation records, geotechnical design reports and 
construction reports.
	
iii.	
Published geological maps.
	
iv.	
Relevant services and utilities records.
	
v.	
Study the most recent set of topographical maps and at least two sets of 
good quality of aerial photographs (Refer to IRC:SP:48-1998).
2)	
Carry out a detailed walkover survey of the proposed alignment(s) and nearby to:
	
●	
Prepare records on key natural terrain and man-made geotechnical features, 
paying attention to recording any signs of ground instability and landslide 
hazards.
	
●	
Undertake the necessary topographical survey (IRC:SP:48-1998), geological, 
geomorphological and seepage mapping.
3)	
Assess the general topographical, geological hydrological and groundwater 
conditions along the proposed highway corridor as outlined in IRC:SP:48-1998 
and refine the project boundaries.
4)	
Carry out a Natural Terrain Hazard Review.
5)	
Identify all existing man-made slope features along the tentative alignment and 
nearby that could affect or be affected by the proposed highway, determine their 
date of construction where possible.



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:SP:106-2015
61
6)	
Carry out a preliminary assessment of the site conditions and the identified 
landslide hazard that could significantly impact on the cost and programming of 
the project, in particular :
	
●	
Assess the impact of the potential landslide hazard from natural terrain 
(e.g: boulder falls), determine the extent of the terrain that needs to be further 
assessed and outline the likely mitigation strategy required.
	
●	
Determine the safety standard for all of the existing man-made slope features 
based on the anticipated use of the highway and outline the necessary 
investigation and assessment of their stability or the likely landslide preventive 
works required to upgrade the features to the current safety standard.
	
●	
Identify any new man-made slope features that are will likely be formed and 
determine the required design standard.
	
●	
Prepare a preliminary report of ground investigation works.
7) 	
Based on the above work:
	
● 	
Assess how the identified geotechnical features, hazards and constraints 
may affect the proposed highway alignment and recommend adjustment of 
the corridor, if it is considered necessary.
	
● 	
Identify the contractual and construction management issues (e.g. 
supervision, design review, traffic constraints, safety of road users, blasting 
control, etc) related to the likely geotechnical work and landslide mitigation 
measures.
	
● 	
Provide preliminary estimates of the potential costs, programming and 
geotechnical personnel requirement for the investigation, design and 
construction of geotechnical works.
STEP 2:
Based on the available information carry out a comparative assessment of the alternative 
corridor/alignment in particular; 
	
●	
Rank the alternatives based on the magnitude of the geotechnical hazards 
present along each proposed corridor/route.
	
●	
Recommend the appropriate rating to be applied for use in a balanced 
evaluation of the geotechnical factors with other factors where such evaluation 
process is required.
STEP 3:
A review report should be produced documenting the work done, the information examined, 
the findings and recommendations, schematic plans and cross sections at critical locations 
of the geotechnical works and landslide hazard mitigation measures to be proposed for the 
project. The report shall also include a hazard map showing the corridor alignment, the source 
and area extent of all landslide hazards identified, the details of all existing slope features 
including those to be upgraded and new slope features to be formed under the project, the

IRC:SP:106-2015
62
principal drainage courses and the probable direction of and limits of travel of any landslide 
debris from natural terrain.
7.1.1.7	
Critical sites
More intensive assessment of ground conditions is required where an alignment is forced to 
cross areas that are known to be unstable or marginal, to ensure that the route is adequately 
protected while not wasting money on over-elaborate protection in a situation where the risk 
of damage or loss is high.
In this situation a detailed landslide hazard map at a suitable scale of the zone needs to be 
made, in order to indicate the hazardous parts where slope protection measures and special 
design considerations for the carriageway are required. Slope monitoring may be appropriate 
at specific locations, to measure, for example, the rate of slope movement, landslide recession 
or erosion[116].
7.1.2	
Planning for Existing Highways
Primary concern for the highway slopes is the stability of the slopes. Scope of planning for 
existing highways can vary widely, ranging from upgrading of a road to local improvements 
of a road’s alignment like widening.
As compared with a new highway, planning of a road upgrading or a widening project is 
generally more constrained by existing structures, services and utilities and the surrounding 
topography. The need to maintain traffic flow during construction is also an important 
constraint. The selection of appropriate route alignment and/or design options should take 
into account these constraints[56].
7.1.2.1	
The objectives of planning for existing roads
	
●	
minimize the risk and severity of road accidents that may result from landslide 
hazards,
	
●	
minimize the need for remedial work,
	
●	
reduce the life cycle costs of the project,
	
●	
improve the awareness of safe design practices of everyone involved in the 
design.
Where there is a large number of failures on a network, an inventory can help in establishing 
a priority for earthworks most likely to fail, or most likely to constitute the greatest risk. Once 
a database of relevant slope information has been established and analysed, then updating 
of the database can be focussed on those datasets that are both key to the slope condition 
and are likely to change within engineering time. The inventory can provide a tool to:
	
●	
Plot the location of the earthworks, along the length of the route or network.
	
●	
See where the slope failures are, and describe and classify them.
	
●	
Rank the earthworks in order of priority for repair.
	
●	
Calculate an order of cost for the repairs.

======================================================================

IRC:SP:106-2015
63
The limitation of a slope inventory is that the data give information only on the slopes measured. 
There is no information on the slopes in the landscape at large; inventory is not an ideal tool 
for extrapolation unless combined with terrain evaluation, as was done in Indonesia. If used 
within the framework of a terrain classification, the two together form a powerful tool for 
planning, management and design.
7.1.2.2	
Planning for monitoring of key sites
For important slope hazard sites such as major cuttings, valley side traverses or stacks of 
climbing loops the cut slopes can be measured to assess the hazard (Table 7.2), or kept 
under continuous observation by monitoring. It would be appropriate to make a detailed 
geotechnical assessment of an important slope that is felt to pose a risk (Fig. 7.1). Planning 
for existing highways is the same order as followed in IRC:SP:48-1998, with the addition of a 
few measures which can be included in the planning process.

Where landslides or slope failures occur, there is often a need to identify quickly the likely 
cause of the failure and to develop short or long term measures to mitigate the failure. Planning 
required for dealing with these hazards can be summarized into[145]:
	
1.	
Simple field reconnaissance to in-depth topographic survey as outlined in 
IRC:SP:48-1998.
	
2.	
Field data collection.
	
3.	
Geotechnical section must provide oversight during repair of the landslide 
or slope failure, particularly if an emergency condition is identified. This 
can range from documenting work done by sub-contractors to conducting 
analyses to help decide the type of repairs that should be implemented. This 
will require:
	
●	
Close communication with the contractor who is performing the repair.
	
●	
Having a clear understanding of responsibilities and expectations 
during the work.
	
●	
Providing good documentations of decisions that are made, including 
photographic documentation,
	
4.	
Slope stabilization methods : If the results of the stability analyses indicate that 
the roadway slope does not meet the minimum factor of safety requirements 
or displacement limits, than it may be necessary to use slope stabilization 
methods to improve the slope performance, mentioned in chapter VIII of this 
guidelines and also in IRC:SP:48-1998.
Where a site shows signs of being at risk but for reasons of size or complexity are felt to 
be too expensive to protect, monitoring can be implemented to detect any sudden change 
in condition. In extreme cases an early warning system can be installed to give warning of 
imminent failure and have the road closed before the slope gives way.
7.2	
Hazard Assessment
There is a wide range of approaches to hazard assessment and these approaches can have 
very different applications:
	
a)	
New Roads construction: the primary task is to locate an alignment that 
minimises the hazards likely to affect the road. This involves examining a 
large area of terrain in a broad way. This strongly indicates a terrain evaluation 
approach to the assessment (chapter IV of the guidelines).
	
b)	
Existing Roads: for an existing alignment or network, the engineer may 
require detailed design information for specific slope hazards. A numerical 
approach is more likely to be appropriate in this situation (chapter IV of the 
guidelines).
Geomorphological mapping and walk-over geotechnical mapping are based on the premise 
that the landscape bears visible indicators of past instability, from which future activity may 
be predicted. Land forms such as concave slopes, fans, terraces and slopes with thin soil

65
cover are indicators of particular kinds of land-forming process including instability, and are 
interpreted to form a picture of how the land has evolved into its present state and how it will 
evolve in future.
Geomorphological mapping therefore provides the engineer with a valuable tool to separate 
areas of stable terrain from those that are unstable, and appreciate what processes may 
affect the road in the short and longer term (Chapter V of the guidelines).
7.3	
Technical Tools for Road Alignment
In the absence of a GIS computerized system, transparencies can be made of each map and 
then can be overlaid together[4]. It is important that the maps and data be at the same scale. 
The following list describes many types of information that might be useful in constructing 
layers for GIS analysis of landslide potential.
	
●	
Topographic Map- Indicates slope gradient, terrain configuration, drainage 
pattern.
	
●	
Terrain Map-Identifies material, depth, geological processes, terrain 
configuration, surface and subsurface drainage, slope gradient (also called 
surficial geology or Quaternary geology maps).
	
●	
Bedrock Map- Identifies bedrock type, surface and subsurface structure, 
surficial cover (overburden), and age of rock over a topographic map base.
	
●	
Engineering Soil Map- Identifies surficial material type, drainage, limited 
engineering characteristics, soils characteristics, vegetation cover.
	
●	
Forest Cover Map- Identifies surface vegetation, topographic features, 
surface drainage pattern, and in some cases, soil drainage character.
	
●	
Research Studies- May provide information on all of the above, plus 
quantitative data on controlling factors and possibly local stability risk 
assessment.
	
●	
Aerial Photography Remote Sensing- Identification can be made of:
	
	
vegetation cover,
	
 topography,
	
 drainage pattern,
	
	
soil drainage character,
	
 bedrock geology,
	
	
surficial geology,
	
 landslide type, and relationship to other factors.
	
●	
InSAR Imaging- InSAR is an acronym for Interferometric Synthetic Aperture 
Radar. Most InSAR equipment is able to penetrate fog and rain and can be 
used in areas difficult to access by foot. By bouncing signals from a radar 
satellite off the ground, digital elevation model (DEM) maps can be produced 
that will show the ground terrain. Ordinary radar on a typical Earth-orbiting

LiDAR Imaging- LiDAR is an acronym for Light Detection and Ranging, 
also known as ALSM or Airborne Laser Swath Mapping. LiDAR can produce 
accurate terrain maps even where forest cover gets in the way of traditional 
photography. The technique produces a very accurate Digital Elevation 
Model map (DEM). LiDAR is a useful topographic mapping tool for three 
reasons : 
	
	
Accuracy
	
 Productivity
	
 Provides its own illumination.
These characteristics overcome the major liabilities of photogrammetry in forested terrain. 
The maps produced by LiDAR are very clear and detailed and in many cases reveal evidence 
of past landslides that are virtually invisible by other means due to heavy vegetation cover.
The use of GIS is extremely important in both investigating and helping to establish the 
spatial relationships between causative factors and landslide events, and also in preparing 
map products of susceptibility, hazard and risk. For the first purpose, the development of 
spatial relationships, the GIS acts as an integrating framework for the analysis. By providing 
a management system for the variety of input spatial datasets and the tools for investigating 
their interrelationships, the GIS can greatly improve the efficiency of such analysis.
Some of the techniques used to reduce landslide hazards are mentioned (Table 7.3). These 
may be used in a variety of combinations to help to solve both existing and potential landslide 
problems. The techniques are generally applicable to all types of surface ground failure, 
including flows, slides and falls. The effectiveness of each hazard reduction technique varies 
with time, place and persons involved in the planning and implementing of the programme for 
reducing the hazard. The control of the landslide hazard system is easier for new developments 
for new developments as vulnerability can be restricted.

Under the sequence of survey and survey methods (IRC:SP:48-1998), an important measure 
to be added before fixing final alignment of a hill road is landslide hazard mapping. Before the 
determination of the Final Centre line, it is necessary to know areas prone to landslide. For 
areas with existing landslides, hazard maps show the areal extent of threatening processes 
where landslide processes have occurred in the past, recent occurrences. Most importantly, 
it shows the likelihood in various areas that a landslide will occur in the future, which will 
help in preparing the alignment of a road to a great extent, in a way that we can avoid areas 
susceptible to land slips and prepare alternate routes of alignment.
Hazard maps contain detailed information on the types of landslides, extent of slope subject 
to failure, and probable maximum extent of ground movement. These maps can be used to 
predict the relative degree of hazard in a landslide area and we can therefore plan accordingly 
to the kind of remedial measures that can be undertaken in order to prevent the area from 
further damage. Areas may be ranked in a hierarchy such as low, moderate, and high hazard 
areas. This helps us importantly in demarking areas which can completely be closed for 
transportation use, areas which needs greater inspection, areas where alignment of roads is 
possible and also aids in following a certain structure/framework for planning according to their

68
ranks of low, moderate and high danger areas. In terms of high and very high hazard ranking 
sites, the primary intention is to concentrate on exposure reduction and a mix of exposure 
and hazard reduction, with the latter approach generally being the more expensive.
For virgin areas, hazard maps show the locations of past and present landslides. With the 
use of a hazard map, the magnitude of the possible slide can be calculated. This helps in the 
process of planning how a possible landslide should be dealt with, for example, to access 
whether the benefits of a prevention method outweigh its costs.
Landslide hazard mapping may be produced by a ‘direct’ or an ‘indirect’ method. For direct 
mapping the study area is zoned according to the location and the density of recorded 
landslides, then extrapolating to slopes of the same type that have not failed[116]. The 
assumption is that future landslides are more likely to occur on slopes where conditions are 
the same as those in which sliding has occurred previously. The indirect mapping method 
relies on the evaluation of factors that are considered to be significant in the initiation of slope 
failure and aggregating these.
Landslides can occur at a road section where:
	
a.	
The upslope drainage or the associated road drainage is partially or fully 
blocked or has an inadequate design capacity; during rainstorms the road 
section will collect a large volume of surface runoff from uphill areas, which 
may discharge onto the downhill slope, and
	
b.	
The slope below the road onto which the surface water may overflow is a 
substandard man-made feature, or steep natural terrain of marginal stability, 
or ground susceptible to erosion or washout by concentrated surface water 
flow.
	
	
(Refer to IRC:SP:48-1998 for further guidance of drainage in highways).

Impact of Drainage on Stability of Highway Slopes

of surface run-off and discharge it onto the downhill slopes in the event that nearby catchpits, drainage 
channels or road drainage components are blocked during heavy rain.

of the nearby stormwater inlets could lead to severe flooding and adversely affect the stability of slopes

7.4	
Techniques for Hazard Reduction on Existing Roads
The challenge with hazard reduction is in identifying locations that are of sufficiently high 
hazard ranking to warrant spending significant sums of money on engineering works[155]. The 
costs associated with installing remedial works over long lengths of road are difficult to justify 
in economic terms and may well be unaffordable. Moreover the environmental impact of such 
engineering work should not be underestimated, having a lasting visual impact at the least 
and potentially other more serious impacts. It is considered that such works should be limited 
to locations where their worth can be proven. Critical review of the alignment of culverts and 
other conduits close to the road should be carried out as part of any planned maintenance or 
construction activities (Fig. 7.2).
Achieving a reduction in the hazard will involve physical engineering works to change the 
nature of a slope or road to reduce the potential for either initiation and or the potential 
for a debris flow to reach the road once initiated. Debris flows are dynamic in nature and 
quite often originate some distance above the road; when they reach the road they are 
relatively fast-moving, high-energy flows. The energy of these systems is a significant factor 
in determining the nature of the engineering works that can be used to effectively reduce the 
hazard to the road and its user. Hence, there are three broad approaches to the selection of 
hazard reduction works:
	
●	
Road Protection: Accept that debris flows will occur and take measures 
to protect the road. Potential solutions include debris basins, lined debris 
channels, debris flow shelters, overshoots and barriers (including ditches, 
walls and fences).
	
●	
Debris Flow Prevention: Carry out engineering works to reduce the 
opportunity for a debris flow to occur.
	
●	
Road Realignment: Realign the road.
Road realignment is undertaken as route improvement activities in order to improve the 
road in terms of both alignment and junction layout, in particular to reduce accidents and to 
ensure compliance with current design standards[116]. In cases where the debris flow hazard 
ranking is high and other factors indicate that some degree of reconstruction is required, road 
realignment may be a viable option.
With regard to the chapter 5 IRC:SP:48-1998, the sequence of survey and survey methods 
should also include the study and analysis of historical background checks of the present 
landslide before undertaking the survey of the site.
During the preliminary stages of an investigation reference should be made to records of 
development in the area which may contain information on site formation, site investigation, 
well boring, piling, foundations and previous instability of slopes[48]. Records held by the 
office in the Public Works Department and by the consultant architect or engineer for both 
public and private developments, although records for old developments may be scanty or 
non-existent. Site investigation contractors may hold useful information. Hazard and risk 
assessments combine geology and history to determine which technologies best will respond 
to a landslide event or to reduce future hazards. Fig. 7.3 provides options for the highway 
slope management.

Post Disaster Management of Landslide  
The management and control of the adverse consequences of future landslide incidences 
will require coordinated, prompt, and effective response systems at the central and state 
government levels, and especially at the district and the community levels in the landslide 
affected areas[64]. Since many components of the response initiatives are the same for different 
types of disasters, systems need to be developed considering the multi-hazard scenario of 
various regions in order to optimally utilize the available resources.
Depending on the magnitude of the landslide and scale of the required response, the 
corresponding role players should be identified and mobilized at the district, state or national 
levels. The community in the affected neighborhood is always the first responder after any 
disaster. Trained and equipped teams consisting of local people should be set up in landslide 
prone areas to respond effectively in the event of a disaster. Rescue & relief operations shall 
be based on ground assessment of damage and losses. Preliminary assessment should 
be carried out immediately within 24 hours for planning the response. Teams should be 
constituted of officials drawn from various sectors to make assessment on the basis of on 
the spot visits, aerial surveys and information collected from primary and secondary sources. 
The Departments/Agencies of the State Governments responsible for various infrastructural 
facilities such as electricity, drinking water, telecommunication etc should repair the damage 
caused by the disaster and should take immediate steps to restore damaged essential 
services so that rescue & relief operations are conducted smoothly.
In the aftermath of disasters the affected people must be looked after for their safety, security 
and the well being and provided food, water, shelter, clothing, medical care etc. so as to

ensure that the affected people live with dignity. The state governments should facilitate the 
involvement of the corporate and private sector and utilise their services and resources if 
offered to the government during the immediate post disaster situation. The India Disaster 
Resource Network (IDRN) should be maintained and updated regularly so that locally 
available resources are utilized effectively in the case of emergencies. The nodal agency 
and respective state governments should constitute multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary 
teams for carrying out post landslide field investigations to assess the hazard potential and 
estimate the risk involved. They will also document the lessons and disseminate the same 
to target audiences within the state and recommend cost effective practical measures. The 
nodal agency should oversee the progress of these efforts in a systematic manner.
For further details on post disaster management of landslide, refers to “National Disaster 
Management Guidelines-Management of Landslides and Snow Avalanches”, a publication 
by National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). Apart from the administrative approach 
as given in the NDMA document; planning, inventorisation, deployment, use of equipment 
for mitigation, search & rescue, skill-set and training level of equipment operators, are also 
important aspects of post disaster management of landslide.
8  Technology  for  Landslide  Prevention  and  Remediation
The key of successful landslide management strategy is to design workable and economically 
viable schemes of mitigation/preventive measures. The promotion of innovative and modern 
technologies based on proven workability becomes the unavoidable choice.
The thumb rule says that slope failure occurs due to imbalance in the driving and resisting 
forces of slope under the effect of gravitational forces. But the triggering factor/factors which 
cause such imbalance are different at different incidence of landslides, greatly depending 
upon the local conditions and hence this hazard is so varied in type and size. So it is essential 
to identify potentially hazardous slopes and control their instability by providing suitable 
remedial measures. For prevention and remediation of such consequences of landslides 
there are a number of effective remedial measures which can avoid or minimize their adverse 
effects. The slope can be stabilized by a single method or concomitant methods of prevention 
totally depending upon the nature, size, location, causative factors of the landslide. The 
effectiveness, acceptability and durability of remedial measures, to a large extent depend 
upon the quality of investigation carried out for identified correct problematic factors of the 
landslides.
8.1	
Slope Instability and their Stabilization
Landforms are the products of the local balance between weathering, erosion and deposition 
and are continuously evolving. Slopes that are too steep for the weathered material to remain 
stable are subject to periodic failure. Instability may be associated with moderate to steeply 
sloping terrain or with land, which has been disturbed by man[35]. Natural slopes that have 
been stable for years may suddenly fail because of construction activities on hill slope and 
also other causes which are already mentioned in chapter 2.

Appropriate Actions for Unstable Slope Treatment
The detailed site inspection procedure as mentioned in Chapter 5: Investigation with or 
without ground investigations, reveals the nature of the problem that is faced, before the 
selection and design of suitable scheme of remedial measures. To control the slope instability 
problems, a general outline consisting of a decision-making process used for assistance in 
framing the problem and selection of the preferred remedial actions presented in Fig. 8.1. 
The recommended remedial measures/methods, as per Clause 6 of IS:14680:1999 can be 
followed for selection of various landslide control measures to avoid landslides in hill areas. 
These control measures are generally divided into four main practical groups as described 
in Table 8.1[134]:

There are a number of levels of effectiveness and levels of acceptability that may be applied 
in the use of these measures, for while one slide may require an immediate and absolute 
long-term correction, another may only require minimal control for a short period[135]. Thus 
the mitigation measures chosen for a given slope must be analyzed recognizing that different 
mitigation measures require analyses for different methods of failure.
8.1.2	
Cost Implication of Treatment
There are many alternatives (Table 8.2) to deal with the instability of slope such as avoid 
the instability, reduce driving forces, increase resisting forces by application of an external 
force, increase resisting forces by increasing internal strength, protect the surface etc[155]. 
Each alternative has many common techniques that should be recognize for resolving slope 
instability including consideration of what these techniques likely to cost as low or moderate 
or high.

Table 8.2  Various Remedial Techniques Against Cost Implication
Options
Implications
Avoid the instability
Re-align road
High cost; may create similar problems; slow to implement.
Completely or partially remove 
unstable material
Low cost; only feasible for minor, shallow slips; may create further instability
Construct catch wall
Moderate cost: There must be enough space so that the wall is capable 
of containing slip debris and access for clearance; slip may become more 
extensive upslope.
Reduce driving forces
Reduce slope angle
Low cost; unlikely to be feasible in steep terrain, cut surface will need erosion 
protection, right of way/sufficient space may not be available
Drain surface
Low cost; will only reduce surface infiltration, therefore combine with other 
techniques.
Drain sub-surface
Moderate cost; assumes that the water table is above the slip surface; more 
effective when sliding mass is relatively permeable.
Increase resisting forces by application of an external force
Construct retaining wall
Moderate cost; must be founded below slip surface; may need to be combined 
with other techniques.
Construct toe berm
Low cost; usually requires significant space at toe.
Install anchors
High cost; specialist installation equipment needed, potential corrosion/
monitoring problems.
Increase resisting forces by increasing internal strength
Drain sub-surface
Moderate cost; assumes that the water table is above the slip surface; more 
effective when sliding mass is relatively permeable.
Install soil nailing
High cost; specialist installation equipment needed.
Use bio-engineering
Low cost; not suitable for very steep slopes and deep-seated failures.
Protect the surface
Construct revetment or rip-rap Moderate cost.
Use bio-engineering
Low cost; not suitable for very steep slopes or hard, compacted soils.
River training works
Usually high cost, but only required in particular locations.

Stabilization Methods for Different Types of Slope Failure 
8.2.1	
Rockfall Mitigation Measures
8.2.1.1	
Prevention measures	
Measures (Fig. 8.2) are taken to 
increase the resisting forces or 
minimizing the disturbing forces 
causing the rockfall and prevent 
any detachment and movement of 
rocks. e.g. Nailing, Deep Anchoring, 
Correcting the rock slope by 
trimming and Benching, Reinforcing 
the slope face etc.

8.2.1.2	
Retention measures
The measures in this category will not totally nullify or prevent the detachment and tendency 
to move. Measures (Fig. 8.3) are taken to contain or retain the rock masses which are on 
the verge of movement. E.g. Mesh/ Net/Netting with nails or anchors surficial strengthening, 
shortcreting, Chemical stabilization of slope face etc.
  
Fig. 8.3  Surfacial
8.2.1.3	
Protection Measures
These measures (Fig. 8.4) don’t affect or prevent the process of rock detachment. They 
guide the falling rock and control the distance and direction in which the falling rock travels 
thus protecting the area prone to hazards. E.g. Drapery system with steel wire mesh and 
steel cable panels, Rockfall prevention barriers, Ditches, Rock sheds etc.
Fig. 8.4 A.  Drapery System, B. Protection Barrier & C. Protection Embankment

Warning measures
These measures help the detection of an impending rockfall or slope movement and thereby 
provide sufficient time for taking precautionary measures to prevent any loss of life and 
property due to rockfalls.

Gabion Wall
Gabion walls are made up of wire mesh crates filled with stones and erected as gravity 
retaining structures (Fig. 8.5) each unit is rectangular and is fabricated from mechanically 
woven, double twisted, hexagonal shaped mesh of soft annealed heavily zinc coated steel 
structure strengthened by mechanical selvedging the edges by high diameter wire. The 
following national and international references having detailed information about gabion walls 
have been collected and presented as follows:

IRC:SP:48 ( Hill road manual ) briefly describes the concept as sausage wall 
made by forming sausages of galvanized iron or steel work netting of 4 mm 
dia having 10cm square or hexagonal openings and filling the sausages with 
local hard boulders/stones and wrapping the wire net at the top. The manual 
highlights the advantages of flexibility and free drainage properties of gabion 
wall.

Soil Nailing
Soil nailing essentially involves reinforcing and strengthening of existing grounds by installing 
closely-spaced steel bars, called nails, into hill slope. A soil-nailed system can override 
local weaknesses in the ground through stress redistribution and is less vulnerable than 
unsupported cuts to undetected adverse ground and groundwater conditions that have not 
been accounted for in the slope stability analysis. Fig. 8.6 shows the cross-section of a 
typical soil-nailed cut slope.

Drum Retaining Wall/Drum Anchored Diaphragm wall
A simple method and low cost technology for construction of retaining wall to stabilize slopes 
has been developed by Bhandari (1987), which promotes extensive use of slope waste 
and landslide debris. The system of drum anchored diaphragm walling consists of empty 
bitumen drums interconnected vertically (Fig. 8.8) and laterally, filled up with wasteful debris 
to achieve gravitational effect and suitably anchored at the slope foundation as well as on to 
the slope retained. The system of retaining wall makes use of empty bitumen drums to serve 
as containers. This technology already implemented at Kaliasaur landslide on Rishikesh - 
Badrinath highway[19, 73 and 158] as mentioned in Bhandari (1987), IS 14680:1999 Landslide 
control - Guidelines, State of the Art report: Landslide Correction Techniques SOA(1995).

Non-Biodegradable Systems
8.3.6.1	
Geosynthetic mat
Geosynthetic mats shall be three dimensional structures made of non-biodegradable materials 
like polypropylene, polyethylene, nylon or similar polymer fibers that are extruded or heat 
bonded at contact points to provide a dimensionally stable matrix to prevent soil erosion on 
slopes (Table 8.6).

Table 8.6  Geosynthetic Mats
Types
Figure
Consists of a flexible 3D polymer mat which initially stabilizes the 
surface whilst assisting vegetation to establish. It goes on to provide 
long-term, tenacious reinforcement of the root system. The mats 
have a flat, high tensile modulus base layer bonded to an upper 
cuspated surface which provides an array of pockets and traps for 
topsoil retention.
3D permanent erosion control mats composed of UV stabilized non-
degradable synthetic fibers. These can be integrated with steel mesh 
reinforces the geomat, significantly increasing the tensile strength 
of the mat, enhancing its erosion protection and shear resistance 
capacity when compared to un-reinforced erosion mats.
8.3.6.2	
Geogrid 
Geogrids are now a day widely used for increasing slope stability and erosion control. 
(Fig. 8.9) can be an economical alternative to conventional slope design as mentioned in 
FHWA (1998)[173]. Soil reinforcement using high tensile strength inclusions can increase the 
shear resistance of a soil mass. It permits construction of soil structures at slope angles 
greater than the soil’s angle of repose.
However, 3 dimensional erosion control mats are best suited for erosion control applications 
and where tensile strength and shear resistance is required there the steel wire mesh 
reinforced 3 dimensional mats are best utilized. This is because normal geogrids are not able 
to last long due to UV exposure. Also there is the danger of it being a fire hazard.

Bioengineering Systems 
8.3.7.1	
Coir geotextile
Coir Geotextile are permeable coir fabrics made from coir fiber extracted from coconut husk 
either by natural retting or by mechanical process. The open weave of Coir Geotextile are 
used for stabilization of soil through vegetation against erosion of landscape and soil slopes 
and acting as a ground cover or mulch.
The following Indian Standards has been published by Bureau of Indian Standards on the 
account of Coir Geotextile:

suitable for application in slopes of road and railway embankments and also in hill slopes 
including the selection of woven coir bhoovastra and installation methods.
8.3.7.2	
Jute geotextile
Jute is a natural fiber out of which Jute Geotextiles (JGT) can be made by the special 
treatment and weaving processes. Jute geotextile being a natural fabric is biodegradable and 
environment-friendly. It has good hygroscopic and hydrophilic properties. Jute geotextiles are 
most drapable among all types of geotextiles-Both natural and manmade. Properly designed 
Jute geotextiles lay on slopes or any other exposed soil surface provides a cover over exposed 
soil lessening the probability of soil detachment and at the same time reduces the velocity of 
surface run-off, the main agent of soil dissociation. IS:14986:2001 & SOA(2012) has covered 
the various aspects like specific requirements, selection, installation method, monitoring and 
requirement of packing related to geo textile.
8.3.8	
Biotechnical Slope Protection
In Biotechnical Slope Protection, vegetation is used as surface protection and to augment the 
strength of soil in which it grows, usually combined with naturally occurring or recycled inert 
materials – timber, stone, iron and steel cables and meshes. These vegetated composite soil 
bodies or structures are ‘soft’ – flexible and multi-redundant statically and visually attractive.
Bioengineering is the use of vegetation, mostly shrubs and grasses, either alone or in 
conjunction with stone and concrete protection works such as retaining walls etc. to enhance 
the stability of slopes. Soil bioengineering combines mechanical, biological, and ecological 
concepts to prevent shallow slope failures and erosion. Basic approaches to upland slope 
protection and erosion control can be divided into two general categories:
	
●	
Living and
	
●	
Nonliving. Frequently, living and nonliving measures are combined to form a 
system (Table 8.7).

Erosion Control Measures/Solutions

Reinforced Slope with green facia Unit- It is a reinforced soil 
system forming structures with 60 degree facings. The vegetation

Elliptical Wire Basket filled with stone and soil mix- It is an 
elliptical basket made of steel wire mesh and lined with coconut 
fiber blanket. The blanket is used to contain a soil and stone mix. It 
can be used with geogrid to form a reinforced soil structure and are 
frequently vegetated with brush layering.
 
Special sized gabions with green facia-These may be a trapezoidal 
gabion basket or a site specific solution (considering feasibility of 
manufacturing) made of steel wire mesh with an inclined front face 
suitable inclination and lined with coconut fiber blanket. They provide 
immediate erosion protection and create hospitable conditions for 
healthy plant development. They are filled with a mix of soil and 
stone to offer a substrate for insertion of cuttings, rooted woody 
plants and/or herbaceous plants.”
 
8.3.8.1	
Greening techniques
Greening techniques for slope stabilization can be divided into three categories i.e. mulching 
system, planting long-rooting grass and fiber reinforced soil system. These techniques 
have their own unique characteristics[79]. They vary in applications, installation procedures, 
materials required and vegetation, etc. There characteristics and advantages are mentioned 
in Table 8.8.

Debris Flow Protection Measures
8.4.1	
Flexible Ring Net Barriers 
A new type of debris flow mitigation measure, flexible ring-net barrier systems, are cost-
effective and efficient compared to massive concrete barriers. It can ideally be used to span 
the cross section of a river bed or drainage on hill slope (Fig. 8.10) to stop the expected 
debris flow volume and to drain the material. There are two different set-ups of the barriers 
(Fig. 8.11).
	
●	
Open slope barriers: For wide U-shaped channel cross sections
	
●	
Channel barriers: For narrower V-shaped channels cross sections
In both systems, a wire ring-net is mounted between the horizontal steel wire ropes that are 
anchored in both sides of the channel side or open slopes. Based on different slope/channel 
configurations, variety of different geometries may be adopted as shown in figures below.

8.4.2	
Check Dams
These are small barriers or dams constructed across natural or man made drainages, or other 
channelized flow of water. A properly designed, constructed, and maintained check dam will 
reduce channel erosion by reducing flow velocity and encouraging sediment settlement. A 
check dam either filters the water for sediment as it passes through the dam or retains the 
water, allowing the sediment to settle while the water flows over the dam (Fig. 8.12).
Fig. 8.12  Check Dam Placed Across Natural Drianage    
8.5	
Drainage and Surface Protection  
The following techniques may be considered to limit the destabilizing effects of rising 
groundwater due to development:
	
	
Surface water drains (table drains) - are often used to prevent scour and 
limit inflow to a slope. Other than in rock, they are relatively ineffective unless 
they have an impermeable lining. They should be cleared regularly and as 
required.
	
	
Surface Protection – gabions and mattresses can be provided for surface 
protection, it is possible to construct flexible structures that effectively 
sustain eroding slope and also preserve their natural look thus providing 
eco-compatible solutions.
	
	
Sub-soil drains- are often constructed behind retaining walls and on 
hillsides to intercept groundwater. They should be laid in a sand/gravel, bed 
and protected with a graded stone/geotextile filter to reduce the chances of 
clogging. These drains should always be laid to a fall of at least 1 vertical on 
100 horizontal.
	
	
Deep, underground drains- are usually used only in extreme conditions, 
where the landslide risk is assessed as not being tolerable and other 
stabilization measures are considered to be impractical. They work by 
permanently lowering the water table in a slope. Both an increase and a 
reduction in the normal flow from deep drains could indicate a problem if it 
appears to be unrelated to recent rainfall.

* The data listed above is quit partial and just indicating of the severity of the phenomena 
in our country. Anybody likes to us data for their own purpose suggested to revalidate the 
authenticity of the data.
Table 2  The Main Satellite Imagery Sources which May be Applicable to  
Landslide Investigations are Summarized below:
The use of Remote Sensing techniques used for investigation of landslides
Aerial Photography (Orthogonally-rectified digital aerial photography)
Identifies the presence of existing failure scars and debris run out. Identify pre-conditioning factors for failure (where visible 
at the resolution of the photography).
Low cost Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)
This approach enables reveals high-resolution digital surface models of landslides. Digital surface models (DSMs) 
are generated using a new feature-based surface reconstruction approach which does not require any ground control 
point information and enables surface models to be generated from UAV-based remote sensing without ground based 
measurements.
Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA)
OOA has the potential to accurately and meaningfully detect landslides by integrating the contextual information to image 
analysis, therefore reducing the time required for creation of landslide inventory for large areas.
Optical Satellite Imagery (Thematic Mapper)
The Landsat series of satellites operates the Thematic Mapper instrument. Landsat-7 now offers a 15 m resolution 
panchromatic band which enables mapping scales to 1:25,000. The Indian, IRS-1C with 5 m pixels improves mapping scales 
to 1:10,000. The IKONOS satellite, available since early 2000, offers data which provides 1 m ground resolution imagery 
and enables mapping scales of 1:2000 or greater. The French SPOT satellite provides 10 m resolution panchromatic data 
and the ability to acquire stereo image pairs. At these scales individual flow lobes, ground fissures and subtle morphology 
indicative of potential peat landslides may be resolvable.

IRC:SP:106-2015

Microwave (Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry, In SAR)
Radar imagery, at different wavelengths and polarization, can be obtained from both satellite and aircraft. Radar data 
can be acquired during the night or day and effectively ‘sees’ through cloud. Currently available SAR (synthetic aperture 
radar) data includes ERS with 25 m spatial resolution, RADARSAT with 10-15m spatial resolution and stereo capability, 
and JERS with 18 m spatial resolution. These data enable interpretation at a range of scales from regional, to local and 
include vegetation type, moisture content, debris sizes etc.
Multispectral Video 
Multi-spectral video cameras operate at the visible to near infra-red portion of the spectrum and can be mounted on low-
flying aircraft. They can generate pixels of less than 1m ground resolution and are therefore suitable for large mapping 
scales. Field spectra obtained from in-situ measurements are used to determine different classes of iron oxide precipitates 
from the air and, by inference, the different pH levels of drainage systems.
Hyper spectral 
Airborne hyper spectral scanners are much more complicated and expensive instruments than multispectral video. They 
can be mounted on low-flying aircraft. Remotely sensed multi-spectral data have been shown to be of considerable use 
for landslide investigations. Uses include the mapping of geological units in areas of poor exposure through estimation of 
soil moisture content, the estimation of soil thickness prone to landslides and the mapping of geomorphological features 
of landslides at the regional scale and the local scale.
Stereo photogrammetry
In the method of stereo photogrammetry, a satellite acquires two images of the same ground scene within a relatively short 
period of time, so that it can view surface features have not significantly changed. These images can be processed to 
get topography from the stereo pair of images. The series of stereo pairs offers a 3 dimensional evolution of the landslide 
over time.
Terrestrial laser scanners
Generates a high resolution topographic model DEM of the study area. The laser system is combined with a differential 
GPS system and calibrated colour digital cameras(infrared cameras can also be fitted) to produce surface topographic 
data and photographic imagery.
Global Positioning System (GPS)
GPS is a useful tool for detecting first stage disaster and further mitigation. It can detect movement of cm/yr., and aid in 
determining the boundary of the landslide area. Monitors can be placed anywhere you can access, and they are relatively 
easy to operate. But precision is affected by the number of observable satellites present, the obstruction of the observation 
point, and the monitoring of installed GPS receivers which have been placed out in the field.

	
Recent advances in new techniques, such as Object-Oriented Analysis 
(OOA), a platform for integration of different types of data (spectral, elevation 
and thematic) has the potential to detect landslides automatically in a better 
way than the pixel, based methods, by incorporating a multitude of landslide 
diagnostic features.
	
	
The availability of a new generation of high resolution of optical satellite 
imageries (eg. World View, GeoEye, SPOT-5, Resourcesat, Cartosat, 
Formosat and ALOS-PRISM) has caused a paradigm shift in the use of Earth 
Observation (EO) data for landslide studies.
	
	
Digital Elevation Models (DEM) produced from overlapping aerial photographs 
or stereoscopic satellite images are the major sources of elevation data for 
landslide studies. A DEM is useful for estimating the volume of landslides 
by an elevation change analysis. Shaded relief images produced from a 
DEM obtained from light detection and ranging (LIDAR) have proven to 
be very suitable for generating landslide inventories under forest areas in 
hilly regions and to refine the boundaries of landslides prepared during field 
investigations. 
	
	
SPOT-5 HRS (high resolution stereoscope) data have been shown to be 
valuable for DSM generation. Cartosat-1 and ALOS-PRISM are other more 
recent sources of along track stereoscopic data. They are more advantageous 
than methods employed by SPOT1-4 AND IRS-1C/D Satellites, which are 
frequently affected by atmospheric differences between the images.
	
	
New generation satellites such as Cartosat-I have considerable advantages 
over airborne stereo imagery, due to their high periodicity, synoptic view, 
high data quality, relatively low cost, and quick extraction of DEM.
	
 The main satellite remote sensing methodology used for measure accurate 
land displacement is the InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) 
technique.
	
	
Quickbird satellite sensors produce very detailed elevation models that 
are considerably more cost-effective than the equivalent areal coverage of 
airborne LiDAR or SAR.

Diaphragm 
Piezometer
Pneumatic piezometers 
can 
be 
successfully 
used in zones that are 
either partially saturated 
or in zones that may dry 
out for short periods.
When 
pore 
water 
pressures are to be 
read, air or nitrogen is 
admitted to one line, but 
is prevented from flowing 
up the other line by a 
blocking diaphragm in 
the tip.
Fairly 
cheap. 
Components 
are not affected by electrical 
transients. The use of gas 
rather than water means there 
are no problems of elevation 
and freezing.
No method of checking 
if pore water or pore air 
pressure is measured. The 
presence of moisture in the 
connecting leads will affect 
the readings.
Vibrating 
wire 
piezometers should be 
considered at sites where 
frequent 
groundwater 
measurements 
are 
required.
More accurate 
measurements of pore 
water pressure are 
occasionally called for, 
requiring the installation 
of vibrating wire 
piezometers, which may 
be read remotely.
The VW piezometer provides 
rapid response in all 
types of soils. Suitable for 
unattended monitoring with 
a data logger. The device 
can be used to measure 
small sub-atmospheric pore 
water pressures. No freezing 
problems. Transmission over 
long distances.
There is no independent 
means of recording the 
position of the sensor and 
therefore if large settlements 
are likely care must be 
taken in the interpretation 
of results. Expensive. Zero 
reading liable to drift and 
cannot be checked
Electrical 
resistancez
It can be used as 
profiling 
piezometer 
for 
measuring 
pore 
water pressure at many 
points.
Moderately complex device, 
expensive. Simple to monitor. 
Very short lag time. Elevation 
of 
readout 
independent 
of 
elevation 
of 
tips 
and 
piezometric levels. No freezing 
problems. Easily automated.
The principal disadvantage 
of being unable to undertake

Tiltmeter
Tiltmeters 
very 
accurately 
measure 
inclination 
relative 
to gravity, either at a 
discrete point or along a 
baseline. Horizontal tilt 
meters are particularly 
versatile as they may 
be manufactured on site 
using readily available 
low cost materials.
Bubble tiltmeters 
however 
they 
can be sensitive 
to 
temperature 
fluctuations
Tiltmeters 
are 
used 
to 
determine the direction of 
movement, to delimit the 
areas of deformation and to 
determine the mechanism 
of movement (e.g. slumping 
or slope creep). They can 
also 
provide 
advance 
warning of accelerated slide 
movement and quantify the 
effectiveness of landslide 
repairs
precision is 
typically ± 50 
arc-seconds; 
and the 
temperature 
sensitivity is 
typically in the 
range of 2 to 3 
arc-seconds/°F 
(Dunnicliff, 
1993).
Microgravity
Extremely precise, locates 
small 
volumes 
of 
low 
density materials utilizing 
very sensitive instruments
Use of expensive and sensitive 
instruments 
in 
rugged 
terrain 
typical of many landslides may 
be impractical; requires precise 
leveling 
and 
elevation 
data; 
results must be corrected for local 
topographic 
features; 
requires 
detailed information on topography 
and 
material 
variations; 
not 
recommended for most landslide 
investigations
They can detect areas of 
low density in relatively large 
landslides.

The 
main 
disadvantage 
of this type of

is 
that curvature is 
only observed in

inclinometers are used for 
monitoring landslides/slopes, 
to detect zones of movement 
and 
establish 
whether 
movement 
is 
constant, 
accelerating, or responding 
to control measures. These 
instruments help for the 
determination of slip surfaces

they reveal the depth of the 
failure plane(s).

Microseismic 
monitoring
Microseismic data may be 
used to monitor the temporal 
and spatial evolution of 
slope instabilities.
Spatial 
location 
of 
microseismic events can 
provide 
important 
in-
formatio 
regarding 
the 
location, propagation, and 
mechanics 
of 
unstable 
areas.
The most detailed data 
from microseismic inves-
tigations 
can 
provide 
information on individual 
microseismic events and 
aid the interpretation of the 
instability mechanism
The versatility of event information is 
highly dependant on the sensitivity 
and layout of the geophone array, 
and interpretation can be limited by 
poorly considered installations
It has been used to identify 
active 
areas 
of 
slope 
deformation 
and 
provide 
details on the precursors to 
failure (Amitrano et al., 2007; 
Amitrano et al., 2005; Meric 
et al., 2007). Microseismic 
monitoring is unique in that it 
can provide information on the 
entire subsur-face volume.

significant quantity 
of data, in the order

Geophones
geophone is a device which 
converts ground movement 
(displacement) into voltage, 
which may be recorded at 
a recording station. The 
deviation of this measured 
voltage from the base line is 
called the seismic response 
and is analyzed for structure 
of the earth.
Seismic 
Reflection
this method requires a bigger effort 
to deploy the geophone layouts, 
particularly in the conditions of 
rugged topography, making the 
technique time consuming and 
costly
The major interest of seismic 
reflection profiling is its potential 
for imaging the geometry of the 
landslide structure, such as the 
internal bedding or the rupture 
surface(s) and the robustness 
of processing tools compared 
to tomography.
Borehole 
Extensometrs 
(vertical 
deformation)
Borehole 
extensometers 
are used to measure rock 
displacement 
which 
may 
take place as a consequence 
of movements in natural 
slopes.

of the device 
depends on
