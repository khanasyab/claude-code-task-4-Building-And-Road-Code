INTRODUCTION
The type designs for boundary stones, as shown in
the
Plate,
were
prepared
by
the

and
Standards Committee
(personnel given on inside front cover) and were
approved

These were finally approved for publication by the Council in

either
side
of
the
road
land
opposite
every
200-Metre
Stone
and Kilometre Stone.
In
addition these shall be fixed at all angular points of the
boundary.
Where the boundary is on a curve or the land is costly and likely to
be encroached upon, these shall be planted closer, as
necessary
in
each case.
3.2.
Inscription
The letters R B, indicating road boundary, shall
be
inscribed
on each stone and below
it the name of the Authority in which the
road land vests, i.e., P.W.D., D.B., etc.
3.3.
Mode of Fixing
Boundary stones shall
project
300 mm
above
ground
with
the lower 600 mm going
into
the
foundation.
Where
the
natural
soil
at
the
base
is
good,
the stones may be fixed in position by

to
be
displaced
during
agricultural
operations;
(ii) Where the road runs in built-up areas; and
(iii) Where the
boundary
stones
are
