IRC:SP:96~2011
This Model Contract Document is to be used for the procurement of hybrid (i.e. partly on
lump sum basis and partly on item rate basis) type of civil works for maintenance of roads
through Competitive Bidding
in projects that are financed
in whole or
in part by the
Government. This document is not suitable for only lump sum contracts without substantial
changes to the method of payment and price adjustment and to the Bill of Quantities,
schedule of activities and so forth.
Post qualification process may be followed for maintenance contracts.
The evaluation and qualification criteria has been provided to address this aspect
Broadly, the applicability of this document is for the scenarios mentioned below: -
i)
The target highways (National Highways, State Highways) that could be
covered under the scope of the draft Model Contract Document must have
been either
for the pavement that has been strengthened/its capacity
augmentation done and for which regular maintenance is required (including
PR type work,
if necessary);
Or such highways which are not immediately being planned for strengthening
of payment/capacity augmentation, but are important from connectivity point
of view; therefore, their regular maintenance may be required for keeping
them traffic worthy for which short term regular planned maintenance may
be desirable;
Or highways which may be taken up for development/capacity augmentation
after 3-^5 years; highways important from connectivity point of view.
11)
Most of such highways may not require initial Rehabilitation/Reinstatement
etc. Accordingly, such items of works may not be included in the scope of
the draft Contract Agreement. However,
if necessary some such works
could be taken up under "Day Works" depending upon specific site/project
requirements.
iii)
Virtually no User and Operation Services have been included under the
scope of work.
iv)
The length of the highway to be taken up for Contract Maintenance may be
desirably between 40~1 00 km.
v)
Duration of the Contract may var^' fro« n 3~5 years but shall not bo less then
3 years.

Introductory Guidarice Motes on the Use of
fVlode! Contract Docyment for ^ainteriaiice of Highways
These introductory guidance notes have been prepared to assist the 'Employer' in the
preparation, using the document, for the procurement of hybrid (i.e partly on lump sum
basis and partly on item rate basis) type of Civil Works for Road Maintenance Contracts.
The main objective of preparation of this document is to provide a uniform Bidding process
which can be used with minimum changes to suit the specific work requirements by the
various Road Authorities/Employer.
This document applies when selection of a Bidder (a Contractor) is determined on the
basis of the lowest evaluated Tender following a post-qualification process. In case, pre-
qualification has already taken place this document shall be modified to reflect any changes
needed as a result of the outcome of the pre-qualification process.
The document follows a single stage, two envelope Bidding procedure.
In summary,
information relating to administrative legal and technical requirements is included in the
first envelope, with no price information. Information relating to price offer (including the
Bid and priced Bill of Quantities) are included in the second envelope. The Price offers of
only those Bidders (Contractors) who satisfy the eligibility and qualification requirements
stipulated in the Bidding Documents are opened to determine the lowest evaluated Bid.
Further, this document is intended for admeasurements contracts (unit prices or unit rates
in Bill of Quantities), which is most prevalent to preserve the road network together with its
assets.
Care should be taken to check the relevance of the provisions of the document against the
requirements of the specific works to be procured. The following directions should be
observed when using these documents:
a)
All the documents listed in the Table of Contents are normally required for
the procurement of Works. However, they should be adapted as necessary
to the circumstances of a particular Contract. Such adaptations are limited
to Bid Notice, Instructions to Bidders, Special Conditions of Contract and
Road Maintenance Standards and Specifications.
b)
The notes inside
[italics] contain
instructions for the
user, as
in the
introduction section also. They should not be incorporated in the Bidding
Document but shall be adopted to the requirements of the particular Bidding
Document. The cover should be modified as required to identify the Bidding
Documents as to the identification of the Project Roads, Contract,
in
addition to date of issue.

c)
Other notes should be retained in the issued Bidding Documents, since
;:.>v,
.
these notes provide important guidance to Bidders.
This document is based on the current practices being followed by the various financing
agencies for such contracts with certain internationally acceptable Clauses and model
formats, which have been adapted to suit the particular needs of procurement within India.
This document has 09 (nine) Sections consists of 05 (five) Volumes. Section 2 (Instructions
to Bidders), Section 3 (Form of Bid
&. Bank Guarantee) and Section 4 (Conditions of
Contract, Part-i: GCC) shall not be altered. The Bid Notice is a sample of currently published
advertisement that provides relevant and essential information to help Bidders to decide
whether or not to participate in a particular Bid.
This is provided
in the document for
information only.

Special Conditions of Contract (SCC) as well as
in the detailed requirements of the
procurement in the Scope of Work and Specifications and/or the Drawings. Drawings
may be required if Scope includes improvement Wori<s.

order to prepare and submit a Bid. This should provide a sound basis on which the Employer
can fairly, transparently and accurately carry out a Bid evaluation process on the Bids
submitted by the Bidders.

Employer, and will not subsequently be made responsive by correction or withdrawal of
the non-conforming deviation or reservation.

D
a)
where there is a discrepancy between the rates in figures and in words,
the rate in words will govern; and
b)
where there is a discrepancy between the unit rate and the line item total
resulting from multiplying the unit rate by the quantity, the unit rate as quoted
will govern.
27.2
The amount stated in the Financial Bid will be corrected by the Employer in
accordance with the above procedure for the correction of errors and shall be considered
as binding upon the Bidder.
If the Bidder does not accept the corrected amount, the Bid
will be rejected, and the
Bid Security shall be
forfeited
in accordance with
Sub-Clause 16.6(b).
28
Evaluation and Comparison of Financial Bids
28.1
The Employer will evaluate and compare only those Bids determined to be
substantially responsive in accordance with Clause 26.

Bid price by adjusting the Bid price after making any correction for errors pursuant to
Clause 27.

Engineer will prepare a brief note within 5 days of inspection, describing:
•
a)
Date, road inspected, persons present.
b)
Any non-compliance observed,
indicating item of work and specific
particulars explaining non-compliance
c)
Time granted by the Engineer to the Contractor to remedy the defects.
The Engineer will correct any errors in the monthly statement, effect deductions for any
non-compliance observed, and
certify for payment. Formal inspections

For each case of non-compliance of Maintenance Standards observed on
the basis of formal inspection of the road, the Engineer will calculate the
amount of payment reduction on the basis of weightage in percentage of
the Total Routine Maintenance Cost assigned to the non-conforming item.
