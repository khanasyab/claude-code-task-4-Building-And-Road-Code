CHAPTER 1
BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW OF THE CODE
This Explanatory Handbook is a complementary document which is non-contradictory in its 
contents to the limit state code IRC:112-2011 ‘Code of Practice for Concrete Road Bridges’. 
The document gives:
	
a)	
Background to Code clauses, wherever considered as necessary
 
b) 
Explanation and commentary on some specific clauses/sub-clauses. All 
clauses of the Code are not covered
 
c) 
Worked-out examples highlighting application of specific clauses
IRC:112-2011 replaces two earlier codes IRC: 21 for ‘Plain and Reinforced Concrete Bridges’ 
and IRC:18 for ‘Post-Tensioned Concrete Bridges’. Some of the design procedures and 
analytical model from these Codes are permitted for use till further notice of withdrawal of the 
same, details of which are given in the Normative Annexure A-4 of the Code.
IRC:112 is a unified Code covering various types of concrete bridges, using plain concrete, 
reinforced concrete, and prestressed concrete, constructed by cast-in-place, precast and 
composite construction methods.
For some special applications, like suspension bridges and cable stayed bridges, provisions 
of this Code can be applied to the extent applicable, combined with the use of specialist 
literature for these types of bridges. IRC:112-2011 is in line with the new generation of 
rationalised international concrete codes using semi-probabilistic Limit State approach to 
arrive at the desired targets of safety, serviceability, durability and economy in a consistent 
and reliable way. It incorporates up-to-date knowledge of the behaviour of concrete, steel and 
composite structures. It takes into account the present state of the art of bridge construction, 
using modern construction technology, together with current conventional practices in India. 
It also incorporates new developments in the field of bridge engineering that have taken 
place internationally. As such the Code includes many new details within its body, which were 
not covered in earlier codes.
It is realised that the Code is to be used by the present generation of practising engineers, who 
will have to familiarise themselves with the new and more advanced methods of the analysis 
and design used with the Limit State approach. This Explanatory Handbook is intended to 
help the users using such methods.
2  Layout of this Guide
This Explanatory Handbook has 19 Chapters covering Section 4 to Section 18, 
Annexure A-1 & Annexure B-1 of the Code. The content sheet gives the correlation 
between the handbook chapter and the corresponding section of the Code, sequentially. The 



======================================================================
PAGE 11 of 233
======================================================================
IRC:SP:105-2015
4
1st chapter of the handbook (i.e. this chapter) provides a brief background information and 
broad overview of the Code to enable the users of IRC:112 to understand the origin and 
objectives of its provisions.
The handbook generally follows the chapter numbers as per the handbook on the left hand 
side and corresponding relevant section numbers of the Code on the right hand side of the 
page so that guidance can be sought on the Code on a section by section basis. Figure 
numbers generally follow the relevant section number of the Code.
3  Need for New Generation of Codes
The unprecedented and rapid growth of concrete construction, both in developed and 
developing countries, is the driving force behind the search for stronger, better and cheaper 
materials, improvements in analysis and design methods, improved technology and use of 
mechanised, fast track construction methods. The revised Code therefore has to take this in 
to account. The significant developments that necessitate the new generation of Codes can 
be grouped in three categories as follows:
	
A) 
Scientific Developments
	
-	
Unprecedented growth of knowledge about concrete and its structural 
behaviour in the last 20 years
	
-	
Development of new structural forms
	
-	
Research on durability of concrete
	
-	
Growing awareness about sustainable construction
	
-	
Research and experience of seismic response of structures
	
-	
New powerful methods of computer based analysis and design
	
B) 
Technological Developments
	
-	
Development of stronger reinforcing steels, prestressing steels and 
concretes of high strength and high performance
	
-	
Applications of fast track construction techniques and large scale 
mechanisation of construction
	
-	
Use of large sized pre-cast segments and heavy lifting capabilities, 
which allow rapid construction of longer, taller and bigger structures in 
all kinds of difficult environments
	
C) 
Development of Semi-Probabilistic, Limit-State Design Philosophy
	
	
The ‘Semi-Probabilistic, Limit State Design Philosophy’, which allows 
application of uniform and rational safety norms to all types of structural 
elements, provides the basis for many international Codes
	
	
Since the development efforts are continuing at accelerated pace all over 
the world, concrete technology has truly become an international activity, 
especially so for the bridges. It is reasonable to expect that this trend will 
continue.

To meet the changing needs of society, new developments in materials, new technologies 
and additional or new concerns are bound to emerge in different parts of the world. The 
Codes of new generation need to accommodate these developments rapidly. It therefore 
becomes imperative that the Code adopts a rational design philosophy with transparent aims 
and appropriate strategies.
4  Contents of IRC:112-2011
4.1 
New Features of the Code
	
A) 
Section 5 : Basis of Design
	
	
The desired aims and objectives are listed in ‘Section 4 General’ of the 
Code. Section 5 will help users to understand the basis and significance of 
various provisions of the Code.
	
	
The Section 5 includes brief descriptions of the multiple strategies adopted 
by the Code using concepts of limit state philosophy, reliability, limit states 
considered for design, types of actions and their combinations, analytical 
modelling, material properties, service life, design life (normally 100 years), 
methods to achieve durability and design based on full scale testing.
	
B) 
Materials and their Properties
	
	
These are covered in Sections 6 & 18 and Annexure A-2.
	
a)	
Section 6: Material Properties and their Design Values
 
● 
This section covers the main materials, viz. reinforcing and 
prestressing steels, and concretes of various grades. Grades 
of steel reinforcement are extended upto and including Fe 600. 
The concrete grades are extended from earlier M 60 upto and 
including M 90.
 
● 
The simplified design values of properties, which are sufficiently 
accurate for normal applications, are specified. Bilinear stress- 
strain diagrams are specified for reinforcing and prestressing 
steels.
	
b)	
Annexure A-2: Additional Information and Data about Properties 
of Concrete and Steel
	
	
This Annexure gives more accurate values and laws covering material 
properties, which are required for extrapolation of solutions beyond the 
normal range and for use in innovative or new applications. For a normal 
user of this Code, awareness of these properties will help to understand 
the situations in which the design (and construction) should be based 
on more exact values of properties as given in the Annexure.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:105-2015
6
	
c)	
Section 18: Materials, Quality Control and Workmanship
	
	
This Section provides the material properties of manufactured items, 
which are controlled by BIS or other International Codes. These are to 
be used for the procurement, testing and quality assurance purposes.
	
C) 
Section 7 : Analysis
	
	
The Code covers many types of bridges with different geometry, which are 
exposed to different types of actions and combinations thereof, each of which 
represents a different design situation. In order to assess the response of the 
structure in different situations, distinct types of analysis are required. Linear 
elastic analysis are most commonly used and are generally adequate. The 
developments in powerful Finite Element techniques have allowed analysis 
of complex structural forms and loading conditions. The resultant stress fields 
from the analysis can be directly converted to detailing of reinforcing steel.
	
	
The advent of computerised analysis and availability of advanced software 
have put very powerful analytical tools in the hands of designers and raised 
the standards of analysis far above those of the past. These developments 
called for the new Section on ’Analysis’. This Section also includes a number 
of simplifications which have been found to be adequate from past practices 
and experience.
 
 
The new trend set up by fib Model Code 2010 (MC 2010) is for the Codes to 
indicate different levels of analyses, from simplified methods to be used in 
normal applications to more and more complex methods needed when the 
load effects and behaviour of the structures (not considered in the normal 
design situations) become significant and important for proper understanding, 
design and construction.
	
D) 
Detailing of Reinforcement, Prestressing Tendons, and Limiting 
Concrete Dimensions
	
	
Three Sections cover these in greater details than hitherto
	
-	
Sections 15 Detailing General Requirements
	
-	
Section 16 Detailing Requirements of Structural Members
	
-	
Section 17 Ductile Detailing for Seismic Resistance
 
 
Large numbers of figures explain the requirements
	
E) 
Informative Annexures
	
	
This is a new concept adopted to bring some of the pertinent technical 
information to the attention of users. The Annexures do not form part of the 
requirements of the Code. However, by using the information or methods 
given therein, the recommendations of the Code can be implemented 
effectively. These also provide additional or supplementary information for 
creating more awareness and better understanding of the Code among the 
users.

7
	
	
Three numbers of Annexures B-1, B-2 and B-3 are included in the Code.
	
F) 
Repeating Technical Information/Requirements in Format of Tables as 
well as Equations
	
	
The tables are given for ready reference and ease of hand calculations. 
The equations repeat the same in formats suitable for computerising the 
calculations. The tabulated values may not exactly match with those derived 
by equations as the same are rounded off in certain cases.
	
G) 
Optional Use of Working Load/Allowable Stress Method
	
	
To ensure continuity and smooth transition from old Codes to methods of 
new Code, use of working load/allowable stresses method is also permitted 
for some time. This is done through provisions in Annexure A-4. The scope 
and details of this Annexure are on similar lines as those of IRC:18 and 
IRC:21. The exceptions are specifically included in the Annexure.
Almost all operative sections are brought upto date with relevant international standards and 
practices. The Sections and the salient features of the same are as below:
4.2 
Other Improvements
	
A) 
Section 3: Definitions and Notations
	
	
In view of relatively new terminology needed for describing the limit state 
methods and extensive use of mathematical equations and notations, an 
exhaustive coverage is included as ready reference.
	
B) 
Section 4: General
	
a)	
This Section, after describing the applicability to all structural elements 
using normal weight concrete, further allows use of its relevant parts 
for other concretes, (e.g. light weight concretes and hybrid structures) 
based on special knowledge, specialist literature and/or experimental 
data at the discretion and responsibility of the owner/designer.
	
b)	
The underlying assumptions also bring out the important aspect of 
quality assurance and routine maintenance.
	
C) 
Section 8: Ultimate Limit State of Linear Elements for Bending and Axial 
Forces
	
	
For all linear members (including beams, columns, ties, struts etc.) carrying 
axial forces arising from external loads or prestressing effects of bonded 
or unbonded tendons, and resisting simultaneously the bending moment, if 
any, arising from any source, the distribution of strains at any section is taken 
as linear. In other words, plane section before action of forces remains plane 
after the action of forces, right upto the failure state.
	
	
Under this single assumption, which is reasonably valid for most of the 
loadings upto failure stage, the ultimate strength of all types of linear members 
is calculated, using stress-strain relationships given in the Code. Either the 
simplified diagrams or more accurate relationship can be used.

IRC:SP:105-2015
8
	
D) 
Section 9: Ultimate Limit State of Two and Three Dimensional Elements 
for Out-of-Plane and in-Plane Loading Effects
	
	
The generalised or classical solutions for such elements subjected to 
combined in-plane and out-of-plane loading conditions are quite complex. 
This Section gives simplified approaches for the design of slabs and webs of 
box sections.
	
E) 
Section 10: Design for Shear, Punching Shear and Torsion
 
 
The design verification of shear is carried out at Ultimate Limit State (ULS) 
only. The design of members requiring shear reinforcement is based on truss 
model. Shear design of members not requiring shear reinforcement is with 
empirical formulas, evolved based on results of extensive experimentation.
	
	
The design for shear of both reinforced and prestressed members is based 
on the same model. This is a deviation from the past. The rules of torsional 
resistance have also been changed from the past practice. Due to introduction 
of the new methods, detailed explanation is included in the Section itself.
	
F) 
Section 11: Ultimate Limit State of Induced Deformation
	
	
The slender bridge sub-structures such as piers of variable cross-sections, 
with or without piles to support them, could not be checked for buckling of 
overall height by methods given in earlier codes. Cumbersome calculations 
based on advanced elastic methods were required. The present Code has 
rather simplified the work by introducing the criteria of permisssible increase 
of stresses due to second order deformations, which do not require further 
detailed ULS checks.
 
 
For concrete members of uniform cross-section, slenderness is defined 
not only in terms of le/i, (le/r in the old notation) but is based on a factor 
λ lim, defined in the Code, which is a more accurate estimator. The general 
method of calculating the effective length depending upon the stiffness of end 
restraints given in Euro Code is followed. However, to simplify the calculations 
for normally met conditions of piers in bridges, simplified and well established 
values are provided in the tabular form, based on BS 5400. For calculating 
the ultimate strength of slender members, if required, a generalised method 
is included.

Section 12: Serviceability Limit State
	
	
The serviceability checks are restricted to check of stress levels in concrete, 
check of crack widths and check of deflections. Deemed control of crack 
widths by certain detailing parameters of reinforcement without calculation is 
permitted. Other serviceability states, such as vibration, are not covered in 
the Code. For these, specialist literature may be referred.

CHAPTER 2
SECTION 4 : GENERAL
2.1 
Scope
Cl. 1.4.1
Unlike earlier Codes, IRC:112-2011 strictly defines its scope and applicability. The Code 
deals with the structural use of plain cement concrete, reinforced concrete and prestressed 
concrete in highway structures using normal weight concrete. The Code also permits partial 
use of its recommendations for other types of concretes having different properties and 
different applications in which concrete is one of the components, e.g. hybrid structures.
Though the provisions of this Code are strictly applicable to highway bridges (& culverts) only, 
the choice of making use of the appropriately valid provisions of the Code for other highway 
and appurtenant structures is left to the wisdom of qualified and experienced personnel 
involved in such designs.
The Code recognizes that the limit state methods are not yet established in India for design 
of bridges and declares that it “strives to establish a common procedure for road bridges 
including foot bridges in India.” It is inferred, though not stated, that the recommendations 
are based on international practices, which are examined and modified in light of the Indian 
experience of using working load/allowable stress methods.
A ‘hybrid system’ is a system in which load is resisted by combination of two or more 
component materials in such a way that each component supplements its capacity with the 
capacity of the other component. Reinforced concrete and rolled or fabricated structural steel 
can be effectively used to make hybrid structure. Structural steel tubes with concrete in-fill 
are another example of hybrid structure. The consistency of internal strains at the contact 
surfaces, arising from bond is not an essential condition at ULS, although overall deformations 
have to be consistent.
There are several bridge elements (like precast segmental bridges, voided slab bridges, 
continuous bridges and pretensioned girder type bridges), which deserves more detailed 
coverage in the Code. It is expected that the Special Publications of IRC on these elements 
(i.e. IRC:SP: 64,65,66 & 71) will be amended soon to provide for design as per Limit State 
Methods in line with IRC:112.
2.2 
Underlying Assumptions
Cl. 43
The underlying assumptions stated in this Section are mostly the assumptions which the 
designers make about the standards of construction and site management which they expect 
to be followed on the project they are designing. The validity and satisfactory performance 
of the designed structure depends on satisfactory execution about these aspects. These 
assumptions emphasize the role of all the agencies involved in construction viz. Owner, 
Contractor, Supervision Consultant, Design Consultant, in the right perspective for fulfilling 
the design intents, especially the intended service life of 100 years. It is useful to discuss 
some of the aspects in detail, to cover the unstated but obviously related issues.



======================================================================
PAGE 18 of 233
======================================================================

IRC:SP:105-2015
11
The Code becomes applicable with certain basic conditions. The intention behind stating 
these conditions is not to use them as a disclaimer, but to bring to the attention of users 
the fact that following the Code faithfully in the design process alone will not result in the 
satisfactory long term performance of bridges. The role of other agencies in realising the 
intents of the Code, in long service life of the structure is equally important. It is imperative 
that these assumptions in the design Code must be converted into practical, effective and 
contractually enforceable “specified requirements” for each construction process.
The explanations and clarifications on underlying assumptions are as under:
Assumption (1): The choice of structural system and the design of the structure are 
made by appropriately qualified and experienced personnel.
Bridges provide vital communication links, sometimes the only link, in the highway system. 
They dominate our landscape and play a vital role in our visual environment. The importance 
of good conceptual design for any bridge therefore cannot be over emphasised. The ability to 
produce a ‘conceptual design’ is one which is acquired through experience over a period of 
time and is nurtured by the successes and failures of past projects. A great effort is called for 
from professional engineers in understanding these requirements of a bridge project so as 
to fix the optimum structural scheme. The present and future traffic needs, knowledge of the 
hydraulics and flood-history of the river, geotechnical conditions, behaviour and experience 
of other bridges on the same river and in comparable environmental exposure conditions, 
available construction technology, time needed for the construction, cost of materials and 
labour and sustainability concerns are some of the issues involved in identifying suitable 
alternatives at the conceptual design stage.
In short, the conceptual design as well as proper application of the Code can be satisfactorily 
done only by appropriately qualified and experienced personnel, working individually or 
collectively as a team.
Assumption (2): Execution is carried out by personnel having the appropriate 
qualification, skill and experience.
This assumption is self evident, but it is the case of ‘easier said than done’. In practice, 
at all stages of detailed design and execution some of the personnel are in the stage of 
gaining ‘hands on’ experience. They need to be properly trained, guided and supervised 
in order to fulfil this condition. How to achieve this and the other assumptions numbered 
(3), (4) and (5) in Clause 4.2 of the Code is the subject matter of the ‘Quality System’ to 
be set up for controlling the entire activities of project preparation, design, construction and 
maintenance. It should be realised that in expounding all the strategies and their successful 
and reliable application, the Code implicitly depends upon human skills. Management of the 
involved personnel is the subject matter of the ‘Quality Systems’. The IRC has published 
Special Publication SP: 47‑1998 ‘Guidelines for Quality Systems for Road Bridges’ which 
should be referred for setting up and operating management of all these activities. Mandatory 
process control and verification requirements should be specified in the tender documents 
and enforced during design and construction stages.



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 233
======================================================================
IRC:SP:105-2015
12
Assumption (3): Adequate supervision and quality control are provided during all 
stages of design and construction.
This is needed even if the Assumption (2) is otherwise satisfied. It is based on the sound 
principle that systems and human beings are fallible and the resulting errors from non-
application of efforts, un‑intended oversights or downright mistakes can be controlled by 
introducing at least one more level of supervision of the activity. In important projects, more 
than two levels of quality controls are used. Reference is made to IRC:SP:47 for details of 
Quality Systems.
Assumption (4): The construction materials and products are provided and used as 
specified by relevant national standards.
This is another self-evident statement. However it will be a sobering thought to keep in mind 
that the national standards specify only the minimum acceptable requirements. “Doing better 
than the minimum” will normally improve the quality of the end product.
Assumption (5): The intended levels of properties of materials adopted in the design 
are available.
This is obvious for ensuring the validity and adequacy of the design using the Code.
Assumption (6): The structure will be used as intended and is maintained adequately.
This stipulation has come out of the aim of achieving the specified design life using methods 
stated in the Code. The provisions of the Code in themselves are not adequate to do so. 
Timely and proper maintenance and repair of the structures are needed. IRC has published a 
number of guidelines, listed below, which need to be implemented by the owner, by appointing 
the experts or its own in-house staff for this activity.

CHAPTER 3
SECTION 5: BASIS OF DESIGN
3  General
This Section describes the overall basis of the recommendations of the Code. It indicates 
the design philosophy, aims of design, methods of design and other strategies adopted by 
the Code to achieve the stated and unstated aims of design. Various basic choices and 
strategies adopted in the Code are described under appropriate headings. Collectively, they 
provide assurance of achieving the aim of designing functional, safe and durable bridges.
On the basis of the approach outlined in this section, the recommendations can be used with 
full understanding of their context, applicability and limitations. Where the design needs to be 
supplemented by information available from specialist literature or other international codes, 
it needs to be critically evaluated for its applicability and consistency before combining the 
same with the approach outlined in this Section. Format of the Code will allow the future 
modifications and revisions of the Code itself, to include new knowledge and technological 
developments to be presented in a way which is consistent with the overall philosophy and 
basis of design of the present Code.
The Code is based on clear and scientifically well founded theories and models. Though the 
Code presumes that these scientific concepts and methods stated in the Code are generally 
known to practicing engineers, this Section provides some explanations to the fundamental 
concepts adopted in the Code.
3.1 
Aims of Design
Cl. 5.1
3.1.2	
Reliability Aspects and Codal Approach
Cl. 5.1.2
The unprecedented development of computational capabilities, the increasingly available 
databases on variability of materials and loads, the development of new sensor technologies, 
the use of new materials, the new level of maturity of probabilistic methods and many 
advances in the field of structural mechanics have paved the way for a more prominent role 
of Structural Reliability methods as rational tools for development of design codes. Current 
international design codes and standards (e.g. ACI 318, and Euro Codes) are based on level 
1 methods that employ only one “characteristic” value of each uncertain parameter and its 
variability. (These are also known as ‘Semi-probabilistic’ methods). 
Target reliability level is often expressed in terms of reliability index β, which is mathematically 
related to the probability of the event of which reliability is investigated. The relationship of 
probability (of failure in reference period of one year) and index β is expressed in a tabular 
form bellow:
β Values Related to the to the Failure Probability Pf
	
Pf	 10-1	
10-2	
10-3	
10-4	
10-6
 
β 1.28 2.32 3.09 3.72 4.75
For more detailed explanation refer to the literature on reliability and the fib Model Code 
2010.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:105-2015
14
The Euro Code defines target β = 4.8 for a one-year return period, which is equivalent to 3.8 for 
a 50-year return period. This is for regular structures. Other values are given in these codes, 
if the consequences of collapse of the structure are especially severe or insignificant.
The probability and reliability based evaluation of the risk of achieving or not achieving a 
certain aim and keeping the risk within ‘acceptable limits’ by choosing appropriate partial 
factors for loads and strengths is the fundamental method adopted by the Code. This Code 
has not defined the values of ‘acceptable limits’ used in the Code. However from the literature 
regarding the basis of Euro Codes the targeted ‘β’ values can be judged by comparison. In 
cases where ‘β’ values cannot be assessed with any degree of certainty, the prevailing design 
practices are re-examined and adopted with modifications, and retrofitting the requirement in 
the probability format of the ‘partial factor method’ as is done for other requirements (provisions) 
for sake of consistency. The Code does not use the direct evaluation of risk using methods 
of mathematical probability. It uses semi-probabilistic methods following the design format 
based upon statistical concepts of characteristic values of loads and material properties, and 
multipliers to modify them, which are termed as partial factors. The Code strives to achieve 
the desirable degree of reliability by approximate methods, using a combination of factors as 
outlined in this clause of the Code.
3.1.3	
Safety, Serviceability, Durability and Economy
Cl. 5.1.3
The Code aims to achieve safety, serviceability, durability and economy in the design and 
construction of bridges by stipulating certain set of requirements about the materials, structural 
models, methods of analysis, design approach and detailing apart from the controlled quality 
of construction for realizing the design aims.
The acceptable limits of safety and serviceability, measured in terms of probability with wide 
international acceptance, are as follows:
	
a)	
The level of the probability of structural failure under action of the working 
loads (i.e. safety) is kept less than 10-6 (one in a million) and less than 10-4 
(one in 10,000) of exceeding the specified performance levels at service 
loads (i.e. serviceability), in period of one year. The Codal method of doing so, 
namely the use of partial factors on loads and material properties, reasonably 
assures that the targeted levels of probability are met. This assessment 
does not cover risks arising out of human error or accidents of non-structural 
nature. Based on these basic risk levels, the risks of failure within the design 
life are approximately given by the annual risk multiplied by the design life in 
years. (This is true enough for low values of annual probabilities, although 
not mathematically accurate).
	
b)	
The aim of achieving durability is based on the past experience of the 
behavior of structures located in various climatic environments in India. The 
international experience and current practices of achieving durability are 
taken into account. These methods are covered in Section 14 and further 
discussed in detail in Chapter 12 of this handbook.
	
	
For the methods of calculation of the concrete cover to the reinforcement 
based on the rate of penetration of the attacking agents or the types of 
deteriorating mechanisms for targeting a minimum stipulated service life, the 
designers can refer to special literature such as fib bulletins.

c)	
Achieving economy is addressed indirectly in the Code by allowing maximum 
exploitation of the materials used and accepting risk levels appropriate for 
various situations as indicated in Clause 5.1.3, (1) and (2).
3.2 
Limit State Philosophy of Design
Cl. 5.2
The basic approaches of Limit State Methods are stated in Section 5.2 (1) to (6). The 
explanations for 5.2 (1) to (3) are as below. Others are self explanatory.
	
1)	
A structure designed to serve its function is subjected to various direct 
external actions or indirect actions resulting from environmental and geo-
technical phenomenon during its service life, which defines its loading 
history. It experiences different physical situations having exposed to different 
combinations of actions, termed as ‘Design situations’.
	
	
Limit state philosophy of design refers to a condition of a structure beyond 
which it no longer fulfills the relevant design criteria. The condition may refer 
to a degree of loading or other actions on the structure, while the criteria refer 
to structural integrity, fitness for use, durability or other design requirements. 
A structure designed by limit state method is proportioned to sustain all 
actions likely to occur during its design life, and to remain fit for use, with an 
appropriate level of reliability, for each limit state.
	
2)	
In the limit state approach for designs, ultimate strength including strength 
controlled by induced deformations (ULS) and serviceability limit state (SLS) 
are mainly considered. Semi-probabilistic methods are used to verify that the 
limits are not exceeded. The serviceability limit states presently include checks 
to control overstress in concrete, crack-widths and limiting the deflection of 
the structure. The deflection limits specified are aimed to achieve indirectly 
the rigidity and robustness and to avoid any visual discomfort, rather than to 
achieve any functional need of the road traffic.
	
	
The Code indicates that for some structures the vibration control may be an 
important consideration (e.g. for foot bridges and foot paths of road bridges) 
although it is not considered in the Code. Limit state of fatigue has also not 
been included.
	
3)	
Considering the statistical nature of variation of loads and material properties, 
time dependent changes in the same, uncertainties and limitations of 
structural models and methods of analysis, quality of construction and 
finally the deterioration and maintenance, a margin called factor of safety 
against risk of failure in meeting the performance has to be provided in the 
design. However over design has to be kept within limits for sake economy, 
considering initial cost as well as life-cycle cost.
 
 
Use of partial factors, which are different for the same load in verification 
of different limit states, is made together with appropriate material factors 
describing the minimum strength properties of the materials to achieve the 
targeted level of reliability (safety). Appropriate experience based methods 
are used to achieve the same where statistical methods have not developed 
sufficiently.

IRC:SP:105-2015
16
3.3 
Limit States
Cl. 5.3
In the context of performance-based Limit State Design, performance criteria for serviceability 
and structural safety are specified for two basic groups of limit states.
	
a)	
Ultimate Limit State Criteria: Ultimate limit states are limit states associated 
with the loss of structure by collapse or unacceptable damage to the structure, 
thereby leading to loss of life, disruption of operation and/or damage to the 
environment. Thus, the Ultimate Limit States are related to design principles 
with respect to the performance-based Limit States for structural safety. They 
may relate to limit state of equilibrium and/or limit state of strength.
	
b)	
Serviceability Limit State Criteria: Serviceability Limit States correspond 
to the states beyond which specified performance Requirements for a 
structure or a structural component are no longer met. Various limit states to 
be satisfies under serviceability are:
	
i)	
Limit State of Crack Control
	
ii)	
Limit State of Deformation
	
iii)	
Limit State of Vibration
	
iv)	
Limit State of Fatigue
 
 
Fatigue verification can be carried out only when details of fatigue vehicles 
are made available. Fatigue vehicles are not yet defined in IRC codes. This is 
still under consideration of IRC. However, pending the finalization of fatigue 
vehicles, the fatigue verification can be avoided provided following conditions 
are met with:
	
i)	
For reinforced concrete structures when the stress in the tensile 
reinforcement is maintained less than 300 MPa under Rare 
Combination of Serviceability Limit State as against 0.8 fy specified in 
Clause No. 12.2.2 of the Code.
	
ii)	
For prestressed concrete structures under the frequent combination 
of actions and prestressing force, only compressive stresses occur 
at the extreme concrete fibers, under frequent load combination of 
Serviceability Limit State.
Vibration verification for bridges is specifically required but is deemed complied by limiting 
deformations specified in the Code in all cases except for special types of bridges and 
footbridges or components of footways, as indicated in the Code.
3.4 
Actions and their Combinations
Comprehensive description of this is included in Chapter 17, Annexure A1, ‘Combination 
of Actions for Bridge Design’. The values of actions and partial factors to be used in different 
combinations for verification of design by Limit State Method are available in Annexure B of 
IRC:6.
It may be noted that limit state approach is to be followed for structural design of bridge 
components only. Until the Foundation Code, IRC:78 is modified to include material safety

factors and resistance factors for the soil parameters, un-factored loads are to be used for 
checking of base pressure under foundation, stability check for foundation and for checking 
of maximum load on pile foundation. Table 3.4 of IRC:6-2010 therefore shall be used only for 
the structural design till such time.
3.5 
Representative Values of the Properties of Materials
Cl. 5.5
The material properties are, in principle, based on the statistical distribution of the values, 
using characteristic properties such as mean value or upper or lower fractiles. However, in 
actual practice this is possible for limited cases. For tensile strength of steels, the manufacture 
is controlled by a minimum specified value as defined by BIS Standards and this nominal 
minimum strength is assumed to represent the characteristic strength of 5 percent fractile, 
which assumption is on the conservative side for assessment of structural strength.
The compressive strength of concrete is based on the statistical parameters. The other 
properties needed for the design are derived from co-relation equations with the compressive 
strength, which have been established in laboratories. These properties are not directly 
verified at site by testing, although the Code does not prohibit such verification.
The available correlations are generally based on tests conducted on cylinders of 150 mm 
diameter and 300 mm length. In Indian scenario 150 mm cubes are used for acceptance 
tests. The Code has followed a factor of 0.8 over cube strength for arriving at the cylinder 
strength. This is an acceptable approximation and will not have significant impact from design 
considerations. Some inherent small discrepancy may be observed on this account. This is 
more pronounced, but on conservative side, for concretes of grade M60 and higher.
Where higher levels of accuracy is desired, the Code recommends use of more accurate 
properties (Clause 5.5.3), obtained from one of the two ways. One way is to use established 
expression of the property derived after incorporating the larger number of factors which have 
effect on the property than the one recommended by the Code (Refer Annexure A-2) for the 
design in Section 6. The other method is to use the experimentally established values, which 
are arrived at by using proper statistical methods, and sufficient number of test samples to 
enable estimates to have 95 percent level of reliability.
3.6 
Analytical Methods to Evaluate Behavior of Structure
Cl. 5.6
The use of both Global and Local analysis is required by the Code using the appropriate 
methods. Emphasis is for use of an appropriate model/method for applicable actions, materials 
and desired level of accuracy. For details refer Chapter 5 (Section 7).
3.7 
Design Based on Full Scale Testing
Cl. 5.7
For some elements, design based on the experimentally established use of materials, 
structural configurations and detailing is accepted by the Code. Salient features of such 
testing and problems faced in the interpretation of results from such tests are:
	
-	
Testing carried out on full scale structural element (prototype) and not on a 
scale model.



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 233
======================================================================
IRC:SP:105-2015
18
	
-	
The methods of analysis required to explain or predict the actually observed 
behavior are far too complex for use in design office. The failure is taken as 
reaching the ultimate load capacity, or deformations which are large enough 
to make the element or structure unsuitable for use.
	
-	
No mention has been made about the factor of safety to be used on the load 
capacity or deflections thus obtained, nor of the number of tests required to 
establish the design, or the statistical methods to be used, as has been done 
in case of material properties established experimentally in Clause 5.5.3.
	
-	
The choice of the acceptance criteria is left to the mutual agreement between 
the testing agency and user, except in the case of acceptance testing of 
prestressing anchorages and devices for which the methods of testing as 
well the acceptance criteria are defined by the applicable national standards/ 
or fib publication.
3.8 
Durability Aspects
Cl. 5.8
The overall approach of the Code for achieving the desired durability is discussed in 
Clause 5.1.3. For further explanatory discussion refer to Chapter 12 (Section 14).
Design service life is specified in the Code for normal structures, temporary structures and 
special structures (Table 5.1). The operational way of designing for durability is to define 
durability as a design service life requirement. In this way the non-factual and rather subjective 
concept of “durability” is transformed into a factual requirement of the “number of years” 
during which the structure shall perform satisfactorily without unforeseen high costs for 
maintenance. (exact definition or criteria of ‘satisfactory behavior’ are not given, but are to be 
understood as qualitative descriptions) The designed service life can be achieved by using 
two principles one, deem-to-satisfy rules and other, the performance-based parameters.
The Code follows deem-to-satisfy rules, which are based on specifying a certain concrete 
composition, minimum cement content, minimum concrete cover, controlling material 
properties (especially by restricting harmful ingredients), time dependent properties of 
concrete appropriate to the design life, appropriate return periods for actions of environmental 
origin, specifying intended use along with maintenance requirements which is assumed to 
result in achievement of the specified service life.
The performance based design for durability and service life is usually based on requirements 
of performance of the structure. Performance based design for service life of structure is 
quite complex. It not only requires in-depth knowledge and data base of the parameters 
determining the ageing and deterioration of concrete structures and constituent materials, 
but also the quality of workmanship needs to be factored in from data base. The performance 
level of deterioration also needs to be well defined in this case. This design method is not 
covered in the present Code.

SecTION 6 : Material Properties & Their Design Values
4.1 
General
Cl. 6.1
The Code, has dealt with materials with two aspects. The first is the “Manufacturing 
Specifications” and actual properties of manufactured materials and other is the “Design 
properties” or the “Design Models”. Design properties are simplified descriptions of mechanical 
properties of different materials used in the process of design of bridges.
As far as the manufacturing specifications of materials are concerned, there is no change in 
new IRC:112 as compared to the earlier codes (IRC:18 & 21). For the specifications of the 
materials used viz. reinforcement, prestressing steel & cement, reference is made to the 
relevant Indian Standards which are listed in Section 18 and Annexure A-2 of the Code. 
However, substantial modifications are made in the design models of the material which 
are based on the large amount of the data gathered in past few years. This vast pool of 
knowledge available today is now incorporated in this Code which will help designers to get 
more rational designs.
Section 6.0 describes these simplified models considered as adequate for design of bridges. 
More elaborate models are included in Annexure A-2 of the Code.
4.2 
Untensioned Steel Reinforcement
Cl. 6.2
4.2.1	
Specifications and Grades
Cl. 6.2.1
Over past few years, better varieties of reinforcing steels are being used in structures in other 
parts of the world. Also, higher grades of steel which have more ductility are manufactured 
in our country and are now covered in the latest version of IS:1786. To get benefit of these 
developments, these improved verities are included the Code. Use of reinforcing steel of 
grades up to Fe 600 is introduced. This change will help in reducing amount of steel used 
in RCC structures. Code has also introduced the galvanized and stainless steel that have 
improved corrosion resistance. This provides more alternatives to designer to achieve longer 
service life of the bridges, particularly in aggressive environments.
4.2.2	
Strength, Stress-Strain Diagrams, Modulus of Elasticity and Ductility
Cl. 6.2.2
To have consistent approach with the limit state philosophy, the term characteristic strength, 
fyk is introduced for steel in the Code. It is the same as the “yield stress” as defined in IS:1786 
which is,
	
fyk 
= 
yield strength in case of mild steel or hot rolled/heat treated HYSD 
	
bars.
 
 
= 
0.2 percent proof strength in case of cold worked HYSD bars.
Typical stress-strain diagrams for mild steel and HYSD (both Hot rolled/heat treated and cold 
worked) are shown in Fig. 6.1 of the Code.

For design purpose, code has suggested two alternate models, bilinear or simplified bilinear 
stress-strain curves. These, with partial material safety factor γs, are shown in Fig. 6.2 of the 
Code.
Fig. 6.2  Bilinear Stress-Strain Diagram of Reinforcing Steel for Design
To explain the use of this diagram, a typical curve is generated for grade of Fe 500 with 
γs = 1.15 in Fig. 6.1. The elastic modulus for this grade is typically 200 GPa. Here, yield stress 
fyk = 500 MPa, hence, fyd = fyk/γs = 500/1.15 = 435 MPa. The value of strain at this point is 435 
MPa/200 GPa = 0.002174. For design purpose, the tensile strength, ft shall be considered 
as minimum value given in Table 18.1 of the code (reproduced from IS:1786) which is 
108 percent of fyk i.e. 540 MPa. Note that the minimum value of 545 MPa is specified in 
IS:1786 for grade Fe 500 as a manufacturing requirement. Thus ultimate stress will be 
ft/γs = 469.5 MPa. In absence of data from manufacturer, the value of characteristic strain, 
εuk can be assumed as 5 percent as given in Table 18.1 and IS:1786 for uniform elongation.

Hence, the strain limit for sloping arm of the curve shall be 0.9 εuk = 4.5 percent. Then the 
ultimate stress for design purpose will be 463.4 MPa, arrived at by liner interpolation.
Similar diagrams for other grades of steel can be constructed. It shall be noted that there 
is no limit on strain if the horizontal branch of the curve is used, as limiting ultimate stress 
remains as fyd.

Stress-Strain Properties for Design
Cl. 6.3.5
For purpose of analysis & design, code has allowed to use the representative stress-strain 
curve as shown in Fig. 6.3 of the Code for wire, strands and bars. For design purpose 
simplified two stress-strain diagrams, first the bilinear and other simplified bilinear as in 
Fig. 6.4 of the code are suggested. These are reproduced below:
Fig. 6.3  Bi-Linear Stress-Strain Diagram of Prestressing Steel for Design
These diagrams shall be constructed as explained for un-tensioned steel as well. Note that 
like reinforcing steel, there is no limit on strain for horizontal branch of simplified bilinear 
design diagram.
In Fig. 6.4 of the Code, the yield point is defined at 0.1 percent proof stress (fp0.1k). This 
value can be taken as 0.87 times of fpk. The term fpk is the characteristic tensile strength of 
prestressing steel, which is same as fp, corresponding to breaking load as given in relevant 
IS code. As per IS:14268, for strand of dia 15.2 mm, fpk = 260.2 kN (cross section:140 mm2) 
= 1862 MPa. Hence, fp0.1k = 0.87 * 1862 = 1620 MPa and fpd = 1620/1.15 = 1409 MPa. Then 
corresponding strain ε = 1409MPa/195 GPa = 0.007224. In absence of accurate data on 
characteristic strain of prestressing steel, the value of εu can be taken as 0.02. Thus, the 
stress strain diagram for 15.2 mm, 7 ply, Class II, stress relived strand to be used for design 
is shown in Fig. 6.4.

Relaxation Loss for Design
Cl. 6.3.6
The method of calculations of loss in force due to relaxation of prestressing steel recommended 
in the Code. This Code has introduced the expression for estimation of the loss due to 
relaxation at any time after tensioning upto 30 years in Annexure A-2 as well. It has also 
introduced the method for estimating the effect of temperature on relaxation of steel. This 
is particularly useful for steam cured elements. The relationship between relaxation losses 
and time upto 1000 hours is in Table 6.3 of the Code and it is markedly different from the 
corresponding Table of IRC:18 (i.e. Table 4B).
4.4 
Concrete
Cl. 6.4
In previous codes (i.e. IRC:18 & 21), design properties of concrete were provided upto grade 
M60. In this code, these properties such as stress strain relationship, models for predication 
of creep & shrinkage strains, multi axial state of stress and the variation of these properties 
with respect to time, etc. are given for the grades upto M90. It is now possible to use concrete 
upto grade M90 for the design of bridges.
4.4.1	
Grade Designation
Cl. 6.4.1
Three groups of concrete are specified in Table 6.4, Ordinary concrete, Standard concrete 
and High performance concrete, based on method of proportioning the concrete and use of 
mineral admixtures (to improve any specific performance parameters).
Grades which are produced using nominal mix proportions by weight of its main ingredients 
are termed as Ordinary Concrete. M15 and M20 are covered under this group. Grades M15 
to M50 are covered under Standard Concrete, which is produced using chemical admixtures 
to achieve certain properties in fresh condition and when mineral admixtures are used to 
achieve certain parameters of the concrete like reduced porosity, the concrete is termed as 
High Performance Concrete.
As standard practice, the grades of the concrete are defined in term of the characteristic 
strength (5 percent fractile) at 28 days on cube size of 150 mm. However, the Code has also 
allowed using the term “characteristic strength” at other than 28 days strength for concrete, 



======================================================================

23
which is produced using high content of ingredients that slow down the setting process of 
concrete in its initial days, but gain the full target strength at say 56, 72 or 84 days. Hence, 
now it is possible to take advantage of realistic strength of concrete, for design at service 
stage. However, in such cases, it is necessary to check the design for the loads which may 
act during initial period of low strength.
The Eurocode has adopted concrete strength described in terms of cylinder (as also in the 
US and many sources in international literature). The Indian Codes, as well as IRC:112 
use cube strength. The two are assumed, for simplicity, to be connected by co-relation of 
fck.cyl = 0.8 fck.cube and the relation between fcm.cyl = fck.cyl + 8 MPa, translates to fcm.cube = fck.cube 
+ 10 MPa. This has been used in IRC:112. This difference should be kept in mind while 
referring to the international sources.
4.4.2	
Design Properties of Concrete
Cl. 6.4.2
4.4.2.1	
General
Cl. 6.4.2.1
Design properties of concrete, such as fcm, fctm, fctk,0.05, fctk,0.95, Ecm, are specified directly in 
Table 6.5 of the Code for grades of concrete M15 to M90 and their correlation equations with 
fck are included in Annexure A-2. The tabulated values are rounded off and may not exactly 
match with the computed values arrived at by use of the correlations.
Depending on the purpose of analysis, it is necessary to use appropriate probabilistic value of 
these properties, i.e. either their mean value or 5 percent fractile or 95 percent fractile values. 
For example, for a section design, concrete strength shall be taken as lower 5 percent fractile 
i.e. fck, whereas, the mean value of the modules of elasticity (Ecm) shall be used for calculating 
the deflection of the members. This is because a small local patch of acceptable but having 
low strength concrete (upto 5 percent fractile of concrete) in the member decides the ultimate 
strength carrying capacity of the entire member whereas the value of Ec at every section of 
the member, and not a small weak zone, influences the deflection of the member.
4.4.2.2	
Compressive strength and strength development with time
Cl. 6.4.2.2
This clause gives the expression for development of compressive strength with time. It 
can be noted that for normal Portland cement, 34%, 60%, 78% 90% and 120% strength is 
expected on 1st, 3rd, 7th, 14th day and one year after casting of concrete. This data is useful for 
taking number of decisions during construction such as, the time for applying initial prestress, 
striking off formwork etc. It should be noted that the gain in strength after 28 days is not 
allowed to be used for design of new structures by Clause 6.4.2.2 (4), except in situations as 
given in Note No. 3 below Table 6.4.
Concrete compressive strength also depends on the duration during which it is subjected 
to a constant stress. A sustained stress in the range of working stress may lead to a slight 
increase in compressive strength. However, high sustained stresses accelerate the process 
of micro-cracking and may eventually lead to failure. As mentioned in Clause 6.4.2.2 (2), this 
effect of reduction of strength due to sustained loading is considered in factor 0.67 in ultimate 
strength calculations.

The Clause 6.4.2.2 (3) provides the principles for acceptance of concrete strength obtained 
at site with limited number of cubes. Though the title of this clause is `the verification of early 
age strength by testing`, the principles given here are equally applicable for the results of the 
cube tests for other than the early strength i.e. say at 28 days.
4.4.2.3	
Tensile strength and its development with time
Cl. 6.4.2.3
Tensile strength of concrete is one of the important parameters in reinforced and prestressed 
concrete structure. It is expressed either as direct or axial tensile strength (which is difficult 
to measure in laboratory), flexural tensile strength or split cylindrical tensile strength. The 
mean, 5 percent fractile & 95 percent fractile values of direct tensile strength for different 
grades of concrete are given in Table 6.5 of the code and the co-relations between the three 
are given in Equations 6.4 & 6.5. As per the code, the tensile strength of concrete is required 
to be used for calculation of shear resistance of section (Eq. 10.4), for deciding the minimum 
reinforcement (Eq. 12.1), for calculations of crack width (Eq. 12.6), to control of shear cracks 
within webs (Eq. 12.14) and to find out anchorage length of pre-tensioned tendons (Eq. 15.7). 
It is influenced significantly by the fracture mechanical properties of the concrete which in 
turn is function of type, size and shape of the aggregates used. Hence for important projects 
it is necessary to verify the tensile strength of the concrete using split cylinder or flexural 
beam test.
4.4.2.4	
Multi-axial state of stresses
Cl. 6.4.2.4
The compressive strength of concrete under multi-axial state of stresses is higher than 
uniaxial compressive strength and is generally presented in form of failure surface. CEB-FIB 
Model Code 20101 may be referred for further details. The higher strength is not for design of 
main elements but for local zones only.
This effect is considered in specifying the higher strength & higher critical strains of concrete 
confined by adequately closed links or cross ties which reach the plastic condition due to 
lateral extension of the concrete at ULS.
The expressions are available in Annexure A-2. In these equations σ2 can be estimated as 
explained in following example:
For circular pier of diameter 1.5 m, the closed links if Φ 16 of Fe 500 are provided at spacing 
of 200 mm c/c with clear cover of 50 mm, σ2, i.e. the radial pressure exerted by the links at 
ULS
 
σ2 
= 
2 x As*(fy γs) (dia. of link *spacing)
 
 
= 
2 x 201 * (500/1.15)/(1500-2 x 50-16) *200)
 
 
= 
0.6317 MPa
4.4.2.5	
Stress-Strain relationship and modulus of elasticity
Cl. 6.4.2.5
For unconfined concrete, the Code has allowed the use of parabolic-rectangular (Fig. 6.5) 
as well as simplified equivalent stress blocks, such as rectangle or bi-linear for the design 
purposes (Annexure-A-2). Here it should be noted that the shape of parabolic rectangular 
stress-strain diagram is not the same for all grades of the concrete (as given in IS:456) but 
varies with the value of exponent ‘n’, which is different for different grades of concrete.

The Code suggests different values of Young’s modulus E depending on purpose of analysis. 
For example, for static & quasi-static loads acting for short duration, and dynamic loads such 
as Earthquake & Wind loads, secant modulus of elasticity, Ecm (Fig. A2-1 of the Code) is 
recommended. For analyzing impact/shock loading, dynamic modulus of elasticity to be used 
which can be taken as 1.25 times of Ecm. For analysis for seasonal variation of temperature 
0.5 Ecm shall be used. For temperature gradient analysis, Ecm shall be used.
4.4.2.6	
Shrinkage
Total shrinkage strain εcs, consists of two parts; drying shrinkage strain, εcd and autogenous 
shrinkage, εca. Drying shrinkage is time dependent strain, primarily caused by loss of water 
when ordinary hardened concrete is exposed to air with relative humidity of less than 
100 percent. Incidentally the term ‘relative humidity’ referred to in the Code means the 
average annual value of relative humidity of the geographical area under consideration. 
For a particular humidity and temperature, the total drying shrinkage of concrete is most 
influenced by the total amount of water present in the concrete at the time of mixing and to a 
lesser extent, by the cement content. Autogenous shrinkage, also known as basic shrinkage, 
self-desiccation shrinkage or chemical shrinkage is associated with the ongoing hydration 
reaction of the cement. It occurs irrespective of the ambient medium due to chemical volume 
changes and internal drying.
The process of drying shrinkage is slow due to the slow diffusion process of loss of moisture 
from concrete. Within a short period of time, the surface region of the concrete section reaches 
the state of moisture equilibrium with the surrounding environment but due to the slow diffusion 
process of moisture loss, the relative humidity in the pore system of the concrete region away 
from the surface remains high. Thus the moisture distribution in the concrete section is non-
uniform, increases from surface towards the center and leads to the development of internal 
stresses, tensile in the regions near surface and compressive in the interior regions. This 
often leads to the surface cracks. In case of autogenous shrinkage, similar stresses do not 
develop as this deformation develops nearly uniform throughout the section of the member.
Since the shrinkage stresses develop gradually with time they are substantially reduced by 
the creep. Also these are influenced by mechanical properties, especially the modulus of 
elasticity of the aggregates. For high performance concrete drying shrinkage is substantially 
reduced as the capillary porosity is low and restricts the loss of water.
Prediction of shrinkage:
The final values of autogenous and drying shrinkage strains for different grades of the 
concrete are tabulated in Tables 6.6 & 6.8 of the code and to predict these strains at any 
time after the casting of concrete, the multiplying coefficient βas and βds are as per Equations 
6.13 and 6.15. are given.
The values of final autogenous shrinkage, εca(∞) as in Table 6.6 are obtained from following 
equation:
 
 
εca(∞) = 2.5 (0.8 fck - 10) 10-6

Similarly, the final values of drying shrinkage εcd (∞) as given in Table 6.8 are derived from 
the basic Equation A2-26 of Clause A2.6 of Annexure-2 of the Code, which is reproduced 
below:
The basis drying shrinkage strain εcd.0 is calculated from:

RH

RHo = 
100%
Note: exp(*) has the same meaning as e* where e is the Napierian base
In Table 6.7 and Equation 6.15 of the Code, ho represents the notional size of the member in 
mm, expressed as ho = 2 Ac/u, where Ac is the cross-sectional area (mm2), u is the perimeter of 
the member in contact with the atmosphere (mm). ho is approximately the distance travelled 
by water molecule from the center point of the cross section to the surface of the concrete. 
The concept will be clear from the following example:
Consider the following box section: Assuming that both inner and outer surfaces are 
exposed to atmosphere, water loss from both the surfaces, i.e. the maximum distance the 
water molecule can travel, i.e. from center of the wall to the outer surface of the concrete. 
The concept is also true for other regularly used concrete sections like Solid Square, solid 
rectangle, solid circular or hollow circular section. It shall be noted that autogenous shrinkage 
is not dependent on the RH or member size.
	
Ac = 36002 – 30002
 
 
= 3960000 mm2
 
U = 4*(3600 + 3000)
 
 
= 26400 mm
	
ho = 2 Ac/u
 
 
= 150 mm
In the super-structure of the bridge various components have different effective thicknesses. 
This will lead to differential strains and stresses in the components, unless this difference

is significant, it is not necessary to calculate the effect separately, relying on the shrinkage 
steel to control the adverse effects. If significant, special analysis and provision of steel is 
necessary.
4.4.2.7	
Creep
Cl. 6.4.2.7
The time dependent strain due to constant stresses is referred as creep. The clause explicitly 
relates to creep of concrete.
The concrete may be considered as an aging linear visco-elastic material. If the stress in 
concrete does not exceed 0.36 fck (t) the creep remains proportional to the stress. Also, 
it shall be noted that the creep is partially reversible. The ratio of creep strain and elastic 
strain is called the creep coefficient Φ. Similar to shrinkage, the Code has specified final 
creep coefficient for design i.e. at end of 70 years in Table 6.9. These values are tabulated 
for two values of RH i.e. at 50 percent and 80 percent for notional sizes of 50 mm, 150 & 
600 mm and at different ages at the time of loading. For other notional sizes and RH, the 
basic equations are available in Annexure A-2 i.e. Equations A2-14 to A2-25.
An example for calculation of shrinkage and creep strains at various stages of loading for a 
PSC T Girder is given below:

CHAPTER 5
SECTION 7 : ANALYSIS
5.1 
General Provisions
5.1.1	
Response of Structure to Loads
Cl. 7.1.1
This section covers various simple as well as advanced methods of analysis for RCC and 
Prestressed members. Behaviour of special load transferring devices (like STU’s, Bearings 
and Seismic Arresters) and their influence on global analysis is also covered in this section. 
These provisions are based on the current national and international practices.
Structural analyses are performed at three levels; Global analysis of overall structure, member 
analysis of parts of the structure and local analysis of a part of the member or of structure. 
These are carried out together in one analysis or separately for individual members Separate 
local analyses are often necessary in situations where global analyses performed do not 
cover all relevant structural effects.
Structural analysis is a fundamental tool and basic to make design decisions. The Engineer 
chooses the idealisation (or model) to represent the structure. The basic requirement in 
modelling is that the model should correctly represent the expected behaviour of the structure 
and its constituent elements. Since concrete is a heterogeneous material, its properties are 
dependent on member size, amount of reinforcement or prestressing of the constituent 
members as well as the age of concrete. Simulations of the material heterogeneity in a 
computationally efficient and simple manner are the challenges, to be met by the Structural 
Engineer.
Generally, analysis outputs will provide the designer with the internal forces or stress resultants, 
namely bending moments, shear forces and axial forces and may provide displacements. 
Methods which provide internal stresses and strains, such as finite element methods, are not 
precluded, although care is needed in the interpretation of results in such cases.
This Section assumes that the designer has adequate knowledge of the analytical methods. 
In order to have better understanding of the clauses, it is useful to have general background 
of the classical as well as the modern methods of analysis. These methods have developed 
rapidly in last 50 years for calculating linear and non linear static and dynamic effects. More 
explanations of these analysis, their historical development, background and applicability are 
included in the Chapter 19 of this Explanatory Handbook.
5.1.2	
Methods of Analysis
These clauses give a general statement of the types of structural analyses that may be used 
for bridges. The use of various types of analyses in appropriate situations is also indicated. 
For details of these analysis refer detailed discussion given in Section 19 of this Explanatory 
Handbook.
5.1.3	
Modelling of Foundations
Cl. 7.1.2, 7.1.3
As of now the design of the foundations is based on the classical methods of soil mechanics. 
Although many are based on the estimation of Ultimate Capacity of the type of foundation

and use of an overall safety factor against failure or excessive settlement, the format of 
Limit State is not followed. For details of the design recommendations reference is made to 
IRC:78. Where required, reference is made to the standard text books and literature.
5.1.4	
Redistribution of Moments
Concrete members are subjected to creep shrinkage and other time dependent effects which 
lead to redistribution of internal stresses in the members. The code provides for including these 
effects in the design without carrying a detailed analysis of these effects in this clause. This 
is based on the experience. For situations not covered under the conditions of redistribution, 
detailed analysis may be required.
5.1.5	
Non-Linear Analyses and Plastic Analyses
For detailed guidance of the use of these methods refer Chapter 19 of these Guidelines.
5.5 
Analysis for SLS and ULS
Cl. 7.2, 7.3
 
a) 
A first order analysis may be useful for short to medium span bridges. A 
second order analysis should always be encouraged for bridges with long 
spans and/or bridges with tall piers.
 
b) 
A linear elastic analysis is sufficient for strength based design. Redistribution 
of moments can be done as per the code to account for material non-linearity, 
without complicating the analysis method. When redistribution of moments 
is done, the design shear forces and design reactions shall be taken as the 
higher of the values ‘with’ or ‘without’ redistribution. Linear Elastic Method of 
Analysis is applicable for both SLS & ULS checks. For SLS checks, the section 
properties for various members shall be based on un-cracked sections. Fully 
cracked section analysis may be used for ULS checks to reduce effects of 
imposed deformations. Modulus of Elasticity of concrete for SLS checks 
and deformation calculations shall be appropriate to the nature of load. For 
sustained loads, effective modulus of elasticity, ‘Ec,eff’ as per Eq. 12.15 of the 
code shall be used to account for creep of concrete under sustained loads. 
For instantaneous loads, secant modulus, ‘Ecm’ shall be used.
	
c)	
Plastic analysis may be resorted to for checking of the structure under 
accidental load combination/seismic load combination. In such cases, a 
preferred design failure mechanism and its attendant hinge locations shall 
be determined. Plastic method of analysis is applicable for ULS checks, 
provided adequate ductility is provided at sections/locations where successive 
hinge/yield lines form and the method adequately model the global effects in 
combination with the local effects.
	
d)	
Strut & Tie Model may be adopted for design of structural elements like 
Blister Blocks, Anchorage zones, Corbels, Nibs, Diaphragm of Box Girder, 
Pile Caps etc. (i.e. structures with areas of non-linear strains, where Hooke’s 
law is not applicable).

e)	
Non-Linear analysis is usually resorted to (though very rarely) for verifying 
the sufficiency of the provided strength to accommodate the expected in-
elastic deformations under seismic loads. For the non linear analysis, the 
bridge model shall include non-linear properties of the material being used.
5.3 
Combined Global & Local Effects 
Cl. 7.5
In addition to global analysis, local analyses may also be necessary, particularly when the 
assumption of linear strain distribution does not apply. Examples of this include:
 
● 
Prestressing anchorage zones & Blister & Deviator Blocks
 
● 
Members with significant changes in cross section or geometry
 
● 
Articulations or Half-joints
 
● 
Deep Beams & Brackets
 
● 
Areas of discontinuity like opening in member
 
● 
Concentrated load locations
Local effects need to be combined with the global effects, wherever necessary. For detailed 
discussion of combining Global and Local analysis or performing sub-structure analysis refer 
Chapter 19 of the Explanatory Handbook.
5.4 
Structures & Structural Frames
Cl. 7.6
5.4.1	
General
The elements of structure are classified by consideration of their nature and function as 
beams, columns, slabs, walls, plates, arches, shells .etc.
A beam is a member for which the span is not less than 3 times the overall section depth, 
primarily without axial forces. Otherwise it should be considered as deep beam.
A slab is a member for which the minimum panel dimension is not less than 5 times the 
overall slab thickness, primarily loads perpendicular to its plane. For beams and slabs, the 
effective span shall be taken as per Clause 7.6.1.1 of the Code.
A column is a member for which the ratio of largest lateral dimension to the lesser lateral 
dimension does not exceed 4, primarily with axial forces. Column with ratio exceeding 4 shall 
be considered as a wall. A column shall be considered ‘short’, if the ratio ‘le/i’ in each plane 
of buckling is such that the failure takes place without involving secondary effects.
5.4.2 
Clause 7.6.1.2 of the code gives simplified expressions for the effective width of 
deck slab and bottom slab which can be taken in the analysis of the overall section at the 
mid span as well as at the support span for simply supported beams, although in reality, the 
participating width is varying and is not independent of the load and load position. For the 
continuous spans the situation is more complex. An FEM elastic analysis of the full span 
subjected to a defined position and magnitude will show the participating width. However, in 
practice this concept of effective width simplifies the calculation tremendously, and is found 
to yield satisfactory Designs.

5.5 
Composite Concrete Construction
Cl. 7.7
5.5.1	
General
Pre-cast concrete girders composite with cast-in-situ deck slab is quite commonly used 
for bridges. In such composite members, where only RC and PSC is used as materials, 
the concrete is placed in two or more separate stages, generally leading to different time 
dependent properties of the concretes cast at different time. The analysis needs to account 
for these properties during various stages of construction and service Transformed sectional 
properties need to be considered for the analyses. Also, relative (i.e. differential) shrinkage 
of the deck slab with respect to the precast girder, duly reduced on account of creep of 
concrete, needs to be taken into account in case of composite decks as per Clause 7.7.2.1 
of the code.
At the serviceability stage the stresses in the concrete and steel are in the elastic or low level 
of plasticity. The differential shrinkage and creep between deck slab and girder are locked-in 
and needs to be taken into account.
For ULS condition checks both the concretes of girder and deck slab reach very high levels 
of strains well in to the plastic range, where the initial differential strains do not change the 
stress levels due to relatively small differences at the elastic stage This is the logic behind 
sub Clause 7.1.1(2).
5.6 
Structural Effects of Time Dependent Properties of Concrete
Cl. 7.8
The effects of creep & shrinkage in reinforced & prestressed concrete members can cause 
significant changes in not only the deformations but also the internal stresses. Creep 
substantially modifies the initial stress and strain patterns, increasing the load induced 
deformations, relaxing the stresses due to artificially introduced and naturally imposed strains 
and progressively activating the restraints to deformations.
Consequently, there is a need to consider the stress redistribution and its effect in design in 
order to make a proper assessment of the load carrying capacity of the structural member in 
service.
There is also a need to take special care for design of slender or thin sections, where 
second order deformations may have significant influence from considerations of buckling 
instability.
5.7 
Prestressed Members & Structures
Cl. 7.9
This clause covers specific rules for prestressed concrete members & structures, dealing 
specifically with pre-tensioned as well as post tensioned structures. The rules for design and 
detailing aspects such as prestressing forces, prestress losses, the treatment of prestress in 
section design and global analysis etc. are included.
The Code has introduced the concept of prestress as an action. For ultimate limit state 
checks, effects of prestressing are considered as resistance, duly taking into account the 
pre-strain.
The maximum force applied to a tendon is specified in Clause 7.9.2. The limit is set at 90 
percent of 0.1 percent proof stress. Since proof stress is 0.87fp as per Fig. 6.3 of the code, 



======================================================================
PAGE 41 of 233
======================================================================
IRC:SP:105-2015
34
maximum force works out to 78.3 percent of the breaking strength. This limit can be exceeded 
only in exceptional situations, up to 95 percent of 0.1 percent proof stress which works out 
to 82.6 percent of breaking strength, only if greater accuracy of measurement (i.e. within 
±5 percent) is assured at site. The maximum prestressing force in tendon after instantaneous 
losses is limited to 75 percent of breaking load or 85 percent of 0.1 percent proof stress which 
works out to 72.3 percent of breaking strength.
Short and long term losses in prestressing steel for pre-tensioned elements as well as post 
tensioned elements are defined in Clause 7.9.3 of the Code, which are as under :
Short Term Losses:
 
● 
Elastic Shortening
 
● 
Anchorage Draw-in including deformation of the anchorage itself, if any
 
● 
Friction
Long Term Losses:
 
● 
Concrete Shrinkage
 
● 
Concrete Creep
 
● 
Steel Relaxation
These losses are explained in the Code in detail. The values for seating at the anchorage 
on account of wedge draw-in & deformation of the Anchorages itself are to be defined by the 
prestressing system supplier.
Regarding ‘Losses Due to Friction and wobble’ given in 7.9.3.2 (2) of the Code, it is worth 
remembering that ‘µ’ , the coefficient of friction between the tendon and its duct is a basic 
property between two materials and the ‘k’ is a coefficient for wobble effect (representing 
angular displacement per unit length of duct multiplied by the length is the function of ‘µ’ and 
the average effective deviation per unit length of the tendon/duct assembly. The later is the 
function of tendon fixing accuracy, diameter of the duct compared to the tendon assembly, 
its weight, support distances, stiffening by curvature, quality controls & workmanship etc. It 
varies from site to site, The values given in the table are based on experience and are to be 
used in the design. In actual use these values should be ascertained at site by using two 
jacks, one as active and other as passive and thus measuring the actual effect of friction and 
wobble together.

Fig. 7.1 gives the diagrammatic representation of the losses in pre-tensioning while Fig. 7.2 
gives the similar diagram for post tensioning.
5.8 
Design and Detailing for Curved Tendons in thin Sections
Cl. 7.10
Prestressing tendons embedded in curved thin sections (slabs or shells) of single or double 
curvature exerts inward, in plane and/or out of plane pressures. This pressure has tendency 
to punch the tendon out of the section under effect of local punching. For derivation of the 
internal tensile stresses set-up in the section due to curvature, refer Chapter 19. For curved 
tendons in the webs which curve in plan, the action is further complicated, Apart from the 
local punching out effects (punching shear) overall inward thrust is created on the webs, This 
is resisted by the web acting like a curved slab resisting out of plane loads and carrying them 
to the upper and lower slabs acting as supports.
The Code includes the method of checking for the punching effect, bending effects and 
corresponding shears to achieve safe design. This is based on the recommendations 
published by Prof. Breen in Proceedings of FIB Congress in Washington in 1994. Fig. 7.2 of 
the Code is self-explanatory in this respect.
5.9 
Special Load Transferring Devices
Cl. 7.11
Vertical and horizontal load transfer from Superstructure to the foundation takes place with load 
transferring devices like bearings, dislodgement preventing stoppers and shock transmission 
units. Type and disposition of these loads transferring devices controls the magnitude and 
the manner in which the load is transferred to foundation. The deign needs to account for the 
reactions developed from these devices as well as restraints imposed, if any.
For bridges built in grade or cross fall, the bearings are normally set in horizontal position. 
This ensures that only vertical reactions are transferred to the bearing resulting from vertical 
loads. In case the bearings are placed parallel to the grade, the bearings are subjected to in-
plane forces also in addition to out-of-plane forces, resulting from vertical loads. Permanent 
in-plane forces can lead to increased time dependent displacements of bearings due to 
creep, which is not desirable. Type of bearings and bearing arrangement provided in a bridge 
therefore has significant influence on the design forces for the substructure & foundation. 
Seismic forces transferred to the substructure are also greatly influenced by the bearing type 
and arrangement.

Section 8 : ULTIMATE limit state of Linear Elements  
for bending and axial forces
6.1	
This section covers Ultimate Limit State (ULS) design of linear elements which 
are subjected to the bending with or without axial force. The rules for ULS design for shear, 
torsion, punching, and membrane elements are in Sections 9 & 10. The methods given here 
are applicable for the members like piers, slabs, I girders, longitudinal design of box girders, 
etc. The additional checks for buckling of slender columns are in Section 11.
Cl. 8.1
6.2 
Stress-Strain Distribution at ULS
Cl. 8.2
Unlike working stress method where the design checks are based on stress limit, in ultimate 
limit state the design checks are based on strain limits. The strain limits, viz. εc1, εc2 & εc3 and 
εcu1, εcu2 & εcu3 for various grades of concrete are specified in Table 6.5 of the Code. The values 
εc1 & εcu1 are used in generalized stress-strain distribution of concrete which are shown in Fig. 
A2-1 of Annexure A-2.The values εc2 & εcu2 are used in defining the parabolic -rectangle 
stress-strain diagram as shown in Fig. 6.5 whereas the values εc3 & εcu3 are used in defining 
the bilinear stress-strain relationship as shown in Fig. A2-3 and rectangular stress distribution 
shown in Fig. A2-4 of the Annexure A2 of the Code. εc1, εc2 & εc3 are the strain limits when 
the cross section is subjected to the pure compression (without bending), whereas, εcu1, εcu2 
& εcu3 are limits when the section is subjected to bending and axial forces. The limiting strain 
εc2c & εcu2c for confined concrete are in Clause A2-8 of Annexure A-2 of the Code. From 
Table 6.5 of the code, it can be seen that for concrete grade upto M60, εcu1 = εcu2 = εcu3. It can 
also be seen that higher concrete strength show more brittle behavior, reflected by shorter 
horizontal branch of the concrete stress-strain graph. Fig. 8.1 below makes it clear.
The possible range of strain distribution is shown in Fig. 8.1 of the Code, which is presented 
below for better understanding of the clause.
The possible strain diagrams in accordance with the stress-strain diagrams discussed above 
are shown in Fig. 8.2 of the Code. These diagrams are based on Bernoulli’s hypothesis. The 
strain limits of the stress-strain diagram for concrete and steel results in five different zones 
for the design of cross-section. With the assumption of the perfect bond, the strain diagrams 
in the Fig. 8.2 govern not only the concrete compressive stresses but also the stresses in 
reinforcement (reinforcing steel or prestressing steel including pre-strain εp(0) at any place in 
the cross-section). The compressive strain of reinforcing steel caused by creep and shrinkage 
of concrete are normally negligible in ultimate limit state and hence not considered.
In zone 1, the whole section is subjected to tensile strain whereas in zone 5, it is subjected 
to compressive strain. In both the zones, the location of neutral axis is outside the section. 
The location of neutral axis changes from top fibre to bottom fibre of section in zones 2, 3 
& 4. Similarly, the location of point ‘C’ (which is characterized by the compressive strain in 
concrete εc = εc2 also shifts from top to bottom in zones 2 to 4 following the movement of 
neutral axis.

Fig. 8.1  Possible Strain Distributions in the Ultimate Limit State
Procedure for DESIGN CHECKS
(A) 
Procedure for Computer Program
For a given cross-section, the ultimate axial load carrying capacity can be checked for uniform 
strain of εc2 if the applied force is pure compressive and for 0.9 εs if the applied axial force 
is pure tensile. The ultimate axial force carrying capacity of the section for given bending 
moment shall always be between these two limits. The position of neutral axis, x for which 
the ultimate force carrying capacity of the section matches with the factored axial force acting 
on the section is obtained by solving the following equilibrium condition.
 
f(x) = Pus (x) + Puc (x) + N =0
Eq.C 8.1 
Where N is the factored axial force applied and Pus (x) and Puc (x) are the contributions from 
steel and concrete respectively in the ultimate resistance of the section and can be express 
as
 
Pus (x) = Σσs(x) As
and 
Puc (x) = ∫σdAc
The notation σs cover the steel stresses in both prestressed and non-prestressed steel.

38
After getting the location of neutral axis at equilibrium, the ultimate bending moment carrying 
capacity of the section about neutral axis is worked out and compared with the factored 
bending moment acting on the section.
Finding out the roots of Eq. C8.1 involve solution of non-linear equation. The equation is solved 
using numerical method such as Regula-Falsi method. In this method, the initial assumptions 
of two values of x, one each on either side of solution are required. It is necessary to satisfy 
condition, i.e. ƒ(xi) * ƒ(xl+l) < 0 at each of iterations.
(B) 
The Direct Solution of Rectangular Sections
In case of direct solution, magnitude of compressive force (Cu) and its location is obtained 
from concrete stress block in compression. The ultimate failure of concrete is caused by 
crushing of concrete which requires the limiting strain (εCu2) on extreme compressed fiber of 
concrete. Following two cases are discussed here:
	
1)	
Neutral axis within the section
	
2)	
Neutral axis outside the section
1) 
Neutral axis within the section
	
a)	
Parabolic – Rectangular stress block
 
 
When neutral axis is within the section, strain in extreme compressed fiber is 
limited to εCu2 and corresponding stress fcd. For rectangular section of width b 
and neutral axis depth x the resultant force Cu is expressed by
	
	
 
 
And its position, measured from extreme compressed edge is defined by 
b2x. The expressions for β1 and β2, as function of strain εc, are:
	
	
The numerical values of β1 and β2 are shown as the function of cube strength (fck in

action. With reference of Appendix A-2.9 of the Code, the expressions for 
β1 and β2 are simplified to,

Neutral axis outside the section
	
a)	
Parabolic – Rectangular stress block
	
	
The adoption of the assumptions in Clause 8.2.1 of the Code leads to the 
range of possible strain diagrams at ultimate limit states subjected to different 
forces. Numerous conditions of neutral axis outside the section arise between 
two cases of strain distribution, one with uniform εc2, over section for uniform 
εcu2 compression and other is εcu2 for extreme compressed edge and 0 at 
neutral axis. For this condition strain diagram is defined by assuming that 
compressive strain εc2 is at level (1-εc2/ εcu2) h, with notation

Though in IRC:112 there are no guide lines for obtaining rectangular stress 
block for (x > h) case, it is possible to write formula that gives the equivalent 
depth h* in relation to x as, 
 where k factor is determined by 
imposing that . h* λh when x = h. It results in

Calculation of Strength of Rectangular Section
Determination of Nrd and Mrd, i.e. resisting capacity of the section.
To illustrate the principles, a sample case is considered with neutral axis within the section 
for rectangular section.
Consider a rectangular section with breath b, total depth h. Strain at extreme compressed fiber 
of concrete is. Strain distribution at ultimate limit state across the section and corresponding 
stresses are illustrated in Fig. C 8.3. A’s is steel in compression and whereas As is steel in 
tension.
Fig. C 8.3  Rectangular Section at Ultimate Limit State
Two requirements are to be satisfied throughout the flexural analysis and design of reinforced 
concrete beams and columns:
	
1.	
Stress and strain compatibility- The stress at any point in a member must 
correspond to the strain at that point. A strain over the depth of the member 
is assumed to be linear.
	
2.	
Equilibrium- Internal forces must balance the external load effects, as 
illustrated in Eq. C8.1 and rewritten as:
For equilibrium,
	
	
	
Nrd = Nc + N’s + Ns
where,
	
Nc is the resultant of compressive forces in concrete, N’s is resultant force in 
compression reinforcement As’ and Ns is resultant force in tension reinforcement 
As.
Each term can be expressed as,
	
	
	
Stress in reinforcement can be expressed as,

where,
	
	
Similarly,	
where,
	
	
The nominal moment capacity, Mrd, for the assumed strain distribution is found by summing 
the moments of all the internal forces about the centroid of the column. The moments are 
summed about the centroid of the section, because this is the axis about which moments are 
computed in a conventional structural analysis.
	
	
	
In case both the reinforcing bar yielded 
	
	
	
	
	
	
β1 and β2 are factors given in Tables C 8.1 and C 8.2.
Design of Reinforcing Bars in Case of Bending Without Axial Force
Parabolic-rectangular stress block:
Consider a section with breadth b, depth h and effective depth d with a design bending 
moment MEd
In order to determine if section is sufficient using tensioned steel (As) alone, the limiting bending 
moment Mur,lim is calculated and compared with design moment on section.
	
	
	
Where Fc = β1fcdbxlim is resultant of compression stresses and zlim = (d – β2xlim)
In order to ensure that the structure has ductile behavior, the strain in steel of tensioned 
reinforcement must be greater than that of strain corresponding to the limit of elasticity, which 
is es ≥ eyd = fyd/fs. This implies that neutral axis does not exceed depth xlim, with ecu as limiting 
strain in concrete,

a)	
If MEd is smaller than Mur,lim, As is alone sufficient.
 
 
To find the actual neutral axis depth corresponding to MEd,
	
	
	
	
	
This, by solving becomes,
	
	
	
 
 
Finally, with z = (d – β2 x),
	
	
	
	
b)	
If If MEd is greater than Mur,lim, As is alone is not sufficient, some compressive 
reinforcement A's in compression is needed. To calculate it,
	
	
	
	
	
The tensioned reinforcement is

y = λx is the depth of compression zone and fcd is designed compressive 
stress. Values of these factors are given in Table C 8.4.

Liver arm 
	
	
	
	
	
Rearranging:
	
	
	
	
	
Once y is known area of steel can be calculated.
Note: To ensure the ductile failure, i.e. to make section under-reinforced, IS:456 has specified 
minimum strain in reinforcement as fy/ (1.15 * Es) + 0.002 at failure. The Code has specified 
this limit as εyd which is equal to fyk/(γs * Es); it results in higher depth of neutral axis for balanced 
section as compared to one calculated by IS:456.

Biaxial Bending
Cl. 8.3
The Code does not directly give any method for designing members subjected to direct load 
and bi-axial bending, other than working from first principles. However this is generally not a 
problem for the practicing engineers since there are several commercial softwares available 
internationally for solving such problems based on strain compatibility methods.
For those practicing engineers who do not have access to the computer software, a simplified 
approximate method is given in the Code for bi-symmetric sections, in which separate design 
in each principal direction is done disregarding the bi-axial bending, as a first step.
Graphical representation of the problem is shown in Fig. C8.4 below as an example with 
rectangular column.

Y-axis; (b) Uniaxial Bending about X-axis;  (c) Biaxial Bending about X-axis and  
(d) Interaction Surface in Pear-Shaped Relationship
Horizontal sections of the interaction surface shown above at each value of axial load can 
be represented by Equation 8.3 of the Code. The application of this principal as given in the 
Code is self-explanatory.

Section 9 : ULTIMATE Limit State of Two and Three Dimensional 
elements for out of plane and in plane loading effects
7.1	
Scope
Ch. 9.1
This section deals with the design of two & three dimensional elements.
The procedure given is useful when the structure is analysed by Finite Element Method using 
membrane, plate or shell elements.
The membrane elements, which have only translation degrees of freedom have stress 
resultants in-plane only i.e., nEdx, nEdy & nEdxy as shown in Fig C9.1. Membrane elements are 
used to idealise the shear walls etc. which are subjected to in plane forces and not out-of-
plane forces.
Fig. C9.1  Stress Resultants for Membrane Element
The plate bending elements on the other hand do not produce any in-plane forces and have 
three degrees of freedom per node i.e. one out-of plane translation and two rotations about 
two axes perpendicular to the out of plane (normal to surface) axis. It gives bending moments 
about x, y axis i.e. mEdx, mEdy & twisting moment mEdxy and out of plane shear forces vEdx and 
vEdy as shown in Fig. C9.2.
Fig. C.9.2  Force Resultants for Plate Bending Element
The shell element is combination of membrane element and plate bending element having 
six degrees of freedom at a node (three translations and three rotations) and gives all the 
eight force resultants i.e. nEdx, nEdy, nEdxy, mEdx, mEdy, mEdxy, vEdx and vEdy.

This section of the code gives the guidelines for design of these elements using Ultimate 
Limit State.
7.2 
One Way and Two Way Slabs and Walls
Cl. 9.2
One way two way slabs and the retaining walls are the typical examples which are subjected 
to the out-of-plane forces that generate the bending moments, out-of-plane shear forces 
and insignificant membrane forces. Hence “Plate bending” element is appropriate element 
for modeling of these structures. The Code prohibits use of the ultimate strength methods 
based on local yielding (e.g. yieldline method) in bridges, except for calculating resistance to 
accidental impact loads.
7.3 
SUB-Elements of Box-Structures
Cl. 9.3
	
1)	
The Code allows the design of the box type sections with separate designs 
for longitudinal effects and transverse effects.
	
2)	
For global analysis (longitudinal) of box-girders, a linear element i.e. beam 
element can be used, which gives overall longitudinal bending moment, 
shear forces and torsional forces for the section design.
	
3)	
For transverse analysis, a slice of 1.0 m length of the box girder at desired 
location can be modeled using beam element with pinned support at bottom-
most nodes of webs, to represent the stiffness of webs. The design of these 
beam elements shall be done using ULS method for linear element as 
specified in Section 8.0.
 
4) 
In case of the box girder having complex geometry such as fish-belly- the 
girder can be modeled using shell elements. The design method for the same 
using sandwich model is available in Annexure B-1.

General Solution for Two Way Slabs, Walls and Shell Elements
Cl. 9.4
7.4.1	
Simplified Design for Tensile Reinforcement for Orthogonal In-Plane Effects
In this section the code has included a simplified design method for calculating tensile 
reinforcement for orthogonal in plane effects, σEdx > σEdy and τEdxy.
In this method:
 
● 
The sign for compressive stresses needs to be taken as positive.
 
● 
X and Y and the direction along which the reinforcement is provided and 
sEdx shall be greater than σEdy
 
● 
No reinforcement is required if both σEdx & σEdy are compressive (i.e. positive) 
and in-plane shear stress τEdxy is small. To determine whether τEdxy small or 
not, Code has included the criteria as σEdx.σEdy > τEdxy.
 
● 
If τEdxy is significantly high or either σEdx or σEdy is tensile then the reinforcement 
needs to be provided in that direction.
Two worked examples demonstrate the procedure of the design.

7.4.2	
Simplified Design of Combined In-Plane Forces and Out of Plane Bending and 
	
Shear
As per the approach suggested in this clause, the element is divided into three layers of 
plate, each having 1/3rd thickness; top & bottom resist the in plane forces & bending moments 
with resulting lever arm and the central one resists the out of plane shear forces. The detailed 
procedure is available in Annexure B-1 and is explained with worked examples in the 
commentary of the said Annexure.
Worked EXAMPLE
Cl. 9.1
Following are the results at the center of membrane element used for analysis of diaphragm 
of bridge deck having thickness of 500 mm with Grade of concrete M40 and reinforcement 
Fe500
	
	
nEdx  
= 
3000 kN/m
	
	
nEdy  
= 
2000 kN/m
	
	
nEdxy 
= 
1500 kN/m
As per Clause 6.4.2.8 (1), fcd = 0.67 x 40/1.5 = 17.86 MPa
 
 
σEdx  
= 
6.0 MPa
 
 
σEdy  
= 
4.0 MPa
	
	
tEdxy  
= 
3.0 MPa
 
 
σEdx x σEdy = 
24
	
	
tEdxy2	 
= 
9.0< 24
Since σEdx.σEdy > τEdxy
2 and both σEdx & σEdy are compressive, no reinforcement in both direction 
is required (provide the minimum reinforcement as given in section).
Also both σEdx and σEdy are less than fcd, the section is safe.
Worked Example
Cl. 9.2
Keeping the other details same in example C-9.1, by changing the forces to following:
	
	
nEdx  
= 
2600kN/m
	
	
nEdy  
= 
2000kN/m
	
	
nEdxy 
= 
2500kN/m
 
 
σnEdx 
= 
5.2 MPa
 
 
σnEdy 
= 
4.0 MPa
	
	
tEdxy  
= 
5.0 MPa
Though both σEdx and σEdy are compressive, σEdx.σEdy (i.e. 20.8) <τEdxy
2 (i.e. 25), hence it is 
necessary to provide the reinforcement.
Since σEdx>|τEdxy|
	
	
f’tdx = 0

SECTION 10 : DESIGN FOR SHEAR, PUNCHING SHEAR AND TORSION
8.1 
Scope
Cl. 10.1
The scope is to cover the design provisions for shear in flexural members including arriving 
at the shear reinforcements.
The shear can arise out of (a) flexure, (b) Interface shear due to concrete cast at different 
times (c) shear between web and flange in flanged sections (d) due to punching (e) due 
to torsion. Different types of shear arising in flexural members can be represented in the 
following flow diagram:
The shear design has to be carried out under ultimate limit state only. When the member 
requires shear reinforcement, the reinforcement has to be calculated based on a truss model. 
For members without shear reinforcement the capacity of the section is estimated using 
empirical formula.
The adoption of higher grade of concrete with high permissible stress leads to slender web 
resulting in large height to thickness ratio giving rise to significant second order out-of-plane 
bending effect. This leads to failure of web at shear force less than sectional force predicted 
based on uniform crushing of concrete using the formula given in the code. Hence the code 
places restriction for shear strength of concrete grades higher than M60. The shear strength 
for the same shall be restricted to strength class M60 for design purposes.
8.2 
Design of Flexural Members for Shear
Cl. 10.2
8.2.1	
Shear Design Model of Members without Shear Reinforcement
Cl. 10.2.1
The sub clauses of the code are quite elaborate and the same can be followed by the 
designers without any difficulty.
Deck slab designed by using the effective width method as given in Annexure B-3, need not 
be checked for flexural shear.
8.2.2	
Zones of Shear Design
Cl. 10.2.2.1
Members loaded beyond their shear capacity need to be provided with shear reinforcement 
to resist the full shear force. Members subjected to bending and shear has four distinct

zones. The zone adjacent to the support does not develop any crack. Hence this zone is 
called no crack zone (Zone A). The next zone (Zone B) develops shear cracks but does not 
develop any flexural crack. In the next zone (Zone C) both flexural and shear cracks appear. 
This zone is further subdivided into two zones as zone C1 and zone C2. In the zone C1 cracks, 
are parallel and in the zone C2 the cracks converge. In zone D only flexural cracks appear. 
The appearance of cracks in different zones in shear is shown in Fig. 10.1 (a) of the Code.
The structure can be supported directly or indirectly as shown in Figs. C10.1 (b) & (c). In 
zone A, the type of support affects the compression fields. In case of direct support, a fan 
like compression field develops. In the area confined by the beam end and the steepest 
inclination of compression field i.e. θ = 45º no shear reinforcement is required in this 
zone. However the shear reinforcement required at section ‘d’ away from support shall be 
extended in this region. As per this clause, loads located between ‘d’ and ‘2.5d’ from support, 
no shear reinforcement is required for the shear generated by these loads as the loads 
are carried to supports directly by the compression strut. This Clause is in contradiction to 
Clause 10.3.3.3 (7) and this is explained in detail in Section 10.3.3.3 (7). The horizontal 
component of the compression strut will give raise to tension. To cater for this tension, 
additional tensile steel needs to be provided over and above the tensile steel provided for the 
bending effect. Reference shall be made to Clause 10.3.3.3(6) also for provision of additional 
longitudinal reinforcement.
In case of indirect support, a fan like compressive field does not exist. In the common inter-
section zone of supporting and supported beam, suspension reinforcements are required 
in addition to shear reinforcement. Preferably this reinforcement shall be provided in the 
supporting beam to resist the reaction transferred by the supported beam to the supporting 
beam.

Beam with Constant depth
	
	
The design of shear resistance of members is based on truss model.

The Truss model can be described as shown in the sketch
Fig. C10.2  Truss Model and Notations for Members with Shear Reinforcement
	
	
The truss model consists of compression chord, tension chord and diagonals. 
The web consists of compression strut diagonals of concrete and tension 
diagonals of steel, consisting of bent up bars, vertical stirrups. ‘θ’ is angle 
of compression strut and α is the inclination of steel stirrups. Angles are 
measured with respect to the axis of element.
 
 
The angle of compression strut θ shall be limited to minimum of 21.8º and 
maximum of 45º. Similarly the angle of shear stirrups shall be limited to 
minimum of 45º and maximum of 90º. As the angle of truss can be varied in 
the calculation, this method is called as “Variable Truss angle Method”.
	
2) 
Beams of variable depth
	
	
The truss model shown in Fig. 10.3 of the Code or any other truss model can 
be used for carrying out shear design of varying depth beams having both 
chords inclined. While designing local zone of beams of short length having 
inclined chords, the zone can be designed as a beam with parallel chords, 
provided the components of chord forces parallel to the shear force is taken 
into consideration as the components of inclined chord forces contribute 
towards shear.
8.2.4	
Design Shear Force
As discussed earlier, the beams can be supported directly or indirectly. In case of direct 
support, the net shear force acting at a section, ‘d’ (effective depth away from the support), 
shall be used for design of shear reinforcement of the section and the same reinforcement 
shall be extended over the support. This will be applicable only if there are no concentrated 
loads located between the support and distance ‘d’ from support. However for checking the 
capacity of strut against crushing, the shear force acting at the face of support shall be 
considered.
In case of indirect supports the shear at the face of support shall be used for arriving at the 
reinforcement as well as for checking the capacity of strut. 
In case of variable depth of beam, the compression chord or tension chord or both chords 
may be inclined. The inclinations of these chords generate chord forces. The components 
of these chord forces reduce the shear force acting on the section if they act favorably i.e. if 



======================================================================
PAGE 65 of 233
======================================================================
IRC:SP:105-2015
58
the depth of section is increasing in the same direction as the bending moment increases. 
However in case where the depth is decreasing in the direction of increasing bending moment, 
the components of chord forces will add to the shear force. Depending upon the direction of 
the prestressing force it can offer relief or add to the shear force. In Fig 10.4 of the Code, the 
chord forces reduce the externally acting shear at the section.
In case of indeterminate structures, in addition to the above forces the shear due to hyper 
static effects shall also be considered.
The value of the prestressing force that is to be used in the calculation is as follows:
	
a)	
The Code allows the designer to use the full capacity of cable, if it can be 
mobilized.
	
b)	
If the prestressing force is already accounted for while arriving at the net 
shear force, duly accounting for all losses in the cable, then the increase in 
prestressing force due to cracking of concrete [Force at full capacity of cable 
if the corresponding strain could be achieved minus the force in the cable 
accounted for in the computation of shear force] only is to be taken as an 
additional force.
	
c)	
Component of this increase in force in the vertical direction can be taken as 
an additional resistance force as if contributed by the shear reinforcement, 
in case the prestressing force is ‘favorable’. In case the prestressing force is 
‘unfavorable’, the resistance shall be reduced.
If the strain in the cable is not attaining a value corresponding 
 then the force in cable shall 
be taken corresponding to the strain attained and the full capacity of the cable shall not be 
used.
Conservatively this increase in stress in the prestressing cable can be ignored and only the 
prestressing force available may be considered after accounting all losses. This method of 
design will lead to slight increase in shear steel.
For unbonded cable, at the ultimate limit state stage the force in the cable shall be assumed 
to be same as the initial prestressing force less the losses. Increase in cable force may not 
be considered. This will lead to slightly conservative design shear force.
In the development length portion, the prestressing force develops gradually in case of pre-
tensioned girders. Hence the corresponding force shall be considered by taking a linear 
variation.
In case of beams of varying depth, the design shear force shall be calculated by ignoring the 
relief offered due to inclination of chords for justifying the no requirement of shear reinforcement. 
However, when the section needs to be provided with the designed shear reinforcement, the 
relief or additional force due to chord inclination shall be considered for arriving at the net 
shear force. The effect due to prestressing force shall always be considered.

VEd is defined as the shear force in the section resulting from external loading and 
prestressing. Chord forces also, if considered, then the net shear force is defined VNS in the 
Code (i,e. VNS = VEd – Vccd – Vtd).
8.3 
Design Method
Cl. 10.3
8.3.1	
Elements not Requiring Design Shear Reinforcement
Cl. 10.3
	
1)	
The shear capacity of concrete VRdc shall be greater than VEd which is the 
design shear force in the section considered resulting from external loading 
and prestressing. No relief due to inclined chord force shall be considered 
while arriving at VEd. For sections having shear capacity VRdc more than VEd 
no designed shear reinforcement needs to be provided. However minimum 
shear reinforcement needs to be provided as per Clause 16.5.2. This 
minimum reinforcement can be omitted in case of slab structures.
	
2)	
The formula given for calculating the shear capacity of section in the code 
is empirical only. The shear strength depends upon the tensile strength of 
concrete which in turn depends upon the compressive strength of concrete to 
the power 1/3, longitudinal reinforcement ratio and depth of the section. The 
longitudinal reinforcement contributes to the shear resistance in two ways 
viz. by dowel action and by controlling the crack width which will influence 
the amount of shear that can be transferred across the cracks by aggregate 
interlock. Shear strength increases with increase in reinforcement ratio but 
the rate of such increase reduces as the reinforcement ratio increases. 
Depth of section also plays significant role which is called as size effect on 
the shear strength, particularly for shallow depth members such as slabs.
	
3)	
The clause places a restriction that the formula given (Eq. 10.4) is applicable 
only to single span members. Reasons are not clear for this restriction. For 
other two types of construction viz, continuous and multiple span integral 
bridges this formula shall not be used and all sections shall be treated as 
cracked sections. Shear reinforcement shall be designed according to 
Eq. 10.7 after verifying the concrete capacity as per Eq. 10.8.
In any prestressed section there will not be appreciable longitudinal reinforcement. Hence 
the capacity of section to resist the shear without shear reinforcement as per Eq. 10.1 will 
be very negligible. Hence the designer can straightway use the Eq. 10.7 and 10.8 for design 
of prestressed concrete sections for shear, both in continuous and multiple span integral 
bridges.
In case of continuous bridges, for sections near the intermediate support, the bending moment 
will be very high and the section would automatically crack. Hence the Eq.10.4 cannot be 
used. The other affected sections in these structures are the contra flexure sections and 
sections near to contra flexure sections. The code has reservation with regard to applicability 
of this equation to these regions. Hence without giving reasons as to why this equation cannot 
be applied to the continuous structures, the restriction is placed. By the same argument for 



======================================================================
PAGE 67 of 233
======================================================================
IRC:SP:105-2015
60
the single span integral bridge also this formula is not applicable as these sections (contra-
flexure and adjacent sections) exist in said structures. However the code permits the use of 
this equation for single span integral bridges.
The other possibility is this formula is applicable only for one way spanning members because 
it does not take into account, the effect of two ways spanning of members.
In case of prestressed concrete members, at first the section needs to be checked whether 
cracked or uncracked. If the flexural tensile stress is less than 
 under maximum bending 
moment, then the section is deemed to be uncracked and the equation 10.4 of the Code 
shall be used to estimate the capacity of the section. This is generally applicable to zone B. 
In case the section turns out to be cracked, then equations 10.7 and 10.8 of code shall be 
used for calculating the capacity of section. In case of cracked sections and sections having 
inadequate capacity, the designed shear reinforcement needs to be provided. In prestressed 
beams the longitudinal tensile reinforcement may be absent or very minimal. Hence the 
capacity of section to carry the shear without shear reinforcement will be virtually absent. 
This is because VRdc in case of beam having no shear reinforcement directly depends upon 
Asl, the longitudinal reinforcement which will be either absent or negligible.
Hence the designer, for most of the cases can straightway use Eq. 10.7 and 10.8, without 
checking the capacity of section to carry shear using Equation 10.1.
Derivation of Equation 10.4 for Un-cracked Prestressed Sections
For sections having no shear reinforcement, the shear failure is expected to occur when the 
principle tensile stress, anywhere in the section exceeds the tensile strength of concrete 
fctd, which shall be taken as fctk.05/γm. Taking tensile stress as negative, the minor principal 
stress.
	
	
	
where,
 
σcp is the compressive stress at centroid due to axial loading or prestressing force 
(after all loss, including partial safety factor), taken as positive.
 
σbending is the stress due to bending moment at the level considered in MPa, taking 
compressive stress as positive. This includes the bending stress due to prestress 
and all other design loads. The section is subjected to normal stress and shear 
stress.
	
τ is the applied shear stress = 
	
VRdc is the shear resistance of the concrete in the web from the shear force required 
to cause web cracking.

about the centroid of the section. This has been taken as S in the code.

Substitute 
	
	
	
	
Squaring both sides:

+ (fctd)2 + 2 fctdx = τ2

In order to take care of the transmission length in pre-tensioned construction a 
constant k1 is introduced.
	
	
	
	
b is the web width at centroidal axis after allowing for deduction due to duct 
diameter as per Clause 10.3.3.3 (5) of the code.
 
At the centroidal axis σbending = 0
	
Hence the shear capacity at centroidal axis is
	
	
	
At times, the maximum principle tensile stress may occur at a section away from centroid 
and not at centroid. For any other section other than centroidal axis the shear capacity shall 
be calculated using the expression which includes the term σbending. The web width and the 
corresponding area shall be substituted accordingly as applicable for that section.
Additional equation for checking shear in section having precast beam supporting the 
deck slab
The uncracked shear resistance VRdc of such type of construction has to be worked out by 
limiting the principal tensile stress to fctd. If the loads Vc1 acting on the precast beam alone 
produces the shear stress of τs, the additional shear force Vc2 which can generate a shear 
stress of τ1s,as the CG of the composite section. The principle tension under the combined 
shear and bending shall not exceed fctd. Hence the total shear capacity of section needs to 
be Vc1 + Vc2. Shear stress distribution will be as shown below.

4)	
The calculation of shear resistance as per above formulae for uncracked 
section is not required for cross sections between the support section and 
the section which contains the intersection point on the elastic centroidal axis 
and a line inclined from the inner edge of the support at an angle of 45º as 
shown below. However the reinforcement arrived at this section AA shall be 
continued in this region covering upto the end of the beam.
Fig. C10.4  Sections Requiring no Check for Shear Resistance
	
5)	
Members with loads applied on the upper surface (top) at a distance 
αv where αv is within 0.5d to 2d from the edge of support (or center of bearing 
when flexible bearings are used) the question arises, how much of this load 
will contribute towards shear, as part of the loads will be directly transmitted 
to the support by arch action without involving bending and shear actions and 
part of the load will be transmitted by truss action. Hence the code suggests 
reducing the contribution of this load towards truss shear by multiplying the 
shear due to this load by a factor αv/2d (i.e.β VED). When loads are placed at less 
than 0.5d, a distance of 0.5d shall be assumed. This reduction in shear force 
is applicable for checking the capacity of section without shear reinforcement 
as per Equation 10.1 provided longitudinal reinforcement is anchored at the 
support. This reduction factor shall not be used while checking with equation 
10.4. (While checking the uncracked section of prestressed concrete) For 
checking the adequacy of shear capacity of section as per Equation 10.5 this 
reduction factor shall not also be used and it shall be assumed that the entire 
load to be contributing towards the shear.
	
	
Designers can observe that the Clause 10.2.2.1 stipulates that no shear 
reinforcement is required to be designed for a section within ‘d’ from support 
except the reinforcement designed at ‘d’ to be continued upto support and 
also for the shear generated due to loads placed in the zone covered by 
θsup and θinf (i,e. between ‘d’ and ‘2.5d’ from support in case θinf is considered 
as 21.8º).

However if we consider the Clauses 10.3.2(5) and 10.3.3.3(7), the 
requirement is some what different. Hence there is a contradiction among 
these clauses. The contradiction is, any load placed between ‘0.5d’ and ‘2d’, 
the reduced shear force due to these loads have to be worked out for arriving 
at the shear at any section between the support and the concentrated load 
and cannot be ignored as stated in Clause 10.2.2.1. Secondly, when the 
load is placed at 0.5d and if the shear force is to be calculated at ‘d’ distance 
away from the support, the effect of the load located at ‘0.5d’ will not appear 
in the shear force calculation.
 
 
The first para of the Clause 10.2.2.1 is applicable only in case if there is 
no concentrated load occurring within a distance ‘d’ from support and the 
structure is subjected to uniformly distributed load. The second part of the 
clause covering the load placed between d and the distance corresponding 
to minimum strut angle 2.5 d shall not be operated. Instead Clause 10.3.2 (5) 
shall be followed.
	
	
Clause No.10.3.2 (5) is not suited for multiple concentrated loads or moving 
loads in case of bridges, indirect loads or subjected to uniformly distributed 
load. This clause is applicable only when the structure is subjected to single 
concentrated load. However if this clause is to the applied to the moving 
loads, then the following procedure shall be adopted:
	
a)	
Workout the support reaction and shear at various sections due to dead 
load.
	
b)	
It is assumed that there are three concentrated loads within a distance 
of 2d located at a distance of 0.5d, d and 1.5d. Any load occurring 
between the support and 0.5d the same may be considered to act at 
0.5d.
 
c) 
Place the first concentrated load W1 at 0.5d, W2 at d and W3 at 1.5d. 
The β1, β2 and β3 factor will be 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75.
	
d)	
The support shear reaction
	
	
Vsupport = VDL reaction + (reaction due to W1) + (reaction due to (reaction 
due to W2) + reaction due to loads beyond 2d.
	
e)	
Shear at section 0.5d (left of section load) VED = V  shear due to dead 
load + β1 (shear due to load W1) + β2 (shear due to load W2 + β3 (shear 
due to load W3). + shear due to loads beyond 2d.
	
f)	
The shear worked out in the above step (e) should satisfy 
Equation 10.1.
	
g)	
Calculate the support reaction, as shown in (d) without introducing 
β factor and the support shear shall satisfy Equation 10.5 for crushing 
of strut.
	
h)	
If there is a reduction in cross-section within 2d or outside 2d this 
section shall also be checked against Equation 10.1 and 10.5.

i)	
Repeat the calculation by moving and placing the load W1 and W2 at d 
and 1.5d and at 2d for checking the section d.
	
j)	
When the loads reach section 2d, and beyond 2d, the reduction 
factor need not to be applied and the shear shall be checked against 
Equation 10.1.
	
k)	
If the sections are able to satisfy Equation 10.1, then no shear 
reinforcement is required to be provided. The support and the reduced 
sections are also able to satisfy equation 10.5 for crushing of strut, it 
can be concluded that the sections need no revision and the section is 
deemed to be safe in shear without shear reinforcement. However, the 
beams are to be provided with minimum shear reinforcement and the 
same will be dispensed with, in slabs.
 
6) 
For design of longitudinal reinforcement in the region cracked in flexure the 
MEd line shall be shifted over a distance of ‘d’ in the unfavorable direction or 
the tensile reinforcement can be increased due to additional chord force as 
explained later.

Estimate the shear capacity of RCC slab in which no shear reinforcement is provided. The 
particulars of slab are as follows:
	
Thickness of slab 750 mm, cover 50 mm concrete grade M30.
	
Reinforcement 25 dia 125 mm.
 
Area of reinforcement = 39.27 cm2/m
 
Effective depth = 750 – 50 –

Effective width = 1000 mm
	
Asl = 39.27 cm2
	
	
	
ρl = 
 
 
 
k = 
 
Axial Load = 0  
∴   σcp = 0.0
	
VRdc = [0.12 x 1.53 (80 x .0057 x 30)0.33] x 1000 x 687.5 x 10–3
 
= 302 kN/m
	
VRdcmin = .031 x 1.533/2 x 301/2 x 1000 x 687.5 x 10–3 = 221.0kN/m
The slab can with stand a shear of 302 kN/m without providing any shear reinforcement.

(Codal Eq:10.13)
At any situation if the provided shear reinforcement 
 works out to be greater than 
 
it can be safely concluded the web has failed in shear and requires redesign.
It is necessary to restrict the shear resistance of concrete grades of higher than M60 to that 
of M60 grade for design purpose.
The adoption of higher grade of concrete with high permissible stress leads to slender web 
resulting in significant second of order out plane bending effect leading to failure at shear force 
less than the shear capacity calculated based on the formula given in the code applicable 
for crushing of concrete under axial compression. In order to avoid such failure the code has 
placed this restriction.
The reduction in the concrete strength due to cracking shall be calculated by using formula 
, for calculating the reduction factor. The strength in steel reinforcement shall 
be taken as 0.87 fy.
Evaluation of Inner Lever Arm
Regarding the use of lever arm 0.9 d, a word of caution is offered. The lever arm 0.9 d 
indicated in the code is only applicable for T-beams. In case of circular section it should be 
taken as 0.9de where de = r+2rs/π, where r = radius of circular section or rs = the radius of the 
longitudinal reinforcement distributed over the circle. For the following cases, the actual lever 
arm should be derived.
	
1)	
Beams having varying width
	
2)	
Prestressed beams
	
3)	
Section having axial forces.
 
4) 
Cross section having no compression flange (Support section of continuous 
beam) i.e. rectangular beams.
In these cases after completing the flexural analysis the internal lever arm shall be worked 
out and the same may be taken as Z for arriving at the shear reinforcement.
In order to prove how erroneous will be if one assumes 0.9d for rectangular beam having 
no flange an example is shown below. Rectangular beam, Concrete grade M45, Breadth 
= 500 mm, Depth = 1000 mm, Effective depth = 950 mm, Area of steel = 10965 mm2. The 
section is a balanced section.
From truss analysis depth of compression chord for yielding of steel = 
 = 471 mm 
Lever arm = 950 – 
 = 714.5  mm which is 0.75d.
Thus it can be seen that 0.9d always does not hold good. Hence the designer adopt the lever 
arm obtained in flexural analysis.

Additional tensile force
Cl. 10.3.3.3 (6)
Additional force in tension and compression chord due to shear VEd may be worked out as 
shown below:

Force in the strut = 
Horizontal component of this force = 
Similarly force in diagonal steel element = 
Horizontal component of this force = 
Unbalanced tensile force Ft = V (cot θ – cot α)
This force has been shown in Fig. C10.8. Distributing this force between tension and 
compression chords equally the additional force = 
. This tensile force 
shall be added to the tensile force generated due to flexure and the reinforcement to be 
provided accordingly. The total tensile force at a section 
 where MEd,max is 
the maximum moment along the girder.
The angle of compression strut shall be limited to minimum of 21.80 and maximum of 450. 
Similarly, the angle of shear stirrups shall be limited to minimum of 45º and maximum of 900. 
Alternatively, shift rule can be applied as per Clause 10.3.2 (6).
The spare capacity available in prestressing steel can be used to carry this additional tensile 
force arising out of shear. In case if the cable is draped the inclination has to be taken into 
account.
However, if it is decided to carry this additional longitudinal force both by un-tensioned steel 
and prestressing steel, the force shall be allocated in each of these reinforcement in the 
same ratio of their respective original forces arrived in the flexural analysis. This procedure 
will maintain the same lever arm arrived during the flexural analysis. However, additional 
longitudinal reinforcement can be provided to take care of this longitudinal force arising out 
of shear. As this reinforcement is located below the prestressing steel, the lever arm will 
be lowered. This increase in lever arm can be omitted in the analysis. Conservatively the 
prestressing steel only can be utilized for flexural and shear analysis.

Design Methodology of Arriving at the Shear Stirrups
In a design problem θ is to be assumed between 45º and 21.8º. The assumed strut angle will 
have to satisfy the shear capacity as per equation 10.8. i.e. the strut capacity should be equal 
to or more than the applied shear. If the concrete strut capacity is satisfied then, the assumed 
angle will be substituted in equation 10.7 and the stirrup requirement will be evaluated. If 
the assumption of maximum angle (θ = 45º) is not able to resist the applied shear, then the 
section needs to be revised. At lower θ value, the capacity of strut will be low and the stirrup 
requirement will also be low. For the higher side of θ, the strut capacity will be high and the 
shear stirrup requirement also will be high. For a given problem θ, the strut angle can be 
worked out as follows:
Take αcw = 1.concrete less than 60 MPa.
	
	
	
At θ = 45º Maximum permissible shear stress
 
 
 
= 
At θ = 21.8º Max. Permissible shear stress = 
Shear stress due to applied shear force
	
vEd = 
 should not be grater than 
Applied shear stress should be less than maximum allowable shear stress
	
	
	
vEd = 
	
	
	
Substituting Equation 6 in Equation – 4
	
	
	
vEd = 0.45 υ1 fck 0.5 sin2 θ = 0.225 fck υ1 sin 2θ
 
 
 
sin 2θ = 
If vEd = 0.225 υ1 fck. then θ = 45º
 
 
 
θ = 0.5 sin–1 
 = 0.5 sin–1 
θ is the angle of strut for the given problem. The design procedure can be presented in the 
form of a flowchart for carrying out the shear design which is given below.

Cl. 10.3.3.3(7) & (8)
When the loads are placed closer to the support, the part of the load will be carried to the 
support directly by the arch action and part by truss action, involving bending and shear. 
Closer the load to the support, greater is the portion of load which will be carried to the 
support directly. Hence a reduction factor is given in the Code to account for the reduction of 
this load for the direct transmission of shear while designing the shear reinforcement. In case 
of bridge superstructures, as the loads are moving loads, this provision may not be much 
useful. However this reduction is not applicable for verifying the concrete capacity as per 
Eq. 10.5. This clause is really applicable for single static load as explained before. While 
verifying the reinforcement requirement for resisting shear, only the shear reinforcement 
within central 0.75av shall be considered. This limitation is made because tests carried out 
indicated that the links adjacent to both load and support do not fully yield. The procedure 
of considering only the links between the load and the support works only for single loads. 
Where the structure is subjected to series of loads beyond ‘2d’ and contribute to the shear, 
then the shear design for these loads should be carried out as outlined in earlier clauses 
for loads beyond ‘2d’. The link requirement from both the analysis should be added and 
provided. Similarly shear should be added from both the systems for checking the crushing. 
As pointed out earlier this reduction factor is not applicable while checking the capacity of 
strut (concrete crushing). For av less ‘0.5d’, then av shall be taken as ‘0.5d’ as minimum.
Following procedure may be adopted for sections within ‘2d’:
	
a)	
Choose sections between ‘0.5d’ and ‘2d’ starting from 0.5d, ‘d’ and ‘1.5d’.
	
b)	
For explanation purpose it is assumed that there are three concentrated 
loads viz w1, w2 and w3 occurring between ‘0.5d’ and ‘2d’, at distances of 
av1, av2 and av3 at ‘0.5d’, ‘d’ and ‘1.7d’, respectively from the support. 
Reduction factors to be used for these loads are β1 = (0.5d/2d = 0.25); 
β2 (d/2d = 0.5) and β3 = (1.7d/2d = 0.85), respectively. The reduction factor 
is not applicable if loads are not acting from upper side of member, like 
suspended loads. The term “load acting from upper side” the intended load 
is one causing an additive support shear. A relieving load shall be considered 
as a suspended load.
	
c)	
Place w1 at av1 and arrive at the shear at support and the reinforcement 
between support and av1 using Eq. 10.17. This reinforcement is to be 
provided within a distance of 0.75 av1 between the load and the support. 
For convenience if the reinforcement is divided by 0.75, then the total 
reinforcement in the zone av1 can be obtained.
	
d)	
Reduction factor shall be used to reduce the shear reinforcement. Let this be 
Asw1.
	
e)	
Next place w2 at av2. Repeat steps c and d and arrive at the reinforcement to 
be provided within a distance of av2. Let this be Asw2.
	
f)	
Similarly keep load w3 at av3 and repeat the calculation. Reinforcement to be 
provided within a distance av3 can be worked out. Let it be Asw3. Effects for 
each of the loads are to be evaluated separately.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:105-2015
74
	
g)	
Consider loads beyond ‘2d’ and arrive at the reinforcement using support 
shear to be provided in zone av1 assuming in equation 10.7. No reduction 
factors are to be used to arrive at the shear reinforcement due to these 
loads. Let this reinforcement be Asw4.
	
	
	
	
	
The dead load shear reinforcement can be added to these live load shears.
	
	
	
	
h)	
Add the shear reinforcements arrived in steps d, e, f and g as shown below. 
Arrive at the reinforcement to be provided in zone av1. In zone av1, the 
reinforcement will be
	
	
	
	
i)	
Repeat the above calculations for other sections between ‘0.5d’ and ‘2d’by 
placing the leading concentrated load at the chosen section viz‘d’, ‘1.5d’ 
and ‘2d’ (for reinforcements between ‘0.5d’ and ‘2d’) and arrive at the 
reinforcement. If ‘2d’ distance is not significant, reinforcement provided 
from the support within‘0.5d’ can be continued upto ‘2d’ to make it simple. 
When the process is repeated for section ‘d’ and reinforcement arrived, the 
reinforcement arrived from support to ‘0.5d’ would be governed by earlier 
calculation as the shear at section would be severe by earlier placement of 
load. By placing the load at d the analysis would cover the region of between 
0.5d and d. Further analysis can cover sections between d and 1.5d and 
1.5d to 2d left.
	
j)	
The shear force also shall be arrived at all these sections without using 
reduction factor and the capacity of concrete shall be checked against 
Eq. 10.5 of the code.
	
	
However, the problem will arise as this shear has to be combined with the 
shear due to loads placed beyond 2d. For checking the crushing of strut due 
to loads between support and 2d and beyond 2d the following procedure 
may be adopted.
	
1)	
Estimate the shear force VED1 due to loads placed within 2d without 
applying the reduction factor β and the shear stress 
.
	
2)	
Estimate the shear force VED2 due to loads placed beyond 2d and the 
shear stress 
.
	
3)	
Estimate the shear force VEDL due to dead load = 
.
	
4)	
Add the shear stress arrived in step 1, 2 and 3.
 
 
Combined shear stress = 
 which should be less than 
0.5v fcd.

In case if one wants to simplify the calculation for checking the crushing of 
concrete calculate the total shear force and calculate the allowable shear 
force by adopting 0.5 bwz v fcd by substituting the d, by z in Eq. 10.5 and 
compare. This will simplify the elaborate calculation. It shall be kept in mind 
that for loads beyond 2d, the angle θ has been assumed as 45º. Under this 
condition only both struts effects can be superposed. Hence while arriving 
at shear reinforcement for loads beyond 2d in using equation 10.7, θ to be 
taken as 45º.
	
k)	
For sections beyond ‘2d’, Eq. 10.7 and 10.8 of the Code, shall be used and 
the sections shall be designed.
	
l)	
If there is a reduction in cross section anywhere within the structure, the 
reduced section shall also be checked.
The method of transmission load is explained in the following diagram.

the shear stress works out to 4.03 N/mm2 > 2.8925 N/m2 but less than 4.19 N/mm2

In case of section not cracked but shear capacity is less than the applied shear adequate 
shear reinforcement needs to be provided which is to be based on Eq. 10.8.
If the section is cracked also shear reinforcement needs to be provided as the capacity 
of section to resist the shear without shear reinforcement will be virtually negligible due to 
absence of any appreciable amount of tensile reinforcement.
To calculate the shear reinforcement the most important parameter required is lever arm Z 
which is obtained from bending analysis.

In case of pre-cast segmental construction where there is no bonded prestressing cable in 
the tension chord, the joints will open up after the decompression moment is reached at that 
section. The depth of opening will depend upon the depth of flexural compression block. The 
prestressing force should be assumed constant after the joint opening.

Interface Shear

follows:

If the force in the flange is Ff and force in the web in Fw, the proportionate shear carried 
by flange is 
 with respect to total shear. The corresponding shear stress 
= XVEd/Z bi. If Fw = 0 then X = 1. As generally the force contribution by the web is small, it can

interface shear is the net shear at the section multiplied by ratio of longitudinal flexural force 
above construction joint to the total compressive or tensile longitudinal flexural force.
The lever arm used to compute the sectional resistance may be used to simplify the 
computation or it can be based on actual stress block for the particular loading case.
The first term of the equation 10.21 represents the frictional force across the inter face under 
the action of normal compressive force which is generally zero except in case of vertically 
prestressed sections and the second term corresponds to the mechanical resistance of 
reinforcement crossing the interface . The shear reinforcement provided in the section and 
continued across the interface having the adequate anchorage shall be considered for 
working out the reinforcement ratio ρ. In case if the additional reinforcement is required over

required to be provided across the horizontal interface shear will be 0.15 percent of interface 
area.

Reference shall be made to Fig. 10.9 of the code. The longitudinal in plane force generated 
in the flange induces shear stress between at the flange and web junction which can be

ΔX is the length under consideration and ΔFd unbalanced in-plane shear force in the flange 
at the interface section.
The maximum value of ΔX shall be assumed as the half the distance between the zero bending 
moment point and maximum bending moment section. When the structure is subjected to 
concentrated loads, the length shall not exceed the distance between concentrated loads. 
Alternatively, shear stress can be calculated using the formula from the previous section 
replacing bi by hf. The shear will be carried by web and also by flanges on either side of web. 
As we are interested in the shear transmitted by flange alone the following formula can be 
used for calculating the shear stress:

hf is the thickness of deck slab. In case if the deck slab is subjected to transverse bending as 
it happens in case of beam bridge and box girder bridge then the deck slab thickness shall 
be reduced by the depth of concrete in bending zone compression. Though the effects are 
occurring in two mutually perpendicular planes, in order to make the analysis simpler, the 
above simplification has been suggested.
The maximum compressive stress in the strut shall be checked in order to avoid the crushing

Design for Punching Shear:
Cl.10.4
8.4.1	
General
Cl.10.4
When a slab is subjected to localized concentrated force which acts over a small area the 
punching shear failure can occur. Common examples are, wheel load acting on deck slab, 
pile caps over piles open foundations supporting pier and well cap supporting the pier. 
Punching shear is resisted by the shear resistance of concrete through the depth of element 
over a perimeter. The section covers action of concentrated force over a small area on two 
dimensioned elements.
8.4.2	
Loaded Area and Basic Control Perimeter
Cl. 10.4.2
	
1)	
Punching shear stress should be evaluated at following perimeters:
	
a)	
At the face of the loaded area
	
b)	
At basic control perimeter
	
c)	
At any other perimeter
	
2)	
The basic control perimeter U1 to be chosen at a distance of ‘2d’ form the 
face of the loaded area provided that the applied concentrated load is not 
opposed by any other upward pressure offering relief within this distance ‘d’ 
is the average of effective depth in both the direction i.e.
	
	
	
	
3)	
When the loaded area is situated near an edge or on the edge or at a Corner, 
the control perimeter shall be calculated based on the Fig 10.11 of the 
Code.
	
4)	
The control perimeter should be chosen at a distance less than ‘2d’ when the 
concentrated force on the loaded area is opposed by high pressure from soil 
(such as foundation) or by the effects of a load or reaction within distance of 
‘2d’. The Code suggests that the relief offered by the opposing force should 
be minimized.
8.4.2.1	
Punching shear design rules
Cl. 10.4.2.1
Punching shear stress is to be calculated at two locations as stated above
	
a)	
At the face of the loaded area
	
b)	
Along the control perimeter
The reason for calculating at the face of the load area is to ensure that concrete strut does 
not get crushed. If the section is unable to salsify the shear capacity then one or more of the 
following actions are to be taken
	
i)	
Increase the depth of slab
	
ii)	
Increase the perimeter of the loaded area
	
iii)	
Increase the grade of concrete

The reason for checking at the control perimeter is to check whether the section can carry the 
load without of punching shear reinforcement.
8.4.3	
Checking of Punching Shear Stress at the Control Perimeter
Cl. 10.4.3.1
	
1)	
General
	
	
The punching shear stress generated on any control perimeter can be 
calculated using the following expression
	
	
vEd = 
	
	
VEd =  Applied shear force
	
	
ui = Control Perimeter
	
	
d = depth of element
 
 
β = Factor for Accounting Bending Moment
 
 
β = 1 for axial load with no bending moment
 
 
β = 1 + k 
 for axial load and bending moment
	
	
MEd is the ultimate moment and VEd is the ultimate shear force on the 
perimeter.
	
	
W1 is the property which corresponds to a distribution of shear as shown in 
Fig 10.12 of code and is a function of basic control perimeter u1 and axis 
about which the moment acts. Theoretically, If the control perimeter changes 
or the axis about which the moment is acting changes, then the value of W1 
will have to be derived for the respective perimeter and direction. However, 
except for the foundation slabs, the value for W1 and u1, derived for the basic 
control perimeter can be used for any other perimeter. For foundation slabs, 
W1 and u1 shall be derived for each respective perimeters.
	
	
W1 is defended as W1 = 
	
	
dl is the length increment of the perimeter
	
	
“e” is the distance of dl from the axis about which the moment MEd acts. k is 
the constant depending the value of C1 and C2. C1 is the dimension of the 
cross section perpendicular to the axis of bending and C2 is the dimension 
parallel to the axis of bending.
 
 
β is a factor to take care of additional shear generated by moment. The 
magnitude of the additional shear force is dependent on the moment 
transferred and the distance of the perimeter from the loaded area and the 
shape of the loaded area. The enhancement of shear due to moment around 
the perimeter can be expressed as:
	
	
 
 
∆V is the additional shear due to moment distributed around the perimeter 
u1.

It is to be kept in mind that MEd is the unbalanced moment applied on 
column.

W1 can be calculated as follows.

If the eccentricity perpendicular to slab edge is towards exterior then 
the expression for β Eq. 10.25 of the Code is valid. However the value 
of W1 has to be worked out using the eccentricity emeasured from the 
centroid of the control perimeter.
	
5)	
For rectangular corner column, (Fig. 10.11 of the Code) when there is no 
eccentricity
	
	
	
	
	
For rectangular corner column, where the eccentricity is toward of the 
interior of the slab, it is assumed that the punching shear stress is uniformly 
distributed along the reduced control perimeter (Fig. 10.13 (b) of code).

In the above case if the eccentricity is towards exterior, then the expression 
for β Eq. 10.25 of the Code is valid
	
	
However the value of W1 will have to be worked out. The eccentricity should 
be measured from the centroid of the control perimeter.
8.4.4	
Punching Shear Resistance of Slabs without Reinforcement
Cl. 10.4.4
Slabs without punching shear reinforcement, have to resist the punching shear stress purely 
by the tensile strength of concrete which is given by the following expression (Eq. 10.33 of 
the Code)
	
	
	
 
 
 
νRdc is in MPa., fck is in MPa.
	
	
	
ρly, ρlz relate to the bonded tension steel in y and z directions. Taking a slab width of ‘3d’ 
beyond the column face on each side the mean value of ρly and ρlz shall be calculated.
	
	
	
σcy and σcz are the axial concrete stress taking compression as positive.
	
	
	
NEdy, NEdy are the longitudinal forces. The force may be either due to prestressing or axial 
force.
Acy, Acz are the corresponding cross sectional areas of concrete resisting the axial forces.
8.4.5	
Punching Shear for Foundation Slab and Pile Caps:
Cl. 10.4.5
The punching resistance of column bases for open foundations and pile caps shall be verified 
at control perimeters within 2d from the periphery of columns.
This is because the angle of punching cone will be steeper due to the favorable reaction from 
the soil. Checking the punching shear for open foundation with the basic control perimeter, 
ignoring the favorable reaction from the soil will lead to conservative assumption. When the 
foundation is subjected vertical loads only, the net shear force causing punching is calculated 
by subtracting the net relief offered by soil.
	
	
	
VEdred.= VEd – ∆VEd.
VEd is the applied shear force



======================================================================
PAGE 103 of 233

Δ VEd is the net upward force within the control perimeter considered i.e. upward pressure 
from soil which shall be reduced by self-weight of the foundation.
The allowable shear stress in concrete vRdc without any punching shear reinforcement
	
	
	
 
ρ1 and vmin are as defined before.
	
a is the distance from the periphery of column to the control perimeter 
considered.
	
The shear stress at the control perimeter
	
	
	
	
For eccentric loading or subjected to moment
	
	
	
Where k is defined in Eq. 10.25 or 10.30 of the Code as appropriate and W is similar to for 
the chosen control perimeter u.
For checking of punching shear in pile caps without shear reinforcement, no specific guidance 
is provided in the Code and the general rule as specified can be applied only in case edges 
of the pile cap are located further than ‘2d’ from the face of pier, which is a rare situation in 
practice. In most of the situations, the pile edges are closer to the piers than ‘2d’. In such 
cases, part of the load will be transmitted directly into the support by way of strutting action. 
In such cases, it is suggested that punching be checked at a perimeter touching the pier/pile 
face (distance less than ‘2d’) after allowing for enhancement in shear resistance.
8.4.6	
Design of Section for Punching Shear
Cl. 10.4.6
 
1) 
As it is difficult to provide punching shear reinforcement it is better to avoid 
this reinforcement. Hence the capacity of the slab in punching shear should 
be greater than the applied shear. This can be achieved by ensuring.
	
	
	
vEd ≤ vRdc
 
 
Shear stress connected with punching shear is defined as below:
	
	
vEd:	Punching shear stress along the control perimeter.
	
	
vRdc:	Shear resistance of slab against punching without punching shear 
reinforcement.
	
	
vRdmax : maximum punching shear resistance of slab.

For edge column

For corner column

d = depth of slab
	
	
C1 and C2 are dimensions of the loaded area as shown in Fig. 10.12 and 
Fig. 10.13 of the Code.
 
 
β is the correction factor for application of moment.
 
 
β = 1 for purely axial load case without bending moment. For column with 
bending moment the value is to be calculated as given earlier.
	
	
Punching shear stress should be less than the allowable shear stress 
vRd,max.
 
 
The allowable shear stress = vRdmax = 0.5 vfcd.
	
	
	
	
	
It should be ensured that vEd is always less than vRdmax.
	
	
This provision makes sure that the concrete strut does not crush in 
punching.

Torsion
Cl. 10.5
8.5.1	
General
Cl. 10.5.1
When a concrete element is subjected to Torsion the longitudinal fibers are free to undergo 
deformation. Torsion can be of classified into Equilibrium Torsion and Compatibility Torsion. 
Equilibrium Torsion is that torsional resistance which is required to keep the structure in 
equilibrium and is essential for the basic stability of the element or structure. A few examples 
are canopy cantilevering off an edge beam, Beams/Box girders curved in plan. Element 
subjected to Equilibrium Torsion has to be designed for full torsional resistance in the ultimate 
limit state.
Compatibility torsion arises out of compatibility of displacement/ rotations to be maintained in 
the connected elements. Generally it occurs in monolithic construction. Compatibility torsion 
can be released without causing collapse. It is not necessary to consider this torsion at 
ultimate limit state. At serviceability limit state cracks may occur in the absence of sufficient

reinforcement. The cracked torsional stiffness of elements subjected to torsion is only about 
25% of the uncracked value. Low torsional stiffness significantly reduces torque resisting 
ability of the beams. Hence if the torsional rigidity is ignored in the analysis it would not 
make much difference. To limit the crack width under limit state of serviceability, check as 
per clause 12.3.5 of the Code shall be carried out and suitable reinforcement as per clause 
16.5.3 shall be provided.
When the longitudinal fibers are restrained against deformation by an external element 
warping torsion arises.
The torsional resistance of a closed section may be calculated on the basis of a thin walled 
closed section. The equilibrium is satisfied by closed shear flow. Solid sections can be 
modeled by equivalent thin walled sections.
In case of complex shapes such as T section, the section shall be divided into series of 
subsections. The acting torsional moments on subsections can be distributed in proportion 
to the uncracked torsional stiffness. Each of the subsections can be modeled as thin walled 
section and the torsional resistance can be computed.
When hollow sections are modeled as thin walled section, the thickness of section shall be 
taken as A/u which will neither be less than twice the axis distance of longitudinal bars from 
the outer surface nor greater than the actual thickness. For conversion of solid section to 
equivalent hollow section Fig. C10. 27 shall be referred to.
In the analysis the torsional stiffness may be based on uncracked sectional stiffness for 
equilibrium torsion and 25% of the uncracked sectional stiffness for compatibility torsion to 
allow for torsional cracking.

of st.
The transverse reinforcement required shall be arrived based on Clause 10.3.3.2 when vertical 
strips are provided. It shall be kept in mind that each wall has to be designed separately. The 
concrete capacity shall also be checked using the following equation.
	
	
	
	
TEd and VNS Design Torsion and Shear forces
	
VRdmax (c) is the maximum concrete capacity of member in shear as given in 
equation 10.8.
	
TRdmax (c) = 2 v.αcw.fcd.Ak.tefi.sinθ.cosθ.
	
TRdmax is the torsional capacity of concrete
	
v is the strength reduction factor αcw is the coefficient. Both the factors are as 
defined in earlier sections.
 
“θ” shall be taken the same value as assumed in shear design.
	
An additional longitudinal steel also needs to be provided for resisting torsion. The 
reinforcement can be calculated using the expression.
	
	
	
	
uk is the perimeter of area Ak.
	
Asl is the area of Longitudinal reinforcement
	
fyd is the yield strength of longitudinal reinforcement
	
TEd = Torsion applied on the section
 
θ = is the angle of compression strut
The longitudinal reinforcement generally has to be distributed uniformly along each wall. 
However in case of small sections the reinforcement can be concentrated at corners. 
Designers can calculate the requirement of this longitudinal reinforcement in a wall and the 
above equation can be modified as follows.
	
	
	
Where Asl is the area of longitudinal reinforcement requirement in a wall with the spacing s of 
the reinforcement.
The above reinforcement shall be in addition to flexural and shear reinforcement in tensile 
zones. In the case of compression zone this longitudinal reinforcement can be reduced in 
proportion to the compressive force available in the compression zone. The compression 
zone shall be taken as twice the cover to the torsional links.

In case of precast segmental construction where there is no continuity of longitudinal 
reinforcement and tension due torsion and bending exceeds the compression due to 
prestress and bending, additional tendons to counter the tension need to be provided. The 
additional tendons shall be distributed around the precompressed tensile zone inside the 
closed stirrups. At least one tendon shall be placed at each corner.
Warping Torsion
For closed thin walled sections and solid sections warping torsion may be ignored since 
warping torsion is not necessary for equilibrium. Hence in these sections the torsion is 
equated to St. Venant torsion or circularity torsion. For open sections having very slender 
cross section, the warping torsional effects can be evaluated using the reference “Roarks 
Formula for stresses and strain” by W.C Young.

The torsion will be shared in proportion to their torsional stiffness.
	
Design of Reinforcements for Torsion:
Deck slab torsion should be combined with Deck slab design.
Effective thickness of the members can be found as follows.
For top flange
	
	
	
But this thickness should not be taken less than 2 twice the distance of longitudinal bar from 
the surface [effective cover].
Taking cover as 40mm and dia for longitudinal and transverse bars of 10 mm,
Effective cover 40 + 10 + 5 = 55 m. Twice the 110 mm.
As 110 > 76.9 mm consider 110 mm.
Ak = (400 – 110) (250 – 110) = 40600 mm2

CHAPTER 9
SECTION 11 : ULTIMATE LIMIT STATE OF INDUCED DEFORMATION
9.1 
General
Cl. 11.1
	
(1)	
This Section deals with structural members and structures whose load 
deformation behaviour and ultimate capacity is significantly affected by second 
order effects. Second order effects are additional action effects caused by the 
interaction of axial forces and deformations under load (Refer Fig. C11.1). 
First order deformations induce internal forces which in turns lead to further 
deformations. Sometimes these effects are also called P-∆ effects as they 
are the products of axial forces and deformations of the elements or system. 
Normally second order effects are calculated by second order analysis.
Fig. C11.1  Interaction Chart showing Second Order Effect[1]
	
	
Design with second order analysis is not commonly warranted. The Code 
provides guidelines to consider these effects in design, either by empirical 
approach or by accurate analysis. This shall be decided by the designer. 
Generally complexities are involved in this analysis. Significant aspects of 
second order analysis are:
	
a)	
The principle of superposition is not valid in second order analysis and 
all actions must be applied to the structure or element together with all 
respective loads and combination factors.
 
b) 
The flexural rigidity (EI) of the reinforced concrete structure is not 
constant. EI reduces with increasing moment due to cracking.
	
	
The code provides relaxation in cases where second order effects are 
less than 10 percent of the first order effects. In such cases, second 
order analysis can be done away with or by following the alternative

methods and provisions as in sub Clauses (4) & (5) and Clause 11.2.1 
(in case of isolated members of uniform cross section).
 
(2) 
Classical buckling, defined as sudden failure due to instability of perfectly 
axially loaded members without horizontal load does not usually occur in 
practical reinforced/prestressed concrete members. However, long slender 
members after a particular load exhibit large and dis-proportionate increase of 
deformations due to combined effects of geometric non-linearity (P-∆ effect), 
non-linear structural response due to material non-linearity, progressive 
cracking and local plasticity. This reduces the ultimate load carrying capacity 
as compared to the short members of identical cross-section and steel 
ratio.
	
	
Therefore, long members have lower capacity as compared to that of short 
members of identical sectional details.
	
	
Second order effects are more pronounced in slender compressive elements. 
The well-known elastic buckling theory by Euler determines the extent of 
slenderness and quantum of second order effects. The elastic buckling itself 
has little relevance in the design, however the same gives good indication 
about the susceptibility to second order effects and can be used as a 
parameter in determining second order effects from the results of first order 
analysis as explained in Section 11.3.2.
	
	
Majority of commercially available structural soft ware have the capability to 
carry out second order analysis. In the second order analysis in addition to 
the invalidity of the principle of superposition, the flexural rigidity of reinforced 
concrete structures EI is not constant. As the moment increases for the same 
load, EI reduces due to cracking of concrete and inherent non-linearity in 
the concrete stress-strain response also increases. Thus it involves both 
geometrical and material non-linearity for RC elements and has to be taken 
in to account while choosing the method for 2nd order analysis.
	
	
The slender piers of the bridges are commonly affected by 2nd order analysis 
while the provisions related to same are also applicable to other slender 
members with significant axial loads like pylons and decks of cable supported 
bridges.
 
(3) 
Where second order effects are significant, these must be taken in to 
account in the analysis by linear elastic method in conjunction with further 
magnification of moments and reduced stiffness properties, accounting for 
cracking and creep.
	
	
However, for the analysis at the ultimate limit states, section properties used 
shall be similar to that at serviceability limit states as per the Clauses 7.2 
and 7.3 of the Code.
 
(4) 
This clause clearly defines conditions under which the second order effects 
are to be considered. The clause requires that the structural behaviour to 



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:SP:105-2015
111
be considered in all directions in which significant second order effects can 
occur and bi-axial bending to be taken into account when necessary. Quite 
often the deformations in orthogonal directions need to be considered in 
bridge design though some times, one direction moment is negligible.
	
	
The distinction between long and short columns is made on the basis of 10% 
difference criteria as given in the Clause (5) below.
	
(5)	
This clause permits second order effects to be ignored if the same are less 
than 10 percent of the corresponding first order effects. When column is 
within range of short column parameters the effects are deemed to be within 
10%. For all other cases the effects will need to be analysed to determine 
their magnitude.
 
(6) 
For the analysis, if the column length is modified to effective length as per the 
criteria for stiffness at column ends, column is also deemed as short column. 
Second order effects can be ignored in this case. Specific second order 
analysis is not necessary as well. The Clause 11.2.1 provides a simplified 
criterion for isolated members with uniform cross sections based on limiting 
slenderness for the same.
	
(7)	
Second order effects apply to both ‘isolated’ members as well as ‘group of 
components’, which can sway involving several members. Piers with variable 
cross-section and piers located in river and creeks where substructure is 
supported by pile foundations with free length due to the scouring action will 
be an example of the latter. Normally, the pier/piers is/are connected to piles 
by a rigid pile cap. In some cases pier/piers are having variable sections. 
This clause emphasizes that the idealisation of the composite structure shall 
consist of varying sections for pier, pile cap and piles with appropriate un-
supported lengths below pile cap, as the secondary effects may be quite 
significant in such structures. Where the piles are embedded fully in to soil, 
the clause permits the independent slenderness analysis for the ‘isolated’ 
pier.
9.2 
Simplified Slenderness Criteria
Cl. 11.2
9.2.1	
Slenderness Criteria for Isolated Members (Columns) of Uniform Cross-Section

Cl. 11.2.1
While determining the second order effects by simplified methods instead of non-linear 
second order analysis, the effective length concept can be used to determine slenderness. 
On determination of slenderness, the requirement of second order analysis itself may be 
deduced. According to Clause 11.2.1 (1), the slenderness ratio is defined as λ = le/i where ‘le’ 
is effective length and ‘i’ is the radius of gyration of the uncracked concrete section.
The Clause 11.2.1 (2) provides simplified criteria when second order analysis is not required 
by limitation of slenderness value λ as follows:



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:105-2015
112
	
	
	
n = NED/(Ac fcd) is the relative normal force. As the axial force ‘n’ becomes greater, the section 
becomes more susceptible to development of second order effects and consequently limiting 
slenderness value becomes lower. Higher limiting slenderness can be achieved where:
 
● 
there is low creep (because the stiffness of the concrete part of the member 
in compression is then higher)
 
● 
there is a high percentage of reinforcement (because total member stiffness 
is then less affected by the cracking of the concrete)
 
● 
The location of the peak first order effect is not the same as the location of 
peak second order moment. These effects are accounted for by the terms A, 
B and C respectively where:
 
 
 
A = 1/(1 + 0.2φef )	
ϕef is effective creep ratio
	
	
	
	
	
MoEqp = First order B.M. in quasi-permanent load combination in S.L.S.
	
	
MoEd = First order B.M. in design load combination in U.L.S.
Value of ϕef is not explicitly defined in the Code. Simplified value of ‘A’0.7, which corresponds 
to ϕef = 2.0 would be typical of concrete loaded at relatively young age with a loading being 
entirely quasi permanent. Using the default value of A = 0.7 is reasonably conservative as the 
same in any case is not sensitive to realistic variation of ϕef.
 
 
 
B = 
Where ω = As fyd/(Ac fcd) is the mechanical reinforcement ratio. If the same is not known, 
‘B’ is recommended as 1.1 for first iteration, that is equivalent to ω = 0.1. This value would 
usually be achieved in a slender column; however this is generous in comparison to minimum 
reinforcement Clause 16.2.2. As such refining the design with actual value is imperative.
 
 
 
C = 1.7-rm
Where rm = M01/M02; moment ratio. M01,M02 are the first order end moments at two ends of 
member as calculated from the analysis of structure, where |M02| ≥ |M01|. If the end moments 
M01 & M02; give tension on the same side, rm should be taken as positive (i.e. C ≤ 1.7), 
otherwise negative (i.e. C > 1.7).
If ‘rm’ is not known, C may be taken as 0.7 which corresponds to uniform moment throughout 
the member. C also should be taken as 0.7 where there is transverse loading, where first 
order moments are predominantly due to imperfections and where the members are not 
braced. As such refining the design with actual value is imperative.
Before carrying out the nonlinear analysis as per Clause 11.3 and simplified method as per 
Clause 11.3.2, it is usual to check whether such effects can be ignored by achieving λ below 
the limiting value as λlim.

The Clause 11.2.1 (3) permits the independent verification in each direction for slenderness 
criteria. On the basis of limiting λ value, further exploration of requirement of second 
order effects can be decided. Depending upon the value of λ for each of the directions the 
slenderness effects can be neglected respectively i.e. if within individual values of λlim.
For bending in two orthogonal directions, the use of simplified interaction diagram may be 
adopted as shown below:

* Positional restraints are given for directions at right angles to the member
Parameters for calculating effective lengths for isolated members are available in this 
clause. Multiplication factors for calculating effective lengths are given on the basis of end 
conditions in Table 11.1 of the Code which has been reproduced here above for the purpose 
of illustration.
For the cases from (2) to (6) assumption is that the restraint at one or both ends are infinitely 
stiff for determining rotational stiffness. It is difficult to achieve this boundary condition in 
reality. As such the effective lengths for the rigid restraints will always be somewhat greater.
Mathematical approach for determination of the rotational flexibility by equations 11.2 and 
11.3 are available in Clause 11.2.2 (1) of the Code, which are reproduced here below:
For compression members in regular frames, the effective length le is determined in the 
following way:
	
Braced Members:
	
	
	
	
Unbraced members:
	
	
	
where,
	
k1 and k2 are the relative flexibilities of rotational restraints at ends 1 and 2 
respectively.
	
k = 
	
θ/M = is the rotation of restraining members at a joint for unit bending moment M
 
EI = is the bending stiffness of compression member
	
Io = is the clear height of compression member between end restraints.

For the unbraced members with rotational restraint at both ends, the second equation above 
can be used. For the theoretical case of a member with ends built in rigidly for positional 
restraint without rotational restraint i.e.(k1 = k2 = 0), the effective length l0 = l.
Effective length is determined in relation of flexural stiffness of compression member with 
that of rigidity of restraint. This means using un-cracked stiffness value of the member will 
not be on conservative side for reducing the buckling length to suggested value for which 
the restraint should be relatively stiffer. It is relevant to note here that this is in line with the 
definition of radius of gyration, ‘i’, given in the Clause 11.2.1 (1) based on the un-cracked 
section. Further the note 1 under the Clause 11.2.1 (1) implies that for determination of 
the stiffness of restraint like pier base cracked properties of the compression member or 
pier should be considered as it affects overall stiffness of restraint to a considerable extent. 
Alternatively the section shall be ensured to be un-cracked in ULS.
The 2nd note recommends that minimum value of the ‘k’ as 0.1, as the condition of fully 
restrained joint is hypothetical. In case of integral bridges where deck is connected to piers 
rigidly, the end stiffnesses to be used for piers can be determined by applying a corresponding 
deflection to pier to match the relevant mode of buckling and finding out moment and rotation 
at the connection of deck and piers in a plane frame model. Alternatively the effective lengths 
can be directly deduced by elastic buckling method provided under Clause 11.2.2 (2).

Non-Linear Analysis of Structure and Elements
Cl. 11.3
9.3.1	
General
Cl. 11.3.1
	
1)	
In principle on the basis of the Clause 11.1 (1), RCC sections with axial loads 
need to cater for material as well as geometric non-linearity. This clause 
recommends non-linear analysis considering different types of loadings 
such as permanent and quasi-permanent loads leading to creep effects and 
short term loads such as live load. Use of generalized analysis methods is 
allowed.
	
	
The Fig. C11.2 illustrate the effects of non-linearity of a cantilever pier. When 
there is an axial load P, there is displacement resulting in a moment deflection 
curve, from which the curvature can be arrived at. In a cantilever pier, the 
maximum moment occurs at the base of the pier varying along its height 
from which an approximate relationship can be deduced. So the deflection 
∆ = kL2/2 where k is the curvature at the bottom of the pier. Therefore the 
total moment including second order moment = M0 + P∆ where M0 is the first 
order moment including moment from imperfections. When this is plotted as 
shown in Fig. C11.3 on pier moment deflection curve, the same can be used 
for ascertaining compatibility and equilibrium.

2)	
For the isolated members, the Code recognises the method based on nominal 
curvature which is explained in detail in the Clause 11.3.2. However, the 
elastic theory based analysis i.e. nominal stiffness method which has been 
elaborated in other international standards such as EN-1992 is done away 
within this Code. Generally, isolated member may be defined as a “member 
within nodes of the frame or pier with bearings at one end and without any 
bracings till its base and alike”.
	
3)	
Though the Clauses (1) and (2) account for structural behaviour in general, 
these do not provide guidance regarding the material properties to be used 
at different stages. As per this clause, stress strain curves for concrete 
and steel given in Annexure-A2.7 and Section 6 (Figs. 6.2 and 6.4) 
respectively for concrete and steel are to be used as long as creep effect is 
considered in overall analysis. The resistance of local sections are governed 
by design values of the material strengths. Design values of the ultimate 
loads are obtained directly from the analysis. In equation Eq. A2-26 and in 
the calculation of k-value, fcm is then substituted by the design compressive 
strength fcd and Ecm is substituted by:
	
	
	
, where  γcE is taken as 1.2

As per the clause, the realistic stiffness has to be accounted for in analysis 
which warrants elaborate verification format. This clause simplifies the 
requirement by providing alternative that as long as material properties given 
in Annexure-A 2.7 are used in the analysis for equilibrium and compatibility, 
no further local checks are required. The Code provides this alternative as 
the same is on conservative side. This is conservative because of uniformly 
reduced stiffness is implicit in the method leading to higher P-∆ effects and 
also method neglects the effect of tension stiffening.
	
4)	
If design properties use dare from concrete stress-strain relationships given 
in 6.4.2.5.4(iii) and creep is accounted for by multiplying all strain values in 
the above concrete stress-strain diagram by a factor (1 + Øef), where Øef is 
the effective creep ratio, then further checks of local sections may not be 
required, as strength and stability are verified directly by the analysis. However, 
additional attention is called for in cases where imposed displacements may 
make the overall stiffer system to attract more reaction components at the 
design section despite the reduction in P-∆ effects.
9.3.2	
Method Based on Nominal Curvature
Cl. 11.3.2
9.3.2.1	
General
Cl. 11.3.2.1
In this method an estimate of the maximum possible curvature is used to calculate the 
second-order moment. The clause specifies the limitation that the method is applicable for 
isolated members of the bridge with constant normal force and the defined effective lengths 
of the members that will depend upon the boundary conditions. The first-order moment, 
including that from initial imperfections, is added to the moment from the additional maximum 
deflection according to the expression in 11.3.2.2 (1) for design moment value.
9.3.2.2	
Design Bending Moments
Cl. 11.3.2.2
The Design moment MEd = M0Ed + M2
where,
	
M0Ed is the first-order moment, including the effect of imperfections
	
M2 is the second-order moment with actual boundary condition duly accounting for 
effective length, especially for indeterminate structures.
The Note (2) of this clause gives method to evaluate equivalent 1st order end moment M0e for 
differing end moments. M0e for differing end moments can be
	
	
	
M0e = 0.6 M02 + 0.4 M01 ≥ 0.4 M02 		
where		
|M02| ≥ |M01|
Sign convention is important here for the moments. If the moments are giving tensions on the 
same side they have to be given the same sign, otherwise opposite signs shall be assigned. 
It is to be noted, however that this note does not apply to bridge piers having bearings on top 
of the piers as the system is not braced system.

118
The nominal second-order moment is given under the note (3) of the clause which is as 
follows:
	
	
	
M2 = NEde2
M2 is determined by calculating e2 from the estimated curvature at failure, 1/r, according 
to the formula, e2 = (1/r)l2
0/c. c depends on the distribution of curvature in the column. The 
definition of c depends on the shape of the total curvature, not just the curvature from first-
order moment. For sinusoidal curvature, c = π2 and for constant curvature, c = 8.
The latter value of c is best illustrated by considering a free-standing pier of length L with 
rigid foundations and hence l0 = 2L. For constant curvature, 1/r, the deflection is obtained by 
integration of the curvature as follows:  
 
 
 
∆ = ∫L
0 ∫x
0 (1/r) dx; dx = (1/r) L2/2
From the above formula for e2, with c = 8 and lo = 2L, the deflection is:
	
	
	
e2 = (1/r) lo2/c = (1/r) 4L2/8 = (1/r) L2/2
which is the same result as that in the earlier equation,
 
 
 
∆ = ∫L
0 ∫x
0 (1/r) dx dx = (1/r) L2/2
The value of c = π2 is recommended in 11.3.2.2 (4) but care should again be taken when 
reinforcement is curtailed continuously to match the moment capacity envelope. In that 
situation, it will be more appropriate to use c = 8.
9.3.2.3	
Curvature
Cl. 11.3.2.3
The value of the curvature ‘1/r’ depends upon the extent of axial load and the creep. The 
method is applicable for members with constant symmetrical cross-section (including 
reinforcement) only. The curvature can be determined according to 11.3.2.3.
 
 
 
1/r = KrKØ 1/r0 where
	
	
	
1/r0 is the basic value of curvature
	
	
	
Kr is a correction factor depending on axial load
	
	
	
KØ is a factor for taking account of creep
The above equation is applicable to a uniform symmetric section having symmetric 
reinforcements throughout.
As explained under Clause 11.3.1 (2), there are “nominal stiffness method” and “nominal 
curvature method” under simplified methods. In the nominal stiffness method, the curvature 
is expressed in terms of estimated nominal stiffness EI, as 1/r = M/El
However, in nominal curvature method as explained below, the curvature 1/r is estimated on 
the basis of yield strain in tensile and compressive reinforcement.
The curvature 1/r0 is based on a rectangular beam with symmetrical reinforcement and 
strains of yield in reinforcement at each fibre separated by a lever arm z = 0.9d, where d is 
the effective depth (the compression and tension reinforcement thus being considered to 
reach yield). Hence the curvature is given by:



======================================================================
PAGE 126 of 233
======================================================================

IRC:SP:105-2015
119
	
	
	
1/r0 = εyd/0.45d
For situations where the reinforcement is not just in opposite faces of the section, d is taken 
as h/2 + is in accordance with 11.3.2.3 (2) where is is the radius of gyration of the total 
reinforcement area. This expression is again only applicable to uniform symmetric sections 
with symmetric reinforcement.
In the absence of symmetrical reinforcement distribution, normally other codes follow the 
method as explained below. The tension steel yields at εyd and the extreme fiber in compression 
reaches its failure strain εc, so the curvature 1/r0 would be given approximately by:
	
	
	
1/r0 = (εyd + εc)/h
Where h is the depth of the section in the direction of bending used as an approximation to 
the depth to the outer reinforcement layer. The concrete strain can conservatively be taken 
as εc = εcu2. If the above expression is used, the factor Kr below should be taken as 1.0.
Kr is a factor which accounts for the reduction in curvature with increasing axial load and is 
given as (nu – n)/(nu – nbal) <1.0, nu is the ultimate capacity of the section under axial load 
only, Nu, divided by Acfcd. Nu implicitly includes all the reinforcement area, As, in calculating the 
compression resistance such that Nu = Acfcd + Asfyd so that
	
	
	
Nu = 
As given in Clause 11.3.2.3 (3) nbal is the value of design axial load, divided by Acfcd, which 
would maximize the moment resistance of the section as can be seen in Fig. C11-4.
Fig. C11-4  Axial Force for a Balanced Section
The clause allows a value of 0.4 to be used for nbal for all symmetric sections. In other cases, 
the value can be obtained from a section analysis. Kr may always be conservatively taken as 
1.0 (even though for n < nbal it is calculated to be greater than 1.0), and this approximation 
will usually not result in any great loss of economy for bridge piers unless the compressive 
load is unusually high.
KØ is a factor which allows for creep and is given by 11.3.2.3 (4) as follows:
	
	
	
KØ = 1 + βØef > 1.0

where,
	
Øef is the effective creep ratio
 
β = 0.35 + fck/200 – λ/150 and λ is the slenderness ratio
For braced members (held in position at both ends) which do not have transverse loading, 
an equivalent first-order moment for the linearly varying part of the moment may be used 
according to 11.3.3.2 (2). The final first-order moment M0Ed should comprise the reduced 
equivalent moment from M0e = 0.6 M02 +0.4 M01 ≥ 0.4 M02 (Eq 11.15 in the code) added to the 
full first-order moment from imperfections.
9.3.3	
Biaxial Bending 
Cl. 11.3.3
When the columns are bent bi-axially slenderness for the same can be ascertained as 
described in the Clause 11.3.1. This clause is applicable when simplified methods are 
used.
Also the approximate method described in the Clause 11.3.2 can also be used. In both 
of these methods 2nd order moments are determined in independently for both directions 
including imperfections. It is to be noted however, imperfections should be considered in 
only one direction which is most unfavourable. The clause cautions to explore the critical 
combination as it is function of the moments as well as dimensions in each of the directions 
and reinforcement. The critical section may not be identical for both directions. Critical section 
for each of the direction needs to be analysed for forces at that section in other direction and 
adequacy shall be established each section.
Sub-Clause (2) specifies to refer to the Clause 8.3.2 for simplified methods where bi-axial 
moments take second order deformation into account. Here the interaction between moments 
in both direction are not required to be considered if the slenderness ratios in the two principle 
directions are less than or equal to 2 and the ‘relative eccentricities’ satisfy one of the criteria 
in 8.3.2 (3). In case the slenderness ratio in any principle direction exceeds 2.0, section 
design under the bi-axial moments and axial force shall be done by a rigorous cross-section 
analysis using the strain compatibility method.
9.4 
Lateral Instability of Slender Beam
Cl. 11.4
9.4.1	
General
Cl. 11.4.1
This clause discusses the lateral stability of concrete beams. The concrete girders 
are vulnerable to instability due to out of plane bending resulting in lateral and torsional 
displacements. The lateral and torsional instabilities are essentially to be checked during 
prestressing, side shifting, transportation and erection or launching as the beams are normally 
safe once deck slab is in place.
If for any reasons the requirements as specified in 11.4.1 (3) are not met then second-order 
analysis needs to be carried out to determine the additional transverse bending and torsional 
moments developed. Geometric imperfections must be taken into account and the clause 
requires a lateral minimum deflection of l/300 to be accounted as a geometric imperfection, 



======================================================================

where l is the total length of the beam. It is not necessary to include an additional torsional 
imperfection as well. Irrespective of the method used, the supporting structures and restraints 
must be designed for the resulting torsion as per Clause 11.4.1 (4).
9.4.2	
Slenderness Limits for Beams
Cl. 11.4.2
This clause gives criteria for ignoring 2nd order effects in beams.
The above lateral stability formulae based on numerical study (3) don’t cover for lateral 
stability of prestressed beams during transportation, handling and even during prestressing, 
arising out of casting imperfections, inclinations etc.
For the factor of safeties against lateral buckling of beams during prestressing, transportation 
and handling etc., special literature may be referred to and one of the papers could be (4) 
under references.

CHAPTER 10
SECTION 12 : SERVICEABILITY LIMIT STATE
10.1 
General
Cl. 12.1
 
(1) 
The verification of SLS is performed under service load conditions.
	
	
The excessive cracking or stresses under SLS may affect the durability of 
structure, its appearance, its air/water tightness etc. Excessive deflections 
may cause ugly appearance and inefficient use.
	
(2)	
This clause permits an un-cracked concrete cross-section to be assumed 
for stress and deflection calculation provided that the flexural tensile stress 
under the relevant combination of actions considered does not exceed ƒctm 
or ƒctm,fl but should be consistent with the value used in the calculation of 
minimum tension reinforcement.
	
	
For the purpose of calculating crack widths and tension stiffening effects, 
ƒctm should be used. Where the maximum tensile stress in the concrete 
calculated on the basis of uncracked section exceeds fctm or fctm. fl, the crack 
state should be assumed. Where the section is assumed to be uncracked, 
whole concrete section is considered to be active and both concrete and 
steel are assumed to be elastic, both in tension and compression.

Stress limitation
Cl. 12.2 
10.2.1	
Allowable Compressive Stress in Concrete
Cl. 12.2.1 
	
(1)	
The limitation of compressive stress in concrete aims at controlling excessive 
compression, producing irreversible strains and longitudinal cracks (parallel 
to the compressive strains) within limits. The clause addresses this my limiting 
the stress level under the rare combination of actions to value of 0.48 fck.
 
(2) 
This clause specifies distinction between linear and non¬linear creep 
behaviour of concrete. Under the quasi–permanent combination, if the 
compressive stress in concrete exceeds 0.36 fck  non-linear model should be 
used for the assessment of creep effects.
10.2.2	
Allowable Tensile Stress in Steel
Cl. 12.2.2
This clause is provided to ensure stress in reinforcement is in elastic range by limiting the 
stress to 0.8 fyk under the rare combination of loads. It is not necessary to carry out the check 
for fatigue, if the tensile stress in the reinforcement does not exceed 300 MPa under Rare 
Combination of Serviceability Limit State.
The stress in prestressing steel shall not exceed the limits prescribed in Clause 7.9.2 after 
allowance for losses. If it is ensured that for prestressed concrete structures, under the 
frequent combination of action and prestressing force, only compressive stresses occur at 
the extreme concrete fibres, under Serviceability Limit State fatigue check is not required.

Limit State of Cracking
Cl. 12.3 
10.3.1	
General
Cl. 12.3.1
By limiting crack width, the functioning and durability of the structure is ensured. In the 
reinforced concrete structures cracks are inevitable due to tension, bending, shear and 
torsion which is a result of either direct loading or restraint of imposed deformations. This 
may not necessarily impair serviceability or durability.
Cracks may also occur due to other causes like plastic shrinkage or chemical reactions 
accompanied by expansion of hardened concrete. The measures to control width of such 
cracks are covered in Section 14. Design crack widths are specified to satisfy requirements 
of functionality, durability and appearance.
10.3.2	
Limiting Crack Width
Cl. 12.3.2
	
(1)	
This clause requires that the design crack width to be chosen such that 
cracking does not impair the functioning of the structure. Cracking normally 
‘impairs’ the function of the structure by either helping to initiate reinforcement 
corrosion or by spoiling its appearance. The size of the cracks also has an 
influence on the time to initiation of reinforcement corrosion. Noticeable 
cracking in structures causes concern to the public and it is therefore prudent 
to limit crack widths to a size that is not readily noticeable. The above 
considerations have led to the crack width limitations specified in Table 12.1 
(Reproduced for ready reference.). Crack width is to be generally checked 
for quasi-permanent load combinations for reinforced concrete members and 
prestressed members with unbounded tendons. For prestressed members 
with bonded tendons check shall be for frequent load combinations, unless 
a different load combination is specified.

 As a rule the limit state of decompression is required, if cracking or re opening 
of cracks have to be avoided for a given combination. The margin between 
zero stress and tensile strength may be reserved for self equilibrating stresses 
not quantified in the analysis. In flexure of a prestressed beam the state 
of decompression is reached when the section under consideration is fully 
in compression and extreme fibre concrete will normally have compressive 
stress in service.
	
	
The decompression limit deck requires that no tensile stresses occur in 
any concrete within a distance of 100 mm, of the tendon duct. This ensures 
that there is no direct crack path to the tendon for contaminants. The 100 
mm requirement is not a cover requirement.  It simply means that if the 
cover is less than 100 mm. If cover is less than 100 mm it must be fully 
in compression. Tensile stresses are permitted in larger cover as long as 
the concrete within 100 mm of the tendons or ducts is in compression. If, 
while checking decompression, the extreme fibre is found to be cracked, the 
check of decompression at the specified distance from the tendons, 100 mm 
becomes imperative.
	
(2)	
In the combinations where temperature distributions (temperature gradient 
along the member depth) are involved, gross properties should be taken in 
to consideration for calculating crack width and self-equilibrating stresses 
shall be ignored. For cracked sections, the analysis to determine self-
equilibriating stresses is complicated and highly iterative. However, since 
cracking results in a reduction in stiffness of section, cracking of a section 
will lead to a substantial relaxation of the stresses induced by temperature. 
It is therefore generally satisfactory to ignore temperature-induced self-
equilibriating stresses in cracked sections as well and to consider only the 
secondary effects.
	
(3)	
The PSC members with unbounded tendon alone are treated like RCC 
member as specified in the clause. However, for prestressed members 
having combination of bonded and unbounded tendons, limits of bonded 
presstressing apply.
 
(4) 
An alternative for crack width calculations out as specified in the 
Clause 12.3.4 or by providing bar spacing and sizes in accordance with 
the Clause 12.3.5 is available. For latter it is not necessary to calculate the 
crack widths as crack control criteria is deemed to be satisfied by adopting 
this clause.
10.3.3	
Minimum Reinforcement for Crack Control
Cl. 12.3.3
	
(1)	
A minimum amount of untensioned reinforcement is required to control 
cracking in areas where tension due to external loadings or external restraints 
is expected. The amount of such reinforcement may be estimated from 
equilibrium between the tensile force in concrete just before cracking and 
tensile force in steel at yielding.

Fundamental principle of crack width calculations and spacing is that the 
reinforcement remains elastic. If the steel yields, excessive deformation will 
occur at the location of the crack and the formulae used in the calculation 
would get rendered invalid. 
	
	
For a section subjected to uniform tension, the force necessary for the 
member to crack is Ncr = Acƒctm, where Ncr is the cracking load, Ac is the area 
of concrete in tension and ƒctm is the mean tensile strength of the concrete. 
The strength of the reinforcement is Asƒyk. To ensure that distributed cracking 
develops, the steel must not yield when the first crack forms hence:
	
	
	
Asƒyk > Acƒctm
 
(2) 
The above equation needs to be modified for the stresses other than uniform 
tension. When the section is subjected flexure for example, the stresses 
vary across the depth reducing tension consequently the requirement of 
reinforcement. Thus a factor kc is introduced in the above equation to account 
for the same. Another factor k is introduced to account for self equilibrating 
stresses arising out of variation in strain along the depth of the member. The 
shrinkage and temperature differences are the common cause of non-linear 
strain variation. For instance surface shrinkage occurs faster than interior 
and similarly the surface which gets heated up faster also cools faster than 
interiors. The factor k therefore reduces the reinforcement necessary where 
self-equilibriating stresses can occur. These stresses are more pronounced 
for deeper members and thus k is smaller for deeper members.
 
 
σs is the absolute value of the maximum stress permitted in the reinforcement 
immediately after formation of crack.
	
	
fct,eff is the mean value of tensile strength of concrete effective when the cracks 
are first expected to occur. In calculating minimum reinforcement to cater for 
shrinkage ƒct,eff, should be taken as greater of 2.9 MPa and ƒctm(t).
	
(3)	
The bonded tendons normally contribute towards the minimum reinforcement 
requirement. However, the clause recommends neglecting the same in 
crack control as a conservative assumption. The other international codes 
particularly Euro code allows any bonded tendons located within the effective 
tension area to contribute to the area of minimum reinforcement required 
to control cracking provided they are within 150 mm of the surface to be 
checked.
	
(4)	
This clause allows minimum reinforcement to be omitted for prestressed 
concrete members, wherein the stress at the extreme tensile fibre is 
compressive, under the rare combination of actions and the characteristic 
value of prestress. This does not however do away with the need to consider 
the provision of reinforcement to control early thermal and shrinkage cracking 
prior to application of the prestressing.

10.3.4	
Calculation of Crack Width
Cl. 12.3.4 
	
(1)	
The crack width calculations are based on the basic case of a prismatic 
reinforced concrete bar, subjected to axial tension. With regard to the 
behaviour under increasing tensile strain four stages are distinguished (as 
shown in the Fig. C12-1):
 
● 
the uncracked stage, 
 
● 
the crack formation stage, 
 
● 
the stabilized cracking stage, 
 
● 
the steel yielding stage.
	
	
Fig. C12-2 shows a simplified representation of the load-deformation 
behaviour of a centrally reinforced member subjected to tension or imposed 
deformation. According to the simplification, in the crack formation stage (2) 
the axial tensile force does not increase. When enough cracks have been 
formed to ensure that no undisturbed areas are left, the tensile strength of 
the concrete cannot be reached any more between the cracks, so that no 
new cracks can appear. This is the start of the stabilized cracking stage (3). 
In this stage no new cracks are formed but existing cracks widen. Finally the 
steel will start yielding at stage (5) 
	
	
For all stages of cracking, the design crack width Wk may be calculated by: 
	
	
	
Wk = Sr, max (εsm-εcm) Where:
	
	
Sr, max is the maximum crack spacing calculated depending upon the conditions 
in Equations 12.8, 12.11 or 12.12 of the code.
Fig. C12-1  Crack Formation Stages 
	
	
εsm is the mean strain in the reinforcement under the relevant combination of 
loads, including the effect of imposed deformations, restrained thermal and 
shrinkage effects and taking into account the effects of tension stiffening. For 
prestressed members only the additional tensile strain beyond the state of

132
zero strain of the concrete at the same level is considered. 
	
	
εcm is mean strain in the concrete between cracks.
	
(2)	
Relative mean strain in the above clause is given by : 
	
	
	
where,
	
	
σsc   is the steel stress in the crack
	
	
αe     is the modular ratio Es/Ecm
	
	
ρp,eff = As/ Ac,eff; Ac,eff is the effective area of concrete in tension surrounding the 
reinforcement, of depth hc,eff, where hc,eff is the lesser of 2.5 (h-d), (h-x)/3 or h/2 
(refer Fig. C12.2).
Fig. C12.2  Effective Tension Area (Typical Cases)
	
	
kt is an empirical coefficient to assess the mean strain depending on the type 
of loading taken as 0.5.
	
(3)	
This clause elaborates the crack spacing Sr.max for various situations as 
enumerated  below are self explanatory in the code as such is not reproduced 
here : 
 
● 
Spacing of bonded reinforcement within the tension zone is reasonably 
close.
 
● 
Case of deformed bars associated with pure bending.
 
● 
Spacing of the bonded reinforcement is more or where there is no 
bonded reinforcement within the tension zone.

If the cracks in a member reinforced in two orthogonal directions are expected 
to form at an angle which differs substantially (> 15°) from the direction of

the reinforcement, the approximation by following equation may be used to 
calculate Sr,max and Wk.
	
	
	
	
where,
 
 
θ is the angle between the reinforcement in the y direction and the direction 
of the principal tensile stress.
	
	
Sr,max,y Sr,max,z are the crack spacings calculated in the y and z directions 
respectively, according to Clause 12.3.4 (3).
Derivation for crack width and crack spacings
 
● 
The member will first crack when the tensile strength of weakest section is 
reached. 
 
● 
Cracking leads to local redistribution of stresses adjacent to the crack by 
strain distribution. 
 
● 
At crack the entire tensile force is carried by reinforcement. 
 
● 
Moving away from the crack tensile stress is transferred from the reinforcement 
by bond to the surrounding concrete. 
 
● 
At some distance Le from crack the distribution of stress is unaltered from 
that before the crack formed.
 
● 
At this location the strain in concrete and reinforcement is equal and the 
stress in the concrete is just below its tensile strength. 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:105-2015
134
	
● 
The redistribution of stress, local to the crack results in an extension of 
member which is taken up in the crack causing it to open. 
 
● 
With increase in tension the crack will form in the next weakest section.
 
● 
This will not be within distance of Le of the first crack due to reduction in 
concrete stress in that region associated with first crack.
 
● 
With further increase in tension more cracks will develop until the maximum 
crack spacing is 2 Le 
 
● 
No further cracks then form but further loading will cause existing cracks to 
widen.
 
● 
This is called stabilized cracking.
 
● 
The member stiffness will continue to reduce tending towards fully cracked 
section
 
● 
The crack spacing will lie between Le and 2Le
	
	
Assuming Constant bond strength T along the length Le 
	
	
	
	
	
	
Le – 0.25 K1 Ø/ρ K1 bond properties of reinforcement 
 
 
This does not fit well with the experimental data. 
	
	
So a term Kc is added to relate it to cover. 
	
	
	
	
K shall be taken as 2 
 
 
 
 
Le = 2c + 0.25 K1 Ø/ρ
	
	
This is valid for pure tension. For bending case another constant K2, is 
included to take into account the variation in stress distribution 
	
	
	
	
Le = 2c + 0.25 K1K2 Ø/ρ

K1 = is 0.8 for HYSD bars; K2 = 1.0 pure tension and 0.5 for 
	
	
bending cases.
	
	
	
	
Le – mean crack spacing
	
	
The crack width will give only the mean crack width if this expression used.
	
	
As we are interested characteristics crack width. Experimentally it has 
been found; 1.7 times this distance gives the maximum crack spacing for 
characteristics crack width.

10.3.5	
Control of Shear Cracks within Webs
Cl. 12.3.5
In the prestressed concrete as well as in RCC members where shear cracking has to be 
checked, the code specfies the criteria for deciding reinforcement required for crack control.
10.3.6	
Control of Cracking without Direct Calculation
Cl. 12.3.6
On the basis of calculations under Clause 12.3.4 above, Code includes a tables for different 
steel stresses and corresponding spacing or the specified bar diameters for crack widths 
of 0.2 mm and 0.3 mm tas a simplification as in the Tables 12.2 and 12.3 for direct use in 
practice. When these values are ensured in design, subject to fulfilling the limitations as in 
12.3.6 (3), no specific calculation for crack width is necessary.
The tabulation is based on the reinforcement stress determined from a cracked section 
analysis under the relevant combination of actions. The relevant effective concrete moduli 
for long-term and short-term loading are used. It is assumed that minimum reinforcement 
clauses in the code are satisfied. An advantage of this simplified approach is that many of the 
difficulties of interpretation of parameters and definitions involved in calculations to 12.3.4 for 
non-rectangular cross-sections (such as for circular sections) can be avoided.
For cracks caused mainly by direct actions (i.e. imposed forces and moments), cracks 
may be controlled by limiting reinforcement stresses to the values in either Table 12.2 or 
Table 12.3 and corresponding bar diameters or suggested spacing. It is not necessary to 
satisfy bar size and spacing both. The first table sets limits on reinforcement stress based 
on bar diameter and the second table based on bar spacing. For cracks caused mainly 
by restraint (i.e., due to shrinkage or temperature), only Table 12.2 can be used; cracks 
have to be controlled by limiting the bar size to match the calculated reinforcement stress 
immediately after cracking.
Tables 12.2 and 12.3 are produced from parametric studies carried out using the crack width 
calculation formulae in Clause 12.3.4. They are based on reinforced concrete rectangular 
sections in pure bending for various parameters as stated in Clause 12.3.6 (3) of the Code.

138
The Clauses 12.3.6 (5) and (6) address the treatment for combination of prestressing steel 
and un-tensioned reinforcement. The prestress can conservatively be treated as an external 
force applied to the cross-section (ignoring the stress increase in the tendons after cracking) 
and the resulting stress in the reinforcement is determined, ignoring concrete in tension as 
usual. The reinforcement stress derived can then be compared against the tabulated limits. 
For pre-tensioned beams with relatively little untensioned reinforcement, where crack control 
is to be provided mainly by the bonded tendons themselves, the clause permits use of any of 
the Tables 12.2 and 12.3 with the steel stress taken as the total stress in the tendons after 
cracking, minus the initial prestress after losses. This is approximately equal to the stress 
increase in the tendons after decompression at the level of the tendons.
The Clause 12.3.6 (7) cautions about large cracks occurring in sections where there are 
sudden changes of stress such as at changes of section, near concentrated loads, where 
bars are curtailed or at areas of high bond stresses such as at the end of laps. The sudden 
changes of sections should generally be avoided (by tapers). However, when the same cannot 
be avoided, the Code requires the check by calculations. Compliance with recommended 
reinforcement detailing clauses normally is expected to provide satisfactory performance and 
will be a reasonable first assumption for check.

Limit state of Deflection
Cl. 12.4 
10.4.1	
General
Cl. 12.4.1
Excessive sagging deflections under permanent actions can generally be overcome by pre-
cambering. Dynamic considerations are to be given for live load and wind-induced oscillations 
respectively. Resonance of bridges needs to be checked, especially for pedestrian bridges, 
where frequency of walking personnel can cause high amplitudes of vibrations.
The Code expects acceptable limit values for deflections should be established by owner or 
by agreement between the stake holders. In the absence of the same, the following deflection 
limits under Live Load may be considered for concrete bridges
	
-	
Vehicular : Span/800,
	
-	
Vehicular and pedestrian or pedestrian alone : Span/1000,
	
-	
Vehicular on cantilever : Cantilever Span/300,

Vehicular & pedestrian and pedestrian only on cantilever arms : Cantilever 
Span/375
10.4.2	
Calculation of Deflection due to Sustained Loads
Cl. 12.4.2
In order to ensure a satisfactory behaviour in the serviceability limit state, deformations should 
be calculated as follows:
 
● 
The long-term deformations are calculated for the quasi permanent load 
combinations,
 
● 
The instantaneous deformations are calculated for the rare load 
combinations.



======================================================================
PAGE 146 of 233
======================================================================

IRC:SP:105-2015
139
For the calculation of camber, only the quasi-permanent load combinations are considered. 
In order to calculate camber, the mean values of the material properties may be used.
The actual deformations may differ considerably from the calculated values; in particular if the 
values of the applied moments are close to the cracking moment. The difference will depend 
on the dispersion of the material properties, the ambient conditions, the loading conditions, 
the previous loading conditions, the restraints at the supports, etc.
Attention must be paid to cases where the basic assumptions of plane sections and uniformly 
distributed stresses across the section may not be adequate, such as in the case of shear lag 
effects in large prestressed structure.
For prestressed concrete members it may be necessary to control deflections assuming 
unfavourable deviations of the prestressing force and the dead load.
In case of cracked sections appropriate moment of inertia should be used. If the accurate 
determination of MI is not possible, 70 percent of uncracked MI should be used. For 
Prestressed Concrete members, generally uncracked MI should be used as the section is 
under compression.
In a cracked section under constant bending moment, changes in the stresses, strains and 
position of the neutral axis occur due to creep and shrinkage.
For loads with a long duration causing creep, the total deformation including creep may be 
calculated by using an effective modulus of elasticity for concrete Ec,eff as below:
	
	
	
where,
	
φ (∞, t0) is the creep coefficient relevant for the load and time interval (as per 
Clause 6.4.2.7).
 
For Shrinkage deformations shrinkage coefficient to be used in a form of curvature 
is as below:
	
	
	
where,
	
1/rcs  is the curvature due to shrinkage
	
εcs	 is the free shrinkage strain (as per Clause 6.4.2.6)
	
S is the first moment of area of the reinforcement about the centroid of the 
section
	
l	 is the second moment of area of the section
	
αe  is the effective modular ratio = Es / Ec,eff
The time dependent deflections are influenced by environmental and curing conditions, the 
age at time of loading, amount of compression reinforcement, magnitude of the stresses due 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:105-2015
140
to sustained loading and prestressing as well as strength gain of concrete after release of 
prestress. In particular, camber is especially sensitive to the concrete properties at the age 
of release of prestress, level of stresses, storage method, time of erection, placement of 
superimposed loads and environmental conditions.
Worked Example 1
Stress Control:
RCC deck slab, 350 mm thick and with M50 grade concrete, is subjected to a transverse 
hogging moment of 144 kNm/m under the combination of actions at SLS. This moment 
comprises 22.5 percent from self-weight and super-imposed dead load and 77.5 percent 
Live Load from traffic. The ultimate design (ULS) requires a reinforcement area of 
2513 mm2/m (20 mm diameter bars at 125 mm c/c) at an effective depth of 290 mm. Carry 
out the serviceability limit state checks.
Solutions:
Check for cracking:
Depth to neutral axis h/2 = 350/2 = 175 mm
Second moment of area, l = bh3/12 = 1000 x 3503/12 = 3.573x 109 mm4/m.
If the section is un-cracked, compressive and tensile stress at the top and bottom of the 
section respectively, would be:
 
σtop = σbot = M *y/I = 144 X 106x 175/3.573x 109 = 7.05 MPa From Table 6.5 for 
M50 grade of concrete,
	
ƒctm = 3.5MPa < σbot; 
Therefore the section is cracked. Stresses therefore will need to be calculated ignoring 
concrete in tension. The relevant modular ratio, αeff, depends on the proportion of long-term 
and short-term loading.
	
(a) 
Check for stresses assuming short term creep and elastic modulus:
	
	
	
	
Es = 200 GPa, and from Table 6.5, Ecm= 35 GPa
	
	
Thus
	
	
	
	
Ec,eff = Ecm = 35 GPa
	
	
The depth of concrete in compression from the following equation is:

= 78.02 mm
	
The cracked second moment of area in steel units from following equation is:
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The concrete stress at the top of the section from following equation is:
	
	
	
	
	
From 12.2/Clause 12.2 (2), the compression limit = 0.36ƒck = 0.36 x 50 = 18 MPa 
> 13.98 MPa, hence OK.
	
The reinforcement stress from following equation is:
	
	
	
	
	
From Clause 12.2.2, the tensile limit = k3ƒyk = 0.8 x 500 = 400 MPa >217.06 
MPa, hence OK.
	
(b) 
Stress checks after, all creep effect has taken place: 
	
	
The creep factor is determined for the long-term loading using Table 6.9 
and is found to be φ = 2.2. This is used to calculate an effective modulus 
of elasticity for the concrete under the specific proportion of long-term and 
short-term actions defined using equation
	
	
	
	
	
	
Repeating the calculation process in (a) above, the depth of concrete in 
compression is 92.17 mm and the cracked second moment of area in steel 
units is 128.9 x 106 mm4.
	
	
This concrete stress at the top of the section from following equation is:
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
< 18 MPa , hence OK.
	
	
The reinforcement stress from following equation is:
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
< 400 MPa, hence OK

The effect of creep here is to reduce the concrete stress and slightly increase 
the reinforcement stress.
Example 2
Crack checks by simplified method without direct calculation method & minimum 
reinforcement in RCC deck:
In this problem, 350 mm thick RCC deck slab analysed in Worked Example above is again 
considered, assuming the same reinforcement (20 mm diameter bars at 125 mm centres 
with 50 mm cover) and concrete grade M50. The exposure class is moderate. The method 
of Clause 12.3.6 (without direct calculation) is used to check crack control and minimum 
reinforcement is checked in accordance with Clause 12.3.3.
Table 12.1 requires crack widths to be limited to 0.3 mm under the quasi-permanent load 
combination for a moderate exposure class. Thermal actions have Ψ2 = 0.5 and so should 
be considered. Only the secondary effects of temperature difference, however, need to be 
considered; the primary self equilibrating stresses may be ignored.
For convenience here, the same moments as in Worked Example 1 of 144 kNm/m, comprising 
22.5 percent (DL + SDL) and 77.55 percent LL actions will be taken. The make-up would, 
however, be very different as discussed above; it is unlikely that temperature difference would 
produce effects anywhere near as severe as those from characteristic traffic actions.
From the above example, the serviceability stress in the reinforcement has already been 
calculated as 220.35 MPa. To comply with Clause 12.3.6, either:
	
1)	
The maximum bar size must be limited to 12 mm (from Table 12.2); or
	
2)	
The maximum bar spacing must be limited to 225 mm (interpolating within 
Table 12.3).
	
	
The provision of 20 mm diameter bars at 125 mm centres complies with 
the limit on bar spacing in (2) above (which permits a reinforcement stress of 
300 MPa for bars at 125 mm centres) and the design is therefore acceptable. 
It does not matter that it does not comply with the limit in (1) as well.
	
	
Additionally, it is necessary to check that the reinforcement complies with 
the minimum reinforcement area required in accordance with Clause 12.3.3. 
This will rarely govern at peak moment positions, but may do so near points 
of contra flexure if reinforcement is curtailed:
	
	
	
	
From Clause 12.3.3: As,minσs = kckƒct,effAct
	
	
Act is the area of concrete within the tensile zone just before the first crack 
forms. The section behaves elastically until thetensile fibre stress reaches 
ƒctm, therefore, for a rectangular section, the area in tension is half the slab 
depth, thus:
	
	
	
	
Act = 350 / 2 X 1000 = 175 X 103 mm2
	
	
	
	
ƒct,eff = ƒctm but not less than 2.8 MPa – clause 12.3.3. From 
	
	
Table 6.5 for M50 concrete, ƒctm = 3.5 MPa so ƒct,eff = 3.5 MPa.

For rectangular sections of less than 300 mm depth, k should be taken as 
1.0 and can in general be taken as 1.0 conservatively. For sections with no 
axial load, i.e. σc = 0 MPa, reduces to kc = 0.4 x (1 – 0) = 0.4.
 
 
σs may in general be based on the maximum allowable value from either 
Table 12.2 (222 MPa for 20 mm diameter bars) or Table 12.3 (300 MPa for 
125 mm bar centres). However, for minimum reinforcement calculation, it is 
possible that cracking may arise mainly from restraint, rather than load and, 
therefore, the value from Table 12.2 is used here in accordance with the 
Note to Clause 12.3.2.  Therefore σs = 220 MPa assuming 20 mm bars and 
so:
	
	
	
	
As,min = 0.4 x 1.0 x 3.5 x 175 x 103/220 = 1280.7 mm2/m
	
	
The 20 mm bars at 125 mm centres provide As = 2513 mm2/m, which exceeds 
this minimum value, so the design is adequate. From minimum reinforcement 
considerations alone, the bar centres could be increased or the bar diameter 
reduced in zones of low moment, but further crack control and ultimate limit 
state checks would then be required at these curtailment locations.
Example 3
Crack width calculation using direct method :
The above worked out example is repeated using direct calculation of the crack width:
By Clause 12.3.4(1)/Eq. (12.5): Wk = sr,max (εsm – εcm)
By Clause 12.3.4(3)/Eq. (12.11): sr,max = k3c + k1k2k4Ø / ρp,eff = 3.4c + 0.425k1k2Ø/ρp,eff
c = 50 mm and Ø = 20 mm; therefore d = 250 – 50 – 20/2 = 290 mm and the depth to the 
neutral axis, x = 92.17 mm (from worked example above). By Clause 12.3.4(3), this equation 
is valid provided the actual bar spacing is less than 5(c + Ø/2) = 5 x (50 + 20/2) = 300 mm, 
which is OK.
By Clause 12.3.4 (2)/Eq (12.7): ρp,eff = 
where As = area of reinforcement = π x 102/0.125 = 2513 mm2/m. Ap = 0 since no prestress. Ac,eff 
= effective tension area = bhc,ef with hc,ef taken as the lesser of:
 
 
 
2.5(h – d) = 2.5 x (350 – 290) = 150 mm
 
 
 
(h – x) / 3 = (350 – 92.17) / 3 = 85.9 mm
 
 
 
h/2 = 350/2 = 175 mm
	
Thus		
hc,ef = 85.9 mm and Ac,eff = 1000 x 85.9 = 85.9 x 103 mm2/m
Therefore		
	
k1 = 0.8 for high bond bars and k2 = 0.5 for bending, therefore: sr,max = 3.4 x 50 + 0.425 x 0.8 x 
0.5 x 20 / 0.029 = 287.2 mm

IRC:SP:105-2015
144
(It should be noted that the concrete cover term, 3.4c, contributes 170 mm of the total 287 mm 
crack spacing here, so is very significant.)
By Clause 12.3.4 (2)/Eq. (12.6): 
	
	
	
From Worked example above, the reinforcement stress assuming a fully cracked section is 
221.0 MPa, so the minimum
	
	
	
value of 0.6 
 is 0.6 x 221.0 / (200 x 103) = 0.663 x 10-3
	
	
	
Kt = 0.5 from Table 6.5 for M50 concrete, fct,eff = fctm = 3.5 MPa, ae  
 
= 200/35 = 5.714. Therefore:
	
	
	
εsm–εcm=
	
	
	
which is greater than the minimum value of 0.663 x 10-3.
Therefore, maximum crack width, wk = 287.2 x 0.711 x 10-3 = 0.20 mm < 0.3 mm limit, hence 
OK.
Repeating the above calculation, the reinforcement stress could be increased to 288 MPa 
until a crack width of 0.3 mm is reached, assuming the same ratio of short-term and long-term 
moments as used in this example.  This compares with an allowable stress of 300 MPa from 
Table 12.3 for bars at 125 mm centres as used in Worked 2nd example above. The method 
without direct calculation therefore gives a more economic answer here.
Example 4
Check for compression:
Problem – 
A beam has width of 150 mm and depth of 300 mm. it is partially prestressed with area of 
steel as 100 mm2 located at a depth of 230 mm from the top of section.  Grade of concrete 
is M40.

b)	
Load corresponding to zero strain in concrete at the level of steel
This stage is called decompression stage. Decompression stage is a stage in which the 
surrounding stress at the prestressing level is zero.
Note that as per IRC:112 Clause 12.3.2 (1), the zero strain location should not be within 
100 mm of the prestressing duct, but for the purpose of example we will consider it to be at

CHAPTER 11
SECTION 13 : PRESTRESSING  SYSTEM
11.1 
General
Cl. 13.1
This section covers requirements of the parts of prestressing systems which are incorporated 
in the structure, which include anchoring devices and coupling devices for application in 
post tensioned construction. It also covers provision of reinforcement in anchorage zones in 
concrete.
11.2 
Anchorages for Post Tensioning Systems
Cl. 13.2
11.2.1	
Type of Anchorages
Cl. 13.2.1
Both, external and embedded types of anchorage systems are covered in this sub-clause. 
Partially or fully embedded anchorages transfer the prestressing force to the members by 
combination of bearing, friction and wedge action while the externally mounted anchorages 
transfer prestressing force of the tendons to concrete through an externally mounted bearing 
plate. Figs. 13.2.1 & 13.2.2 show the typical details of two types of anchorages.

C11.2.2	
Requirements of Anchorage Capacity
Cl. 13.2.2
The requirements spelt out in this clause are meant to ensure that the anchorage and coupler 
assemblies have sufficient strength, proper force transfer mechanism to concrete and fatigue 
characteristics to meet the design requirements.
C11.2.3	
Load Transfer to Concrete Element through End Block
Cl. 13.2.3
The end zone (or end block) of a post-tensioned member is a region which is subjected to 
high and complex state of stresses from the anchorage system This zone is termed as the 
anchorage block.
Minimum concrete strength required at the time when tensioning takes place and load is 
transferred to concrete member depends mainly on the design of anchorage, the edge 
distance of the anchorage and the spacing between adjacent anchorages. The anchorage 
zone is provided with reinforcement to take care of tensile stresses in this zone and maintain its 
integrity, Strictly a check of crack width is required as per this clause. However, determination 
of the tensile forces from the dispersal of prestress in local zone creates a multi axial state of 
stresses which gets modified as the concrete cracks and transfers load to the reinforcement. 
Even with the advent of powerful computers designers will generally find it difficult to carry 
out such analysis, where combined bearing, friction and wedge action is mobilized. In lieu 
of such check, Eurocode EC2 suggests that the reinforcement stress shall be limited to 
250 Mpa to control the width of the cracks. This is similar to controlling crack widths in water 
retaining structures by limiting the steel stresses, Alternatively, the design of this zone can be 
proved by testing of typical assembly and varying the load carrying capacity and inspection/
control of crack widths as specified in the acceptance tests.
C11.2.4	
Acceptance Tests for Anchorage-Tendon Assembly
Cl. 13.2.4
The tendon and the anchorage together is called the Anchorage-Tendon assembly. The 
three tests recommended in the FIP document define the performance, testing procedures 
and quality assurance requirements necessary to make the post tensioning system safe 
and acceptable. These tests have also been adopted by IS Code on Prestressed Concrete 
(IS:1343: 2010).
	
(1) 
Anchorage efficiency Test:
	
	
The aim of static load test carried on the tendon anchorage assembly, is to 
assess the performance of the same in holding tendons effectively upto a 
minimum specified fraction of the UTS of tendons with required minimum 
extension and without causing failure of more than a specified % of tendons. 
IS:1343 specifies these limits as 95 percent of UTS and not less than 
2.0 percent elongation of a 3 m long specimen. Failure limit of tendons is not 
over 5 percebt area of cross-section. This reduction in holding capacity is 
acceptable due to the low values of tensions in actual use.

(on 19 Strands of 13 mm Dia - UTS 350 T)
	
(2) 
Dynamic load test:
	
	
The aim of dynamic load test is to determine the capacity of the tendon-
anchorage assembly under load fluctuation between specified variation of 
stress of tendons in terms of minimum specified cycles of loading as an 
indication of the quality and reliability of the assembly. IS:1343 specifies 
these limits as loading range of 80 Mpa for steel with upper limit of 
65 percent of the UTS, and number of cycles as >2.5 million. Not more than 
5 percent of cross sectional area of tendons are allowed to fail. This test is 
carried out without using the trumpets, which bring the tendon assembly to a 
closer configuration for passing through the duct. If tested with the trumpet, 
the tendons (strands) fail at much lesser number of cycles (Thousands, rather 
than millions) by fretting at the points of contact between tendon and the 
trumpet. In this sense, the test does not replicate actual loading condition, 
but is purely a test of the mechanical efficiency of the anchorage block, 
wedges and tendon assembly in a stressed condition. This is acceptable for 
grouted tendons where the relative slip between the tendon and trumpet is 
avoided by grouting and ultimate reliance for holding tendons in the stressed 
condition is placed on the grout.

This test is carried out to ascertain that the transfer of prestressing forces from 
the mechanical anchorage and its components to the concrete takes place 
without causing any excessive cracks in concrete or excessive deformation 
of the anchorage components.

11.4 
End Block Design & Detailing
Cl. 13.5
In design, attention needs to be given to highly stressed concrete compression zone in the 
immediate vicinity of the anchorages; bursting stresses generated in the localized area of 
the anchorage as complimentary transverse tensile force arise from spread of load in the 
mass of concrete, The design of Anchorage zones is an area of dual responsibility between 
the supplier of post tensioning system & the design consultant. The local anchorage zone 
reinforcement, which may be either spiral or an orthogonal reinforcement or combination 
thereof, shall generally be specified by the prestressing system supplier which has been 
tested for satisfactory performance in the load transfer test. The recommendations of the 
prestressing supplier normally suffice for satisfactory performance of the local zone behind 
the anchorage. This however may have to be modified for a group of anchorages in their 
specific configuration for a specific design situation by the design consultant. This is referred 
as the end block design.
11.4.1	
Bursting Reinforcement for Post-Tensioned Sections
Cl. 13.5.1
The local zone behind the bearing plate for an external anchorage or around anchorage for 
embedded anchorage is subjected to high bearing stress and internal stresses. The stress 
is ‘compressive’ for a distance 0.2Y0 from the end. Beyond that it is ‘tensile’ upto 2.0Y0. 
The resultant of the tensile stress in a transverse direction is known as the bursting force 
(Fbst).
The design bursting reinforcement for an individual externally mounted anchorage with 
individual square end block or rectangular end block is given in Clause 13.5.1.1. It can 
be observed that with the increase in size of the bearing plate the bursting force (Fbst) 
reduces. For internal (embedded) anchorages Clause 13.5.1.2 allows use manufacturer’s 
recommendation instead of complex detailed design.
11.4.2	
Spalling Reinforcement for Post-Tensioned Tendons
Cl. 13.5.2
Local tensile stress concentration exists along the loaded edge (surface) of the member, 
which require reinforcement to control compatibility induced cracking. This sub-clause of the 
code provides specification for check of the section as a whole containing the anchorages.
Proportioning of spalling reinforcement in the these zones may be done with strut-and-tie 
models Alternatively, the spalling zone reinforcement may be designed for a force equal 
to 0.03 * Pmax/(fyd*γp,unfav) as per Euro Code EC-2. For more details and for refined analysis, 
Specialist literature, such as CIRIA-1 guide (Ref. 3) may be referred on use of strut and tie 
model as well as for distribution of this reinforcement.

11.5 
Blister Blocks & Deviator Blocks
No guidance is given in the code regarding design and detailing of reinforcement for 
‘Intermediate  Anchorage Blocks’ (or Blister Blocks) and ‘Deviators’, which are frequently used 
in segmenteal construction and in PSC Box Girder structures. For the benefit of designers this 
document gives some guidelines which are based on specialist literatures (such as AASHTO 
LRFD Code, CIRIA guidelines/EC2 …etc.).
	
a) 
Blister Blocks
	
	
Blister Blocks are projections for anchoring a tendons at intermediate points 
from within the body of a member. Such anchorages exert compressive 
forces to the slab behind the anchorage. Tensile force is generated in the 
slab in front of the anchorage, away from tendon. Apart from the normal 
bursting and spalling forces, treatment of which is similar to any normal 
anchorages, blisters and slabs are also subjected to local shear, bending 
and direct force effects. The slabs at blister blocks are also subjected to 
high tensile stresses in the prestressing direction away from the tendon, for 
which tie-back reinforcement is required, to prevent cracks occuring at the 
blister block. Intermediate anchorages shall not be used, as far as possible, 
in regions where significant tension is generated at the anchor from other 
loads. Wherever practical, blisters should be located in the corner between 
flange and web where the compressive stresses at high or form a continuous 
rib, suitably reinforced, extended over the full flange width or web height, 
along which the anchorages can be spresd, CIRIA guide recommends that 
for the intermediately anchored tendons tie-back reinforcement into the 
concrete behind the anchorage point should be provided to cater for at least 
50 percent of the prestressing force. This is based on the simplified assumption 
that in the elastic analysis the in plane force is resisted equally on both front 
and back side of anchorage. The contribution of residual compression at 
the location to resist the said tension is allowed to contribute to get net 
reinforcement required. This amount of reinforcement can be reduced, with 
increasing compressive stress in the region of the anchorage, produced by 
other prestressing tendons, for which detailed local analysis, using FEM may 
have to be carried out.
 
 
Tendons anchored in blister block usually will have curved profile within the 
blister zone, which will give rise to radial component of the load, which must 
be resisted by additional radial reinforcement anchoring back into the main 
body. In addition, high local bending & shear stresses develop in the slabs at 
the location of blister blocks. Fig. C13.5 shows typical reinforcement detail 
for blister blocks.

b) 
Deviator Blocks
	
	
The term ‘deviator’ refers to discrete structural element which allows change 
in profile of an external post tensioning tendon to be deviated from an 
otherwise straight alignment. The protective duct surrounding the tendon 
strands is normally continuous through a deviator without direct connection 
to it. The structural unit providing deviation may be concrete or structural 
steel.
	
	
The deviator block must withstand the longitudinal and transverse forces 
that the tendon applies to it and transmit these forces to the structure. The 
deviators must also ensure that the radius of curvature of the prestressing 
tendon does not cause any overstressing or damage to it.
A sample worked example for Design & Detailing of End Block is given at the end of this 
chapter for the benefit of designers.

The reinforcement required to prevent bursting and spalling in anchorage zones is determined 
in relation to a rectangular prism of concrete, known as the primary requlansation prism, located 
behind each anchorage. The corss-section of the prism associated with each anchorage is 
known as the associate rectangle. The associate rectangle has the same centre and the 
same axes of symmetry as the anchorage plate (which should have two axes of symmetry) 
and should satisfy.

CHAPTER 12
SECTION 14 : DURABILITY
C12.1 
General
Cl. 14.1
In addition to having required load-carrying capacity to withstand various design combinations 
of ultimate loads and combinations of serviceability design actions, concrete structures are 
required to have adequate durability so as to provide satisfactory service life.
Durability of concrete is its resistance to various deteriorating elements that may reside inside 
the concrete itself or be present in the service environment to which the concrete structure 
is exposed. In so far as deteriorating elements residing inside the concrete are concerned, 
these originate from the ingredients of concrete e.g. water, aggregate, and cement, mineral 
and chemical admixtures. Section 18 of this Code requires that all the ingredients used 
should conform to the requirements of the respective BIS Specifications.
The various actions that can affect the durability of concrete can be mechanical, physical 
or chemical. Impact, abrasion, erosion and cavitation are examples of the mechanical 
causes. Physical causes of deterioration include high temperature effects; effects of thermal 
gradients inside concrete, especially in mass concrete; alternate freezing and thawing and 
incompatibility between coefficients of thermal expansion of the aggregate and the matrix. 
However, it is the attack by chemical agencies like chloride, sulphate, CO2, and chemical 
causes of alkali-silica and alkali-carbonate reactions that are more prominent. Deteriorating 
elements present in the service environment include gases like oxygen, carbon dioxide, 
liquids like water, chloride and/or sulphate ions in solutions and other potentially deleterious 
substances.
Most of the harmful reactions are expansion-producing and are activated with presence of 
water or moisture.. For example;
 
● 
Atmospheric CO2 is converted to carbonic acid (H2CO3) in the presence of 
moisture, which attacks hydrated cement paste. This is called carbonation. 
Carbonation lowers the pH value of concrete and reduces the protection to 
steel by the alkalinity of the surrounding medium.
 
● 
Corrosion of steel is controlled by the rate of penetration of chloride ions. It 
requires the presence of oxygen and water and is aided by carbonation.
 
● 
Sulphate attack depends on the penetration of sulphate ions into the concrete. 
The reaction takes place in the presence of moisture.
 
● 
Frost attack concrete has to be above a critical range of water saturation for 
the damage due to freezing and thawing to take place.
 
● 
For alkali silica reaction (ASR) water is required to produce the expansive 
gel and therefore, depends upon the rate of water penetration into the 
concrete.



======================================================================
PAGE 170 of 233
======================================================================

IRC:SP:105-2015
163
It is quite apparent that transport of fluids – both liquids and gases – into concrete is important 
consideration. The various processes can be summarized as follows;
 
● 
Flow of water due to application of a hydrostatic head, characterized by water 
permeability coefficient.
 
● 
Water absorption and uptake of water resulting from capillary forces, 
characterized by a sorptivity coefficient.
 
● 
Ion diffusion: movement of ions as a result of concentration gradient, 
characterized by ion diffusion coefficient.
 
● 
Other processes like gas diffusion, water vapour diffusion, pressure induced 
gas flow etc.
In view of so many possible modes, one should really be concerned with a notion of collective 
‘penetrability’ of fluids.; Nevertheless, the commonly accepted term is ‘permeability’, which is 
mostly adopted to describe transport of fluids through concrete (Neville, 2000).
Fluid transport depends mainly upon the structure of hydrated cement paste. The micro-
structure that forms upon hydration of cement consists of solids having pores of various 
sizes in addition to the spaces originally occupied by the water. The porosity depends upon 
the age, the degree of hydration, the water/cement ratio and the type of binders. The primary 
influence is of water/cement ratio, as depicted in Fig. C14.1.
Fig. C14.1  Dependence of Permeability on the Water Cement Ratio
According to Fig. C14.1, the permeability at water/cement ratio of about 0.4 or below is quite 
less; on the other hand, permeability increases asymptotically above water/cement ratio of 
0.6 or more. For a given water/cement ratio, the permeability is lower when blended cements 
or mineral admixtures are used than in case of OPC alone. This is due to blocking of pores 
due to formation of secondary hydration products, e.g. pozzolanic reactions of fly ash or silica 
fume with calcium hydroxide formed due to hydration of cement, or hydration of granulated 
slag activated and promoted by the calcium hydroxide.
The foregoing describes the intrinsic permeability of the concrete mix. Ingress of harmful 
elements is also facilitated by the cracking that may be caused by load effects or internal 



======================================================================

IRC:SP:105-2015
164
deformations like shrinkage or temperature effects. In order to limit ill effects of cracking 
the Code limits the crack width Table 12.1 under Clause 12.3.2, permissible for different 
exposure conditions.
Various other factors influencing durability are mentioned in this clause. Workmanship to obtain 
full compaction and efficient curing are important parameters. A suitably low permeability is 
achieved by ensuring thorough compaction of concrete and by adequate curing. The shape 
or design details of exposed structures should be such as to promote good drainage of 
water. Member profiles and their intersection with other members should facilitate easy flow 
of concrete and proper compaction. Chamfering the corners or using circular cross sections 
reduces the ingress of fluids. Use of half joints may be avoided, unless there are adequate 
provisions kept in detailing for drainage and for proper inspection and maintenance.
Regular maintenance provides the opportunity to intervene if deterioration is taking place at 
a rate greater than expected.
C12.2	
Common Mechanisms leading to Deterioration of Concrete Structures Cl. 14.2
Salient description of the mechanisms of deteriorations is included in Annexure B-2.
The basic mechanism of corrosion of steel, as an electro-chemical phenomenon, can be 
summarized in terms of an anode process and a cathode process;
 
● 
Anode: 
Fe → 2 e- + Fe2+ 
(Metallic iron)
 
● 
Cathode: ½ O2 + H2O + 2 e- → 2(OH)-
	
In addition, the corrosion undergone by steel is due to combination of iron and 
(OH-) ions;
 
● Fe + ½ O2 + H2O → Fe2+ + 2(OH) → iron hydroxide (rust).
The process is schematically depicted in the Fig. C14.2.1. It shows that ingress of chloride 
ions is facilitated by presence of cracks.
For transformation of metallic iron to rust, the requirements are;
	
1.	
Iron must be available in a metallic (Fe) state at the surface of the reinforcing 
steel;
	
2.	
Oxygen and moisture must be available for the cathode process;
 
3. 
The electrical resistivity of concrete must be low to facilitate the electron flow 
in the metal from anodic to cathodic areas.
From engineering stand point; two types of situations are necessary to be considered. The 
steel reinforcement, being well protected in the alkaline medium in concrete, can withstand a 
certain amount of chloride ions to be present before corrosion can take place. On the other 
hand, if the passivity is destroyed because of one reason or the other and the pH of concrete 
is below a certain threshold value, only oxygen and water are needed for corrosion to take 
place. Presence of chlorides is not necessary.

Fig. C14.2.1  Mechanism of Corrosion of Steel in Concrete – Schematic
Concrete constructions, in order to be durable, have to ensure that neither the limiting amount 
of chloride ions is exceeded in concrete nor the pH value of concrete is lowered below the 
threshold value. Practical limits of tolerable chloride ion concentration and limiting pH value 
are best arrived at by in-service record of concrete. The interaction shown in Fig. C14.2.2 
is based on data of a large number of concrete structures in India, which have undergone 
distress due to corrosion of steel (Mullick, 2000).
C12.3 
Designs for Durability
Cl. 14.3
The provisions for durability in this Section are essentially against corrosion of steel. Provisions 
for other mechanisms are either in terms of choice of the binder system (cements and mineral 
admixtures) or others measures described in Clause 14.4.
C12.3.1	
Classification of Exposure Conditions
Cl. 14.3.1
The first step is to establish the aggressiveness of the service environment (exposure 
conditions). In deciding the appropriate class of service environment, the following factors 
should be taken into account (fib, 2009);
 
● 
The general environmental conditions of the area in which the structure is 
situated,
 
● 
The specific location and orientation of the concrete surface being considered 
and its exposure to prevailing winds, rainfall etc.,
 
● 
Localized conditions such as surface ponding, exposure to surface run-off 
and spray, aggressive agents, regular wetting, condensation etc. These 
aspects include factors such as cladding to structure, or ponding due to poor 
detailing etc.

166
Carbonation is not significant when the pores of concrete are saturated, because of slow rate 
of diffusion of CO2 in water compared to that in air. On the other hand, if there is insufficient 
water in the pores, CO2 remains in gaseous form and does not react with the hydrated 
cement. The highest rate of carbonation occurs at a relative humidity of 50 to 70 percent 
(Neville, 2000).
‘Moderate’ category is for situations where the chances of carbonation are insignificant 
because the pores of concrete are either saturated or dry. No ingress of chloride from external 
sources is anticipated. Inadequate workmanship can lead to corrosion of steel. Provision is 
also made against attack by other deleterious chemical agents, which are facilitated by the 
presence of moisture.
‘Severe’ category is for situations, where presence of moisture (wet, rarely dry) and some 
carbonation under humid conditions can lead to corrosion of steel. Wet, rarely dry condition 
includes concrete surfaces subject to long term water contact and many foundations. Concrete 
exposed to coastal environment can have access to chloride ions increasing the risk of 
chloride-induced corrosion. Concrete components exposed to industrial waters containing 
chloride will be included in this category. Inspite of presence of significant amount of chloride 
ions in sea water, risk of corrosion of concrete completely submerged in sea water below 
mid-tide level is comparatively less because of paucity of oxygen.
‘Very severe’ category is for situations where exposure to air-borne chloride ions in marine 
environment adds significantly to the risk of chloride-induced corrosion. Saturated concrete 
subjected to cyclic freezing and thawing is prone to effects of expansion due to formation of 
ice, leading to spalling.
‘Extreme’ category is for conditions, where the risk of corrosion of steel and sulphate attack 
are the highest such as concrete exposed to tidal variations, splash and spray zones in sea, 
because of accumulation of salts in the pores and accompanied by damage due to wave action. 
Concrete in direct contact with aggressive sub-soil/ground water can lead to severe attack on 
concrete in foundations, without being accessible to periodic inspection and maintenance. If 
harmful effluents from nearby chemical industries are discharged into the water body, where 
the bridge is situated, it poses serious threat to the durability of concrete. Cyclic wet and dry 
conditions allow accumulation and build-up of deleterious elements. Example demonstrating 
classification of environment for a bridge structure is given at the end.
C12.3.2	
Durability Provisions
Cl. 14.3.2
In exposure to chloride-bearing environments, build-up of chloride ions inside concrete in the 
early ages is due to sorption, and due to diffusion in the longer term. Models for prediction of 
service life of concrete adopt the concept of age-dependent ‘effective diffusion coefficient’. Its 
value is initially high, reflecting the sorptive component, and reduces with time. The effective 
diffusion coefficient depends upon the type of cement, use of mineral admixtures and the 
water – binder ratio, and the degree of hydration of cement. Using values of effective diffusion 
coefficient, error function solution of Fick’s second law of diffusion has been adopted to 
predict rate of chloride ingress (Buenfeld, 1997).



======================================================================
PAGE 174 of 233
======================================================================

IRC:SP:105-2015
167
The strategy to guard against on-set of corrosion is to ensure that the amount of chloride 
penetrated after the design service life is less than the threshold level of chloride permitted, 
at the cover thickness.
Since the ingress of chloride is controlled by both the chloride diffusion coefficient and 
the surface chloride level, the defense against corrosion of steel in a particular service 
environment, as adopted in the Code, is integral of cover depth and water/cement ratio, the 
latter governing the chloride diffusion coefficient.
The cover requirements in Table 14.2 are from durability considerations related to corrosion of 
reinforcement alone. The requirement may have to be increased from other design/detailing 
considerations, for which reference shall be made to Sections 15, 16 and 17 of the Code. 
For Example, Clause 15.3.1.2 specifies the requirement of cover to post tensioned ducts. In 
case of other mechanisms of deterioration (e.g. sulphate attack, alkali silica reaction or frost 
attack) depth of cover is not important consideration.
To emphasize the need of adequate impermeability, ‘Acceptance Criteria’ for concrete in 
Clause 18.6.7 prescribes Rapid Chloride Ion Permeability test (ASTM C1202). In this test, 
the total electrical charge in Coulombs (ampere-seconds) passed during a specified time 
interval (6 hours) through a concrete disc specimen placed between solutions of sodium 
chloride (NaCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is measured, when a potential difference of 
60 V d.c. is maintained. The charge passed is related to the penetrability of concrete to chloride 
ions, charge being greater, the larger the amount of chloride ions penetrated. Guidelines 
relating chloride permeability of concrete to the charge passed (Coulombs) during the test 
are given in ASTM C1202.
The following upper limits for RCPT values at 56 days are suggested for different exposure 
conditions:
 
● 
Severe 
 
– 
1500 Coulombs
 
● 
Very severe 
– 
1200 Coulombs and
 
● 
Extreme   
– 
800 Coulombs
Apart from water - cement ratio and cover, Table 14.2 of the Code also lists two other 
parameters – minimum cement content and minimum grade of concrete. Minimum cement 
content specified is to ensure adequate workability of concrete. For a given water-cement 
ratio, a given cement content corresponds to a particular water content, which may result 
in high, medium or low workability. An appropriate value has to be chosen keeping in view 
the placing conditions, cover thickness, and concentration of reinforcement. For the values 
of water-cement ratio and cement content shown in the Table 14.2, the water content in the 
concrete mix works out to 140 to 160 liters/m3, which will generally result in low workability 
(0 – 50 mm slump). For higher workability, higher cement content (and higher water content, 
maintaining the water-cement ratio) will have to be adopted or chemical admixtures used. 
Minimum cement content, along with the water-cement ratio, is also required to result in 
sufficient volume of cement paste to overfill the voids in compacted aggregates. For crushed 
aggregate of 20 mm size, on which the Table 14.2 is based, the voids content is about 
25-27 percent. The values of water-cement ratio and cement content specified correspond 



======================================================================
PAGE 175 of 233
======================================================================
IRC:SP:105-2015
168
to paste volume of about 27-28 percent, equaling the voids content of the aggregate. A fuller 
description is available in IS:SP-23.
The Note(5) below Table 14.2 clarifies that minimum cement content should include all 
cementitious materials inclusive of additions mentioned in Clause 18.4, as all these binders 
comprise the paste volume with the water. Similarly, the water-cement ratio is water-binder 
ratio when mineral admixtures are added, which control the chloride diffusion coefficient.
The strength grade of concrete will be chosen from structural design considerations. Concrete 
mix design should be based on that strength grade (see Clause 18.5.3). Water-cement ratio 
and cement content arrived at the mix design for that grade should be checked with the 
provisions of Table 14.2. Lower water-cement ratio and higher cement content between 
the two should be adopted. Compressive strength of concrete alone does not guarantee 
durability under service conditions. The values of minimum strength grade in Table 14.2 are 
those which can be generally expected with the corresponding water cement ratio and with 
the cements or binders available in India. So, the minimum strength grade specified is an 
indirect control on the durability parameters.
Stainless steel reinforcement is now permitted, in line with practice in some countries for 
concrete structures exposed to very severe service conditions. Since there is no Indian 
Standard (IS) specification for stainless steel as concrete reinforcement, provisions of British 
Standard BS:6744:2001 shall apply (see Clause 18.2.3.3).
Conventional steel or timber formwork is essentially impermeable and traps the entrapped air 
and water that migrate towards the formwork during compaction. As a result, water/cement ratio 
in the cover zone is higher than in the bulk, and forms a weak link; having lower resistance to 
the ingress of air, water and CO2 etc. In comparison, controlled permeability formwork (CPF) 
liners act as a filter through which air and bleed water can pass and cement is retained. The 
passage of water and entrapped air from the concrete through the permeable formwork lining 
fabric results in a ‘local’ reduction in water/cement ratio at the formed concrete surface. This 
is schematically explained in Fig. C.14.3.2.2.

It has been reported that chloride diffusion coefficient of cover concrete can be reduced upto 
50 percent and service life prolonged with use of controlled permeability formwork (Mullick, 
2008).
For plain cement concrete, the chances of deterioration due to corrosion of steel are not 
significant, and as such the maximum water-cement ratio can be exceeded by 0.05 for each 
category and concomitantly the strength grade lowered by 5 MPa.
C12.3.2.1	Adjustments for other aggregate sizes
Cl. 14.3.2.2
If aggregate of larger size than 20 mm, is used, the requirement of water in the mix for a 
particular workability is reduced; so the cement content can also be reduced (to maintain the 
water-cement ratio).
C12.3.2.2	Chloride content
Cl. 14.3.2.3
The strategy to guard against onset of corrosion is to ensure that the amount of chloride 
at the level of reinforcement after the design service life is less than the threshold level of 
chloride permitted.
The threshold is best considered in terms of corrosion risk associated with different amounts 
of chloride ions present in the structures. The following risk classification has been proposed 
(Browne, 1982) and commonly accepted:
Chloride (% by wt. of Cement)
Risk of Corrosion
< 0.4
Negligible
0.4 to 1.0
Possible
1.0 to 2.0
Probable
> 2.0
Certain
The values in Fig. C.14.2.2 incorporating data of corrosion damaged concrete structures 
in India are of similar magnitude. Since the bridges will be designed for a service life of 
100 years, a conservative value of 0.30 percent for RCC in ‘moderate’ exposure condition is 
specified as against 0.40 percent in many other Codes. For RCC in other exposure conditions 
which are more stringent and for prestressed concrete, still lower values are specified. It may 
be noted that the amount of chloride ion specified is on ‘acid soluble’ basis, indicating the 
total chloride ion content in the concrete. Part of the chloride ions get bound in the cement 
hydration products; this is called ‘chloride binding’. Only the reminder is the free chloride, 
which is available for causing corrosion. This is expressed as ‘water soluble’ chloride and, as 
a very general guide, can be half of the total chloride content. Total acid soluble chloride is 
specified for ease of measurement.
C12.3.2.3	Sulphate content
Cl. 14.3.2.4
Cements contain sulphate added during manufacture. More sulphate ions may come from soil, 
sub-soil water and ground water, sea water and effluents from industrial sources. Excessive 
sulphate ions will lead to sulphate attack in concrete. Code therefore specifies the limit in 
terms of water soluble sulphate content.

Additional Provisions for Specific Mechanisms of Deterioration
Cl. 14.4
C12.4.1	
Corrosion of Reinforcement
Other than the measures as specified in Code, which may be adopted for preventing 
reinforcement corrosion, following additional measures are also practiced:
	
a)	
Bright metal sheathing duct (Clause 13.4.2) should be used only under 
‘moderate’ environmental conditions.
	
b)	
Use of cable pockets at the top of the deck shall be avoided from durability 
considerations.
C12.4.2	
Sulphate Attack
Cl. 14.4.2
The main reactions of sulphate attack on concrete are;
 
● 
Formation of sulpho-aluminates (ettringite) on reaction of sulphates with the 
calcium aluminate (C3A) phase of cement,
 
● 
Formation of calcium sulphate with reaction of sulphates with the calcium 
hydroxide released on hydration of cement.
	
	
Volumes of reaction products in both cases are greater than the volume of 
the reactants, for which there is no space in the hardened concrete. They 
result in expansion and spalling.

Magnesium sulphate reacts; in addition, with the main hydration product 
calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) phase, leading to its decalcification i.e. 
substitution of Mg+ for Ca+ and formation of magnesium silicate hydrates 
in place of C-S-H, and other expansive salts identified above. Magnesium 
sulphate thus formed is more dangerous than sodium or calcium salts.
The essential solution is in having cement with lower C3A content – as in sulphate resistant 
Portland cement (IS:12330). Use of blended cements (PPC or PSC) or mineral admixtures 
reduces the OPC component and thereby the amount of C3A available. Consumption of 
calcium hydroxide by pozzolanic reaction also helps.
C12.4.3	
Alkali-Silica Reaction
Cl. 14.4.3
Annexure B-2 lists the types of siliceous rocks in aggregate which may prove to be reactive. 
In India, siliceous rocks like granite, granite gneiss and schist, quartzite and sandstone, 
when containing ‘strained quartz’ have been found to be reactive (Mullick, 1992). Need of 
appropriate methods of evaluation of potential reactivity have been emphasized.
C12.4.4	
Frost Attack
Cl. 14.4.4
Freezing of water inside concrete due to low temperature is accompanied by 9 percent 
increase in volume (ice has specific gravity of 0.91). Repeated cycles of freezing and thawing 



======================================================================

have a cumulative effect. In hardened concrete, there has to be space to accommodate 
this increase in volume, otherwise cracking will occur. Air entraining admixtures create a 
system of small, discrete, nearly spherical air bubbles inside concrete, typically about 50 µ 
in diameter, i.e. much smaller than accidentally entrapped air due to inadequate compaction. 
These air bubbles provide the extra space needed. Obviously, if concrete is relatively dry, 
the problem of freezing of water is minimized; therefore, concrete is required to be protected 
from saturation. Lower water-cement ratio minimizes the volume of capillary pores inside 
concrete and ensures strength of concrete such that it can better resist the damaging forces 
induced by freezing (Neville, 2000). In case of severe freezing, restriction of water-cement 
ratio to about 0.45 and minimum strength of 45 MPa is recommended.
C12.4.5	
Abrasion
The compressive strength of concrete is the principal factor controlling the resistance to 
abrasion (Neville, 2000). The minimum strength required depends on the severity of abrasion 
expected. For members in contact with water having high velocity of flow and carrying abrasive 
bed material, concrete of higher grade may be necessary.
C12.5 
Example for Environmental Classification
To decide the exposure condition (Table 14.1) applicable to a bridge structure or its 
components, the chances of carbonation and availability of chloride ions should be taken 
into account. A bridge structure in dry climate or its parts constantly immersed in water will 
have less probability of carbonation corrosion. If no ingress of chloride ions or other harmful 
chemicals are anticipated, such components can be classified in ‘moderate’ category. If the 
ambient conditions are likely to cause carbonation and ingress of chloride ions or other harmful 
chemicals are expected, the classification can be ‘severe’ to ‘very severe’, depending upon 
the relative humidity and level of chloride ions, as described in Table 14.1. Classification 
under ‘extreme’ category is self-explanatory from Table 14.1.

CHAPTER 13
SECTION 15 : DETAILING : GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
C13.1 
General
Cl. 15.1
This Section pertains to general rules for detailing of reinforcement and prestressing, in 
particular. Modifications for coated steels are included in a separate clause. These rules 
are to be read along with the provisions of Section 16 and 17, which cover detailing for 
specific structural members and ductile detailing for bridges under Seismic Zone III, IV & V, 
respectively. The rules are for normal weight concrete only.
C13.2 
Reinforcing Steel
Cl. 15.2
C13.2.1	
Spacing of Bars
Cl. 15.2.1
The minimum limits are specified to permit concrete to flow readily into the spaces between 
bars and between bars and forms, without honey-comb and enabling adequate bond strength 
to be developed along the full length of the bar.
C13.2.1	
Permissible Mandrel Diameter for Bending of Rebars
Cl. 15.2.2
The recommended diameters for bars are given in Table 15.1 and 15.2 for avoidance of 
bending cracks and of splitting/crushing the concrete inside the bend. The diameters are 
higher for smaller values of concrete cover as well as higher grade of reinforcing bars. 
Table 15.1 is applicable for bent-up and curved bars - as applicable say for portal frames 
continuous beams or bent-up shear reinforcement in beams. This Table is not applicable for 
stirrups, link bars, loop bars etc., for which Table 15.2 is applicable.
C13.2.3	
Bond
Cl. 15.2.3
C13.2.3.1	Bond conditions
Cl. 15.2.3.1
The code describes the bond condition as “favorable” or “unfavorable” depending upon the 
depth of the member & inclination of the reinforcement with respect to direction of concreting. 
For “unfavorable” bond condition, the allowable bond stress is taken as 70 percent of 
allowable stress under “favorable” condition. The bond condition is to be always considered 
as ‘favorable’ for bars having an inclination of 45º to 90º to the horizontal. For bars which are 
horizontal or have inclination up to 45º to the horizontal, the bond condition depends upon 
depth of the member as indicated in the Fig. 15.1.b,  15.1.c and 15.1.d.
C13.2.3.2	Ultimate bond stress
Cl. 15.2.3.2
The ultimate bond stress is a function of type and condition of reinforcing bar, tensile strength 
of concrete (fctk,0.05), concrete cover, bar spacing & transverse reinforcement. The design 
value is to be taken as per Table 15.3 of the code for favorable bond condition. The bond 
stress increases uniformly till concrete grade M40 and almost at half the rate from M40 to 
M55 for plain bars. The increasing brittleness may be the reason for lesser rate of increase 
between M40 to M55. A comparatively sharp increase is however specified for grade M60 



======================================================================
PAGE 181 of 233
======================================================================
IRC:SP:105-2015
174
than for M55. The design value of bond stress is however restricted beyond M60 concrete to 
account for the increased brittleness.
C13.2.3.3	Basic anchorage length
Cl. 15.2.3.3
The basic anchorage length of a bar is obtained by assuming an average bond stress, equal 
to the ultimate bond stress, which acts over the full perimeter of the bar and uniformly along its 
length. The multiplication factor, ‘k’ for the anchorage length is tabulated for various concrete 
grades and for various grades of reinforcement bars, up to Fe 600.(Table 15.4).The basic 
anchorage length is based on the principle that it must avoid longitudinal cracking or spalling 
of the concrete.
C13.2.4	
Anchorage of Longitudinal Reinforcement
Cl. 15.2.4
C13.2.4.1	General
Cl. 15.2.4.1
The anchorage of bar shall be done in such a way that:
	
a)	
the bar is capable of developing the required stress and
	
b)	
the force in the bar is safely transmitted to the surrounding concrete without 
causing longitudinal cracks or spalling.
Generally, transverse reinforcement will be required in the anchorage zone to resist 
secondary forces induced locally. The same is usually available or provided in form of bars in 
perpendicular direction. Special attention to detailing is required where mechanical devices 
are used. It may be necessary to check their capacity to transmit the concentrated force by 
test.
C13.2.4.2	Anchorage methods
Cl. 15.2.4.2
Fig. 15.2 of the Code illustrates the methods of achieving the anchorage of reinforcing bar. 
Anchorage of HYSD bars in tension can be provided using any of the methods the type “b” & 
“c” is not allowed for plain bars. Also for plain bars straight anchor is permitted for bar up to 
8 mm diameter only. The Code also does not permit the use of length in bends or hooks for 
anchorage of bar in compression. For plain bars anchorage is traditionally with 180 hooks but 
these are probably missed in methods as the bars are seldom used now days.
C13.2.4.3	Design anchorage length
Cl. 15.2.4.3
The design anchorage length is obtained by allowing for the beneficial effects of actual cover, 
confinement by transverse reinforcement, transverse clamping pressure, shape of bent up 
bars besides the actual force in bar, expressed as ratio of required area to actual provided 
(normally less than 1.0). Anchorages of shear reinforcements or links are normally to be 
achieved by using bends, hooks or by welded transverse reinforcements as in Fig. 15.3 of 
the Code.
Use of welded bar for stirrup is a new addition in the Code. Also there is a change in the 
dimension of bends and hooks compared to previous practice.
C13.2.5	
Laps or Splices
Cl. 15.2.5
As the length of reinforcement bars is restricted and in many situations, likely to be less than 
the required length, splicing of bars will be necessary in most structural elements. Code 



======================================================================
PAGE 182 of 233
======================================================================

IRC:SP:105-2015
175
recommends splicing by lapping of bars, welding and mechanical devices. At laps, forces are 
transmitted from one bar to another through the concrete surrounding the lapped bars while 
others have a direct force transfer.
C13.2.5.1	Splices of bars by laps
Cl. 15.2.5.1
The rules are splicing of bars by lapping are detailed in this sub clause. Lapping of 
100 percent of bars is permitted with restrictions specified therein. The increased lap lengths 
are specified for various quantum of the bars to be lapped at a section, including 100 percent 
lapping. Reinforcement requirement across the lap is specified for various situations.
C13.2.5.2	Splicing by welding
Cl. 15.2.5.2
For HYSD bars, welding should be proposed only in special cases, when other alternative 
methods of splicing are not feasible. Bars of diameter greater than or equal to 20 mm must 
be butt welded. Welded splices have to comply with the rigorous requirements of the Code. 
C13.2.5.3	Splicing by mechanical devices
Cl. 15.2.5.3
A mechanical splice including its connecting element shall develop at least 125 percent of the 
characteristic strength, ‘fy’. This has been regarded as a minimum safety requirement for safety 
to prevent brittle failures. Field tests of samples from actual site supply are recommended. 
Reduced cover to concrete at the location of mechanical splice is permitted subject to a 
minimum cover of 30 mm.
C13.2.6	
Additional Rules for HYSD Bars Exceeding 32 mm in Diameter
Cl. 15.2.6
This clause specifies the additional rules for bar exceeding 32 mm which are complementary 
to those given in Clause 15.2.3. Such bars should only be used in elements where the 
member thickness is not less than 15φ. They should be anchored either as straight bars with 
links provided as confining reinforcements or using mechanical devices.
C13.2.7	
Bundled High Strength Deformed Bars
C13.2.7.1	General
Cl. 15.2.7.1
This clause specifies the special rules for bundled high strength deformed bars. The code 
allows bundling of a maximum of 4 bars in compression zone including laps and 3 bars in 
all other cases. All bars in a bundle must be of the same type and grade. This will ensure 
uniform deformation for the developed strain. Use of bars of same diameter is preferred but 
not mandatory.
C13.2.7.2		
Anchorage of bundled bars
Cl. 15.2.7.2
Bundled bars need elaborate detailing at anchorage points. These are detailed in this sub 
clause. Bar with equivalent diameter of 32 mm and more shall be staggered at the anchorage 
point in case the bar is in tension. For compression bars staggering is not required.
C13.2.7.3	Lapping of bundled bars
Cl. 15.2.7.3
Special considerations are required for lapping of bundled bars. Bars in a bundle shall 
generally be lapped one by one with a stagger, unless the number of bars in a bundle is 



======================================================================

IRC:SP:105-2015
176
restricted to two with equivalent diameter of less than 32 mm. For bundle with more number 
of bars or equivalent diameter more than 32, specific provisions of the sub-clause are to be 
followed.
C13.3	
Prestressing Units
C13.3.1	
Arrangement of Prestressing Tendon/Cable Duct
Cl. 15.3.1
This clause permits grouping of cables horizontally or vertically touching each other in the 
straight portion of the cables, subject to limitations given in Fig. 15.9 of the Code. The Code 
includes the provisions for pre-tensioning tendons.
C13.3.1.1	Post-tensioning systems
Cl. 15.3.2.1
Rules for use of couplers are now available in this sub-clause besides requirements of at 
end anchorages, intermediate anchorages and blister blocks. The requirements of residual 
compression at location of intermediate anchorages or additional reinforcement in lieu of 
it and cover to anchorages of 200 mm at local thickening or blister blocks are some major 
requirements. The guidelines for external tendons are not included in the Code. For this 
specialist literature may be referred.
C13.3.1.2	Pre-tensioning systems
Cl. 15.3.2.2
The code draws distinction between the transmission length (over which the prestressing 
force is fully transmitted to the concrete), the dispersion length (over which the concrete stress 
gradually disperse to a distribution which is compatible with assumption of plane sections 
remaining plane) and the anchorage length (over which the tendon force at the ultimate limit 
state is fully transmitted to the concrete). The design rules for these are included in the Code. 
Complete detailing of the anchorage zone is possible with these. Basic requirements for 
deviators for pre-tensioning systems are now available in the Code.
C13.4 
Coated Steels
Cl. 15.4
In case of fusion bonded epoxy coated bars the permissible bond stress shall be considered 
as 80 percent of the value given in the Code for uncoated bars while anchorage and lap 
lengths are 1.25 times. The galvanized and stainless steel bars treated same as normal 
reinforcement bars.

CHAPTER 14
SECTION 16 : DETAILING REQUIREMENTS OF STRUCTURAL MEMBERS
C14.1 
General
Cl. 16.1
This section gives additional rules for specific members including beams, slabs, columns, walls 
and some special elements such as corbels, deep beams, etc. Foundation detailing is not 
directly covered in this code, except for ductile detailing covered in Section 17. The foundation 
elements can be designed with corresponding clauses for other elements or reference shall 
be made to provisions of IRC:78 for foundation detailing. Minimum reinforcement specified 
in this section, for various elements ensures that when the moment of resistance of the 
un-cracked section is exceeded, the available reinforcement is at least able to provide a 
minimum moment of resistance which is at least as that of the gross concrete, so that sudden 
(brittle) failure is not initiated on cracking.
This section also recommends the minimum dimensions to be kept for various elements of 
bridge from practical considerations of constructability and workmanship.
C14.2 
Columns of Solid Section
Cl. 16.2
C14.2.1	
Sectional Dimensions
Cl. 16.2.1
Section with larger cross sectional dimension ‘b’ less than or equal to 4 times the smaller 
dimension ‘h’, is classified as column or pier. If the cross section is solid, it is termed as ‘solid 
column/Pier. In case the cross-section is hollow, it is termed as ‘hollow column/pier’. The 
columns are further classified as “pedestal columns” and “other columns” depending upon 
the le/i ratio (Refer Clause 11.2 for details). ‘Other columns’ include ‘long’ as well as ‘short’ 
columns.
For cross-section with b > 4h, the section is classified as ‘wall’.
C14.2.2	
Longitudinal Reinforcement
Cl. 16.2.2
The minimum percentage of longitudinal reinforcement, as specified for columns is to cater 
for un-intended eccentricities and to control creep deformations. Under sustained loads, the 
load is transferred from concrete to the reinforcement because the concrete creeps and 
shrinks. In case the area of reinforcement in a column is lesser than minimum specified 
percentage, the reinforcement may yield. The minimum percentage reinforcement therefore 
depends upon gross area of concrete and the design axial compressive force in column.
The maximum percentage of reinforcement in columns (4 percent outside lap portion and 
8 percent at laps) is chosen partly from practical considerations of placing and compaction 
the concrete and partly to prevent cracking from excessive internal restraints to concrete 
shrinkage caused by the reinforcement.
Salient detailing features of longitudinal reinforcement in “other columns” are as under:
 
● 
Minimum diameter, φmin ≥ 12 mm



======================================================================
PAGE 185 of 233
======================================================================
IRC:SP:105-2015
178
 
●  
Minimum area, As,min = 0.10.NEd/fyd, but ≥ 0.002 Ac
 
● 
Maximum area, As,max = 0.04 AC (= 0.08 AC at laps)
 
● 
Minimum number of bars in a Circular Section is 6
 
● 
For regular polygons, at least one bar is to be placed at each junction of two 
surfaces
C 14.2.3	 Transverse Reinforcement
Cl. 16.2.3
All longitudinal corner bars in compression should be enclosed within lateral ties to hold 
them in place and avoid its buckling. No longitudinal bar in a compression zone should be 
further than 150 mm away from a restrained bar. Transverse reinforcement is also required 
in columns to provide adequate shear resistance. Combination of various forms of ties/links, 
loops or spiral is allowed, as per choice of designer. Salient detailing features of transverse 
reinforcement in column areas under:
 
● 
All transverse reinforcement must be adequately anchored
 
● 
Minimum Diameter, φmin ≥ max [8 mm ; φlong/4]
 
● 
Maximum Spacing, Scl,max = min [12.φlong,min; h ; 200 mm]
C14.3 
R.C. Walls and Wall Type Piers
Cl. 16.3
Wall is defined as vertical load bearing member whose larger lateral dimension is more than 4 
times its least lateral dimension (Clause 7.6.4.1). In case a wall is subjected to predominantly 
out of plane bending (e.g. retaining wall, solid abutment or vertical of box structure), the 
provisions for slab are applicable for the said wall. In situations where a wall is also subjected 
to high concentrated load (e.g. plate type pier), the design and detailing may be based on 
strut-and-tie model or an appropriate FEM model.
C14.3.1	
Vertical Reinforcement
Cl. 16.3.1
Salient detailing features of vertical reinforcement in wall are as under:
 
● 
Minimum diameter, φmin ≥ 12 mm
 
● 
Minimum area, As,vmin = 0.0024 AC (minimum half at each face)
 
● 
Maximum area, As,vmax = 0.04 AC (At lap location specific percentage is not 
indicated in the Code but 0.08 AC may be permitted at laps with a cue from 
provision for column)
 
● 
Maximum spacing, Sv,max = 200 mm
C14.3.2	
Horizontal Reinforcement
Cl. 16.3.2
Salient detailing features of transverse reinforcement in wall is as under:
 
● 
Horizontal reinforcement shall be placed between the vertical reinforcement 
and the face of wall.
 
● 
Minimum diameter, φmin ≥ max [8 mm ; φlong/4]
 
● 
Minimum area, As,hmin = max [0.25 As,v; 0.001AC]

● 
Maximum Spacing, Sh,max = 300 mm
C14.3.3	
Transverse Reinforcement
Cl. 16.3.3
Where vertical reinforcement exceeds 0.02 AC, stirrups are required as for columns.
C14.4 
Hollow Piers/Columns
Cl. 16.4
In case of hollow piers/columns, following conditions should be satisfied:
 
● 
Largest overall dimension ≤ 4 times smallest overall dimension
 
● 
Ratio of effective length/radius of gyration ≥ 12
 
● 
Wall thickness ≥ 300 mm
 
● 
Two ends of the hollow section shall be capped by thick solid RCC slab 
having thickness ≥ 1/3rd the clear inside dimension of hollow section in the 
direction of spanning of slab and integrally connected to walls.
C14.5 
Beams
Cl. 16.5
C14.5.1	
Longitudinal Reinforcement
Cl. 16.5.1
C14.5.1.1	Minimum and maximum reinforcement percentage
Cl. 16.5.1.1
 
● 
Minimum long. tensile reinforcement :
 
● 
Asl,min = max. [0.26 (fctm/fyk) bt.d ; 0.0013 bt.d]
 
● 
Maximum long. tensile reinforcement :
 
● 
Asl,max = 0.025 AC other than at Laps
 
● 
Maximum total long. reinforcement, Ast,max = 0.04 AC
C14.5.1.2 Tensile steel in flanged section
Cl. 16.5.1.2
The total amount of tensile reinforcement Asl of a flanged cross-section (e.g. at intermediate 
supports of continuous ‘T’ beam) need not be within web but may be spread over the effective 
flange width of the beam section.
C14.5.1.3	Curtailment rules for longitudinal reinforcement
Cl. 16.5.1.3
This clause provides altogether different shift rules for curtailment compared to earlier practice 
for the length of the longitudinal tension reinforcement and anchorage in tension. Salient 
features of shift rule are as under:
 
● 
Sufficient reinforcement should be provided at all sections to resist the 
envelope of the acting tensile forces, including the effect of inclined cracks in 
webs and flanges.
 
● 
For members with shear reinforcement, the additional tensile force, ∆Ftd, 
should be calculated according to Clause 16.5.1.3 (2).
 
● 
For members without shear reinforcement ∆Ftd, may be estimated by shifting 
the moment curve by a distance al = d according to Clause 16.5.1.3 (3). 
This shift rule may also be applied as an alternative for members with shear 



======================================================================
PAGE 187 of 233
======================================================================
IRC:SP:105-2015
180
reinforcement, where al = z (cot θ – cot α)/2 = 0.5 z cot θ for vertical shear 
links.
 
● 
Depending upon the angle of strut considered in design, the value of ‘al’ can 
vary from 0.45 d (for θ = 45º) to 1.125 d (for θ = 21.8º).
 
● 
For reinforcement in the flange, placed outside the web, ‘al’ should be 
increased by a distance equal to the distance of bar from web face.
 
● 
The curtailed reinforcement should be provided with an anchorage length 
lb,net, but not less than ‘d’, effective depth from the point where it is no longer 
needed. The diagram of the resisting tensile force should always lie outside 
the envelop line of the acting tensile force, displaced as described above.
	
	
Fig. 16.2 of the code should be referred, which clearly explains the shift rule 
philosophy.
C14.5.1.4		
Anchorage of span reinforcement at an end support
Cl. 16.5.1.4
 
● 
Asb,sup bottom steel at support ≥ 0.25 times Asb,span, steel provided in the span. 
The code recommends that the bottom reinforcement should be anchored to 
resist a force of VEd x (al/d) + NEd, as defined in Clause 16.5.1.4 (2).
 
● 
The anchorage length is required to be measured from the line of contact of 
the direct support. Minimum length should be = 2/3rd/bnet.
 
● 
For indirect support, it is measured from a distance of1/3rd width of support 
from the face of support, beyond which a minimum length of &bnet should be 
provided.
C14.5.1.5	Anchorage of span reinforcement at intermediate supports
Cl. 16.5.1.5
 
● 
Asb,sup bottom steel at intermediate support ≥ 0.25 times Asb,span, steel provided 
in the span
 
● 
Anchorage length, l, ≥ 10φ for straight bars
 
● 
Anchorage length, l, ≥ dm for hooks and bends
 
● 
Continuous reinforcement is recommended at intermediate supports to resist 
accidental loads. However this does not mean that the intermediate support 
must have width greater than 20φ, as the bars from each side can be made 
continuous or lapped
C14.5.2	
Shear Reinforcement
 
● 
Shear reinforcement should form an angle of 45º to 90º w.r.t longitudinal 
member axis. It can be in the form of links or a combination of links, bent-up 
bars or assembly in the form of cage. At least 50 percent of the bars should 
be in the form of links.
 
● 
Though these recommendations are practicable for prismatic beams, it 
would be difficult to implement this clause in case of haunched beams, in 



======================================================================

which case the reinforcement shall be provided perpendicular surface of the 
element.
 
● 
Minimum shear reinforcement, ρw,min = 0.072 (fck)0.5/fyk
 
● 
Maximum longitudinal spacing of :
	
i)	
Links, Sl,max = 0.75d x (1 + cot α)
	
ii)	
Bent-up bars, Sb,max = 0.6d x (1 + cot α)
 
● 
Maximum transverse spacing, St,max = 0.75d ≤ 600 mm
C14.5.3	
Torsional Reinforcement
Cl. 16.5.3
 
● 
Torsion links need to be in form of closed loops.
 
● 
Provision of shear reinforcement in Clause 16.5.2 is generally sufficient to 
provide the minimum torsion links required.
 
● 
There should be at least one longitudinal bar at each corner of the torsion 
link. Others longitudinal bars need to be distributed uniformly along the inner 
periphery.
 
● 
Longitudinal bars within loop for torsion shall have spacing ≤ 350 mm.
 
● 
The limiting spacing of torsion links is u/8, where ‘u’ is the outer perimeter of 
the member and shall satisfy Clause 16.5.2 (7) as well.
C14.5.4	
Surface Reinforcement
Cl. 16.5.4
Skin reinforcement (or surface reinforcement) may be provided to control cracking and to 
ensure adequate resistance to spalling of the cover as in members with depth more than 
1 m or in situations where cover to reinforcement provided is more than the minimum cover 
required as per Section 14 of the code. This is also required in situations where bundled bars 
or bars of size greater than 32 mm have been used (refer 15.2.6 (10). In case of deep beams 
this reinforcement generally comprises of smaller diameter bars placed in the tension zone 
within the links. Other requirements are:
 
● 
Maximum spacing of the bars = 200 mm
 
● 
Minimum area of surface reinforcement, As,surf ≥ 0.01 Act,ext, where Act,ext is the 
area of cover portion outside the stirrups/links.
 
● 
The surface reinforcement may be taken into consideration as a part of the 
longitudinal bending steel or as link. Then it shall satisfy for the same saw 
well.
C14.6 
Solid Slabs
Cl. 16.6
The clause applies for members defined as slab i.e. span to thickness ration is equal to more 
than 5.
C14.6.1	
Flexural Reinforcement
Cl. 16.6.1
 
● 
Primary reinforcement – minimum and maximum areas as per provisions for 
beam.

● 
Curtailment, shear, torsion – as per provisions for beam, except that for the 
shift rule, al = d may be used.
 
● 
Secondary transverse reinforcement ≥ 20 percent of the main 
reinforcement.
 
● 
Maximum spacing of primary reinforcement - minimum of [2h, 250 mm], 
where ‘h’ is the overall depth of slab.
 
● 
Maximum spacing of secondary reinforcement: minimum of [3h, 400 mm].
 
● 
For slab that is part of flange of a beam, if primary slab reinforcement is parallel 
to the beam, 60 percent of span reinforcement in slab shall be provided at 
top over continuous support, unless quantum is specifically calculated. The 
detailing shall be as in Fig. 16.5.
C14.6.1.2	Anchorage of bottom main steel at intermediate support
Cl. 16.6.1.2
Provisions for beam are applicable for slab also.
C14.6.1.3	Reinforcement in slabs near end-support
Cl. 16.6.1.3
 
● 
Ass,sup bottom steel at support ≥ 0.5 Ass,span provided in the span. The code 
recommends that the bottom reinforcement should be anchored to resist 
a force of VEd x (al/d) + NSd, as defined in Clause 16.5.1.4 applicable for 
beams.
 
● 
The top reinforcement shall be capable of resisting 25 percent of the 
span moment in situations where partial fixity can occur but is ignored in 
analysis.
C14.6.1.4	Reinforcement at the free edges
Cl. 16.6.1.4
Along a free (unsupported) edge, a slab should normally be stiffened. Code specifies the 
requirements for edges along the traffic and across the traffic directions. For the former it is 
either in terms of specific resistance capacity or in form of the reinforced kerb of crash barrier. 
For the latter it shall be by ensuring the resistance capacity.
The edges not requiring carrying traffic not covered by earlier described conditions are to be 
detailed with suitable closing reinforcement comprising of transverse U-bars enclosing the 
longitudinal bars, as per Fig.16.6 of the code. The available slab bars shall be considered 
and detailed accordingly.
C14.6.2	
Shear Reinforcement
Cl. 16.6.2
Slabs requiring shear reinforcement should have a depth of at least 200 mm in order for the 
links to contribute to shear resistance. The general detailing rules for shear reinforcement are 
as for beams apply, except:
 
● 
In slabs if VEd ≤ 1/3 x VRd,max, all of the shear reinforcement may be provided 
either by bent-up bars or of shear assemblies.
 
● 
Maximum longitudinal spacing of bent-up bars can be increased to Smax = d
 
● 
Maximum longitudinal spacing of successive series of links is given by : 
smax = 0.75d (1 + cot α)

C14.7 
Corbels
Cl. 16.7
Two cases are covered for design of corbel using strut & tie method:
	
a)	
ac ≤ 0.5 x hc
	
	
In addition to the main reinforcement provided at the top of corbel (with total 
area of As,main), closed horizontal or inclined links (secondary tie bars) to be 
provided distributed within the depth of the corbel, where As,link > 0.25 As,main. 
Reinforcement shall be detailed as in Fig. 17. (a) or (c) of the Code.
	
b)	
ac>0.5 x hc
	
	
In addition to the main tension reinforcement, vertical links/stirrups are 
required where the shear force exceeds the concrete shear. Same shall be 
such that As.stirrup ≥ 0.5 x fcd/fyd. Reinforcement shall be detailed as in Fig. 17. 
(b) of the Code.
C14.8 
Articulations (Half Joints)
Cl. 16.8
Articulation (or half Joint) is usually provided in bridges at a connection where the construction 
depth is limited or in case of suspended span resting on tip of a cantilever. The treatment 
of articulation shall be similar to a corbel or a nib. The Code cautions to avoid edge stress 
concentration and to ensure rotation capacity.
C14.9 
Deep Beams
Cl. 16.9
A deep beam is a member whose span is less than 3 times the overall section depth. In bridge 
design, this will most frequently apply to diaphragms in box girder, cross girders between 
bridge beams etc. Specific detailing rules are included in the Code.
C14.10 
Members with Unbonded Tendons
Cl. 16.10
For the purpose of detailing, members with only unbonded tendons shall be treated the same 
way as reinforced concrete members. In case members are with a combination of bonded 
and unbonded tendons, requirements of bonded tendons will apply.
C14.11 
Concentrated Forces
Cl. 16.11
C14.11.1	 General
Cl. 16.11.1
The rules in this sub clause apply to zones where concentrated load acts in superstructures 
or substructures. The Eqn. 16.13 is derived from the confinement provided to the core by the 
surrounding concrete & supplementary reinforcement, whose perimeter is defined by ‘b2’ and 
‘d2’ in Fig. 16.9. The surrounding area resists transverse expansion of the core by acting in 
ring tension prior to spalling. The distribution of load should be such that adjacent areas do 
not overlap and the slope should not exceed 1H:2V.
The value of FR,du should be reduced if the load is not uniformly distributed on the loaded area 
Aco. Though no guidance is given in the code, the bearing pressure check could be based on 



======================================================================
PAGE 191 of 233
======================================================================
IRC:SP:105-2015
184
the peak pressure in case it is not uniform. Also in case shear force is less it can be ignored. 
For higher shear, the code recommends adoption of 3D – FEM analysis.
C14.11.2	 Zones Below Bearings
Cl. 16.11.2
 
● 
The minimum distance between the edge of the loaded area and edge of the 
section should not be less than 50 mm or less than 1/6th of the corresponding 
dimension of the loaded area.
 
● 
Additional sliding wedge mechanism needs to be checked to avoid edge 
sliding. The reinforcement needs to be provided parallel to the loaded face for 
a depth as indicated in Fig. 16.10 of the code. The amount of reinforcement 
is given by At fyd ≥ FRdu/2, which should be uniformly distributed over height 
‘h’ (Ref.1). The provided reinforcement needs to be suitably anchored, 
necessitating closed links.
C14.12 
Indirect Supports
Cl. 16.13
Suspension reinforcement needs to be provided where the load from the primary (supported) 
beam is transferred to the support indirectly through the cross (supporting) beam. Such 
provisions arise in situations e.g. where the bearings are not provided directly under the 
girder. In general suspension reinforcement will add to reinforcement for other effects.
C14.13 
Anchorage Zones for Post Tensioning Forces
Cl. 16.14
Anchorage zone is defined as a zone within which the concentrated forces of post-
tensioned anchorages disperse and spread over the full section of the prestressed structural 
element. Usually this zone in length is taken as equal to the larger of depth/width of the 
section (Ref.1).

CHAPTER 15
SECTION 17 : DUCTILE DETAILING FOR SEISMIC RESISTANCE
C15.1	
GENERAL
Cl. 17.1
These provisions are based on the current national and international practices. Seismic 
design and detailing are still evolving globally, making its codification an ongoing process. 
The bridge designers are therefore encouraged to refer to specialist literatures wherever 
required to augment the design and detailing practices.
The purpose of these design requirements for bridges in Seismic Zone III, IV & V are to 
ensure that the bridge substructures are provided with adequate ductility to ensure that the 
required overall global ductility of the structure is met and the plastic hinge formation is 
preferably within the substructure rather than at foundations, which is difficult to inspect and 
repair.
In order to ensure that plastic hinge is formed at pre-determined location in pier (generally at 
pier base), the Code allows curtailment of longitudinal reinforcement only in case of tall piers 
only after the designer ensures that the potential of formation of plastic hinge just beyond 
the point of curtailment is avoided. The Code however is silent on the definition of ‘tall pier’ 
for the purpose of this clause and reference may be made to other national/international 
standards/literature for the definition of tall pier in this regard.
C15.2 
Concrete Piers/Columns
Cl. 17.2
C15.2.1	
Confinement
Cl. 17.2.1
Requirements of this section are concerned with confining the concrete and providing 
increased lateral support to the longitudinal reinforcement in plastic hinge zone. The main 
function of the transverse reinforcement for confinement is to ensure that the axial load 
carried by the bridge pier after spalling of the concrete cover will at least be equal to the 
load carried before spalling & to ensure that buckling of the longitudinal reinforcement is 
prevented. Thus, the spacing of the confining reinforcement is also important.
C15.2.1.1	General requirements
Cl. 17.2.1.1
 
● 
Eq.17.1 gives the minimum axial stress in piers beyond which the confinement 
of the compression zone is required. The lightly loaded bridge piers having 
normalized axial force less than 0.08 times the capacity of concrete 
section (calculated without reinforcement) will not require confinement 
reinforcement.
 
● 
Eq.17.2 gives the required quantity of confining reinforcement, with the intent 
that spalling of cover concrete will not result in a loss of axial load strength 
of the column. This is defined in the form of mechanical reinforcement ratio. 
ωwd in Eq. 17.2 is also referred to in Eq. 17.5 & 17.7.



======================================================================

IRC:SP:105-2015
186
C15.2.1.2 Minimum confining reinforcement
Cl. 17.2.1.2
 
● 
For rectangular stirrups and cross-ties, the minimum design confining 
reinforcement (ωwd) is greater of two values given in Eq.17.5. The second 
term in the Eq. 17.6 is applicable in case the % vertical reinforcement 
in pier is more than 1 percent. In case the percent reinforcement is less 
than 1 percent, this term can be ignored in the calculation. The minimum 
reinforcement condition is to be satisfied in both directions. For circular 
sections, the minimum confining reinforcement provided by hoops/spirals 
determined as higher of two values given in Eq. 17.7.
 
● 
The value of ωwd is larger for circular sections since the circular sections do 
not have lateral ties. In rectangular sections, there are numbers of lateral ties 
which are anchored in central core concrete.
C15.2.1.3	Spacing of ties/hoops/spirals
Cl. 17.2.1.3
The requirement that spacing of hoops or ties shall not exceed one-fifth of the minimum 
member dimension for rectangular sections or one-fifth the diameter of concrete core for 
circular sections is prescribed to obtain adequate concrete confinement.
The requirement that spacing of hoops or ties not to exceed five times the smallest longitudinal 
bar diameter is intended to prevent buckling of longitudinal reinforcement after spalling.

C15.2.1.4	Length of potential plastic hingeso
Cl. 17.2.1.4
This section stipulates the minimum length of potential plastic hinge zone and minimum 
length beyond the plastic hinge zone over which closely-spaced transverse reinforcement is 
required to be provided within the member. This is based on normalized axial force, ηk.
C15.2.2	
Buckling of Longitudinal Compression Reinforcement
Cl. 17.2.2
Once the cover concrete in the plastic hinge zone spalls due to several hysterics of the 
seismic action, the longitudinal bars are prone to buckling. The transverse reinforcement 
shall be adequate to prevent this buckling by providing transverse reinforcement at spacing 
not exceeding 5 times the smallest diameter of the longitudinal bars.
C15.2.3	
Other Rules
Cl. 17.2.3
Due to loss of concrete cover in the plastic hinge zone as a result of spalling, proper anchorage 
and careful detailing of the confining steel is required for its effectiveness.



======================================================================

IRC:SP:105-2015
188
Lapping of longitudinal reinforcement with dowels is also strictly prohibited within plastic hinge 
region, generally at the column base, where plastic hinge is likely to form. This is because 
the splice occurs at the location where requirement of bond is critical. Further, lapping at 
the base is likely to stiffen the base and shift up the plastic hinge beyond the lapping region, 
thereby increasing the seismic demand.
C15.2.4	
Hollow Piers
Cl. 17.2.4
 
● 
Dimension b/h as shown above for rectangular hollow pier shall not exceed 8 
in the plastic hinge region. In case of hollow circular piers, the ratio di/h shall 
not exceed 8, where ‘di’ is the inner diameter of the hollow pier.
 
● 
No confinement is necessary in case the normalized axial force, ηk ≤ 0.2. 
However the requirement of controlling buckling as per Clause 17.2.2 is 
required to be met.
C15.3 
Foundations
Cl. 17.3
C15.3.1	
General
Cl. 17.3.1
It is desirable that inelastic response in strong ground shaking occurs above the foundations, 
as repairs to foundations can be extremely difficult and expensive. Code does not allow 
foundations to enter within plastic range under design seismic action, except for pile foundation 
in unavoidable circumstances. This is generally ensured by:
	
a)	
Designing the foundation for 25 percent additional base shear on account of 
seismic action (as specified in IRC:6-2010), so that the weakest link is within 
the pier or at the pier base (capacity protection).
	
b)	
Ensuring adequate ductility at the plastic hinge location by proper detailing 
and confinement for pile foundations as hinge formation is allowed if 
unavoidable.
C15.3.2	
Pile Foundation
Cl. 17.3.2
In situations where it is not possible to ensure hinge formation at the pier base in any direction 
(e.g. in case of plate type piers), it may not be possible to avoid localized hinge formation in 
the pile foundation due to seismic loads. In such cases, ductile behavior of the piles shall be 
ensured by following measures:
 
● 
Treat the following locations in pile for potential plastic hinge :
	
	
Top of pile
	
	
Location of maximum bending moment
	
	
Interface of soil layers with marked difference in shear deformability



======================================================================
PAGE 196 of 233
======================================================================

IRC:SP:105-2015
189
It is to be understood that for a pile which is fixed at top with pile cap, there can be two 
locations where plastic hinge may form at the time of collapse and therefore will require 
confining reinforcement at all such locations to ensure large deformation without failure. 
These locations are generally the top of pile and location of second peak bending moment 
at intermediate level. The scour level or fixity point below scour level can be likely locations. 
In situations, where the sub-strata is such that there is an interface of soil layers with marked 
difference in shear deformability which shifts the location of second peak bending moment 
at the intermediate level, the plastic hinge is likely to form at this interface in addition to top 
of pile.
 
● 
Provide confinement reinforcement at pile top, along a vertical length equal 
to 3 times the pile diameter if a large pile group prevents the rotation of pile 
cap.
 
● 
In case the pile is analyzed by approximate method (e.g. equivalent cantilever 
method as per IS:2911), confinement reinforcement is also required to be 
provided for a length of two times the pile diameter on either side of the point 
of second peak maximum moment in pile at intermediate level (other than at 
pile head).
 
● 
In case more accurate analysis using soil-structure interaction is adopted for 
pile foundation design (e.g. using soil springs), confinement reinforcement 
needs to be provided at the top of pile where bending moment is maximum 
as well as any other locations where peak moments occur.

SECTION 18 : MATERIALS, QUALITY CONTROL AND WORKMANSHIP
C16.1 
General
Cl. 18.1
This section deals with the material properties and specifications for procurement of 
Reinforcement, Prestressing Steel and Concrete.
It is important to note that although, primarily these are specified in terms of the Indian 
Standards governing these materials, they are not limited to the same. If the materials used 
in the design conform to other countries’ codes, they can be used as long as they meet the 
minimum specifications of the BIS Codes. For materials where BIS Codes are not available, 
other Codes are specified.
The Code makes it clear that for assessment of properties of materials in existing bridges, 
the standards and specifications prevailing at the time of construction of the bridge only are 
to be considered.
In the following explanatory part only the noteworthy points are discussed, since the Code 
is very clear on the aspects of specifications for procurement. For items which involve site 
fabrication or design and making and placing concrete, detailed guidelines are given.
C16.2 
Untensioned Steel
Cl. 18.2
C16.2.1	
Products with Improved Corrosion Resistance
Cl. 18.2.3
There are many methods in use for providing additional protection against corrosion. The 
acceptable methods to the code are:
	
a)	
Using galvanized steel
	
b)	
Using stainless steel
	
c)	
Using epoxy-coated re-bars
Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. Suitability or otherwise of these 
methods in a particular case is not commented upon by the Code. Discretion of the user is 
implied for adopting.
Other available techniques such as Cathodic Protection are outside the scope of the Code.
C16.3 
Prestressing Steel
Cl. 18.3
C16.3.1	
Coated Wires/Strands
Cl. 18.3.1
Prestressing steel is susceptible to stress corrosion due to high level of stress as compared 
to the reinforcing steels. The prestressing steel is also susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement 
in aggressive environments. Hence, it requires to be adequately protected. For bonded 
tendons, the alkaline environment of the grout provides adequate protection. For unbonded 
tendons, corrosion protection is provided by one or more of the following methods.

Material Ingredients of Concrete
Cl. 18.4
C16.4.1	
Chemical Admixtures
Cl. 18.4.2
Natural or manufactured chemicals are often added to the concrete in the form of admixture, 
before or during mixing. The most used admixtures are air-entraining agents, water reducers, 
retarders and accelerators. It is a general knowledge, not specifically required by the Code, that 
Admixtures shall be evaluated for compatibility with the cementitious materials, construction 
methods and job specifications before being used.
C16.4.2	
Mineral Admixtures
Cl. 18.4.3
Mineral admixtures are finely divided siliceous materials which are added to concrete in 
relatively large amounts, generally in the range of 20 to 70 percent by mass of the total 
cementitious material. These materials are generally by products from other processes or 
natural materials. They are also sometimes referred to as “supplementary cementitious 
material”. Though there are several types of mineral admixtures which are available for use, 
the code permits use of fly ash (by product of coal fired furnaces), ground granulated blast 
furnace slag (non-metallic manufactured by product from a blast furnace) and silica fume (by 
product from the manufacture of silicon or ferro-silicon metal) only.
C16.5	
Grouting
Cl. 18.7
C16.5.1	
Properties of the Grout
Cl. 18.7.4
The main properties considered relevant for the performance of grouts in post-tensioned 
concrete structures are :
	
a)	
The flowability of grout: This is considered important to ensure complete 
filling of the tendon duct.
	
b)	
Volume change of grout: This is considered important to be maintained 
within a specified range around zero to completely fill the tendon duct.
	
c)	
Bleed of grout: It is considered important to limit free water inside the tendon 
duct, and any bleed water to be reabsorbed by the grout within a specified 
time.



======================================================================
PAGE 199 of 233

d)	
Strength of grout: This is considered to provide an indication of the grout 
quality with respect to its bond and shear strength.
	
e)	
Resistance of grout to freezing: This is considered important for applications 
in cold climates. Since there is no mention of this in the Code, specialist 
literature may be followed in situations where such condition exists.
C16.5.2	
Load Tests of Structures
The situations under which load testing of flexural members of abridge structure would be 
resorted to are -
	
a)	
Structures which are sub-standard due to quality of design or construction.
	
b)	
Deterioration of structures, due to material degradation or physical damage.
	
c)	
Non-standard design methods which may cause the designer, authorities or 
other stake holders to have proof of the concept used.
For members other than flexural members (e,g. Corbels, Deep Beams …etc.), where stress 
– strain relationship is not linear, the acceptance should preferably be based on analytical 
investigation.

CA1-1 
General
A1-1
This annexure gives details of the nature of actions, basis of their classification and the 
philosophy adopted for deciding the design values of actions. Various values of actions like 
characteristic values, design values and combinational values are explained with special 
reference to design of concrete bridges, where they differ from other types of bridges. The 
explanations are along with some of the clauses of Sections 3 & 5, as these also deal 
on same subject matter. Hence corresponding clause numbers are referred to, whenever 
necessary.
CA1-2 
Classification of Actions
A1-2 
Actions are of two types viz. direct and indirect actions. The actions (loads) such as self-weight, 
superimposed dead load, carriageway live load, footpath live load and wind load etc. are 
directly applied to the structure and hence they are termed as direct actions. Indirect actions 
are those which are generated in the structure due to imposed deformation by settlement, 
temperature or seismic accelerations. Thus indirect actions are generated actions. Actions 
can be represented in a diagram as given below:
Fig. 1-A1-1
Direct and indirect actions can be further classified as permanent and variable actions. Direct 
actions which are always present in the structure are termed as permanent action, e.g. Self-
weight, Superimposed dead load, Back fill weight, Earth pressure, Prestress effects etc. 
Actions, which vary with respect to time are treated as variable actions e.g. Carriageway 
live load, Footpath live load, Wind, Thermal action etc. Snow load, even though it varies

with respect to time, is treated as direct permanent action. Settlement effect, which falls 
under the category of indirect action, is termed as permanent action as the settlement effect 
becomes permanent, once the settlement takes place. Thermal effect which also falls under 
the category of indirect action will be termed as variable action as it can vary with respect 
to time. Thus it can be seen that some indirect actions fall under the category of permanent 
action and some under the category of variable action. Semi-permanent (Quasi permanent) 
actions are certain fractions of variable actions which are likely to be present in the structure 
at all the time, e.g. some fraction of thermal effect.
In addition, there are two more variable actions viz. Accidental action and Seismic action. 
Accidental actions are those actions, of which the occurrences themselves and their periodicity 
cannot be predicted. These are actions which the structure may or may not be subjected to 
during its life time, exemplified by barge impact and vehicle collision with the parts of the 
bridge. Accidental action is direct variable action. Accidental actions caused by explosions 
are special cases, which is not covered by IRC:6, hence not included in the Code.
The seismic action shall be considered as an indirect variable action as the forces are 
generated in the structure due to ground acceleration.
Representative Values of Actions
Cl. 3.1.3
Values of actions used within a particular combination of actions take account of low probability 
of more than one action having their characteristic values at the same time for determining 
the representative value. It also takes account of reduction in likely maximum value of an 
action, if considered over periods of less than the design life.
Characteristic Value of Actions
Cl. 5.4.2
Characteristic value of an action is based on nature of load and statistical distribution of 
magnitudes of action. It could be mean value, upper fractional or lower fractional value or a 
nominal value. Upper and lower characteristic values commonly correspond to 95th and 5th 
percentiles. When statistical distribution is not adhered to, a nominal value is specified which 
is treated as characteristic value. For permanent action which varies very little about its mean 
value, the characteristic value corresponds to the mean value, which is a single value. In 
cases where the design is expected to be sensitive with respect to variations in the density 
or thickness or time dependent losses in case of prestressed concrete, then the values are 
defined as lower case and upper case values, referred as ‘inferior’ and ‘superior’ values. The 
‘inferior’ and ‘superior’ values of actions are generally given as a multiple of characteristic 
value. For variable actions, the characteristic value shall correspond to:
	
–	
an upper value with an intended probably of not being exceeded or
	
–	
a lower value with an intended probably of being achieved during a reference 
period or
	
–	
a nominal value
The values given in the code corresponds to nominal value since these are not fixed on 
statistical basis. It has been fixed based on acquired experience.

CA1-3 
Design Situation & Load Combination
Cl. 15.4.2.2
	
1)	
A structure, during its construction and service life is acted upon by various 
actions at different times. These actions, which can act simultaneously, 
need to be combined in order to verify the safety of structure. The design 
situations & combinations specified in the Code will give rise to 9 primary 
combinations. The same are explained in detail under sub clause, “Limit 
states to be considered” subsequently. 
	
2)	
All variable actions such as live load, wind, temperature etc. do not act at their 
peak values simultaneously at the same time. Hence, when these actions are 
to be combined, a reduction factor needs to be applied to scale down their 
peak values. While combining several variable actions, one variable action 
shall be treated as the leading variable action and all other variable actions 
shall be treated as accompanying variable actions. It will be for the designer 
to choose the leading variable action. As an example, if the carriageway live 
load is taken as leading variable action in a combination, then, thermal action 
or wind action shall be considered as accompanying variable action and the 
combination factors shall be taken accordingly. For the next trial, the thermal 
action can be taken as leading variable action and the carriageway live load 
shall be considered as accompanying variable action. While combining, 
various variable actions, the leading action shall be assumed to act at its 
peak and all other actions are to be scaled down in all combinations, except 
in frequent combination where the combination factor has also to be applied 
even to the leading action, in order to convert the characteristic action to 
frequently occurring action. The reduction factors which are used to scale 
down the peak values while combining are called combination factors. The 
product of combination factor and characteristic value of action is called 
combination value of an action, Qk, ψ0Qk or ψ1Qk or ψ2Qk. It is made clearer 
that combination factors are to be applied only on variable actions.
Partial Factor for Actions
A1-3
The partial factor is used for enhancing the combination value of actions (loads) for verifying 
the ultimate limit state. The partial factor consists of two factors γs and γD. γs is the partial factor 
for taking into account the uncertainty in modeling the effect of action, which is considered 
as 1.15 for permanent actions and 1.1 for variable actions. γD is the partial factor for taking 
in to account the possibility of unfavorable deviation of action, which is considered as 
1.17 for permanent actions (load) and 1.36 for variable actions (load). Hence the partial 
factor for a permanent action (load) will work out to 1.15 x 1.17 = 1.35 and for a variable 
action 1.1 x 1.36 = 1.50.
A word of caution, that enhancing the permanent loads is to be done only when it causes 
unfavorable effect (adding to the effects of variable action). In case it causes favourable effect 
(opposing the effects of variable action) then the permanent action shall not be enhanced 
by partial factor. For example, this situation will happen in continuous structure or while 
establishing factor of safety.



======================================================================
PAGE 203 of 233
======================================================================
IRC:SP:105-2015
196
For the verification of serviceability limit state and accidental combination, the partial factor 
on actions shall be taken as 1.0 only i.e. the actions shall not be enhanced. For prestressing 
action, the partial factor will vary under different conditions, for which Clause No. 7.9.5 of the 
Code shall be referred to. The factors γs and γD are from other International Codes as there 
are no data available for these factors.
Combinations of Actions and Combination Factors
As explained earlier, the variable actions and permanent actions acting simultaneously are 
to be combined in to order to carry out the verification of Limit States. When actions are to 
be combined, the reduced values of variable actions are to be used in order to arrive at the 
probable severity of the effects as all the variable actions do not act at their peak values at 
the same time. Combination factors are to be used on the variable actions in order to arrive 
at the characteristic combination (basic combination) value or infrequent combination value 
(rare combination) or frequent combination value or quasi permanent combination value of 
variable actions from the nominal values.
Partial Factor for Actions Given in IRC:6
A1-1
The partial factor for actions given in Annex.-B of IRC:6-2010 includes both the combination 
factor and partial factor for variable actions. This means that partial factor given in the code 
for variable action = Partial Factor for Variable Actions X Combination Factor for Variable 
Actions i.e.γ, x (ψ0 or ψ1 or ψ2). Hence, the partial factor as specified in the code only needs 
to be applied. The philosophy of combination factor is given herein only for the understanding 
of the engineers. As the combination factor is not applicable for permanent actions the partial 
factor for permanent action does not include the combination factor. The use of these partial 
factors given in the code is explained in the worked out examples where they are shown in 
the brackets.
CA1-4 
Limit States to be Considered
There are two types of limit states which are to be satisfied i.e. Limit state of Strength (ULS) 
and Limit State of Serviceability (SLS).
Under ULS, strength and stability are to be ensured under three limit state combinations i.e. 
Basic Combination, Accidental Combination & Seismic Combination.
For checking the equilibrium of super-structure and sub-structure, and structural strength 
different load factors are specified for different set of load combinations, for which Table 3.1 
and 3.2 of Annex-B of IRC:6 shall be referred. For checking of equilibrium of foundation 
and for base pressure check of foundation, reference shall be made to IRC:78. Table 3.4 of 
Annex-B of IRC:6 shall be referred for structural design of foundation under ULS.
Under SLS; stress, deformation, crack width, settlement, creep and shrinkage effects are to 
be checked. For checking the serviceability limit state 3 combinations will be made use of. 
Cl. 15.4.2.2
	
1)	
Rare Combination
	
	
This combination is used to check the maximum stress levels in structure 
for a rare load combination and load values, which is expected to occur 
infrequently on the structure.



======================================================================
PAGE 204 of 233
======================================================================

IRC:SP:105-2015
197
	
2)	
Frequent Combination
	
	
This combination of loads and load values is expected to occur frequently 
and therefore is used to check crack width in case of prestressed concrete 
structure and deformations in case of both R.C.C and Prestressed Concrete 
Structures.
	
3)	
Quasi Permanent Combination
	
	
This combination is used to evaluate the settlements, creep effects, permanent 
stresses in the structure and to check crack widths in case of reinforced 
concrete structure. This combination provides an estimate of sustained loads 
on the structure.
All permanent loads and a fraction of variable loads which will be present at all times will be 
combined to arrive at this combination.
Verification of Limit States:
Cl. A1-4
The variable actions are to be combined with permanent actions keeping in mind that all 
variable actions do not attain their peak values simultaneously at the same time and are to 
be combined appropriately to verify.
	
1)	
The static equilibrium; overturning, sliding, uplift for Basic, Accidental and 
Seismic combinations.
	
2)	
The structural strength under ultimate state for Basic, Accidental and Seismic 
combinations.
	
3)	
The serviceability limit states for Rare combination, Frequent combination 
and Quasi permanent combination.
Thus 9 primary combinations of actions have to be checked to complete the design. There 
can be several sub combinations. The necessary checks required to be carried out under 
ultimate limit state and serviceability limit states are detailed under relevant chapters.
Worked Examples
Partial factors are taken from IRC:6-2010. The examples will illustrate the methods to carry 
out the stability checks and to work out the disturbing and stabilizing forces/moments for the 
various combinations.
8.1 
Stability Check: To Check the Stability of the Structure: Example 1:
	
Overhang Beam - Stability Check
 
Self-weight of member g 
= 
15 kN/m
 
Concentrated Dead Load G = 
6 Kn
	
Live Load

The structure can overturn with respect to B
Overturning Moment = (1.05) x 15 x 
 + (1.05) x 6 x 3 + (1.50) x 9 x 
 
= 70.87 + 18.9 + 60.75 = 150.52 kNm
Restoring Moment = (0.95) x 
 = 144.28 kNm
	
144.28 kNm< 150.52 kNm
Structure overturns and hence unstable. To make it stable either reduce the cantilever length 
or reduce the concentrated load or provide anchoring at A.
Example 2:
Retaining Wall:
Fig. 2  Details of Retaining Wall
1) 
Overturning Check
	
Overturning moment (for unit length) about A
 
Earth pressure moment = (1.50) x  x 17 x (4.3)3 x 0.33 x 0.42 = 140.50 kNm
 
Moment of due to surcharge = (1.2) x 10 x 0.33 x 
 = 36.61 kNm
 
Total overturning moment = 140.50 + 36.61 = 177.11 kNm
Restoring moment (for unit length) about A
 
Raft = 
25 x 0.6 x 3.8 x 3.8/2 = 108.3 kNm
 
Wall = 
25 x 3.7 x 0.4 (0.8 + 0.2) = 37 kNm
 
Fill = 
17 x 3.7 x 2.6 x 2.5= 408.9 kNm
 
Total Restoring moment = 108.3 + 37 + 408.9 = 554.2 kNm



======================================================================

Reduced moment = (0.95) x 554.2 = 526.49 kNm
	
526.49 kNm > 177.11 kNm
	
Hence the structure does not overturn.
2) 
Sliding Check 
	
Sliding check (for unit length)
 
Horizontal force due to Earth pressure = (1.50) x  x 0.33 x 17 x 4.32 = 78.00 kN
 
Horizontal force due to Surcharge = (1.2) x 10 x 0.33 x 4.3 = 17.00 kN
 
Total Horizontal force = 78.00 + 17.00= 95.00 kN
	
Vertical Force:
 
Self-weight = 2.5 x 3.8 x 0.6 + 25 x 3.7 x 0.4 = 94 kN
 
Soil Load = 17 x 3.7 x 2.6 = 163.4 kN
 
Total Vertical Load Per Unit Length = 94 + 163.4 = 257.4 kN
 
Taking friction coefficient as 0.5
 
Resisting forces = (0.95) x 257.5 x 0.5 = 122.3 kN
	
As 122.3 kN> 95 kN
	
Hence the structure will not slide.

It is to be noted as the dead load effects oppose the live load effect, the 
partial safely factor 1.0 has been used for dead load moment
 
iii) 
Maximum (-) moment of Mid-Point of AB = {1.35 (-9 + 4.21) – 1.5 x

As the dead load effects add to effect of live load effect the partial safely

Thus it can be seen that at first the bending moment has to be calculated 
with the actions and then the partial factors to be chosen to arrive at the 
moment for the different combinations.

Calculation of Design Bending Moments in a Continuous Beam:
Example 1:

Dead Load = 30 kN/m

4)

5) 
Live Load – moment at Mid span AB 
= - 0.025 x 52 x 18 = - 11.25 kNm
6) 
Live Load – moment at support B

CHAPTER 18
INFORMATIVE ANNEXURE  B-1 CONCRETE SHELL ELEMENTS
C-B-1 
Introduction 
The Annexure gives detailed method of design of shell element. As explained in Section 9, 
the shell element is subjected to eight number of force resultants. This method is generally 
applicable when the analysis is performed using finite element method. The internal actions 
in a shell Element at ULS are Sketched in Fig. C-B-1.1.
Fig. C-B-1.1  Shell Element
The method is similar to Wood-Armer’s method popularly used method in the past. In 
this method, it is firstly verified whether the element is cracked using Eqn. B-1-1. If the 
element is uncracked, the only verification required is to check that minimum principal stress 
(i.e. maximum compressive stress) does not exceed the design compressive strength fcd. 
If the element is cracked, the Annexure gives procedure to find out the required reinforced 
reinforcement.
A sandwich model is used to convert out-of-plane moments and twisting moments into stress 
resultants acting planes of the top and bottom layers. The core/middle layer is designed to 
carry the out of plane shear force.
After determining the in-plane forces in the outer layers as per the Section-9, verification at 
ULS is to be performed adopting the sandwich model for Shell Elements. The procedure is 
demonstrated with the help of worked example.

CHAPTER 19
ADDITIONAL EXPLANATIONS ON SECTION 7 : ANALYSIS
A.1 
Introduction
This additional chapter giving Explanatory Notes and Guidelines for the application of 
‘Section 7: Analysis’ of the Code is arranged differently from the discussion of other sections. 
The need arises from the fact that the Clauses of Section 7 assume substantial knowledge 
of the analytical methods on part of the designer. In order to explain the requirements of the 
Code Clauses it is useful to have general background of the classical as well as the modern 
methods of analysis.
This overview is necessary for another important reason. The users of the Code and the 
Explanatory Handbook are the practicing engineers belonging to different age groups. They 
have received their basic education at different times in which period, many new developments 
in the methods of analysis have taken place. An Element of ‘Continued Education’ for 
Engineers of senior and middle level of experience is thus unavoidable. 
The present is a period of transition in which many design offices and individual designers are 
switching over to the automated and computerised, analytical and design tools. These tools 
allow use of more realistic models representing the behaviour of structures and materials 
than the models suitable for hand analysis. 
The analysis of bridge components require application of the appropriate classical, modern 
or computerised analytical methods for calculating response of the components, when are 
subjected to different loading conditions. The methods for doing so are covered in the Code. 
These methods are further explained in an introductory manner in this Chapter. For the 
full treatment of any of these methods refer text books, advanced literature and instruction 
manuals of the computer programmes performing such analysis. 
A.2 
Classical Methods of Analysis 
A.2.1 	
Essence of Classical Methods of Analysis
The classical methods are developed in last 150 years. Hallmarks of the classical methods 
are:
	
●	
Simple and idealised representation of structural elements, support conditions 
and loads. 
	
●	
Equilibrium of external loads and support reactions as well as equilibrium of 
external load effects with internal forces developed in the structural elements 
due to elastic deformation of the material i.e. satisfying the requirements of 
equilibrium condition.
	
●	
Use of linear elastic constitutive laws describing the response of materials, 
i.e. providing constitutive laws of materials describing stress-strain 
characteristics.
	
●	
Assumption of consistent deformations of elements constituting the structure 
i.e. satisfying Kinematical relations, or compatibility of geometry in deformed 
shape.



======================================================================
PAGE 219 of 233
======================================================================
IRC:SP:105-2015
212
	
●	
Use of continuum mechanics under these conditions to formulate general 
equations describing the response of the structure subjected to loads.
	
●	
Finding exact or approximate mathematical solutions of these general 
equations, which in turn allow computation of reactions, deformed shape 
and internal stresses and strains.
Many of the real life materials and structures do not fully comply with the simplified assumptions 
made in the classical solutions. However, till recently the limitations of the hand calculations 
hampered use of more realistic structural models. 
A.2.2	
Use of Mathematical Analysis
The application of mathematical methods to solve engineering problems is developed in 
the last 180 years. Some of the basic laws, such as the Hook’s laws of linear elasticity, 
(AD 1660), were established earlier. However, the beam theory of Euler-Bernoulli, developed 
in AD 1750, can be considered as the beginning of the present day mathematical analysis 
of structures. Methods of the science of ‘Strength of Materials’, and ‘Applied Mechanics’, 
developed based on the growing knowledge about the laws of equilibrium of forces acting on 
bodies as a whole (rigid bodies) and elastic behaviour of linear members like columns and 
beams subjected to axial, bending and torsional forces, together with the laws describing 
behaviour of structural materials. These methods were suitable for hand analysis. Many of 
these are still being regularly used by bridge engineers, as exemplified by the techniques of 
‘equilibrium of joints’ and ‘method-of-section’ used in design of trusses.

213
The Beam Theory of Euler-Bernoulli expresses the behaviour of elastic beam having small 
deflection. Fig. A.1 shows a rather simple mathematical representation (model) of the real 
life beam by its geometrical central axis, assuming that its deflected shape under action of 
transverse load is described by a continuous curve, shape of which is determined by the 
deformation of the cross-section of beam itself. It is further assumed that the cross-section 
deforms in such a way that the sections originally at right angle to the central axis remain at 
right angle to the deflected curve at all points. The internal strains developed by this deformed 
shape produce internal set of resisting forces, which provide equal and opposite internal 
couple to resist the bending moment generated by the external load. The internal stress-
strain relationship is assumed to be linearly elastic following Hook’s law. Fig. A.1 shows this 
basic mathematical approach, which uses the method of equilibrating external forces and 
internal resistance forces acting on part of the beam taken as a free body. Use of ‘free body 
diagram’ is another classical technique still being commonly used for local analysis. The 
deformations induced in the cross-section by shear forces are dis-regarded in this analysis, 
resulting in acceptably small under estimation of deflections. The solution of the differential 
equations describing the deflected shape using mathematical methods provide the deflected 
shape, strains and stresses induced in the beam. Thus, the use of mathematical tools to 
solve engineering problem came into practice. This approach is described in some details 
here since it contains in essence all the elements of mathematical methods of analysis. Euler 
Bernoulli’s beam theory is still the most commonly used method by engineers, even when 
more rigorous methods have been developed.
Advanced theories for linear members like beams/columns and for two and three dimensional 
structures like plates and shells, using principles of continuum mechanics and using simple 
constitutive laws for materials were developed by Timoshenko and others. Timoshenko’s 
general beam theory is shown in Fig. A.2 for comparison. These general methods also 
account for the effects of shear strains and are also applicable to short beams, in which 
the shear mechanism play significant role in load transfer. The generalised equations of the 
theory are valid for members exhibiting large deflections of the mid surface (Article A.6.1). 
These methods assume homogenous material characteristics having linear relationship 
linking various types of stress and strains in the three directions which are described by 
different modulii of elasticity and Poisson’s ratio. For details reference is made to the text 
books on this subject.
A.2.3	
Saint-Venant’s Principle
One of the most significant finding known as St. Venant’s principle made it possible to 
apply the methods of continuum mechanics to practical structures. The assumptions about 
the distribution of internal strains and resulting stresses in the general portion of the three 
dimensional body where no local external forces act, are not valid in the near vicinity of the 
load, where they are affected by the way in which the loads are applied to the structure. 
However, the Saint-Venant’s Principle states that (Quoted from Timoshenko and Goodier 
from Book ‘Theory of Elasticity).

214
Fig. A.2  Timoshenko’s Beam Theory 
‘If the forces acting on a small surface of an elastic body are replaced by another statically 
equivalent system of forces acting on the same portion of the surface, this re-distribution 
of loading produces substantial changes in the stresses locally but has negligible effect on 
stresses at distances which are large in comparison with the linear dimension of the surface 
on which the forces are changed.’ 
This knowledge makes it possible to apply the overall general solutions of structures which 
include portions of locally applied loads without vitiating the overall analysis of the structure, 
except in the local zones in the near vicinity of the loads or supports. In other words, the

215
overall evaluation of the internal stresses is substantially reliable and can be used in practical 
designs. However, the knowledge of the internal strain and stress distribution in the near 
vicinity of external forces is essential for the proper design of these local portions. This 
requirement is met by the methods of ‘Local Analysis’. 
A.2.4	
Importance of Sign Convention
A.2.4.1	
Sign Convention Guided by Understanding of Physical Effects
Following consistent sign conversion for describing physical quantities in various stages of 
analysis and interpreting results using the same signs is useful, but not vitally important 
as long as the direction and sense of the physical effect could be directly understood. The 
use of rigorous sign convention can even be avoided, as illustrated by different practices of 
assigning signs to bending moments. Treating bending moments as sagging or hogging for 
beams under gravity loads or treating moments causing sagging of members inwards of the 
closed section as positive for elements forming closed sections or the practice of plotting the 
bending moment on the tension side of the member are the methods based on the physical 
understanding and variously used in the same design without causing confusion or miss 
interpretation. Mathematically rigorous sign conventions are not essential in any of the above 
three practices.
A.2.4.2	
Sign Convention as a Mathematical Necessity
As now-a-days the mathematical methods of analysis are used, a consistent sign convention 
becomes unavoidable, even for the methods suitable for hand calculation. Association of 
positive/negative signs before the numbers representing opposite physical effects, such as 
directions of opposite forces or compressive/tensile strains etc. becomes necessary. One of 
the most commonly used sign convention, which has been used by Timoshenko in his work 
on theory of elasticity is shown in Fig.A.3.
Fig. A.3  3-Dimensional Orthogonal Co-ordinate System following Right Hand Rule
A.2.4.3	
Conventions used in two Dimensional and three Dimensional Plates and Shells
The Plates and Shells are three dimensional structures. In the theory of elasticity, some of the 
commonly met shapes like domes (surfaces of revolution) have exact solutions available for 



======================================================================

IRC:SP:105-2015
216
some simple loading conditions. Many other shapes, like cylindrical shells, have approximate 
solutions which can be accepted and safe structures can be designed using engineering 
judgement and experience. For applications where such structures are required (e.g. fish 
belly type cross-section for super-structure) the Code has suggested a general method in 
the Informative Annexure B1: Concrete Shell Structures. For such applications this or other 
specialised text books or literature may be referred to. Strict adherence to the sign convention 
is vitally important in such analysis. 
A.2.4.4	
Use of Varying Sign Conventions and Precautions
Mathematical methods require use of internally consistent sign conventions within the 
analysis, but these conventions are not necessarily the same in different methods of analysis. 
The designer must be wary of what these signs represent in the analysis in relation to the 
signs being followed in his design process. The best precaution to avoid blunders is to try 
and understand the overall deformations of the structure and the deflected shapes of the 
members obtained in the analysis and compare the same with individual’s own perceptions. 
A.2.4.5	
Further Developments in Methods of Analysis
Classical methods of static and dynamic analysis have developed over large number of 
years. The exact closed form solutions of the differential equations of the theory of elasticity 
are available only for a limited number of simplified structural elements and loading patterns. 
Therefore, many simplified, but sufficiently accurate methods for engineering applications 
have been developed. A review of these methods is outside the limited scope of this Chapter. 
Numerical techniques such as finite differences have general applicability in such cases, but 
these are fairly cumbersome to use.
Many other solution techniques suitable for hand analysis having special applications have 
been developed. ‘Moment Distribution’ method of Hardy Cross and its further generalisations 
using step-by-step relaxation method are suitable for indeterminate frame structures with 
and without sway. A number of ‘Strain energy’ methods were developed. Method of Three 
Moments, Conjugate Beam Method and Column Analogy are some of the other normally 
used methods. The powerful ‘Slope Deflection’ method developed in this era could be fully 
exploited only after advent of computers with application of ‘Matrix Algebra’ to deal with the 
large number of unknowns and equations. 
A.2.4.6 
Simplifications Introduced in methods of Analysis
Simplification of mathematical models is of great help to designers. Some of the simplifications 
commonly used in the analysis of bridges are mentioned bellow: 
A.2.4.6.1	 Two Dimensional representation in longitudinal and transverse directions
Analysis of structures idealised as if they are lying in one plane simplifies the understanding 
of behaviour, the sign conventions, as well as the mathematics of analysis itself. However, 
the real life structures have three dimensional geometry, and the effects in the out-of-plane 
direction (such as buckling) should not be lost sight of while using the two dimensional 
approximations.

217
A.2.4.6.2	 Simplified Analysis of Plates for deck-slabs, webs of deep beams and box 
sections
Plates, which are two dimensional elements but are subjected to three dimensional loading, 
are very commonly used in bridge engineering. Many simplified methods of analysis involving 
acceptable loss of accuracy have been developed. 
A.2.4.6.3 Simplification of loading
Most of the real life loads are complex in nature. The codes use simplified loads which 
produce more or less equivalent effects on the structure to that of complex loads. The use 
of uniformly distributed load in combination of single point load to represent actual effects 
of vehicular live loads was used earlier by the British Codes. In comparison, the currently 
used hypothetical train of axle loads are more difficult to use. The train of loads specified in 
Appendix of IRC:6 were developed by NATO countries for the military use. The present live 
loads used by Eurocodes are developed based on the number surveys carried out in Europe 
using statistical methods of stochastic analysis.
A.2.4.6.4 Simplification of dynamic effects
Use of Impact Factor to increase the static value of traffic load to produce equivalent dynamic 
loading of vehicles travelling at high speed is the well known example. Also use of static 
wind pressure steadily applied on the structure in place of real life dynamically applied time-
varying wind pressures for bridges which are not dynamically sensitive to wind loading, is 
also common. 
A.2.4.6.5	 Seismic Effects 
The Indian Standards are using simplified static inertial loads to calculate dynamic effects of 
Design Basis Earthquake, (DBE). Static ‘Equivalent Forces’ based on ground acceleration 
and natural period of vibration of the structure are used together with static linear elastic 
analysis in place of dynamic non linear analysis by reducing inertial forces by response 
reduction factor. 
A.3 
Modern Methods of Analysis
A.3.1	
General
It may be understood that the theory of elasticity does not properly predict the behaviour 
of reinforced concrete structures near their ultimate state of strength. This is due to the 
prominent non linear behaviour of concrete in compression, effects of cracking and plasticity 
of steel. 
New methods are developed in the last 60 years or so, based on the knowledge about the 
plastic behaviour of materials and resulting ductility of structural elements. These methods 
require more complex mathematical methods of analysis. However, their application in 
practice is simplified by tools like design charts and computerised algorithms. 
A.3.2 
Classification of Methods of Analysis
The different types of analysis are classified as per the constitutive laws of materials used in 
the analysis and whether the equilibrium of the structure is evaluated based on the original 
geometry of the structure (first order analysis) or based on the deformed geometry (second

order analysis). Variously used idealised constitutive laws for stress-strain and moment 
curvature relations for uniaxial relationships are shown in Fig A.4. This usage has led to the 
following self-descriptive definitions:

First order non-linear analysis
	
	
Structural analysis, performed on the initial geometry, that takes account of 
the non-linear deformation properties of materials
	
	
This type includes different types of non-linearity such as a continuously 
varying stress-strain relation, bi-linear stress-strain relation with elastic 
branch followed by second linear branch with strain hardening or having 
perfect plasticity (e.g. reinforcing and prestressing steels). These are shown 
in Fig. A.4.
	
(5) 	 Second order non-linear analysis
	
	
Structural analysis, performed on the geometry of the deformed structure 
that takes account of the non-linear deformation properties of materials as 
listed in type (4) above.
	
(6) 	 Rigid, fully plastic analysis, first or second order
	
	
In the ultimate state of some of the materials (e.g. steel) the contribution 
of elastic phase to the total deformations is small and can be neglected for 
simplifying the calculated response in the analysis as shown in Fig. A.4. This 
method is not applicable for concrete structures.
A.3.3 
Applicability of modern non-linear and plastic methods in bridges
The present trend in bridge design is to use different types of analyses for calculating different 
types of responses for different design situations (load combinations), even for the same 
bridge elements. For example, while overall analysis of an element is elastic, the sectional 
design is based on elasto-plastic methods. The use of various methods is described in

A.3.4 
Applicability of theory of plasticity to concrete structures
Theory of plasticity was developed for analysis of steel structures since steel exhibits large 
plastic deformations before failure, both in tension and compression. This theory can be 
applied to reinforced concrete structures provided that the plastic strains on compression side 
are large enough to permit formation of plastic hinges/yield lines, which allows redistribution 
of internal resisting forces while satisfying the new static and/or kinematical equilibrium 
conditions. The concrete section also needs to be ‘not-over-reinforced’ to the extent of not 
allowing steel to enter the plastic zone on tension side. 
A.3.5 
Strut and Tie Models
The code permits use of strut and tie models for local analyses. However, in any situations 
of loadings the possible number of solutions being very large, it is difficult to predict the 
most likely solution that will evolve in practice. It is advisable to develop model which is a 
logical development of the elastic phase into plastic stage as load increases. It should also 
be kept in mind that the idealised elasto-plastic diagram is not a true representative of the 
real behaviour. In reality the diagram exhibits a declining arm after reaching peak, and this 
behaviour puts practical limits on exploiting the plasticity fully, if the redistribution calls for 
mobilising strains beyond this peak.
It is relevant to mention here that in case of concrete corbel, highly non-linear strain distribution 
exists at re-entrant corners where effect of the declining arm may seriously reduce the 
capacity of plastic solutions. Such corners should be avoided in practice, thus minimising the 
stress concentrations, unless more rigorous analysis or testing of the experimental corbels 
is carried out.
A.4 
Combination of Global and Local Effects
A.4.1 
Global Analysis 
This method is used for the overall analysis of the bridge structure. It consists of determining, 
in a structure, a consistent set of either internal forces and moments or stresses that are 
in equilibrium with a particular defined set of actions on the structure. The internal sets of 
forces depend on geometrical, structural and material properties. One of the commonly used 
applications is box girder super-structure, where the box cross-section may be treated as a 
line member.
A.4.2 	
Local analysis
Results of global analysis are valid in all parts of structure, except in local zones such as 
points of application of concentrated loads including support reactions, areas of discontinuity 
like openings in structural members and joints/connections of members at locations other 
than geometrically smooth transitions where sharp changes in the flow of stresses are 
involved. The Saint-Venant’s Principle described earlier assures that the effects of these 
disturbances in the structure are strictly local and limited in their extent. The stresses at 
some distance away from these disturbances get back to the original state without vitiating 
the global analysis.

This principle allows considering equilibrium of a small part of the structure considering the 
equilibrium of a free body containing the disturbance, but having its boundaries sufficiently 
away at locations where the original stress distribution is as by the global analysis. In hand 
analysis this distance is taken as the depth of the element. A generalised method of analysis 
for such cases is to use the computerised analysis. Alternatively, other types of local analysis 
based on non-elastic methods or those using theorems of plastic analysis like strut and tie 
method are used where the normal elastic methods become unusable. One of the examples 
of such local analysis is idealisation of box girder super-structure into a transverse slice of 
unit width for load effects in the transverse direction.
A.4.3	
Combined global and local analysis
In global FEM analysis the local disturbances can be included as a part of global geometry 
with refined finite element mesh surrounding the disturbance to yield distribution of rapidly 
changing local stresses as a part of global analysis. Similarly, in the case of box girder 
super-structure results of global analysis and local (transverse direction) analysis are 
algebraically added to get the total design forces.
A.5 
Computerised Analysis and Computerisation of Design Process 
A.5.1 
Development of digital computers and use of numerical solutions, Matrix 
Algebra and applications to Dynamics 
The availability of large capacity computers, small enough to be put on table tops in hands of 
designers, has revolutionised the computing capacity in design offices.
The slope-deflection method was developed by classical theorist. It involved setting up a 
number of linear equations connecting deformations of members at its end with the set 
of forces acting at its end by the members’ stiffness or flexibility. The full rigidity (or full 
flexibility) of connections of such members enforced common deformations on members 
(or the individually separate deformation of fully flexible members). In case of partial fixity, 
the members can be connected by springs with required spring constants. Solution of such 
set of linear equations, which numbered the same as the number of unknowns, provides a 
unique solution to the structural deformations and forces. This method had limited application 
in practice due to the fact that the number of unknown increase very rapidly as the number 
of members and connections increase and the solution for each loading case has to be 
separately obtained. This was inspite of the availability of the mathematical tool of Matrix 
Algebra. 
However, with the advent of digital computers the situation changed dramatically. 
It became, not only possible but even simpler to solve the large sized frames, once the 
computer programmes for use of Matrix methods were developed. Many other types of 
indeterminate structures such as members of varying dimensions, two and three dimensional 
elements such as plates and shells etc. could be solved using various numerical techniques. 
Most significant development of finite elements took place based on the ability to solve the 
mathematical equations.

222
Even the non linearity of the material properties, and geometric non-linearity of structural 
response (i.e. second order effects) could be analysed using numerical techniques.
The otherwise un-solvable equations involved in the field of dynamics could be solved using 
step-by-step static solutions by small time steps and integration of the same to represent 
dynamic process. The meaningful earthquake analysis of structural response became 
possible.
However, this development has increased the need for designers to be more knowledgeable 
about the basic mathematical methods and to become proficient in their application, while 
using commercially available softwares. It is even more important to be aware of their 
strengths and limitations.
A.5.2	
General observations
The large size of memories of present day computers are capable of dealing with very large 
number of unknowns arising from the large number of compatibility requirements, thus 
increasing the ability to find mathematical solutions for arbitrarily defined shapes, support 
conditions and loadings. However no solution can be more accurate than the accuracy of the 
data and the extent to which the assumptions made in the solution techniques are valid. It is, 
therefore, important to understand the basic theory and assumptions underlying the methods 
used by the computer programme. 
Further more, computers are also being used to make design choices in addition to analysing 
the structure. However, indiscriminate use of automated procedures, both for analysis and 
design has a few major flaws, including amongst others;
	
(1) 	 Creation of false sense of accuracy. Since the computer can calculate with 
equal accuracy solutions based on correct models as well as those based 
on the unrealistic models, the accuracy of solution depends on the use of 
correct model.
	
(2) 	 It is not possible to improve the characteristics and behaviour of basic element 
(liner or multi dimensional) to take into account more refined properties of the 
same than the constitutive relations built-in in the programme.
	
(3) 	 The mechanical use of software to obtain black- box solutions is not conducive 
for imbibing in the designers a physical feel of the behaviour of structures 
and structural materials, unless special efforts are taken to understand the 
same.
	
(4) 	 In the computerised analysis large amount of data is required to be prepared 
as input data and the mistakes are difficult to detect.
	
(5) 	 The process of carrying analysis is totally programme-driven and mechanical. 
The results are arrived at without the computer having any intelligent 
understanding of what it is doing and why. Whether the results look reliable 
or appear to be not- so- right in an engineering sense is to be judged by the 
user.

All this is known, but inspite of the difficulties and risks, computerised analysis is a very useful 
tool, if properly deployed and properly interpreted. The most important care to be taken in the 
analysis is the totally correct use of the signs in input data and the correct interpretation of the 
output. Since these sign conventions are programme - specific it is essential for the user to 
become fully familiar with the same before starting their use. This is specially required for using 
programmes originally developed for primary use in mechanical engineering applications for 
the civil engineering applications. Usually these are very advanced programmes and through 
familiarity with the methods, limitations as well as sign conventions is a pre-requisite. 
A.5.3 
Use of Finite Element Methods
The above discussion is especially true for using techniques of ‘Finite Element Methods’, 
(FEM). The assembly of finite elements should be examined visually or plotted as a hard 
copy for all structures to insure correct assembly of the elements. However, it should be 
remembered that the apparently identical looking twin- image shown by the assembly of 
Finite Elements does not correctly represent all properties and all behaviours of the structure 
of whose mathematical model it represents. The validity and accuracy of any output is decided 
by the properties of the finite element (i.e. shape functions) used and their suitability to 
represent the primary and secondary structural behaviour. For example, a 3-D solid element 
using compatibility of translational (u, v, w) deformations only at nodes cannot represent, at the 
element level, the effects of angular rotations and bending moments. For full understanding 
of the capabilities and limitations of various elements used in a specific programme reference 
shall be made to the specialist literature.
A.5.4 
Computer Aided Designs
While using commercially available software as design aid it is necessary to be aware of the 
basic requirements of the code for which the programmes supplying design aids are written. 
If the same are different from the IRC codes being used (either old versions or the current 
version), these design aids cannot be used for the purpose of verification (i.e. to demonstrate 
the acceptability of the design). 
A.6 
Theories of Small Deflection, Large Deflection and their Applicability for 
Bridge Structures
A.6.1 
Theories of small and large deflection
For many types of structures only limited deflections are acceptable in order to meet the 
functional and serviceability requirements. In other words, the complete structure and its 
structural elements should be sufficiently stiff i.e. non-flexible. It is found that for such structural 
elements the equilibrium of external forces and internal resisting forces need not be calculated 
on the basis of the deflected shape after loading by 2nd order analytical methods, but can be 
established with acceptable level of accuracy based on its geometry before loading (i.e. 
first order analysis). On the other hand, some of the structures may meet the requirement 
of stiffness of the structure as a whole, but some of its elements/members are more flexible 
and their stabilised deflected shape (i.e. their deformed shape) under action of load has to

224
be taken in to account for calculating the overall equilibrium of the structure and load shared 
by the flexible elements/members. 
The theory in which sufficiently accurate equilibrium between the load and resistance is 
established, based on the original unloaded geometry is termed as a theory of small 
deflections. This definition appears subjective and not mathematically precise but is enough 
to make a judgement about applicability and use of one or other type of analysis. 
A.6.2 
Applicability for Bridge Structures
The theory of small deflections provides the basis for most of the analytical work needed in 
bridge engineering with notable exceptions of second order analysis needed for analysis and 
design of slender members, which may be required in normal types of bridges having tall 
piers. This analysis is covered in the Code in Section 11: ‘Ultimate Limit State of Induced 
deformations’.
The analysis based on the theory of large deflections is needed for special types of bridges. 
The suspension and cable stayed bridges and large span arch bridges belong to this type. 
Suspension cable of the suspension bridges can only be analysed based on its deflected 
shape. The stiffening girders carrying load may be designed on the basis of the theory of 
small deflections, but the overall stability under localised live loads also has to be based on 
the large deflections.
The cables of cable-stayed bridges and the cables of extra-dosed bridges belong to an 
intermediate category depending on their geometry and length. However, at least for the 
construction stage analysis they have to be treated as highly flexible elements. 
The IRC:112 on its own does not cover all design requirements of such elements. However, 
the Code can be used for such designs in combination with the help from specialised literature 
and/or international codes.
A.7 
Prestressed Members and Structures
IRC:112 has covered prestressing in six sections. The global effects of prestressing on 
structures including its time dependent variations are covered in Section: 7 ‘Analysis’; the 
design properties are covered in Section: 6 ‘Material Properties and their Design Values’; the 
local effects, such as spalling and bursting behind anchorages and the technological aspects 
are covered in Section: 13 ‘Prestressing Systems’; Sections: 15 and 16 cover detailing and 
Section: 18 covers ‘Materials, Quality Controls and Workmanship’. 
Although various methods of considering prestressing in the analysis and design have been 
used in the past, the Code requires in Clause 7.9.2 that:
“General
	
(1)	
Prestressing is considered as an action and its effect should be included in 
the forces/moments and applied to the structure.
	
(2)	
Prestressing force is time-dependent. Its magnitude also varies from the 
intended value due to technological reasons. Both the effects should be 
considered in selection of design prestressing force.

(3)	
The contribution of prestressing tendons to the resistance developed by the 
member shall be limited to the additional forces mobilised by their further 
deformations, consistent with the ultimate deformation of the member.”
In view of the above, discussion in this Chapter is restricted to the evaluation of ‘Prestressing 
Action’ as a load due to prestressing. The appropriate methods of analysis are to be used for 
obtaining the action effects. 
A.7.1 
Concept of Prestressing as a Load
Historically, prestressing was developed in era of the ‘working load/allowable stress’ philosophy 
of design. Its target was to increase the capacity of concrete members to carry tensile loads 
without cracking, allowing the optimum use of materials in which the stiffness from cracked 
concrete need not be neglected. The prestressing of a structural member in this way may 
be defined as the creation of an initial stress of opposite sign to the stress produced by the 
working load, in order to increase the working load without increasing the actual stress in 
the member. The most logical way to achieve this is to apply opposite force as a pre-load, 
which is created by prestressing. For prestressing to be most advantageous, it is therefore 
necessary that the working load should act mainly in one direction and the creation of initial 
stress of opposite sign is achieved by prestressing. In theory it is not essential that pre-
loading is achieved by stressed steel tendons anchored to the structural member although 
it turns out to be the most convenient method, especially after steels of high strength having 
adequate residual force after accounting for relaxation loss were developed.
However, it should be remembered that achievement of enhanced working load capacity does 
not automatically ensure sufficient safety margin under Ultimate Limit State. For Instance, 
in case of unbonded tendons, which do not undergo large increase of force under factored 
ultimate load, the required margin of safety cannot be provided by prestressing tendons and 
it needs to be achieved by other means.
The force in the tendons is transferred to the structure at all points of contact between the 
two. At all locations the force on the structure is equal and opposite of the force acting on the 
tendon. At location of anchorages force equal to locking force acts along the direction of the 
tendon. A curved tendon pressing against the structure transfers pressure equal to T/R where 
T is the local tensile force in tendon and R is the radius of curvature at that location. For a 
circular profile it represents a constant radial pressure along the tendon profile. For a parabolic 
profile it is equivalent to uniformly distributed load, since 1/R = constant for the parabola. For 
moderately flat profiles this is easily calculated by dividing the change in vertical component 
between two points of the tendon by the length of the horizontal portion in between.
