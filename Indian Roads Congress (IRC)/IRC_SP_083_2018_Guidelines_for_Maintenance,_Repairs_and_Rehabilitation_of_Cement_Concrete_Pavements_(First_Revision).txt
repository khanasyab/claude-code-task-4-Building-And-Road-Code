GUIDELINES FOR MAINTENANCE, REPAIR AND REHABILITATION  
OF CEMENT CONCRETE PAVEMENTS
1 INTRODUCTION
1.1	
Concrete Pavements also known as Rigid Pavements have a relatively long service life, 
provided these are properly designed, constructed and maintained. With mega projects like National 
Highway Development Project (NHDP), Special Accelerated Road Development Project (SARDP), 
and Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) the pace of concrete pavement construction 
has increased recently. This is because concrete pavements are economical in life cycle cost and 
known to perform better with minimum maintenance. The concrete pavement can serve upto its 
design service life and even beyond if timely repairs are undertaken. Load transfer mechanism 
of the concrete pavement is through beam action and accordingly the concrete pavements are 
expected to perform relatively better than flexible pavements on weak sub­ grades, as these can 
bridge small soft or settled areas of sub-grades. The concrete pavement performance in high rainfall 
areas is found better than flexible pavement due to high resistance to water penetration. Similarly 
in hilly terrain, concrete pavement is able to resist impact load and abrasion due to braking and 
acceleration in a better way than flexible pavement. Design of concrete pavements is fundamentally 
governed by the flexural strength instead of compressive strength because the wheel load causes 
the concrete slab to bend which induces bending stresses. Therefore the critical stresses are flexural 
stresses rather than the compressive stresses in the concrete pavement. IRC:SP:83, “Guidelines 
for Maintenance, Repair and Rehabilitation of Cement Concrete Pavements” was first published 
in the year 2008 and used by the various stakeholders. Meanwhile, lot of advancement has been 
taken place in the technology, machinery and the material as well as feedback was received from 
the Industry, so need was felt to revise this document. Accordingly, the task of revision of this 
document was taken by the Rigid Pavements Committee (H-3) during the tenure 2015-17. The 
revised draft was prepared by the subgroup comprising Shri R.K. Jain, Dr. V. Ramachandra, Shri 
Anil Trivedi and Shri Binod Kumar. Other than the H-3 Committee members, valuable inputs were 
received from the officers of S&R Zone of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. The draft 
was deliberated in several meetings of H-3 Committee and was finalized in its meeting held on 9th 
September, 2017. The revised draft was placed before the Highways Specifications and Standards 
Committee (HSS) in its meeting held on 24th October, 2017. The HSS Committee approved the draft 
subject to the consideration of the observations of members. The draft document after carrying out 
the modifications was considered and approved by the Executive Committee of IRC in its meeting 
held on 2nd November, 2017 for placing before the Council of IRC. The Council in its meeting held 
on 3rd November, 2017 at Bengaluru considered and approved the document for printing.

Concrete pavement has flexural strength to withstand traffic and environmental load. 
Concrete gains strength with age and under normal conditions may gain, in 90 days, about 
10 per cent strength over its 28 days strength. The design and construction of rigid pavements

The Figs 1.1 to 1.3 depict broad arrangements of three main types of concrete 
pavement i.e. Jointed Plain Concrete Pavement (JPCP), Jointed Reinforced Concrete Pavement 
(JRCP) and Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavement (CRCP). Fig. 1.4 depicts a typical 
cross-section of rigid pavement. These Figures are given to facilitate better appreciation of the 
different types of rigid pavements and associated distresses.

The concrete pavement slab expands with the rise in temperature and contracts with 
fall in temperature. Concrete slabs accordingly tend to curl and warp due to the change in 
temperature and moisture gradient across its cross-section. The changes in temperature and 
relative humidity causes concrete pavement to crack at regular interval. Keeping this in mind, 
contraction joints are provided at designed intervals to take care of the expected cracking. 
Contraction joints provided are thus especially for crack control to ensure that cracking in 
concrete slabs does not take place randomly, at other locations except at the contraction joint 
locations. Fig. 1.5 shows a contraction joint after crack developed under the initial saw cut. It 
is presumed that if contraction joints are properly located, designed and constructed, cracks at 
other locations will not take place. However, due to various factors including deficiencies like 
inappropriate selection of materials, lack of timely and adequate curing, delayed joint cutting, 
and other construction deficiencies etc., uncontrolled (random) cracks in the concrete pavement 
do take place at undesignated locations. Faulting, scaling, loss of texture etc. are other types of 
distresses which are normally encountered in concrete pavements. These distresses are mainly 
due to improper functioning of joints, settlement of sub-grade, loosening of tie bars and improper 
construction workmanship.

Cracks are not uncommon to concrete construction and, therefore, minor shallow 
cracks need not be viewed as a serious problem. Many cracks can be restored easily to a 
condition that will serve for the design life of the pavement. In some cases, no repair may be 
required, while in others some preventive repairs like resealing, retexturing will be sufficient. Only 
deep structural cracks are a matter of serious concern for which repair methods are available. 
These guidelines apart from suggesting various repair techniques are also aimed to offset the 
impression that the repairs of the concrete pavements are something impossible and therefore, 
their construction should be avoided.

1.6	
Scope
1.6.1	
All pavements deteriorate with time. The rate of deterioration of concrete pavement 
is comparatively much slower than the flexible pavement. The concrete pavements are 
therefore expected to have a longer service life. Fig. 1.6 indicates the typical treatment which 
may be considered with the age and condition of pavement. The techniques of assessment, 
repair and rehabilitation presented are for old concrete pavement during its normal service 
life. New concrete pavements should be laid with utmost care so that no distress or defect 
is observed during construction. In the case of concrete pavements, some distresses at a 
few isolated locations however, do take place immediately after or during an early stage 
after completion. If these isolated distresses are rectified well in time, then longer life of 
the concrete pavement is assured without much need of detailed periodic maintenance/
rehabilitation. Preservation of concrete pavements, therefore, can be broadly classified into 
three categories:-
	
(i)	
Concrete Pavement Restoration (CPR) Techniques - Repair and maintenance 
operations without any overlay
	
(ii)	
Rehabilitation - Strengthening involving overlay options.
	
(iii)	 Reconstruction - Undertaken after the end of service life or due to severe 
distresses in longer stretches due to faulty design/construction.
1.6.2	
With proper design, construction and maintenance, a concrete pavement can give 
a useful service life of more than 30 years without any significant rehabilitation/reconstruction. 
Concrete pavement repairs/maintenance involves a series of engineering techniques which 
are used to repair the isolated areas of distress. Broadly such repairs theoretically do not 
enhance the structural capacity beyond the designed life of a concrete pavement. In reality 
such repairs, however, do extend the service life of the pavement. Timely repair by adopting 
CPR techniques is quite cost effective and helps to avoid costly rehabilitation/reconstruction 
later on.
1.6.3	
Treatment depends on the wear characteristics. Fig 1.5 shows typical methods that 
can be applied against pavement age. They range from repairs under Concrete Pavement 
Restoration (CPR) to overlays to complete reconstruction. Repairs are generally classified as to 
whether an overlay is used or not.
1.6.4	
There could be situations where one or more repair techniques may be required 
to be used together to mitigate distresses. In some cases, where more than one repair 
technique is required to rectify the defects/distresses, these will be executed in a proper 
sequence to ensure the effectiveness of such repairs. Repair and maintenance strategies 
suggested in these guidelines are basically intended for old pavements of which defect 
liability period has expired. Guidance may be taken for the preparation of the contract 
clauses for new construction for which defect liability period is not yet over. However, the 
contractual clauses for new construction will prevail irrespective of the recommendations in 
these guidelines (Refer Para 5.3). These guidelines address the need for cost effectiveness 
and consideration of lane closure problems encountered during the operation phase which 
normally occur much after the construction phase. These guidelines are primarily focused on 
repair/maintenance of the concrete pavements through CPR techniques.

2 DEFINITIONS
2.1	
General
The main types of maintenance required in respect of cement concrete pavements are as 
follows:
	
(a)	
Routine Maintenance: Routine maintenance may be defined as those treatment 
that are applied to a pavement in order to keep the pavement functioning properly. 
As such routine maintenance is sometime called ‘reactive maintenance’. This 
suggests that it is a work that is performed as a reaction to a specific distress. 
Routine maintenance is performed on pavement as they begin to show sign of 
deterioration, but is generally considered to be a wasted effort on pavement that 
are severely distressed.
	
(b)	
Programmed Maintenance: It covers works undertaken to arrest deterioration 
and restore the asset to its original condition. Works are programmed in 
advance and defined to delay further deterioration. It normally includes work 
such as resealing the defective joint with sealant, cross-stitching, partial 
depth repairs, full depth and diamond grinding to remove faults in the rigid 
pavement.
	
(c) 	 Rehabilitation and Strengthening: It refers to programmed works that are 
undertaken to structurally restore the condition of a road section to impart further 
design life to carry future expected traffic loads. The works upgrade the road to 
current design standards. It includes work like diamond grooving for restoring 
surface texture, slab stabilization, reconstruction or application of an overlay to 
rectify structural deficiencies in the pavement, retrofitting of dowel bars and tie 
bars wherever needed.
	
(d)	
Emergency Repairs: It covers responding to complaints or emergencies.
The repairs are usually performed by skilled (sometimes specialist) labour. 
2.2 
Terms and Definitions
Different terminology used in these guidelines will be read in accordance with the following 
definitions/abbreviations:
Blowup or Buckling Compressive failure in which there is either upward movement of both 
or one slab (>4 mm) or shattering of one or both slabs at a joint or a 
crack.
Bump
Local areas at a higher level than the pavement profile.
Composite 
Pavement
A pavement consisting of both flexible and rigid layers with or without 
separating granular layers.
Corner Break 
Cracks
Diagonal full depth crack that intersects the corner joints at less than half 
width of the panel.
Corner Crack 
Cracking that extends diagonally across corners (generally within 
600 mm of the corner).



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 140
======================================================================
IRC:SP:83-2018
8
Crack along joint
Initial phase of spalling, crack intersects the joint at an angle or travels 
parallel to it.
Crow foot or Y 
shaped cracks
Deep shrinkage cracks (more than 25 mm) resulting from excess of 
bleeding water or water basins on the top surface of the slab.
Crazing (Map 
cracking)
Development of a network of fine random cracks or fissures on the 
surface layer. These cracks are rarely more tan 3 mm deep and more 
noticeable on steel troweled surfaces.
Diagonal Cracks
Linear straight crack that extends diagonally across the slab.
Alkali–Aggregate 
Reaction Cracks
Family of closely spaced, crescent shaped fine cracks that initiate at slab 
corner/joints/cracked comers and run close and parallel to slab edges 
and result from chemically reactive aggregates and higher alkali content 
in cement. Cracked areas are usually darker in color. The cracking 
generally starts at the slab bottom and moves upward.
Fine/Hairline Cracks Shallow surface cracks without any pattern which have an unspalled 
width of less than 0.2 mm at the surface of the slab
Longitudinal Cracks Linear cracks running approximately parallel to the pavement centre 
line.
Alligator cracking
Cracks forming a rectangular (map) or irregular polygonal pattern (like 
an alligator skin).
Narrow crack
A crack which has an unspalled width of up to 0.5 mm at the surface of 
the slab.
Multiple Cracks
Multiple connecting cracks which are not in a straight line.
Medium Cracks
A crack which has an unspalled width of between 0.5 mm and 1.5 mm
Parallel Cracks
Usually fine cracks forming a family, more or less parallel to one 
another
Plastic Shrinkage 
Cracks
Plastic shrinkage cracks are those which appear on the surface of 
concrete before it has hardened. These cracks randomly located in the 
concrete are usually parallel to one another, and are few centimeters in 
length.
Reflection Crack
A crack in an overlay which occurs over a crack or a joint in the underlay.
Transverse crack
Linear cracks running at approximately right angles to the pavement 
centre line.
Wide crack
A crack which has an unspalled width exceeding 1.5 mm at the surface 
of the slab.
Working crack
Transverse crack extending full width of slab with depth (d) Greater than 
half the slab depth (D/2) which artificially create joint location.
Curling or warping
Curling or warping is distortion of the pavement slab from its proper plane 
into a curved surface caused by differential expansion or contraction 
resulting from a difference in temperature or moisture gradient between 
the top and bottom of slab. Fig. 2.1 illustrates distortion of pavement slab 
under different temperature and moisture gradients.

IRC:SP:83-2018
Fig. 2.1 Distortion of Pavement Slab under Different Temperature Gradient
Damaged Surface
Hardened surface deeply abraded or otherwise damaged following 
accident, or by vehicle tracks or metal wheels.
Depression
Localised sections/areas at a lower level to the normal pavement profile. 
This usually happens due to inadequate care at the time of laying.
Diamond Grinding 
(Cutting)
Diamond grinding is pavement preservation technique that corrects 
variety of surface imperfections. It uses a series of diamond tipped saw 
blades gang-mounted on a shaft for correcting irregular surfaces in 
concrete pavement that are commonly caused by faulting, curling and 
warping of slabs. This is also applied to the pavement surface to restore 
skid resistance.
Divided/Broken/
Shattered slab
Cracks in different directions dividing a slab in a number of pieces. 
Such cracks may intersect and may also converge in a point. In case of 
shattered slab the pieces are not less than four in number.
Dowel Bar Retrofit
Method for providing/restoring load transfer under the wheel paths in 
an old with/without doweled pavement or transversely cracked concrete 
slabs by installing dowels into slots cut into the pavement surface so as 
to extend the service life of the pavement slab.
Dowel Socketing
Loosening of dowel bars, which leads to load transfer. Improper 
installation of dowels leading to enlarging of dowel-cavity and resulting 
in loss of load transfer and spalling of concrete.
Drop off
Settlement between traffic lane and bituminous/soft shoulder following 
erosion or wear or secondary compaction of shoulder by traffic. The 
shoulder is at a lower level than the concrete pavement.
Faulting (or 
stepping)
A difference in elevation across a joint or crack usually associated with 
undoweled JPCP. Usually the approach slab is higher than the leave 
slab due to pumping. Faulting is noticeable when the average faulting in 
the pavement section reaches 4 mm or more. Diamond grinding or other 
rehabilitation measures should be considered for removal of faulting.
Foreign Matter
Foreign incompressibles like aggregates usually impregnated in the 
joint/joint sealant that may initiate spalling or locking of transverse or 
longitudinal joints.

Full depth repair
Repair involving the replacement of part or whole slab panel to the full 
depth of the slab.
Functional 
characteristics
Characteristics of the pavement which are important to users, including 
safety and riding comfort.
Heave
Heave is an upward swelling of soil exerting pressure on upper layers 
causing localized failure.
Impressions
Impressions that may be associated with depressions left in fresh 
concrete, by movement of animals/vehicles/bicycles.
International 
Roughness Index 
(IRI)
 The international roughness index is obtained from measured longitudinal 
road profile. It is calculated by using a quarter – car vehicle mathematical 
model expressed as unit of m/km or mm/m.
Intervention level/
standard 
Maximum permissible tolerance level at which a defect is to be promptly 
scheduled for rectification.
Joints:
Longitudinal Joint
Sawn or formed joint parallel to the centerline of pavement intended to 
relieve stresses due to transverse warping and for uneven settlement 
of the subgrade. Usually placed between lanes, to allow construction in 
convenient width.
Transverse Joint
Sawn or formed joint normally placed at regular interval at right angles to 
the centre line. Transverse joints consist of expansion joints, contraction 
joints and construction joints.
Construction Joint
Full depth butt joints placed wherever construction operations require 
to prevent a cold joint forming. Usually when paving operations stop for 
more than initial setting time or at the end of a day’s paving.
Contraction Joint
Sawn or formed joint normally placed at regular intervals to permit the slab to 
contract and intended to relieve tensile stress in the concrete and to so prevent 
formation of irregular cracks in the slabs. The joints are of groove type, about 
1/3rd to 1/4th depth of the slab so that cracks forms below the groove.
Expansion Joint
Butt joint which provides space in concrete to allow for expansion of slabs 
caused by the increase in mean temperature as compared to the temperature 
at the time of laying the concrete slab. They relieve compressive stresses 
due to expansion, as also those due to contraction and warping. 
Loss of fine 
Aggregate/exposed 
and polished 
coarse aggregate
Fine aggregate loss around the coarse aggregates that show a rounded 
polished surface.
Loss of surface 
texture
Loss of surface texture is a measure of loss of skid resistance of concrete 
pavement surface. With time the texture gets abraded. This is measured 
by following two methods:
(i)	
Sand Patch Method (for broom/brush texturing)
(ii)	
British Pendulum Tester (for all kind of texturing)

3 TYPES AND CAUSES OF DEFECTS
3.1 
Distress Identification
A site condition survey once a year, preferably in the beginning of monsoon season should be 
undertaken to assess the existing pavement condition and to identify the pavement distresses. 
Such site condition surveys should aim at two objectives:
	
(i)	
To determine the root cause of pavement’s distress.
	
(ii)	
To track the rate of progression of the distress leading to pavement deterioration.
Repair techniques discussed in these guidelines, except those of full depth repair, may not be 
effective, if the rate of pavement deterioration is relatively fast. In case of a fast rate of deterioration 
particularly in continuous long stretches, the rehabilitation options may be considered along 
with repair option and appropriate decision taken as per specific site conditions. Determining 
the root cause of failure, if possible, helps in identifying the appropriate repair techniques/
strategies including the combinations thereof. The Chapter-4 describes in detail the different 
types of distress identification/assessment surveys. It is important to record both the severity 
and extent of each distress during condition survey undertaken. In case, it is felt that non-
destructive and/or destructive testing are required to assess the structural problems, as the 
same are not adequately determined through visual inspections, then such testing should be 
undertaken subsequently.
3.2	
Distress Types
Distresses in concrete pavements are either structural or functional. Structural distresses 
primarily affect the pavement’s ability to carry traffic load. Functional distresses mainly affect the 
riding quality and safety of the traffic.

3.2.1	
Structural distresses
All cracks are not structural cracks. Any uncontrolled/random crack like longitudinal, transverse, 
diagonal, intersecting cracks that extends through the depth of the slab (> D/2, where ‘D’ is 
depth of PQC slab) is to be considered as a structural crack. Structural cracking is often caused 
due to excessive loading, long joint spacing, and shallow or late sawing of joints, restraint at 
base or edge, due to joint lock-up, inadequate thickness, material related problems etc. Often 
reasons for structural cracking could be pumping of fines from the sub-grade or the sub­ base, 
excessive warping of the slab, subsidence of utility trench, excessive temperature stresses and 
moisture content. Structural cracks unless repaired effectively reduce the load carrying capacity 
of the pavement and adversely impact the designed service life of the pavement. Use of proper 
construction techniques and traffic load controls can reduce/avoid structural cracks.
3.2.2	
Functional distress
These distresses do not necessarily reduce the load carrying capacity of the pavements but 
affect the riding quality, and safety. Roughness, loss of surface texture or any other surface 
related defects, problems like faulting, scaling, ravelling and popouts etc. fall under this category.

3.4	
Causes of Common Distresses
3.4.1	
Timing of sawing the joints
3.4.1.1	
Understanding the causes of pavement distress is essential for providing appropriate 
effective repair and developing maintenance strategies. Contraction joints are provided in the 
concrete pavement to control the formation of uncontrolled cracks in the concrete pavement. But 
early uncontrolled cracks do occur for a variety of reasons. It is therefore important to identify the 
correct causes so that appropriate cost effective method for rectification is selected.
3.4.1.2	
Timing of joint cutting is very critical. Determination of appropriate timing of sawing 
requires experience and is also a site specific decision. It depends upon factors like, ambient 
temperature, wind velocity relative humidity, type of aggregates used in concrete and rate of 
strength gain etc. Ref. IRC:15

Concrete Strength →

3.4.1.3	
There is a time range during which the activity of sawing should be completed. This 
time range is known as sawing window. Fig. 3.1 depicts this sawing window. Experienced saw 
operators rely on their judgment and scratch test to decide as to whether the concrete is ready 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:83-2018
16
for sawing. Concrete surface can be scratched with a nail or knife blade to examine how deep 
the impression is formed. As the surface hardens, the scratch depth decreases. In general, if 
the scratch removes the texture, sawing should not be undertaken as it will be a case of too 
early sawing. An experienced crew can always fine-tune the optimum sawing timing. Sawing to 
appropriate depth is very important and shallow depth sawing will lead to random cracking. The 
appropriate sawing depth is between 1/4th to 1/3rd of PQC thickness.
Too early sawing leads to unacceptable ravelling (Fig. 3.2) and too late sawing leads to 
uncontrolled/random full depth cracking. Uncontrolled/random full depth longitudinal cracking 
often occurs due to too late sawing. An early entry dry saw, if applied to a depth of 0.2 times the 
thickness of the PQC or 25 mm will avoid random cracking. Sawing should not be initiated when 
the compressive strength of the concrete is less than 2 MPa and should be completed before it 
attains the compressive strength of 7 MPa. These figures are indicative only. The actual timing 
will depend upon ambient temperature, wind velocity, aggregate types, humidity etc. Another 
way is to saw alternate panels to begin with. This will help to complete the sawing operation 
within the sawing window range. The left out panels should be sawed subsequently. It should 
be ensured that these alternate panels are not left unsawed inadvertently. This type of sawing 
is known as skip-sawing technique. The sawing should be started when the pavement is able to 
bear the weight of crew and saw-machine. It is usually 6-18 hours depending upon season i.e. 
summer and winter.

3.4.1.4	
Plastic shrinkage cracking
It is important not to confuse cracks arising due to restraint of the concrete at early age due to 
misaligned dowel bars, improper joint spacing and timing of joint cutting with plastic shrinkage 
cracks. Plastic shrinkage cracks are tight, about 0.3 m to 0.6 m long formed in parallel group’s 
perpendicular to the direction of the wind, at the time of paving. Plastic shrinkage cracking is a 
result of rapid drying at the pavement surface. The cracks normally extend down to a depth of 
about 20 mm - 30 mm. Adequate curing measures are necessary to prevent their occurrence. 
These cracks normally do not influence the overall performance of the pavement and can be 
repaired as described in Chapter 5. Misting/fogging after 2-3 hours minimizes all surface cracks.

IRC:SP:83-2018
3.4.1.5	
Drying shrinkage cracking
Wider/deeper cracking is usually attributable to the drying shrinkage and restraint developed in 
the concrete due to inadequate joint spacing, improper saw cutting or misalignment of dowel bars. 
The optimum spacing of joints in a jointed concrete pavement depends on the slab thickness, 
sub-base stiffness and concrete strength. ACPA recommends a maximum joint spacing of 21 
times depth of the PQC slab for concrete pavement constructed over dry lean concrete (DLC)/
stabilized sub-base. Other agencies recommend even closer joint spacing, so as to maintain the 
ratio of slab length to the radius of relative stiffness less than 5. The equation 3.1 gives radius of 
relative stiffness. Pavement with long transverse joint spacing may otherwise develop full panel 
width deep cracks due to tensile stresses developed due to temperature curling.

3.4.1.6	
Misaligned dowel bars
If the saw timing and saw cut depth are found adequate, cracking could still occur due to the 
misalignment of dowel bars. The misalignment of dowels can induce a crack away from a 
transverse joint, if the dowels physically lock two slabs together and restrain their contraction.
3.4.2	
Traffic loading and environmental influences
The concrete pavements are subjected to stresses due to traffic loading and environmental stresses 
due to change in temperature and moisture conditions which can have the following effects:
3.4.2.1	
Traffic related distress causes are the most widespread and frequent. They usually 
act in combination with climatic causes.
	
•	
Axle loads are responsible for fatigue and impact failure of the materials of 
different pavement layers including the pavement slab. They also originate 
structural cracking both shallow and full depth and vertical differential movements 
of the concrete slabs or faulting as well as lateral slab movement.
	
•	
Wear by traffic tires results in loss of texture and consequential functional 
distress of the pavement surface.
3.4.2.2	
Temperature related distress of concrete slabs results from temperature variations 
and temperature gradients through the slab thickness.
	
•	
Thermal expansion or contraction is resisted by friction of the underlying layer 
and by the adjoining slabs. Compressive stress builds up during expansion that 
may originate cracking.



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 140
======================================================================
IRC:SP:83-2018
18
	
•	
Temperature gradients also initiate slab curling and loss of uniform sub-base 
support, which may lead to cracking including structural cracking.
3.4.3	
Moisture decreases the bearing capacity of underlying layers, facilitates abrasion and 
internal erosion. Surface water ingress in the pavement structure shall be prevented by properly 
sealed joints and by timely sealing of cracks. However sealing materials deteriorate with time 
and properly designed and operational pavement sub-surface drainage shall be provided so that 
any percolating water does not remain entrapped within the pavement. If these conditions are 
not fulfilled and water is trapped in or between the pavement layers it will be subjected to high 
pressure and may be expelled under passing traffic loads carrying fine materials (pumping) in 
suspension that result from internal erosion of the pavement materials.
3.4.4	
Run-off water may ingress in joints and cracks carrying with it foreign incompressible 
materials.
3.4.5	
Repair cannot be durable if distress causes are not found and eliminated. One type of 
distress can generally result from several different causes. So careful observations and follow-
up are required to discard certain causes and confirm some others. Mapping and rating of the 
distress type may be done adequately. In some cases it may happen that distress causes cannot 
be satisfactorily investigated until the pavement is excavated before carrying out the repair. The 
necessary excavation should be done at such locations.
3.5	
Diagnosis of Defects
3.5.1	
Causes of construction defects can be related to workmanship and work methods as 
described above, as well as equipment operating condition and adjustment and the properties of 
the materials.
3.5.2	
Unexpected changes in climatic conditions (temperature, moisture, wind) may also 
originate defects and distress, when appropriate preventive action is not taken.
3.5.3	
Construction records and diaries of line supervisors and managers should contain the 
most important/useful information to identify causes of defects. For example: ambient temperature, 
speed and direction of wind at the time of paving, time of joint saw cutting, inconsistencies in 
delivery and/or placing of the concrete, malfunctions of the equipment etc.
3.6	
Diagnosis of Functional Defects and Distresses
3.6.1	
Functional Performance of the pavement refers to characteristics of the pavement 
that are important to users. These characteristics primarily include safety (as measured by skid 
resistance testing by the British Pendulum or Mu-meter Test or texture depth as measured by 
the Sand Patch test) and riding comfort (as measured by profilograph or bump integrator and in 
some situations also by noise measurements).
3.6.2	
Surface Functional distress results from wearing of the pavement surface materials 
by traffic tyres and heavy abrasion from vehicle parts during breakdown/accident. Their causes 
can therefore be found in the volume of traffic, in tangential efforts applied by the tyres, like 
braking efforts and in the capability of the pavement surface materials to withstand such efforts 
with minimum wear under the prevailing weather conditions.

3.7	
Diagnosis of Structural Defects and Distresses
3.7.1	
Structural performance refers to the structural adequacy of the pavement in relation 
to its ability to carry future traffic. Structural adequacy can be determined by performing distress 
surveys like deflection testing, nondestructive testing, and materials testing, after visual inspection.

4 ASSESSING MAINTENANCE NEEDS
4.1	
General
4.1.1	
The evaluation of the existing pavement condition is the most important part of the 
process of assessing the maintenance needs. The maintenance strategy will be determined 
according to the level of deterioration (refer Para 1.6.1 and Fig. 1.6). The characterization of the 
condition of the existing pavement largely determines the types of treatments to be considered. 
Characterization includes the types of distress, width and depth of crack/defect, percentage 
area affected; joint defects etc. (refer Table 4.5). Different evaluation tests and procedures are 
available for a complete and comprehensive evaluation of the existing pavement condition.
4.1.2	
The maintenance needs should be assessed every year as part of the planning of the 
road maintenance program. It is recommended that an overall assessment of the maintenance 
needs be done on the basis of condition surveys which can take various forms such as:
	
•	
visual inspection and rating as per Proforma 4.3
	
•	
profile/faulting/roughness measurements, by Profilograph and Bump Integrator 
(BI)
	
•	
deflection tests; Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD)
	
•	
friction/skid resistance tests by sand patch, British Pendulum and Mu-meter
	
•	
drainage condition survey
	
•	
Non Destructive Testing (NDT) Techniques like Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity, Impact 
Echo etc.
4.1.3	
Additional testing and measurement will be required to collect specific data particular to 
the needs identified during the overall condition survey based on repair/rehabilitation alternatives 



======================================================================
PAGE 33 of 140
======================================================================
25
IRC:SP:83-2018
to be considered in the maintenance program. For example concrete material evaluation, base/
sub­ base and sub-grade testing and drainage condition surveys. The frequency of such additional 
testing will depend on the age and extent of damage recorded in the overall condition survey. 
A review of the project records including plans, specifications, construction quality assurance/
quality control records and general inspection notes will be helpful.
4.2	
Pavement Evaluation Procedure
4.2.1	
Road agencies around the world have developed a range of procedures for evaluation 
of the concrete pavements in their countries. US Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has 
developed 17 standard procedures as given in Table 4.1. Relevant tests which are suitable 
to a particular site may be adopted for the evaluation of the pavement condition. Some of the 
commonly used procedures are indicated below:
a)	
Visual Condition Surveys - Either manual or video/photographic-based procedures 
can be followed. Specific commentaries are provided to address special features 
related to concrete pavement distresses.
	
i.	
Visual rating is a simple method of inspecting the pavement for detecting 
and assessing the type and severity of the damage. In most instances, road 
inspections address all aspects of road condition, including the condition of 
shoulders, road drainage, road furniture etc., as well as the condition of the 
pavement.
	
ii.	
Visual condition survey may be conducted from a vehicle driving over the 
pavement or a manual survey conducted by walking or riding in cycle rickshaw 
along representative sections. Automated survey equipment are available and 
may be deployed for the purpose.
	
iii.	
Whilst there are various methods of visual rating adopted by different agencies 
over the world, an essential requirement is to inspect the concrete pavement 
on a regular basis and record the various maintenance needs kilometer-wise 
all along the length of the road in standard formats. Proformae 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 
and 4.4 are placed at the end of this Chapter. These proformae are suggestive/
indicative in nature and could be suitably modified in field as per project specific 
requirement.
	
iv.	
Although slow and labour intensive, the manual condition survey is the most 
reliable. The best method to record location and extent of distress types in a 
manual survey is graphical (map) and tabular format. Typical examples for 
guidance are provided in Proforma 4.1 and Proforma 4.2 respectively. The 
different types of distress shall be rated and their degrees of severity noted in the 
forms at the places where they occur. The details may be further summarized in 
the standard format as recommended in Proforma 4.3.
	
v.	
Any type of distress or defect may be located at a certain pavement section 
and at a certain distance from the centre line. The same distress may extend in 
length between two sections across the transverse or longitudinal joints. It may 
extend laterally to the whole width of the carriageway or only to certain strips or 
areas. Such extension of distress should be carefully noted to study the extent 
of such distress.



======================================================================
PAGE 34 of 140
======================================================================
IRC:SP:83-2018
26
	
vi.	
The location and extent of the defect/distressed area are recorded as observed 
at the surface. Since internally deteriorated concrete below the surface can 
have larger extension than superficial observations may show, before marking 
the area to be repaired it is important to test the surrounding slab areas.
	
vii.	
The actual extension of deteriorated concrete can be determined by “sounding”, 
which is done by striking the surface with a rod or a hammer or by dragging a 
chain along the surface. This will produce a metallic ring on sound concrete and 
a dull/hollow sound on deteriorated concrete.
b) 
Deflection Testing - This testing is an important part of any pavement evaluation 
plan. Key aspects are addressed such as the time of testing for concrete pavements, 
especially for joint and crack testing for Load Transfer Efficiency (LTE) and void 
detection.
c)	
Roughness Surveys - This is to be done as per IRC: SP:16. Research has established 
that pavements constructed initially with low roughness level have relatively longer 
life.
d)	
Skid Resistance Survey - There are three methods to assess roughness of the 
surface as suggested below:
	
i.	
Sand Patch Method: As per IRC:15, the value should be between 0.65 mm to 
1.25 mm.
	
ii.	
Measurement by British Pendulum Test: The value of Skid Resistance 
Number (BPN) as per Transport Research Laboratory (TRL, Road Note No. 
27), the value should be between 45 - 55 BPN (as per British Pendulum Test) 
in normal conditions. (Refer Appendix E for more details about the British 
Pendulum Test).
	
iii.	
 As per Mu - Meter: Table 1 Appendix E gives the acceptable values for Skid 
Number 36 to 31 at different traffic (vehicle) speeds from 50 kmph to 110 kmph. 
(Refer Appendix E for more details about Mu-Meter)
e)	
Faulting Surveys - The faulting of joint/crack is normally measured with a millimeter 
scale. However, advance equipment like Georgia Fault meter if, available may also 
use for measuring joint/crack faulting.
f)	
Core Testing - The guidelines refers to standardized testing procedures by the 
Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). Core samples may be used for strength testing, 
and modulus of elasticity testing. Petrographic as well as durability (materials related 
distress) testing may also be carried out with the core samples.
g)	
Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) Testing - Guidelines are provided that address 
ground GPR techniques relative to PCC pavement applications.
	
The GPR scanning technique could be used for in the following applications:
	
1.	
Detection and mapping of underground services;
	
2.	
Detection of of bedrock/boulders and cavities;
	
3.	
Detection of underground structures such as trenches and tunnels
	
4.	
Detection of sinkholes along roads and highways;
	
5.	
Detection of water seepage/leakages;

6.	
Determination of concrete qualities mapping of defects;
	
7.	
Detection of reinforcements positions and tendons/ducts profiles
h)	
Slab Curvature Measurement - Curling/warping may be determined using the 
dipstick or by measuring slab deformation (deflections) at slab comers and at other 
locations using Linear Variable Differential Transformers (LVDTs) or dial gauges. Such 
testing may be needed in some cases to determine, if premature failure conditions 
(cracking, etc) are due to excessive slab curling and warping.
i)	
Drainage Surveys - Drainage evaluation needs to be included as part of overall 
pavement evaluation, so as to assess any potential future problems caused by 
moisture and run-off especially where the average rainfall exceeds 500 mm per year. 
The moisture may penetrate the pavement through cracks or transverse/longitudinal 
joint due to delamination or oozing out of sealant from the walls of the groove. The 
condition and effectiveness of side drainage also require recording, particularly, before 
the monsoon period. The presence of rain cuts, piping and erosion of shoulders should 
also be record ed. Drainage condition survey data form is given in Proforma 4.4.

4.3	
Functional Evaluation
4.3.1	
The functional performance of a pavement refers to characteristics of the pavement 
which are important to the users, including safety (as measured by cleanliness and friction 
testing) and riding comfort (as measured by profile testing and noise measurements).
4.3.2	
The measurement of irregularities (roughness) in the road surface can be used to 
indicate in physical terms the existing condition of the road and its likely deterioration with time. 
It is thus a very useful tool in the hands of a maintenance engineer. It is good practice to take 
roughness measurements on the entire network of concrete roads in the country, at least once 
every three years and to maintain the permanent record of the same.
4.3.3	
Moving profilographs or laser device are often used to measure the depth of irregularities 
in the road surface. Standards related to profile measurement and data analysis have been 
developed by ASTM under ASTM E 950 and ASTM E 1364. The indigenous response type fifth 
wheel bump integrator (BI) which measures suspension deflections (originally developed by 
TRRL in the UK) towed over the road surface (preferably in the wheel path) at a steady speed of 
32+/-1 km/hour has to date been generally used in the country to evaluate the roughness in terms 
of mm/km. A brief description of the above equipment and procedures for calibration are given in 
the IRC publication “Guidelines for Surface Evenness of Highway Pavements”, IRC:SP:16.
4.3.4	
The roughness of a pavement is commonly reported in terms of an unevenness index as 
measured by the bump integrator. The maximum permissible roughness values (expressed in “mm/
km”) recommended by IRC:SP:16 for the roads with different types of surfaces are given in Table 4.2

It is possible and desirable to construct roads with roughness level lower than above with the use 
of modern equipment and construction practices supported with adequate logistics commensurate 
with the capacity of paver etc.
4.3.5	
Two methods of reporting the roughness are commonly followed. One is based on the 
bump integrator (BI) in mm/km as described above and the other is based on the International 
Roughness Index (IRI) in m/km. Table 4.3 gives the conversion values between BI and IRI.

4.4	
Structural Evaluation
4.4.1	
The structural performance of the pavement refers to its ability to carry future traffic.
4.4.2	
There are a number of means of assessing structural capacity by measuring deflection 
and curvature of the pavement under heavy axle load.
4.4.3	
Deflection based non destructive testing methods such as Falling Weight Deflectometer 
(FWD) are generally preferred as destructive testing is cumbersome, time consuming and costly.
4.4.4	
There are cases when pavement in long continuous stretch is badly damaged or 
distressed. In all such cases, it may be considered desirable that pavement in such condition 
be opened up and each layer is tested to identify the exact cause of failure/distress. The FWD 
is a very quick and accurate method for assessing residual life of the pavement, and also for 
overlay design. The FWD is attached to a 4 wheeled vehicle, and results recorded directly on to 
computer disc, for later analyses.
4.5	
Measurement and Degree of Severity of Defects
4.5.1	
The severity of any type of distress can be evaluated by the measurement of one or 
two parameters that best characterise that type of distress.
	
a)	
Deformation in the pavement may be due to faulting, drop-off shoulder, heaving, 
blow up etc. Deformation is measured in terms of level difference in mm by 
using a straight edge and a graduated wedge or tape.
	
b)	
Individual cracks can be evaluated by measuring their width in mm. This can 
be done by inserting metal strips of standard gauge thickness or by optical 
microscope (Fig. 4.1). Measurement of crack length and its variation with time 
is also important. Cracks that run across one or more slabs are particularly 
severe and result from concrete tensile failure. The maximum crack width shall 
be recorded as representative of at least 50% of its length.
	
c)	
Multiple and hair cracks can be evaluated by measuring the total length of cracks 
in mm/m2 within a square frame with 1 m long sides.
	
d)	
For cracks, it is also very important to know their depth, because full depth 
cracks (>D/2) allow ingress of water and undermine the strength of the slab 
and the pavement. On the other hand some kinds of shallow cracks, such as 
shrinkage cracks do not need to be repaired if they are isolated and short. The 
crack depth can be determined in cores bored from the pavement or by ultra-
sonic pulse velocity measurements across the crack . The depth as determined 
by this method is about 60 to 70 % of the actual depth as determined by the 
former method.
	
e)	
Surface loss (ravelling and scaling) can be evaluated by its percentage of 
damaged area and its maximum depth.
	
f)	
Joint spalling can be evaluated by measuring its width in mm. Refer Figs 4.2 (a) 
& (b). The maximum spalling width shall be recorded
	
g)	
Individual popouts and potholes can be evaluated by measuring their diameters 
and depths. Multiple popouts can be evaluated by their number per square metre.

h)	
Surface wearing can be evaluated by its area density as a percentage and the 
textural depth (sand patch test) or skid resistance of the worn surface.
	
i)	
Patching can be evaluated as the percentage area patched to the total area of 
the slab.

4.6	
Distress Rating System
4.6.1	
The routine survey and recording of the surface condition and rating of severity of 
defects is important for assessing the maintenance strategy. The airports authorities use such 
a system and several roads authorities around the world use similar ratings systems. Some 
define three degrees of severity (low, medium and high), some five degrees and others ten 
degrees. A 5-level distress rating system is recommended in these guidelines. This is given in 
Table 4.4.
Table 4.4 Five Level Distress Rating System
Distress Rating

Severity(Defects) Rating
0
Excellent
Not Discernible

Minor
2
Good/Average
Moderate
3
Fair
Major
4
Poor
Extreme
5
Very Poor
Unsafe/Unserviceable
4.6.2	
Type of repair can be appropriately decided from the distress rating as per details 
of Table 4.5. The techniques for repair can be selected from Table 5.1 and 5.2. The guidance 
as to the materials suitable for repair is given in Chapter 12. The materials selected should 
provide the desired performance and durability of 6 to 8 years minimum. Concrete mix proportion 
characteristics are given in Appendix B for early opening to traffic (EOT) in case of emergency 
repairs.
4.6.3	
The severity level of the defects and distress develop during the contract defect liability 
period (usually specified as the first year after substantial completion) should generally not 
exceed degree 2. More time is necessary for distress development under traffic loading, climatic 
influences and/or unattended maintenance to reach degrees of severity 3 and 4. If degree of 
severity level 3 was exceeded during the defect liability period of the construction contract, this 
would probably have to be explained by relevant design and construction shortcomings and 
rectified under the terms of the contract. These days the Employer specifies 4 yrs defect liability 
period and it is the responsibility of Contractor to repair all distresses above severity level 2 in 
Table 4.4.
4.6.4	
Distresses with degree of severity of 5 (like wide cracks with spalling and/or scaling) 
exceeding 50% area and/or faulting exceeding 12 mm or broken slabs exhibiting rocking effect 
may be considered for slab replacement.
4.7	
Monitoring Performance
Performance or serviceability of the new roads or the roads after repair shall be assessed as per 
Para 4.2.

5 METHODS FOR REPAIRING CONCRETE PAVEMENTS
5.1	
Types of Repair Techniques
Repair techniques can be broadly classified into two categories:
	
i.	
Preventive Techniques
	
ii.	
Corrective Techniques
Preventive techniques are pro-active techniques/activities. These are aimed to slow down or 
prevent the occurrence of the distress so as to ensure a longer service life of the pavement. Joint 
and crack resealing are the most commonly applied preventive repair techniques. Full depth 
repairs are examples of corrective repair activities. There are a number of corrective activities/
repair techniques which perform both the function of corrective as well as preventive repair 
activities. Diamond grinding, grooving, slab stabilization, cross-stitching, retrofitting of dowel 
bars/edge drains and retexturing are some of the activities of the repair techniques which act 
both as corrective and preventive repair activities.
5.2	
Concrete Pavement Restoration Techniques
5.2.1	
Concrete Pavement in real situations suffers from one distress or, many times, with 
a combination of distresses. There are different techniques to tackle individual distresses. More 
often, a combination of repair techniques is required to be applied as illustrated in Fig. 5.1. 
Preventive techniques in many situations may help the pavement to perform for many years but 
may not provide a very long-term solution.

and Spalling

======================================================================
PAGE 49 of 140
======================================================================

IRC:SP:83-2018
5.2.2	
Budgetary resources will sometime dictate whether we should go for preventive repair 
activities to be followed by corrective repair activities or directly to corrective repair activities. The 
latter option will also be dictated by the degree of the severity of distress and urgency of repair. 
For example, in case of full depth/deep transverse cracks, resealing can be done early, so that 
further ingress of water into the pavement is prevented. It can run for some years. Later on to 
restore the structural integrity of pavement, appropriate corrective repair activities like dowel bar 
retrofit or full depth repair may be undertaken.
5.2.3	
Different activities have to follow a defined sequence. Full depth repairs, dowel bar 
retrofit or cross-stitching activities must precede the diamond grinding, grooving and resealing 
of joints. ACPA has suggested a model sequencing pattern which may be considered as a guide 
in this respect. This sequence is given in Fig. 5.1. All locations may not require every repair 
technique procedure or a combination of procedures. Individual technique/procedure may suffice 
in many cases.
5.2.4	
The selection and application of a particular repair technique at the proper time is 
essential for good performance of the concrete pavement. The actual selection of the particular 
repair technique shall depend on the following:
	
1.	
Type and extent of severity level of distress/damage
	
2.	
Causes of distresses are as given in Table 3.1
	
3.	
Bearing capacity of subbase and subgrade. Where insufficient bearing capacity 
is the cause of the distress the subgrade and/or subbase should also be 
strengthened and/or stabilized
	
4.	
Volume of traffic and traffic diversion conditions during the work, repair methods 
that require short work and curing times shall be preferred
	
5.	
Possible reuse of salvaged materials such as recycling of demolished concrete 
in DLC
	
6.	
Responsibility for payment, i.e. repair obligation of the construction agency 
under defect liability provisions of the contract or payment by the operating 
agency after defect liability period or handing over whichever is later.
5.3	
Timing of Distress Repair
5.3.1	
New construction
5.3.1.1	
The acceptance criteria for new construction shall be governed by IRC:15 “Code 
of Practice for Construction of Jointed Plain Concrete Pavements”. The acceptance criteria 
prescribed for cracked concrete slabs is in line with the MoRT&H Specification Clause 
602.9.9.4 which states that “The Contractor shall be liable at his expense to replace any 
concrete damaged as a result of incomplete curing or cracked on a line other than that of 
a joint”. As already stated before, the repair of new concrete pavement, within the defect 
liability period shall be governed by the relevant Clauses of the contract. In case where the 
contract clauses do not provide any specific acceptance criteria for new construction then for 
such cases it is recommended that acceptance criteria should be that all distresses of low 
severity (2 or less) vide Tables 4.4 and 4.5 shall be accepted with minor repair as per the 



======================================================================
PAGE 50 of 140
======================================================================
IRC:SP:83-2018
42
discretion of the Engineer-in-Charge. In case severity is of 4 and 5, it should not be accepted. 
For severity 3, the client may apply its discretion depending upon the nature/type of distress 
and considering that certain types of repairs like partial depth repairs etc. are likely to last 6-8 
years only.
5.3.2	
Old construction (after defect liability period)
5.3.2.1	
For concrete roads in operation, the cost of repair and lane closure are two important 
considerations in deciding the type of repair to be undertaken. Pavements have their defined 
service life. Repairs are intended only to ensure that concrete pavements perform till designed 
service life. The strategies for repair of older pavements could be thus different than those of 
new pavements. Decision is based on a tradeoff between the “cost” of repair and the “remaining” 
life of the pavement. Road Authorities may decide suitably.
5.3.2.2	
Alternative repair strategies for existing pavements are given in the last two columns 
of Table 4.5. The type of repair to be undertaken, primarily depends upon whether distress 
is of a structural nature or of non-structural nature. For these guidelines all cracks/distresses 
are non-structural in nature, when “d < D/2”, where “d” is the depth of crack or distress and 
“D” is the thickness of the slab (PQC). Preventive repair activity in cases, where d < D/2 are 
recommended. When “d > D/2” i.e. depth of crack/distress is more than half the thickness of 
the slab, such cracks/distresses are structural in nature. The repair methods recommended are 
corrective in nature where d > D/2. As stated before, the repair and maintenance strategies to 
be followed may involve either short term measure or long term measure or a combination of 
both with time spacing to suit the specific condition of distress, availability of fund etc. For repairs 
where “d>D/2”, the procedure given in para 5.4.5 or 5.4.6 or 5.4.7 as per site specific distress 
may be followed.
5.4	
Distress to be Repaired
5.4.1	
Visible distressed areas should be repaired according to the standards specified in 
the contract (if applicable) or as per the Tables 4.4 and 4.5 whichever sets the more stringent 
condition.
5.4.2	
Generally distress types of low severity (2 or less) may be left with minor repair. 
Structural distress with severity 4 and 5 as per Table 4.5 shall receive priority repair, to minimize 
further damage to the pavement structure with time, to avoid costly repairs/reconstruction. In 
such cases, short term repairs may precede the long term repair as per Table 4.5 to avoid 
damage extension due to delay in long term repair.
5.4.3	
Some types of distress like depressions, heave, single crack, raveling, loss of surface 
texture will only need repair for degrees of severity of 3 or more. Working cracks will be treated 
with dowel retrofit or with full depth repair depending on degree of severity. Full depth repair are 
to be undertaken in case of extreme severity.
5.4.4	
Single, shallow fine/hair cracks do not require repair. Fine plastic shrinkage cracks 
are believed to be self healing (autogenous). Fine interconnecting cracks (crazing) should 
be considered as surface distress and repaired with low viscosity epoxy resins as shown in 
Figs. 5.2 and 5.3 before propagating further and developing ravelling.

IRC:SP:83-2018
Fig. 5.2 Plastic Shrinkage Cracks Repaired 
with Low Viscosity Epoxy
Fig. 5.3 Close Up View of Epoxy Sealing
5.4.5	
Full depth cracks and damaged joints shall be sealed without delay to minimise ingress 
of water/incompressibles into the pavement structure. This should be followed with dowel retrofit 
or full depth repair.
5.4.6	
Full depth repair is recommended, if weak concrete is identified or suspected or the 
pavement had multiple type of distresses such as cracking, ravelling, large pop-outs/potholes 
and compression failure as blowups etc. Slab areas surrounding the visible distressed area 
should be sound when struck by a hammer and all areas sounding dull/hollow shall be included 
in the repair/boundaries. Weak concrete may extend to neighbouring slabs, and such slabs 
should also be repaired.
5.4.7	
Repair priority should be given to full depth cracks across one or more slabs. The 
repair of this type of structural distress developing after trafficking for some period often requires 
sub-grade stabilisation. Repair of full depth transverse cracks always requires new dowel bars 
to be placed and one new joint constructed as shown in Fig. 5.4. The large cracked slab is thus 
replaced by two smaller slabs with lower curl and warping stresses.
(a) Full Depth Repair with drilled-in Dowel 
Bars (with two new construction joints)
(b) Full Depth Repair with Grouted Tie Bar & 
Dowel Bars Assembly (Contraction Joint)
Fig. 5.4 Full Depth Repair
5.4.8	
The purpose of joint sealants is to prevent ingress of water and incompressible foreign 
materials. The condition of joint sealant should be watched at regular interval, particularly, before 
the on-set of monsoon. This should be replaced, when it is worn out, lost adhesion from the 
groove walls of the joints, hardened badly (oxidized) and has become brittle, has oozed out 
completely.

Prerequisite Activities for All Types of Repairs
5.6.1	
General
All repair techniques discussed in the guidelines will start with the following preparatory 
activities-



======================================================================
PAGE 53 of 140
======================================================================
45
IRC:SP:83-2018
	
1.	
Marking out the areas to be repaired.
	
2.	
Making the temporary working area safe for the workmen from the passing traffic 
by temporary barricading, signage etc.
	
3.	
Dismantling the affected areas and disposing of the broken concrete in an 
appropriate way.
	
4.	
Any other activities as per the direction of the Engineer in Charge.
5.6.2	
Marking areas to be repaired
The following activities shall be undertaken for appropriately marking out the area to be repaired.
	
a)	
The total distressed and surrounding areas (to be repaired) are marked on the 
pavement in rectangular form with sides parallel and perpendicular to the centre 
line after sounding with a hand hammer, ensuring not less than 50 mm cutting 
beyond unsound concrete. Rectangular areas simplify saw cutting and concrete 
removal.
	
b)	
All full depth repairs shall be made to the full width of a lane to achieve stable 
patches and provide adequate room in the pit for dowel hole drill rigs and 
compaction equipment.
	
c)	
The area to be repaired for a full depth transverse crack shall be a transverse 
strip. The width will depend on the crack alignment. Odd shaped slabs (L/B > 
1.5) and mismatched slabs shall be reinforced with 10 mm dia bars placed at 
depth of 75 mm from the top and 200 mm C/C both ways.
	
d)	
If the transverse crack is close to a joint (< 1500 mm from the joint) one of the 
sides of the area to be repaired shall be the nearest joint itself.
	
e)	
The newly cut joint faces shall be scrabbled with a chisel or sand blasted to 
create roughness for better bond between old and new concrete.
	
f)	
Partial depth repairs are usually smaller than 1m in length. For partial depth 
repairs if the distance between patches is smaller than 300 mm, the patches are 
combined in a single large patch.
	
g)	
When two different areas to be repaired or patches are close to each other the 
repair may be faster and cheaper if the adjacent areas are combined in a large 
patch.
	
h)	
The criteria for combining adjacent full-depth patches depend on slab thickness 
and the patch in case of (partial width repair) or lane in case of (full-width repair) 
width.
5.6.3	
Layout for repair of wide full width cracks (d >d/2)/full depth repair (fdr):
The following activities shall be undertaken:
	
a)	
The layout recommended for repair of full width transverse cracks depends on 
the location of the crack with respect to the joints and free edges as shown in 
Fig. 5.5.



======================================================================
PAGE 54 of 140
======================================================================
IRC:SP:83-2018
46
	
b)	
Transverse cracks extending full width of the panel or continuous longitudinal 
cracks intersecting with formed or sawn joints are not acceptable in new 
construction i.e. before “Taking Over” from the contractor by the client as per 
IRC:15 and MoRT&H Specifications for Road and Bridge Works. However, these 
may be provided with tie or dowel bars as part of a short term maintenance 
strategy after “Taking Over”. Dowel bars shall be used in such conditions where 
widening of the crack may occur.
	
c)	
For cracks at a distance of more than 1.5 m from the next transverse joint, 
slots for retrofitting of dowel bars shall be cut and the dowel bars placed at 
distances of 250- 300 mm before the crack is widened and sealed. This is a 
stop gap arrangement. The permanent treatment would be to make a full slab 
replacement or cutting out the affected part of slab by full depth cutting. Holes 
are drilled for tie bars and additional contraction joint is made by providing dowel 
bars (See Fig. 5.5).
	
d)	
For cracks located at short distances from joints (ie. at less than 1.5 m) the strip 
of slab between the crack and the joint shall be cut to a regular rectangular 
shape and removed. The condition of the existing dowel bars shall be checked 
and new holes for new tie bars shall be drilled in the opposite sawn cut face. 
These shall be thoroughly cleaned with compressed jet air and filled with a thick 
epoxy. The tie bar shall be inserted by hammer imparting light thuds at the head 
of the tie bar so that the epoxy oozes out insuring complete bond between the 
circular wall of the whole and ribbed surface of the tie bars. The epoxy shall be 
allowed to cure for a minimum period of four hour.
	
e)	
If the slab displays more than two full width cracks complete slab reconstruction 
shall be considered or repair may be carried out as per the advice of Engineer.
	
f)	
The concrete faces with tie bars shall be scrabbled/sandblasted to give a rough 
key to the new concrete. The pit shall be filled with the approved concrete mix, 
compacted and textured to match the surrounding slabs. Before concreting the 
bottom and sides of the pit are kept wet for few hours (not less than 4 hours). The 
condition of surface should be Saturated Surface Dry (SSD). Some agencies 
use cement: sand 1:1 slurry with w/c ratio not more than 0.62 to coat the sides 
and bottom of pit (the slurry should not be allowed to dry). While pouring fresh 
concrete, it shall be placed in central portion of the pit first and then worked 
towards edges ensuring complete vibrations including in the corners.
5.6.4	
Layout for repair of deep longitudinal cracks
The layout recommended for repair of deep longitudinal cracks again depends on the location 
of the crack with respect to the joints and free edges as per Fig. 5.6. Stitching or partial depth 
patching may be tried depending on the severity of the defect and behavior of the repair under 
traffic. Continuous longitudinal cracks intersecting with formed or sawn joints are again not 
acceptable in new construction and all the slabs affected should be replaced prior to “Taking 
Over” or repair may be carried out as per advice of Engineer-in­ Charge.

5.7	
Cutting and Removing Debris
	
a)	
Saw cutting and chipping are the operations required to remove the unsound 
concrete within the marked area and leaving a rectangular patch pit of uniform 
depth.
	
b)	
The sidewalls of the pit to be cut are usually specified as vertical and the vertical 
sections of the pit are rectangular.
	
c)	
Special care shall be taken not to damage the adjoining panels when chipping 
concrete in full-depth patches. For this purpose chipping of the slab concrete 
shall only take place after making a cut at a distance of 50 mm into the sound 
panels. Within this area additional saw cuts may be made to expedite removal 
of slab pieces as per Fig. 5.7. After the concrete inside the delineated area has 
been chipped and removed the remaining strip between cuts and joints can be 
safely removed.

If the repair extends up to the slab joint insert a piece of oiled shuttering ply in 
the adjacent joint(s) to avoid percolation of patching material in the joint.
5.8	
Saw Cutting and Lifting Procedure for Full Depth Repair and Whole Slab 
Replacement 
It comprises of the following procedure:-
	
a)	
The marked area is sawn with diamond blade saw in pieces or whole according 
to availability of crane or other machinery to lift and remove slab pieces as 
shown in Fig. 5.8.
	
b)	
The remaining pieces of slab left over tie bars and dowel bars is broken in such 
a way that the concrete in the adjacent good slab is not damaged.
	
c)	
Lifting the whole piece of concrete imparts no damage to the sub-base and 
is readily done. This method requires less labour than breaking the concrete 
before removing. Different types of equipment can be used to lift the slab or slab 
portion by means of a chain connected to lift pins: torque claw attachments for 
front-end loaders, forklift devices and vertical bridges.

Work Safety and Traffic Diversion
	
a)	
Before the repair work is carried out, the proper traffic diversion shall be planned 
and implemented in consultation with the Engineer-in-Charge having full regard 
to the statutory and contractual provisions for safety.
	
b)	
All signals required for traffic diversion and work safety shall be brought to the 
site and placed at appropriate sections and distances.
	
c)	
When the work is finished and curing completed all debris and traffic control 
measures shall be removed and normal traffic conditions restored (For details 
refer Chapter 15).
5.10	
Disposal of Dismantled Materials
The concrete dismantled during partial depth repair/full depth repair/grinding and grooving etc. 
shall be suitably disposed off as provided in the contract. In absence of any such provisions the 
MoRT&H specification clause 202 and IRC:121 should be followed. That is:-
	
a)	
The concrete should be broken to sizes not greater than 0.02 cum and stacked 
neatly in the ROW (Right of Way) for later reuse or till it is finally disposed of as 
per contract.
	
b)	
The chunks should be sorted into range of sizes, with larger chunks (less than 
0.02 cum in size) broken further by hand or put in the crusher to break them 
into smaller size particles so they can be reused as an recycled aggregate for 
nonstructural purpose. For example it can be:-
	
•	
Used in GSB by mixing 20% - 25% of the broken particles (75 mm down) 
with new material if required after satisfying necessary laboratory tests for 
the layer concerned.
	
•	
Mixed with gravel/moorum mixture for protecting the earthen shoulder after 
satisfying necessary laboratory tests.
	
•	
Used in the Dry Lean Concrete (DLC) or foundation levelling course (M-
10) after satisfying necessary laboratory tests.
	
•	
Used for the mechanical stabilization of weak soils after satisfying necessary 
laboratory tests.
	
c)	
Any unused material may be auctioned or disposed of according to the 
environmental rules and instructions of the Engineer.
6 CRACK SEALING AND JOINT RESEALING
6.1	
General
6.1.1	
This is a frequently applied preventive repair technique normally used as a part of 
periodic maintenance. If the edges of the crack are severely broken (spalled) the slab should 
be cut 30 mm deep on both sides of the crack at a distance of 10-12 mm each side. The 
concrete is removed between the cuts and the crack is filled with a fine epoxy resin mortar. 



======================================================================
PAGE 58 of 140
======================================================================
IRC:SP:83-2018
50
The pit is cleaned and prime coat is applied on sides and at the bottom of the pit. The pit is 
filled with Epoxy Concrete with 10 mm down aggregates. The cuts have dried as shown in Fig. 
6.1 (b). Crack widening and sealing follows the same work procedure as joint grooving and 
resealing.
6.1.2	
Different methods to seal and patch cracks are illustrated in Fig. 6.1 and are briefly 
described below:
	
a)	
Gravity application of low viscosity epoxy resin: Cracked area is first 
cleaned by blasting with air. A low viscosity, free flowing, fast curing epoxy resin 
can be applied from a plastic beaker or from end of a nail by gravity into cracks 
0.5 mm- 5 mm wide to secure broken concrete pieces together to prevent it 
from breaking out. Epoxy resin to be used should be with viscosity in range of 
300 centipoise @ 20°C and 110 centipoise @ 30°C. See Fig 6.1 (a).
	
b)	
Epoxy Resin Injection: Resin injection can be used to make structural repair 
of deep cracks, particularly corner breaks, by following the method described in 
MoRT&H Specification. The resin is injected at high pressure in previously bored 
holes along the crack. The resin fills the crack and sometimes the interface of 
the slab with the sub-base if the pressure is maintained for a long period. The 
broken slab is thus secured together and better supported by the sub-base. 
See Figs. 6.1 (b) and 6.1 (c). Care has to be taken not to fill the adjoining 
construction joints with resin. 
	
c)	
Retaining as a “Working Crack” with Elastomeric Sealant: Suitable as a 
short term measure at cracks which do not display faulting and rocking under 
the traffic load. Route along the crack to provide a uniform groove and apply an 
elastomeric sealant. The life expectancy will generally depend on the volume of 
the traffic and the condition of the sub-base.
6.1.3	
Overfilling of cracks or joints should be avoided as the residue will struck to the tyres 
of the vehicle which often leads to uprooting of entire sealant. This can be prevented by bevelling 
the edges of the joint. This will also eliminate edge spalling (FOD).
6.1.4	
Crack sealing between untied/bituminous shoulder shall be filled with a mixture of 
emulsion rejuvenator and topped off with sand.
6.1.5	
Low viscosity epoxy shall also be poured along the boundaries of the patch thus 
repaired with epoxy/epoxy mortar/epoxy concrete. Dry fine sand shall be spread over these. 
Different methods to seal/cracks are given in Fig. 6.1.

Joint Resealing
6.2.1	
Over time all types of joint sealants suffer distress. They lose flexibility, bond to the 
walls of the joint groove and may crack. The sealant may be subject to very harsh conditions. 
Accordingly the material selected for joint sealing, shall be capable of:
	
(i)	
Withstanding horizontal extension and compression and vertical shear;



======================================================================
PAGE 60 of 140
======================================================================
IRC:SP:83-2018
52
	
(ii)	
Withstanding climate •effects such as weathering by UV rays in some sealants, 
extreme temperatures and moisture;
	
(iii)	 Resisting penetration by stones and sand at high temperatures:
	
(iv)	 Maintaining strong bond to concrete sidewalls at specified temperatures.
	
(v)	
The sealants (polyurethane/silicone), should pass the hydrolysis test.
6.2.2	
Joints shall be resealed as necessary to minimize both infiltration of runoff water in 
the pavement structure and ingress of incompressible material in the joint groove as shown in 
Figs. 6.2 & 6.3.
6.2.3	
The commonly used sealant materials applicable specifications, the designed 
extension, shape factor and relative price are listed in Table 12.6 of Chapter 12. The manufacturer’s 
specifications shall be consulted to check the required maximum allowable service extension 
that the sealant material can sustain without damage and if a primer is required to improve the 
bond between sealant and concrete.
6.2.4	
The joint groove dimensions should be selected after determination of the expected 
joint movement resulting from temperature changes. The shape factor is defined as the ratio 
of depth to width of sealant in the joint groove. Too narrow grooves may originate extension 
failure of the sealant or loss of bond with the groove walls. Manufacturers of silicone sealants 
recommend a minimum thickness of 6 mm and a maximum thickness of 13 mm because wider 
joints are prone to spalling. For narrow joints compression seals may also be used as per clause 
8.1 of IRC:15 (EVA and PE) apart from other pouring sealant.

Fig. 6.3 Typical Detail of Field Moulded Joint Sealants
6.2.5	
The groove saw cut depth must provide for the sealant depth, the compressed backer 
rod thickness, and the depth that the sealant surface is to be recessed and extra depth to 
account for variability of the saw depth as shown in Fig. 6.3.
6.2.6	
The service life of joints depends on the care taken to prepare the joint and install 
the sealant. The service life of joint seals also varies with the type of sealant. A typical hot-pour 
sealant provides an average of 2 to 3 years of life after proper installation. Some low-modulus 
or PVC and coal tars can perform well past 8 years. Polysulphide sealants perform well for up to 
4 to 5 years according to experience on the National Highway Development Project (NHDP) to 
date. Silicone sealants perform well for periods exceeding 10 to 12 years. 
Compression seals normally provide service for periods often exceeding 15 years and sometimes 
20 years. Further study of the issues of adhesion, temperature, UV radiation and theft (theft 
due to improper application of seals & poor quality of adhesive) is required here in India. But 
the most important condition is that the joint be clean and dry when reapplying the sealant 
(adhesive in case of compression seals). Also, some materials are unsuitable for bonding to 
fresh concrete and so technical advice should be sought from sealant manufacturers regarding 
the recommended minimum concrete age at the time of installation. Normally it is not before 21 
days of paving.
6.2.7	
Joints sealants should be replaced when they are defective or reach the end of their 
service life and do not prevent ingress of water any more. Simply pouring new sealant in the 
old joint will not restore the latter. The old joint shall be completely removed, the joint groove 
cleaned and groove walls to be roughened and the new joint material properly placed, after 
priming as per manufacture’s instructions. This work must be performed under dry conditions 
and preferably scheduled in the hotter months of the year.
6.2.8	
When the joints are spalled, compression seals should not be used before its proper 
repair because they would tend to twist or move up and down in the joint at locations where the 
joint walls are not vertical and uniformly smooth. (After repairing the spalled portion, compression 
seal can be used for resealing of joints).
6.2.9	
The sealant is applied after insertion of a backer rod in the groove. Backer rod keeps 
off the fluid sealant from sinking in the groove and bonding to the bottom of the groove (Prevents 



======================================================================

54
3 point adhesion). They shall be flexible, compressible, undergo no shrinkage, repel water and 
not react with the sealant. The rod diameter should be at least 25% larger than the joint width, 
so that it fits tightly in the groove.
6.3	
Method for Repairing the Flexible Joint Sealant
	
(1) 	 Select the material and method of applying the liquid sealant, taking necessary 
approval from the Engineer-in-Charge.
	
(2)	
Materials from the compression joints can be removed manually by pulling out 
after cutting it by 0 running a knife blade along the faces of the wall or running 
a saw cutting machine with worn/used blades or by ploughing. Most sealants 
can be very effectively removed by ploughing (raking). V -shaped plough/rake 
should not be used. Rectangular plough/rakes cause very little damage to the 
joint groove faces. The plough/rake should pass at least twice cleaning one 
joint face during the first pass and the other joint face during the second pass. 
Ploughing should remove at least 95% of the old sealant material.
	
(3)	
Joint materials are removed and disposed properly. Some materials may require 
hazardous or specialised waste disposal methods.
	
(4)	
Width of groove and shape of the groove is improved for the new material as 
per provision of IRC:57. The groove shall be shaped by sawing with a diamond 
blade. This is an efficient method for ensuring complete removal of old sealant. 
Reshaping the old groove may be required for improving or modifying the shape 
factor and can be done by cutting with dry or wet diamond blades. In many 
cases blades are ganged side by side on the blade arbour with a metal spacer 
to allow the saw to reface both joints to a uniform width in one pass. However, 
some sticky sealants such as PVC and coal tar can clog the diamond blade. The 
refacing of the groove shall be kept to an absolute minimum in order to keep the 
joint groove from becoming too wide, which may lead to risk of extra damage 
and spalling at the joint.
	
(5)	
Edges of the joint groove are chamfered to improve the durability of the sealant 
and the profile (Fig. 6.4). Minor spalls along the joint faces do not inhibit 
performance of most sealants but some patching may be needed for larger 
spalls. These spalled grooves shall be patched before proceeding with groove 
cleaning.

IRC:SP:83-2018
	
(6)	
The groove faces of the joint are cleaned thoroughly. This is the most important 
task of joint sealing. Groove faces require a thorough cleaning to ensure 
sealant adhesion and long term good performance. Dirt, dust or traces of the 
old joint material shall not remain on the joint faces after cleaning. Joints wider 
than 10 mm are easy to clean. Cleaning of narrow joints of 6 mm width or less 
is very difficult and shall be carefully performed.
	
Note:	Using chemical solvents for cleaning is not allowed because they can leave 
contaminants in the pores of the groove faces that will inhibit bonding of the new 
sealant. Proper cleaning combining mechanical action with water flushing is required.
	
(7)	
The saw slurry and any cleaning chemical residues shall be washed away 
immediately after sawing in a single direction.
	
(8)	
The groove faces are sandblasted one by one when the joint is dry. The 
sandblast is done by holding nozzle close to the surface at an angle with the 
surface. Sandblast removes residues of the old sealant and provides surface 
texture to improve sealant adhesion. Alternatively when compression seals 
are to be used the sidewalls may be prepared by grinding or wire brushing. 
	
(9)	
The joint and pavement surface is air blasted to remove any remaining sand and 
dust, ensuring the compressor is blasting clean air without oil contamination 
prior to air blasting . If not, an oil and moisture filter is required or the insertion 
of oil in the air by the compressor shall be discontinued.
	
(10)	 The surrounding pavement is kept clean by use of a vacuum sweeper or 
broom.
	
(11)	 The compressible backer rod is installed to give the correct shape and depth to 
the sealant. The backer rod material shall be compatible with the liquid sealant 
and have a diameter about 25% larger than the groove width. Backer rods 
shall be forced into the groove uniformly to the desired depth. Many methods 
have been used including poking in with a screwdriver that may damage the 
surface of the rod and automated equipment. The best tool is the steel or non-
metallic roller with two lateral wheels supported by the pavement surface and 
a central insertion wheel that can be changed to match different depths. Good 
practice is to roll the insertion wheel over the Backer Rod twice in opposite 
directions.

56
	
(12)	 Groove sidewalls are checked that these are free of dust and dirt before 
pumping/pouring the sealant. The joint should be cleaned again if any traces of 
contamination are found.
	
(13)	 The primer is applied to the dry side walls of the groove according to the 
recommendations of the manufacturer. The durability of priming depends on 
climatic conditions. Ref IRC:57
	
(14)	 Installation requirements are different for each type of sealant. Recommendations 
from the concerned/selected manufacturer should be followed. Manufacturers 
also provide mobile equipment to melt and pump the hot sealant into pavement 
joints and also to apply cold applied sealant material.
	
(15)	 The liquid joint sealant is installed at the proper temperature recommended by 
the manufacturer. When the sealant is at the right temperature about 250 ml 
(1/4 litre) of cold sealant should be discarded from the pumping unit hoses and 
nozzle before installation begins. The nozzle shall be introduced in the groove 
to fill the sealant from bottom and reduce chances of entrapping air. Instead of 
pushing the nozzle, the operator shall draw it towards himself to achieve a more 
uniform cross section and less voids. The groove shall not be filled to the top, 
The sealant surface shall be recessed 2 ± 1 mm from the pavement surface. 
Tool the polysulphide sealant with a wooden spatula after 10 minutes and then 
apply more sealant, if needed. The nozzle shall be sized to match the groove 
width and no moisture should be allowed in the latter.
	
(16)	 Low-modulus silicone sealants are not self-levelling and require tooling within 
10 minutes of installation before they begin to “break/cure” and form a skin. A 
tool or a backer rod strip is drawn over the fresh sealant to force it in contact with 
the sidewalls at the top of the groove and produce a concave shape.
	
(17)	 Moist grooves shall be previously first dried to avoid boiling of water in contact 
with the liquid sealant which may inhibit adherence.
	
(18)	 When transverse joints are sealed with silicone and longitudinal joints are sealed 
with hot­ pour sealants, silicone shall be applied first because it is viscous and 
will only slightly penetrate the longitudinal joints.
	
(19)	 Finally check sealant adhesion to the sidewalls by pushing down a knife blade 
along the groove sidewalls.
	
(20)	 Check the curing of silicone sealant after 2 to 3 weeks by removing a small 50 
mm long specimen of sealant and stretching about 50% for 10 seconds. A fairly 
fast and uniform relaxation of the specimen indicates adequate curing. Slow 
rebound and curling indicates differential curing. To take advantage of good 
adherence of the silicone material to itself use the same brand of sealant to 
repair the gap from which the sealant specimen was cut.

Compression Seals

Defects in compression seals generally comprises:
	
a)	
Failure of the bond with the groove walls
	
b)	
Pulling out/theft by vandals

6.4.2	
Reinstatement of compression seals comprises of the following:
	
1.	
The joint side walls are inspected for raveling, spalling and other irregularities 
that could reduce the seal’s lateral pressure and originate seal extrusion or 
popping out from the joint. Repair damaged sections before installation of the 
compression seal.
	
2.	
Any burrs along the sawed joint are removed by dragging a blunt, pointed tool 
along sawed joints. This removes sharp edges which if left untreated may make 
the seal installation difficult. A mechanized wire brush can also be used for this 
purpose.
	
3.	
This type of operation shall be done only where needed and before cleaning the 
groove.
	
4.	
Lubricant/adhesive is applied to the seal edges and/or groove sidewalls.
	
5.	
The compression seal as shown in Fig. 6.6 (a) is installed taking care not to 
stretch the seal more than 2-3% during installation. Stretching by more than 
5% could be detrimental and later on may cause sealant to break into pieces. 
Special attention shall also be paid to avoid twisting and nicking in addition to 
stretching. To monitor sealant stretching lay a length of sealant parallel to the 
joint and cut a piece of seal with the same length. The piece of seal is extracted 
and its length is measured after relaxation, stretch in percent is calculated.
	
6.	
Improper adhesive may cause failure of compression seal as shown in 
Fig. 6.6 (b).
6.4.3	
The Fig. 6.7 (a) shows that the liquid sealant has failed in adhesion and is missing 
in parts. This gap gets filled up with refuse, dust, aggregates and all other filthy materials. If 
movement is restricted or materials enter the joints, excessive stress develop, resulting in 
development of defects and plying of traffic further enhance the problem. Due to these unfilled 
open joints, potholes may start developing leading to the spalling of the transverse joints and 
cracks at joints. Figs 6.7 (b) and 6.7 (c) show sand blasting the groove walls and subsequent 
clearing with compressed air jet. Fig. 6.8 shows further pictures in sequence of the method for 
repair of joint sealants.

7 CRACK STITCHING (CROSS STITCHING)
7.1	
General
7.1.1	
Crack stitching with inclined tie bars (cross-stitching) or U-bars (stapling) may be used 
for full depth longitudinal cracks in reasonably good condition i.e. the width of crack is less than 



======================================================================
PAGE 67 of 140
======================================================================
59
IRC:SP:83-2018
3 mm and length is more than 1 m in order to arrest movement of slabs and slab pieces. Stitching 
maintains aggregate interlock, prevents the crack from vertical and horizontal movement or 
widening and provides added reinforcement and strength. Table 4.5 shall be referred to for 
selecting suitable cases for this type of repair.
7.1.2	
Cross-stitching serves the same purpose as tie bars and bent tie bars (stapling) but 
requires less surface disruption than the installing tie bars.
7.1.3	
Cross-Stitching shall not be used as an alternative for treating cracks that are severely 
deteriorated/spalled. It is normally used for the treatment of narrow longitudinal and diagonal 
cracks which do not display spalling or other types of distress. Full depth transverse cracks 
which have assumed the role of an adjacent joint should not be stitched. Stitching will not allow 
joint movement (open and closure), so a new crack is likely to develop near a stitched working 
crack or the concrete will spall over the reinforcing bars and along the crack. For safety measure, 
the longitudinal joint(s) adjacent to the cross stitched slab, should be cleaned thoroughly and 
resealed for effective joint movement. In such cases otherwise, dowel bar retrofit, full depth 
repair or whole slab replacement should be used depending on alignment and position of the 
crack.
7.2	
Methodology for Cross Stitching
The cross-stitching procedure is illustrated in Figs. 7.1 & 7.2. The same is as follows:
	
(i)	
Preliminary vertical holes (diameter Ø = 36 - 45 mm), 30 mm deep are drilled 
in an alternating pattern at 500 mm - 750 mm spacing apart, where the inclined 
hole starts to facilitate its drilling.
	
(ii)	
Alternate inclined holes (12 to 20 mm) at an angle of about 30° to 40° from the 
slab surface normal to the line of the crack are drilled; the length of the holes 
shall be equal to 1.7 times slab thickness. The holes should be spaced as for 
(1) above and alternate from each side of the crack. Whilst a 500 spacing is 
generally recommended, a 750 mm spacing is adequate for light traffic and 
lightly loaded inner highway lanes. For heavy traffic and outer lanes, a spacing 
of 500 mm c/c is preferred. The dimensions and spacing also depend on the 
slab thickness in a similar manner as dowel bars.
	
(iii)	 The holes are cleaned thoroughly using oil-free compressed air.
	
(iv)	 The hole is filled with epoxy resin/elastomeric concrete in enough quantity for 
the bar to be completely coated when inserted in the hole.
	
(v)	
A high yield deformed epoxy coated reinforcing bar (12-16 mm) is placed 
conforming with IS:1786 & IS: l3620 in every hole.
	
(vi)	 A groove shall be made along the line of cracks displaying spalling and filled with 
a low viscosity resin, fine epoxy mortar or elastomeric cement as appropriate as 
per Para 6.1.1.

Fig. 7.1 Typical Arrangement for Cross Stitching with 12 mm Dia Straight Bars
Fig. 7.2 Drilling Inclined Holes with Angle Template
7.3	
Methodology for Stapling
Stapling or slot stitching is a technique used to provide positive mechanical interconnection 
at longitudinal crack or joint between two slabs or segments. 16 to 20 mm dia epoxy coated 
U-shaped deformed bars placed in the slots hold the segment together, serving to maintain 
aggregate interlock and provide added reinforcement and strength (Fig. 7.3). These bars prevent 
further migration of slabs. Larger diameter bars may also serve the function of load transfer. The 
procedure for the same is as follows:
	
1.	
Mark the position of vertical holes of dia 30 mm at a distance of 228 mm from 
the crack at a spacing of 600 mm c/c.

2.	
Drill 30 mm dia holes upto maximum depth of D/2.
	
3.	
Cut the slots of 30 mm width and of a depth of 50 mm less than the depth of 
drilled holes.
	
4.	
Remove debris and clean the slots and the holes.
	
5.	
Roughen the sides of holes and slots by sand blasting/sand paper.
	
6.	
Insert U-shaped deformed steel staple bars into the slots and anchor the ends 
into holes with high modulus epoxy.
	
7.	
Fill the slot with 1:3 epoxy-sand mortar or elastomeric concrete upto 10 mm 
above the top surface of staple bar. Vibrate or tamp the mix to ensure proper 
compaction of the material surrounding the staple.
	
8.	
Fill the remaining volume of the slot with non-shrinkable concrete or any other 
equivalent material upto the top level of PQC and finish it properly.

7.4	
Methodology for Slot Stitching
Slot-stitching (Fig. 7.4) is a repair technique for longitudinal cracks and joints. It provides 
mechanical interconnection between two slabs or segments on opposite sides of longitudinal 
joint or crack respectively. The deformed steel bars placed in the slots not only hold the segments 
together to maintain aggregate interlocking but also provide added reinforcement and strength 
to the joint or crack. Bars provided into slots also prevent horizontal and vertical movement of 
segments at crack or joint. Larger dia bars (> 25 mm) also help load transfer across the joint or 
crack. Slot-stitching involves the following steps:
	
1.	
Cut slots approximately perpendicular to the longitudinal joint or crack using a 
saw cut or any other machine.
	
2.	
Remove the concrete and clean the slot. Prevent concrete debris from entering 
into the joint or crack.
	
3.	
Place deformed 16 mm to 20 mm dia bars into slots.
	
4.	
Fill the slot with non-shrinkable or very low shrinkage material.
	
5.	
Finish flush with the surface and cure as per the curing instructions for the 
material.

Cross Stitching Vs Slot Stitching
Both the methods of cross stitching and slot stitching are effective in preventing the widening 
and maintaining aggregate interlocking at longitudinal joint or crack. However, cross stitching 
has following advantages over slot-stitching:
	
a)	
Cross stitching is less intrusive and less damaging to the slab.
	
b)	
Repaired surface area exposure is less. Only drilled circular holes are visible on 
surface.
	
c)	
Quantity of backfill material is less.
Thus, cross-stitching is less expensive repair option than slot-stitching. However, the selection 
of repair methodology should be evaluated on the basis of strength, installation time and cost at 
the project site. 
As mentioned before after crack stitching, it is very important to treat the adjacent longitudinal 
joint. If there exists a functional crack in the joint, the joint needs to be cleaned, treated for any 
spalling and resealed. In case of drifted slabs, the joint shall be filled with suitable fillers to avoid 
through penetration of water, a compressible filler board may be compressed & inserted in the 
joint along with a cement grout. Photographic process illustration
8 PARTIAL-DEPTH REPAIR
8.1	
General
Partial-depth patches are provided for majority of surface distresses at joints, cracks, and mid 
slab locations that are within the upper half of the slab. The most common distress type requiring 
partial-depth repair is spalling as shown in Fig. 8.1, but partial-depth repair can also be used for 
restoring small areas like popouts, potholes and corner breaks as shown in Fig. 8.2. Table 4.5 
shall be referred to for selecting suitable cases for this type of repair.
For severe, shallow and surface defects, spalling is typically a random and localized distress. 
Surface spalls create a rough ride and can accelerate development of further distress. Partial-

IRC:SP:83-2018
depth patches replace unsound concrete by fresh concrete to restore surface evenness and 
arrest further deterioration. They also provide proper edges for resealing joints and sealing 
cracks & reduce occurrence of Foreign Object Damage (FOD).
Joint edge spalls mostly result from poor workmanship (compaction and or finishing) whilst 
starting the next day’s work at a construction joint, penetration of incompressible materials in the 
joint groove and slab curling and warping, dowel bar lockup, dowel bar out-socketing or when 
reinforcement is too close to the surface of the pavement. Partial depth patching can only repair 
spalls in the upper half of the slab, when load transfer devices, dowels are in good condition.

Selection of Repair Material
Material selection for partial-depth repairs should consider the following factors: mixing time and 
required equipment, working time, temperature range for placement, curing time, aggregate 
requirements, repair area moisture conditions, cost, repair size, and bonding requirements. The 
choice of materials should be such that, it should serve the purpose with prolonged strength & 
functionality in the most cost effective way. Typical properties of cementitious repair materials 
are given in Table 8.1. Refer Chapter 12 for more information.

Methodology for Partial Depth Repairs (PDR)
Partial depth repairs can be used for repair of Potholes, Popouts, Corner Breakage, Edge 
Breakage, Joint Spalling or any other type of surface defect which may be encountered in rigid 
pavements.
The standard methodology for partial depth repairs can be summarized as below:
	
i)	
Identification & Marking out of Repair Boundaries
	
ii)	
Removal of affected concrete
	
iii)	
Cleaning & Preparation of Patch
	
iv)	
Application of Pre-coat/Primer/Bonding Agent
	
v)	
Placing & Finishing of Repair material
	
vi)	
 Application of Seal Coat
	
vii)	
Curing of Repair Patch
	
viii)	 Joint Re-sealing
	
ix)	
Allowance of Traffic
(i) 
Identification and Marking of Repair Boundaries
Before commencement of work, the general survey of repair area should be done. The affected 
area is checked for extent of spread of unsound concrete either by using steel rod/hammer 
sounding test or by running a heavy steel chain across the affected area. The unsound concrete 
produces a hollow or dull thud whereas sound concrete shall produce a sharp metallic ring with 
adequate rebound. The limits of unsound concrete are fixed using this method. The boundary 
of the proposed cut is fixed 50 mm deep in the sound concrete so as to ensure that no unsound 
concrete is left out.



======================================================================
PAGE 73 of 140
======================================================================
65
IRC:SP:83-2018
Partial-depth patches are usually very small. Each patch usually covers an area less than 1 m2•. 
The area to be repaired as stated earlier, shall extend 50 mm beyond the limits of unsound 
concrete generated by hammer sounding survey and be at least 100 mm x 250 mm (in plan) x 
depth of patch/minimum depth. The depth is normally in the range of 65 mm (+/-15 mm) for epoxy 
mortar/polymer/elastomeric concrete type repair or 40 mm deep (+/- 10 mm) for elastomeric 
concrete (See Fig. 8.3). For depth more than 80 mm, the patch should be repaired with M 40 
grade Concrete made with 10 mm down aggregates. Shallower patches have a tendency to 
break up and breakout under traffic. Small steel studs cut from reinforcing bar may be drilled and 
epoxied into place in an approximate grid pattern (100 mm x 100 mm) to provide an extra key 
effect similar as shown for the treatment of popouts as shown in Fig. 8.4. The repair boundaries 
should be kept square or rectangular and irregular shapes should be avoided.
Fig. 8.3 Repair of Shallow Cracking and Spalling Near the Joints
(ii)	
Removal of Affected Concrete
The removal can be accomplished either by saw & chip method or by cold milling the affected 
portion. In saw & chip method, the upper 50 mm of the concrete (or deeper if the spall is wide but 
not deeper than one third of the slab thickness) is saw cut parallel to the joint on the perimeter 
around the repair area. In case one of the patch area faces is a sealed joint, the saw should 
be run through the sealed joint to obtain a clean vertical surface for repair. Additional cuts may 
be made within the repair area to speed up chipping. The concrete should be removed with an 
electronic chipper/hammer not more than 10 Kg in weight. The area upto the bottom of the cut 
patch shall be chipped and removed. The repair area is chipped about 10 mm deeper into the 
sound concrete. After finishing of chipping the debris shall be removed and the patch shall be 
inspected using hammer sounding test to check for any more unsound concrete faces.



======================================================================
PAGE 74 of 140
======================================================================
IRC:SP:83-2018
66
In case the spalls are observed to extend beyond half depth of pavement or to full depth of the 
pavement, the patch should be fixed using full depth repair technique. The patch shall not expose 
any dowel bar or reinforcement. If a dowel bar or reinforcement is exposed the surrounding 
concrete shall be completely removed to at least 25 mm below the bar or wire as shown in 
Fig. 8.3 for typical layouts. The upper/unsound concrete layer between the joint and saw cut is 
chipped out; by manual or mechanical chipping. Loose materials is removed from the pit of the 
patch and clean the repair area.
(iii)	
Cleaning and Preparation of Patches
The pit surface is cleaned eliminating all dust and exposing the concrete grain texture: (a) check 
the air blown by the compressor for oil and moisture with the help of a cloth; (b) sandblast the 
surface to remove dirt, oil, residual unsound concrete and laitance and to improve texture; (c) air 
blast the surface to complete cleaning; (d) check the prepared surface for cleanliness by rubbing 
across with the hand or a cloth; if the pit is not immediately patched, cleaning operations shall 
be repeated. As a minimum, the patch should be air blown, cleaned using high pressure water 
jet & then dry air blown.
The patch pit is again checked for unsound concrete before starting the patch. If unsound 
concrete is detected it should be removed and the pit cleaned again by air blasting.
During spall/corner break repair, the existing joint groove shall be protected against leaking of 
fresh resin or cement mortar repair compound that could build bridges between the two slabs. If 
non­ flexible patch material is used an oiled piece of ply-board or a compressible synthetic filler 
board of thickness that can be compressed to the pre-existing joint width be placed to form a 
bond breaker in the adjacent joint(s) to avoid penetration of patching material in the joint. The 
bond breaker should be inserted 25 mm deeper than the patch, have the same upper level as 
the slab and a scored top strip. Laterally the bond breaker should extend 75 mm on both sides 
of the patch. The bond breaker should be slightly thicker that the joint opening and be slightly 
compressed after installation. Latex caulking can be used to seal any gaps between the bond 
breaker and the joint opening.
(iv)	
Application of Pre-Coat/Primer/Bonding Agent
This is the most critical process that governs the bonding of repair compound with parent 
concrete. The bonding agent (water-cement slurry, resin etc.) is mixed carefully according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions. The bonding agent is applied using a hard bristle brush to the 
walls of patch area, evenly in a uniform coat & it should not be allowed to collect in pockets. The 
bonding agent should be in appropriate consistency/tacky when the patching operation starts. 
Some special kind of propriety materials do not require application of bonding agent prior to 
placing of patch material.
(v)	
Placing & Finishing of Repair Compound
The patching mix is prepared using a small drum or paddle-type mixers with capacity of about 
0.2 m3. A small Jiffy mixer may be used for smaller patches. Aggregates and binder may be 
previously weighed and bagged. Mixing times and proportions are strictly observed. Too long 
mixing will reduce the time that is available to patch.



======================================================================
PAGE 75 of 140
======================================================================
67
IRC:SP:83-2018
The patch materials are placed by slightly overfilling the pit to allow for volume reduction during 
compaction/screeding. Aggregate mixes shall be placed with a shovel, because dumping from 
buckets or wheelbarrows causes’ segregation. Cementitious mixes •shall be vibrated to release 
entrapped air. The vibrator shall be held at 15°- 30° from the vertical and lifted up and down 
until the whole patch is covered. It should not be moved horizontally in the patch. Some patches 
may be too small for the use of internal vibrating needles and vibrating screeds. Rodding and 
tamping or cutting with a trowel or other small hand tool is acceptable. Some polymer mixes 
including epoxy mixes which have high heat of hydration, should, in certain adverse conditions, 
be placed in several 38 mm to 50 mm thick lifts with waiting times between lifts as recommended 
by manufacturers.
The finishing area should be finished to the cross section of the existing pavement without leaving 
excess material on the adjacent pavement surface. The recommended finishing procedure is to 
screed/trowel from the center of the patch area to the patch boundaries. By moving the screed/
trowel toward the patch boundaries, the material is pushed toward the interface to increase the 
potential for high bond strength. After finishing, the patch should be textured/tined using brush to 
approximately match the surface finish of the existing adjacent concrete pavement. For higher 
accuracy levels, the operation is followed by grinding of the pavement area.
In case there are any saw-cut run outs, they should be filled using the repair material. Leaving 
them unattended may cause ingress of moisture/water and incompressible materials which shall 
delaminate and de-bond the patching material.
(vi)	
Application of Bonding Coat
An important procedure in placement of partial-depth repairs is sealing the patch/slab interface. 
After the material has gained sufficient strength. The patch/slab interface is coated with 1:1 
cement : sand motor having WC ratio 0.4 to 0.62. This paste will act as a bonding agent between 
the old and new concrete. After putting the fresh concrete in the partial depth repair cavity the 
same is properly compacted. 
(vii)	
Curing of Repair Patch
Proper curing of partial-depth repairs is very important due to the large surface of small patches 
compared to the volume of patch material, as well as the fact that concrete gains bond strength 
much slower than it gains compressive strength. This relationship is conducive to quick moisture 
loss and is different from most other concrete applications. Proper curing generally employs 
the application of curing compound at the time bleed water has evaporated from the surface. 
Because curing is critical for partial-depth patches, the first 24 hours should be wet cured with 
gunny bag. Proprietary patch materials shall be cured as recommended by the manufacturers. 
Some require some type of moist curing whereas others need application of specific curing 
compounds and a few others may be air-cured.
(viii)	
Joint Resealing
Resealing the repair joint is important, because it will help prevent moisture and incompressible 
material from causing further damage. It is important that the new transverse and longitudinal 
joints constructed within the patch area be formed or sawed to provide the proper joint seal

reservoir, and match surrounding joints. The joint faces must be clean and dry for good sealant 
performance.
(ix) 
Allowance of Traffic
Compressive strength requirements for paving concrete are generally specified at M40 at 28 
days. The repair concrete should develop an equal or greater strength by the time it receives 
traffic loadings. However, to minimize lane closures, traffic loadings may be allowed on a patched 
area when the repair concrete has attained the minimum strength needed to assure its structural 
integrity. The compressive strength required for the opening of partial-depth repairs to traffic may 
be lowered because of their lateral confinement and shallow depth.
The specifications of rapid-setting proprietary mixes should be checked for recommended 
opening times. Cylinders or beams can be tested for strength to determine what opening time 
will allow the repair material to develop enough strength.

Methodology for Repairing Popouts
This procedure as illustrated in Fig. 8.4 excludes saw cutting the boundaries of the patch and is 
typically required for treatment of popouts/potholes and spalling.

IRC:SP:83-2018
The procedure is as follows:
	
(i)	
Chipping starts in the middle of the patch and progresses to the borders. The chisel 
point shall be directed towards the inside of the patch at about 45°. Hand tools or a 
light electric chiseling machine of 6.8 kg maximum with spade bit may be used.
	
(ii)	
Drill and epoxy grout in stud.
	
(iii)	 Prime with low viscosity epoxy on bottom and vertical sides.
	
(iv)	 Fill the patch with epoxy mortar (1:3).
This procedure has the following advantages:
	
a.	
The rough vertical edge promotes bonding.
	
b.	
There are no saw overcuts.
	
c.	
Fewer steps and smaller crew than for the saw and chip procedure.
	
d.	
Spalling is controlled by using the 6.8 kg jackhammer.
	
e.	
May be faster than the saw and chip procedure if mechanical tools are used.
	
f.	
A saw is only needed for joint sawing, which is a different work.
This procedure has the following disadvantages:
	
a.	
Sound concrete may be damaged by heavy hammers.
	
b.	
Jackhammers can cause feathered edges.

Potential Problems with Partial Depth Repairs (PDR)
Partial-depth repairs are generally susceptible to failure over a period of time. The causes of 
failure of partial depth patches can be design, material or construction related failure of a large 
epoxy patch and cementitious patch.
8.5.1	
Design-related causes of large partial-depth patch failures are the following:
	
a.	
Exclusion of some deteriorated concrete from repaired area.
	
b.	
Incompatible climate conditions materials or procedures.
	
c.	
Thermal incompatibility between repair mixes and the slab concrete.
	
d.	
Climatic conditions during the service life that are beyond capability of repair 
materials.
	
e.	
Inadequate cure time after the repair.
	
f.	
Inadequate opening time after the repair.
	
g. 	
Incompatibility between joint bond breaker and sealant material.
8.5.2	
Construction-related causes of shallow partial-depth patch failures are the following: 
	
a.	
Failure to square the hole.
	
b.	
Deteriorated materials not completely removed.
	
c.	
Inadequate cleaning, namely laitance (sawing slurry) adhering to surface.
	
d.	
Lack of bond (poor surface coating or inappropriate surface condition)
	
e.	
Failure to re-establish compression failure.
	
f.	
Variability of repair material.
	
g.	
Insufficient compaction of fresh patch mixture.
Full depth repair is the recommended choice during the construction stage for minimizing risk of 
dealing with this type of failure after 2-3 years traffic or less.
Epoxy mortar is susceptible to brittleness over a period of time when exposed in large areas 
to UV or direct sunlight. Epoxy mortar may be modified by adding at-least 5% poly-sulphide 
polymer in the epoxy resin. Such formulation will improve the life of the mortar by giving some 
flexibility and improving UV resistance. As much as possible cementious based repair compounds 
shall be used for repair of partial depth repairs as they do not possess the above problems as 
encountered in epoxy mortars and are also bond to parent concrete in a better way. For more 
information regarding materials kindly refer Chapter 12.
8.6	
Problem associated with Longitudinal Tining
Tining is the preferred method for texturing fresh concrete. It is generally provided transversely 
but can be applied longitudinally also. Longitudinal tining is new to India and has been adopted 
in certain projects under NHDP. Certain observations have been made after passing of traffic 
after relatively short period of time (less than 4 months). The edges get abraded in the wheel 
path and shallow spalling develops at irregular interval along the pavement. This affects the 
surface evenness and riding quality. (Refer Fig. 8.6).

9.1	
General
This is the ultimate repair treatment. Table 4.5 shall be referred to for selecting suitable cases 
for this type of repair. If this treatment does not succeed an overlay is to be used either along or 
alone with full depth repair. The procedures to be followed for whole slab replacement are broadly 
similar to full depth repair as described in this Chapter. Full depth repair may be considered as 
the preferred repair option in the following situations:
	
(i)	
Partial depth repair has failed
	
(ii)	
The cross-stitched longitudinal joint has again failed
	
(iii)	 The crack which was less than D/2 has propagated more than D/2 or full depth 
and the slabs across the crack are rocking
	
(iv)	 The slab has shattered and can no longer support the load of traffic
	
(v)	
The spalling along the joint or crack is more than 50% depth of slab thickness
	
(vi)	 The corner break is down to full depth
	
(vii)	 Failure of pavement due to dowel bar locking and serious cracks along the joint 
have developed
	
(viii)	 Blow-up at expansion joint.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:83-2018
72
Full-depth repair entails removing and replacing at least a portion of a slab down up to the 
bottom of the concrete. Full-depth repair improves pavement surface evenness and structural 
integrity and extends the pavement service life. The most common problem that requires 
full-depth repair is cracking full width near the joints and joint deterioration. This includes 
blow-up and any cracking, breaking, or spalling of slab edges on either side of a transverse 
or longitudinal joint. Often, spalling takes place on the bottom of the concrete slab and may 
not be visible from the surface. Spalls that extend 75 mm to 150 mm from the joint are an 
indication that additional spalling could exist below and would require full-depth patching 
(Refer Fig. 9.1).
Full-depth repair is also necessary to repair any deep comer breaks or any slabs with more 
than one intersecting full depth crack. The latter may result from lack of uniform support 
or inadequate structural strength. Most full-depth repairs cover an area of more than 2 m2. 
Their minimum dimension in longitudinal or transverse direction should be 1.5 m. For multiple 
corner breaks or slabs with intersecting cracks, their size may correspond to the area of an 
entire slab. Before full-depth patching the sub-base and separation layer shall be reinstated 
as required. (Fig. 9.2)
9.2	
Replacement of a Portion of a Slab Comprises the following Tasks:
	
(i)	
The area to be treated is marked according to the guidelines in para 5.6 and 
5.7 in Chapter 5. Inspection of the area for unsound & sound concrete should 
be made by sounding hammer method, by placing a straight edge & checking 
deflection or by core tests. (Ref Fig. 9.5)
	
(ii)	
The materials and procedure are selected for patching in consultation with the 
Engineer. The patch mixes for full-depth repairs often use ordinary or rapid 
hardening Portland cement as per the need and also proprietary cement that gain 
strength early (Appendix B). A job mix design shall be tested in the laboratory 
with a target slump of 20 - 40 mm. To decrease the water-cement ratio a water-
reducing admixture plasticizer/super plasticizer may be required for Grade 43 or 
Grade 53 cement (IRC:44-2017 may be referred for mix design).
	
(iii) 	 The portion to be replaced is cut out and removed. The perimeter of the 
area to be repaired shall be cut with a concrete saw to the specified depth. 
Transverse perimeter cuts are first made around the boundary of the repair 
down to about a quarter(1/4th) to a third (1/3rd) of the slab thickness (See 
Fig. 9.1). Separate full depth cuts are then made for removal of the slab. The 
concrete between the two cuts provides a buffer to prevent undercut spalling 
and allows chipping for exposing the steel dowel/tie bar reinforcement. 
Always cut toward the shoulder so that any shear forces developed from 
the compression of the slabs get concentrated and relieved in the paved 
shoulder portion. After removal of the slab through lift or break-and-remove 
method, the quality of DLC is inspected for any cracks, deterioration, 
settlement or damages. Necessary core tests may be conducted to validate 
functional existence of the DLC. If found unsatisfactory, the DLC should be 
cut & removed. Similarly checks shall continue for next layer until intercepted 
layer seems satisfactory.

Fig. 9.1 Buffer Cuts for Protecting Repair Perimeters from Undercut Spalling
	
(iv)	 The advantages of sawing patch boundaries include the following:
	
a)	
The saw leaves vertical edge faces
	
b)	
During breaking the patch area is isolated within the sawed boundaries 
and the risk of damage in the adjacent slab areas is therefore minimized. 
Full depth saw overcuts should end within this buffer area.
	
c)	
Spalling of adjacent slab areas is also minimized
	
d)	
Breaking, chipping and removing debris within the sawed boundary is 
usually easier and faster
	
(v)	
The disadvantages of sawing patch boundaries include the following:
	
a)	
More workers are required than for other procedures
	
b)	
Water used to cool the saw-wheel saturates the repair area and drying 
time may delay the work
	
c)	
Saw polished vertical patch boundaries provide poor bonding. This 
is alleviated by manual chiselling or by means of light jackhammers or 
roughening by sand-blasting the polished sides.
	
(vi)	 Holes are drilled for dowel bars or tie bars in the edge walls of the remaining 
slab portion (Fig. 9.2). Rather than single hand-held drills, it is better to provide 
enough space for using dowel-drilling rigs with wheels to properly control 
alignment and wandering. Both standard pneumatic or hydraulic percussion 
drills are acceptable. They drill a hole in about 30 seconds. Electric pneumatic 
rotary drills take three to four times longer. The hole shall be 2 mm bigger than 
bar diameter for epoxy anchor material or 6 mm bigger than the bar diameter for 
cement based anchor material.

(vii)	 The dowel hole is cleaned carefully by means of a nozzle and compressed air. 
Prior to this operation ensure that the compressor is not blowing oil and moisture 
contaminated air by blowing into a piece of dry cloth.
	
(viii)	 The epoxy anchoring material is fed to the back of the hole before inserting 
the dowel/tie bars. This ensures that the anchoring material will flow outward 
along the entire dowel/tie embedment length during insertion and decreases the 
likelihood of leaving voids between the dowel and concrete (Fig. 9.3).
Fig. 9.2 Drilling of Holes for Dowel Installation
Fig. 9.3 Epoxy Injection into Holes
	
(ix)	 Reinforcement is fixed in top of the repair when the length to width ratio of the 
patch exceeds 1.5 so to control any cracking on account of the shape factor. 
(10 mm dia high yield deformed bar@ 200 mm c/c in both directions). The 
reinforcement shall be placed about 75 mm below the top surface.
	
(x)	
1:1 cement sand slurry with water/cement 0.4 - 0.62 is applied on the sides and 
bottom of the pit before pouring fresh concrete.
	
(xi)	 Concrete is poured in the pit from ready mix or batch trucks, or site mixed for 
small jobs in small mixers. Evenly distribute and compact the mix by penetration 
of a vertical vibrator. Special care is important to compact concrete in the corners,

Replacement of a whole slab comprises of essentially the same process except that 
after removal of damaged slabs it is important to check the causes of damage that could be 
poor drainage or Jack of support. Before reconstruction the sub-drainage system and the sub-
base shall be repaired as appropriate and the interface reinstated. Repair procedure for the 
replacement of a whole slab is otherwise the same as that of full depth repair described in this 
Chapter. New dowel and tie bars shall also be retrofitted, if required.
9.4	
Whole slab replacement requires fixing tie bars along the longitudinal joint. Drill 
holes to suit 16 Dia deformed reinforcing bars with embedment length appropriate to the anchor 
material. Hand held drills are acceptable because alignment is not critical.
10 SLAB STABILISATION
10.1	
General
Slab stabilization refers to the method for raising sunken slabs by pressure grouting under the 
slab after boring vertical holes for pressure injection of the slurry. It is also sometimes called 
undersealing or sub-sealing. It is most often performed at areas where pumping or loss of support 
has occurred. The most common materials are cement and fly-ash grouts or polyurethane 
mixture etc. selected according to the fluidity, durability and cost.
10.1.1	
Several phenomenon like mud pumping and settlement cause voids under concrete 
pavements. Heavy axle loads induce the highest slab deflections near transverse joints and 
working cracks away from transverse joints. Deflections may cause erosion, consolidation, with 
the resultant loss of the sub-base or sub-grade support. Without support underneath the slab, 
load stresses in the concrete increase and may cause other problems, such as faulting, comer 
breaks, and cracking. The voids usually occur near cracks, joints, or along the pavement edge, 
and are often not more than 3 mm to 4 mm deep. The grout fills these voids beneath the concrete 
pavement slab or sub-base layer and displaces free water. Transverse joint faulting and presence 
of water at or near joints and cracks on the traffic lane or shoulder are good indications of pumping 
and voids. Corner breaks and shoulder drop off are further indicators of voids under the slabs.
10.1.2	
Slab stabilization is intended to fill the voids beneath the slab. Slab stabilization 
requires an effective method for locating the voids. This may be done by the following evaluation 
methods, but each has its limitations.
	
(i)	
Visual inspection: This method has several deficiencies especially when 
evaluating effectiveness of stabilization.
	
(ii)	
Deflection measurement by FWD (Falling Weight Deflectometer).
	
(iii)	 Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR).
10.1.3	
The principle requirements in selection of materials are strength and ability to flow into 
or expand to fill the very small voids and water channels. The main advantage of polyurethane 
grouts are the tensile strength and fast cure time. But usually pozzolana-cement grouts are 
preferred due to availability and cost effectiveness.
10.1.4	
A typical pozzolana cement grout uses one part cement to three parts flyash. Quantity of 
water is typically in the range of 1.5 to 3 parts by weight of mix. Tests shall be conducted thoroughly, 
i.e.: 1, 3 and 7 day compressive strength, flow cone times and initial set times. Engineers use the

IRC:SP:83-2018
flow cone during the concrete mix design process to determine the quantity of water required. The 
Contractor shall check the grout consistency twice each day using the flow cone (ASTM C 939).
10.2	
Pressure Grouting
It comprises the following tasks:
	
(i)	
The repair materials and procedure are selected.
	
(ii)	
Holes are drilled for grout injection using pneumatic or hydraulic rotary percussion 
drill on a 1 m square grid over the whole area of voids to be filled under the slab; 
drill depth = slab thickness + 20 mm, drill vertical hole of dia 30 mm - 50 mm as 
appropriate to best suit the available equipment, distance to joints and cracks = 
0.5 m to 1.0 m.
	
(iii)	 Compressed air is blown to remove water etc under the slab for the grout injection. 
The work sequence should be across and along the slab going downwards 
crossfalls and longitudinal gradients.
	
(iv)	 Grout is injected in each hole at a pressure of 0.35 N/mm2 working in sequence 
across and along the slabs, until the void accept no more grout or grout flows up 
through an adjacent hole or the slab begins to rise. A short pressure surge up to 
2.0 MPa may be necessary to clear debris from the grout hole for 2-3 seconds only.
	
(v)	
For early and fast flow of grout and to minimize air beneath the PQC two holes 
are drilled, vacuum pump may be used by sucking air from second hole.
	
(vi)	 Excess grout upon completion is removed from the pavement surface. If resin 
grout was used that cannot be removed the slab surface may be blinded with 
fine hard aggregate.
	
(vii)	 Injection holes are cleaned and filled with cement or resin mortar.
	
(viii)	 Traffic is opened only after the minimum appropriate curing time.
10.3	
Vacuum Grouting
Vacuum grouting comprises of the following tasks:
	
(i)	
Holes are drilled for grout injection on a 1 m square grid over the whole area of 
voids to be filled under the slab.
	
(ii)	
The holes are temporarily plugged and the slab surface is swept to clean all debris.
	
(iii)	 Vacuum channels are placed in position.
	
(iv)	 Transparent flexible plastic sheet is placed over the area to be grouted on top of 
the vacuum channels.
	
(v)	
The perimeter of the plastic sheet is sealed. The vacuum injection holes are 
sealed to prevent ingress of air.
	
(vi)	 Vacuum is applied and any water from the void beneath the slab is drawn off 
(Fig. 10.1).
	
(vii)	 With the vacuum applied puncture the plastic sheet at the injection holes and 
pour grout in each hole in the working sequence. The hole is plugged as soon 
as grout begins to be drawn up.
	
(viii)	 Upon completion excess grout shall be removed from the pavement surface.

11 SPECIAL TECHNIQUES FOR REHABILITATION OF RIGID PAVEMENTS
11.1 
Repair for Load Transfer Failure (Retrofit of Dowel Bars)
11.1.1	
New dowel bars shall be placed at cracks where displacements occur and at joints if 
the existing bars are damaged (misaligned, bent or corroded dowels, dowel socketing or dowel slot 
widening). At least three bars in every wheel track at 300-375 mm spacing (Figs. 11.1 & 11.2) shall be 
installed as per procedure given below. For existing dowel bars, there can be two ways of retrofitting. 
If there are no cracks along the existing dowel bars, the retrofit slots can be cut out in the land space 
between the existing bars and new bars be installed. However, if the existing bars are corroded or 
surrounding concrete is cracked, the retrofit slot be cut out encompassing the damaged bar. This 
tantamount to replacement of dowels by retrofit. The spacing is 300-375 mm. This repair method 
re-establishes load transfer across the joint or crack, while at the same time allowing longitudinal 
movement. Poor load transfer may originate faulting, sub-base damage, corner breaks, or spalling.

Fig. 11.2 Side View of Retrofit Dowel Bars
11.1.2	
The work procedure for retro-fitting dowel bars consists of following steps:
	
(i)	
The repair materials are selected.
	
(ii) 	 The slot to be cut is marked parallel to the centre line of the pavement with a 
length of about 800- 900 mm ensuring half-length on either side of crack/joint.
	
(iii) 	 Vertical holes (40 mm diameter) are drilled at the ends of the planned slot to 
such a depth that the dowel bar center line will be in the middle of the slab 
thickness.
	
(iv)	 The slot sides are cut and the bottom sides are levelled between the holes drilled 
at each end. Diamond-saw slot cutting is the most reliable and proven method. 
Diamond-saw slot cutting machines can make multiple cuts to form the edges of 
three (one wheel path) or six (two wheel paths) slots. The saw operator aligns 
the head before the joint or crack then plunges into the concrete and advances 
across the joint or crack. The plunging and moving back and forth across the 
joint or crack creates a flat bottom at the required depth.
	
	
The jack hammer may be placed either at the end of the fin or downed along 
the bottom or along the side of the slot to break the fin. The tin may be removed 
easily in two or three big pieces. The fins can also be removed manually with the 
help of hammer and chisel. The small projections at the bottom of slot be broadly 
flattened with small jack hammer or manually with hand hammer and chisel. The 
slots are cut parallel to the center line of the pavement. The slots are 50 mm to 
65 mm wide and slightly deeper than half the slab depth so as to ensure that 
dowel is at mid depth of slab. The outside wheel path dowel is between 300 mm 
to 375 mm from the pavement edge and the inside wheel path dowels shall be 
450 mm to 600 mm inside the center line of the pavement. The spacing between 
the dowels may be between 300 mm to 375 mm center to center.
	
(v)	
Joints and transverse cracks with a load transfer of less than 40% shall be 
retrofitted with dowels prior to diamond grinding. The total deflection of slabs 
shall also be checked to ensure that it is less than 0.8 mm. If the deflection is 
greater than 0.8 mm the slabs should be stabilised prior to diamond grinding. 



======================================================================
PAGE 88 of 140
======================================================================
IRC:SP:83-2018
80
Local spot grinding is not recommended and is otherwise going to be very 
expensive for just mobilising the machine.
	
(vi)	 The slots/pits are cleaned carefully and dried out if moist. This is done by sand 
blasting followed by air blasting. The slot is checked by wiping a hand along the 
slot walls and bottom. Laitance or dust adhering to the hand would indicate that 
further cleaning is necessary.
	
(vii)	 The crack or joint is caulked at the bottom and sides of the slot to keep patching 
material from entering the crack or joint and build bridges across the crack or 
joint.
	
(viii)	 The dowel is covered with debonding agent such as form oil or grease to allow 
slide movement within the hardened patch. No oil or grease shall fall onto any 
of the slot surfaces because it would not allow the patching material to bond to 
the slot and could cause the patch to fail. Placing a sleeve over the dowel is not 
recommended because inherent looseness could cause the dowel to socket 
and fail.
	
(ix)	 The dowel is prepared with non-metallic expansion end caps, a plastic foam 
or filler board joint refom1er in the middle and non-metallic chairs. Retrofitting 
dowels are the same as those used in the pavement with a few modifications. 
Dowels mostly used are round mild steel bars not less than 450 mm long. 
Depending on the slab thickness, the dowel diameter is 32 mm to 36 mm. 
(Ref: IRC:58). Before applying form oil or grease the dowels should be epoxy 
.coated over the entire surface including the ends to prevent corrosion and 
joint lock-up.
	
(x) 	 A resin coat is applied to the slot walls and a resin mortar layer to the slot bottom 
before placing the dowel horizontally, if the patching mix is resin mortar.
	
(xi)	 The dowels in the slots are inserted so that the chair legs are in the saw-cut 
kerfs at the bottom of the slot. In this position, the dowel will be aligned in the 
pavement middle line. Parallel to the pavement surface. The joint reformer 
should be over the joint or crack with half-length dowel on each side. The legs 
and sides of the chairs should be smug against the slot walls to keep the dowel 
from moving during placement of the patch material.
	
(xii) 	 The slot is filled with resin or fast track concrete mortar which attains minimum 
compressive strength of 10 MPa within 3 hours. Compact with a spud vibrator 
around the dowel without hilting it.
	
	
The patch mix shall have all the properties similar to concrete and have little or 
no shrinkage. It shall set and develop strength quickly to allow traffic as soon as 
possible (32 MPa minimum).
	
•	
Compressive Strength	
	
40 MPa (minimum) after 28 days (IS:516)
	
•	
Bond (Shear) Strength	
	
7 MPa (minimum) after 28 days
	
(xiii)	
A curing compound is applied.
	
(xiv)	
The road can be opened to traffic when the patch material has gained 
strength of at least 32 MPa. The pavement is then finished with diamond grinding.
The Retrofitting of dowel bars is illustrated in Fig. 11.3.

Retrofit of tie-bars
The method of placing retrofit tie bars across longitudinal cracks is similar to the above, except 
spacing shall be 450-600 mm depending on thickness of slab. Procedure is similar to slot stitching 
illustrated in Fig. 7.4.

Slab Lifting or Jacking
11.2.1	
This repair method consists of raising sunken slabs to the level of adjacent slabs by 
lifting or pressure grouting beneath the panel.
11.2.2	
The first method comprises the following tasks:
	
(i)	
A full depth saw cut is made along longitudinal joint(s) to separate the slabs to 
be raised from the adjacent panels
	
(ii)	
Holes suitably sized are drilled lifting into the slab at positions to fit the lifting 
frame
	
(iii)	 The hydraulically operated lifting frames are positioned transversely with lifting 
bolts centered over the lifting holes
	
(iv)	 Threaded female sleeves are fixed into the lifting holes with resin grout or mortar
	
(v)	
The lifting bolts are screwed into the threaded sleeves
	
(vi)	 A level reference datum across the slab to be raised is established.
	
(vii)	 The slab is raised to the required level slowly by operating hydraulic jacks at 
each corner of the lifting frame
	
(viii)	 The void is filled beneath the slab with fast hardening cement grout
	
(ix)	 Traffic is opened only after the minimum required curing period and adequate 
strength.
11.3	
Restoration of Evenness and Skid Resistance (Diamond Grinding)
11.3.1	
Removing of bumps and re-profiling of surface of concrete pavement by means 
of diamond grinding improves the surface evenness and decreases severity of impact from 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:83-2018
82
dynamic load of vehicles. Presence of bumps and unevenness in pavement causes increased 
tensile stress in the pavement and reduces its life.
11.3.2	
Diamond grinding can also be used to smooth out roughness from slab surface, to 
even out curled or warped slabs and remove patching unevenness. It removes a thin layer of 
concrete from the surface of the pavement.
11.3.3	
PQC Grinding is required when there is severe surface deterioration causing 
problem to end user like FOD problem in runways, removal of bumps or flattening of profile 
due to construction error causing FRL mismatch in adjacent panels casted, on surfaces that 
are exposed to snow and are susceptible to treatment with de-icing chemicals, exposed 
aggregate surface or surface blemishes that need to be removed to ensure longer life of the 
pavement etc. Grinding should be followed by applying a layer of siloxane based solution for 
best results.
11.3.4	
Numerous forms of machines are manufactured to carry out diamond grinding as 
per requirement of the client. A typical machine generally grinds from 3 mm up to 5 mm. The 
localized bumps or the damage surface is to be measured with straight edge & the area to be 
ground is marked. The machine is operated in end to end pass on the pavement (parallel to 
transverse joint preferably). Grinded surface resembles typical Indian mosaic flooring with micro 
texture serrations exposing fresh layer of concrete.
11.3.5	
Before commencing grinding operations all forms of loose concrete in corners, 
potholes, pop outs etc should be patched with elastomeric cement to give best results. Special 
care is to be taken when machine is moving across joints to ensure the sealant is not damaged 
in grinding operation. It is best to reseal post grinding. After grinding the slurry should be cleaned 
using water jet & section should be inspected using a straight edge.
11.3.6	
Although diamond grinding does reduce the thickness of the pavement, by 
making the surface even and by reducing tensile stress in slab it adds to the overall life of 
the pavement. Depending of the equipment used for diamond grinding, if the texture on the 
slab lacks required level of friction, the slab may have to be subjected to diamond grooving 
after completion of diamond grinding. Table 11.1 may be referred for factors limiting diamond 
grinding.

11.4	
Diamond Grooving
It is a specialized technique used to restore skid resistance at the surface of concrete pavement 
and to reduce wet weather accidents, improve traction and prevent hydroplaning. PQC Grooving 
is required to prevent formation of water film between tyre of vehicle and the pavement leading 
to loss of traction and wet weather accidents, in areas where reduction in stopping distance 
is required by increasing traction, in areas where rectification of lost texture is required due 
to accidental occurrence of rain during PQC laying, and to increase pavement service life by 
adding more friction capabilities the texture depth (to be checked every 3 to 5 years).
11.4.1	
Grooving generally provides the best treatment against aqua planning on high speed 
expressways. It is like grinding cut with diamond impregnated blades or cylinder rings. The 
grooves are usually cut in a transverse direction, are 3 mm to 5 mm deep & 3 mm to 4 mm wide 
with a distance of 10 mm to 40 mm between lines. Grooving is intended to help water expulsion 
under tyres. This treatment shall be considered on pavements that have exhibited a significant 
number of wet weather accidents (usually on curves or at junctions).
11.4.2	
The abor/head width can be substantially larger considering the larger spacing 
between the blades. Longitudinal grooves produce less noise than transverse grooves, however, 
they help raising water spray trails of splash. In Indian conditions with high rainfall and slow 
moving vehicles transverse grooves should be preferred.
11.4.3	
Surface grooving comprises the following tasks:
	
(i)	
All joints shall be effectively sealed against ingress of sawing slurry
	
(ii)	
Sawing slurry is prevented from entering surface water drains
	
(iii)	 The surface is textured by sawing randomly spaced grooves 3 mm wide by at 
least 4 mm deep
	
(iv)	 Deposits of slurry are flushed and removed from the pavement surface 
11.4.4	
Grooves shall not be cut within 150 mm of the outside edge of the slab and longitudinal 
joints.

11.4.5	
Determination of requirement of retexturing by measurement of mean texture depth:
Skid resistance and noise of roads highly depend on the characteristics of pavement Texture. 
Therefore, the estimation of texture characteristics may give useful information for the skid 
resistance and noise of road. As an indicator, MTD (Mean Texture Depth) is generally measured 
by the Sand Patch Test (SPT). Even though the SPT can be simply conducted with very low cost, 
it has some disadvantages including time-consuming and traffic interruption. The basic principle 
of quantitatively measuring the texture depth of pavement surface is by calculating the volume of 
the apertures between the aggregates through MTD method, commonly using Sand Patch Test. 
Sand Patch Test is a method of calculating MTD by evenly filling the apertures on the pavement 
surface with 25 cm3 of dry natural sand with a rounded particle shape passing 300 micron and 
retained on 150 micron IS sieve. The diameter of the patch shall be measured to the nearest 
5 mm. The mean texture depth is calculated as 31000/D2 mm, where D is the diameter of the 
patch in mm.
Five individual measurements of the texture depth shall be taken at least 2 m apart anywhere 
along a diagonal line across a lane width between points 50 m apart along the pavement. 
No measurement shall be taken within 300 mm of the longitudinal edges of a concrete slab 
constructed in one pass. In case the MTD value is below the standard value of 1.25 mm the 
surface needs to be re- textured.

11.5	
Millling Procedure
11.5.1	
Milling is only recommended as a procedure for the preparation/treatment of a 
concrete surface for receiving a bonded overlay. Standard milling machines with 300 mm or 450 
mm wide cutting heads have proven efficient and economical particularly when used for large 
areas, such as full lane-width repairs.
11.5.2	
The milling operation results in a rounded pit. The borders shall be made vertical by 
sawing or jack hammering or chiselling.
11.5.3	
The advantages of the mill procedure include the following:
	
(i)	
It is efficient and economic for large areas
	
(ii)	
It leaves a rough surface that promotes bonding of the patch
11.5.4	
This procedure has the following disadvantages:
	
(i)	
For repair areas shorter than 0.09 m2, the smallest milling head results in a 
patch larger than needed
	
(ii)	
Milling may cause spalling of border edges
	
(iii)	 The pit edges perpendicular to the milling operation (and traffic direction) are 
rounded. These edges shall be made vertical by chiselling or cutting
11.5.5	
When cold-milling is used, a secondary cleaning should follow to ensure the removal 
of dust and particulate material from the milling operation. Secondary cleaning can be done with 
sand blasting, water blasting, sweeping or air blowing equipment. This should be accomplished 
if immediately prior to applying the bonding grout.
11.5.6	
Shot blasting is performed by a self contained mechanical unit that will cause no 
dust or particulate problems. The machine is capable of removing all surface contaminants, 
except some difficulty is encountered in removal of asphalt concrete or asphalt cement. 
The machine will throw abrasive metal shot at the surface in a contained cleaning head. 
The particulate matter and dust created by the operation is also picked up and discharged. 
The average depth of removal for this equipment is about 3 mm. Care shall be taken 
when using shot blasting equipment, that the shot does not penetrate the joint. It is 
recommended that a backer rod be installed in all open transverse joint grooves prior 
to the shot blasting operation to avoid penetration of shot that could eventually cause 
compression failures. Depending on the efficiency of the vacuum attachment available on 
the equipment, secondary cleaning may not be necessary after this procedure, but it is 
highly recommended.
11.6	
Concrete Overlays
11.6.1	
General
If the existing rigid pavement is structurally weak based on the prevailing traffic or the 
wearing surface needs improvements in riding quality an overlay over rigid pavements is 
generally laid as per IRC:SP:17 “Recommendations for Concrete Overlays on Concrete 
Pavements”.



======================================================================
PAGE 94 of 140
======================================================================
IRC:SP:83-2018
86
There are the following main types of overlay:
	
(i)	
Partially bonded rigid overlay over cement concrete pavement
	
(ii)	
Unbonded rigid overlay over cement concrete pavement
	
(iii)	 Fully bonded rigid overlay over cement concrete pavement
	
(iv)	 Cement concrete overlay over bituminous pavements, as per IRC:SP:76
Family of overlays is given in Fig. 11.6.
11.6.2	
Partially bonded overlay
For partially bonded overlay, the concrete pavement should be cleaned of any loose or extraneous 
matter, given a detergent wash @ 1 kg/10 sqm. Along with scrubbing with wire brush to remove 
oily and greasy materials. Subsequently the whole surface is flushed with water to remove all 
traces of the solution and other dust particles. Partially bonded overlay over rigid pavement 
is designed as per the forlmula given below, with matching the joints in top PQC with those in 
existing PQC layer:
	
h0 = (hm
1.4 - C he
1.4)1/1.4
Eq. 11.1
where, h0 =	 thickness of concrete overlay, cm
hm	
=	 thickness required for monolithic slab needed for the projected traffic as per IRC:58, cm
he	
=	 thickness of existing concrete pavement, cm
C	
=	 pavement condition factor as per Table 11.2
Typical Application of Partially Bonded Overlays are for the treatment of slightly cracked concrete 
pavement.

11.6.3	
Un-bonded overlay
Generally consists of a thick concrete layer (125 mm or greater on top of an existing concrete 
pavement. A separation interlayer is provided to separate the new and existing concrete surface 
as per Fig. 11.7. At least 100 mm bituminous separation layer of bituminous macadam or (leveling 
course grading) may be adopted.
Fig. 11.7 Unbondcd Concrete Overlay
The optimum thickness separation interlayer prevents distress reflecting into the overlay as 
shown in Fig 11.8
Typical applications of unbonded Concrete Overlays are:
	
(a)	
For treatment of the pavements having little or no structural life remaining
	
(b)	
Pavements displaying extensive and severe durability distress
	
(c)	
Medium to heavily trafficked roads
	
(d)	
Treatment for pavements over very weak or wet subgrade
For an unbonded overlay, rocking slabs shall be rectified, exposed sub base properly compacted 
and gap may be filled with bituminous macadam having 2.5% - 3% binder sealed properly with

Fig. 11.8 Effects of Separation Inter Layer Thickness
An un-bonded overlay over rigid pavement is designed as per the formula is given below:
	
h0 = (hm
2 - C he
2)1/2
Eq. 11.2
where, h0 = thickness of concrete overlay, cm
hm = thickness required for monolithic slab needed for the projected traffic as per IRC:58, cm
he = thickness of existing concrete pavement, cm
C = pavement condition factor as per Table 11.2
11.6.4	
Fully bonded overlay
Generally consists of a concrete layer (100 mm to 150 mm) on top of an existing concrete 
surface. Specific steps are taken to bond the new concrete overlay to existing concrete as 
shown in Fig. 11.7.
Fig. 11.7. Bonded Concrete Overlay
Bonded overlays are suitable over sound uncracked concrete pavement. Typical applications for 
a bonded overlay are:
	
(a)	
to correct surface problems relating to wear or loss of skid resistance
	
(b)	
to repair damage caused by chemical spills
	
(c)	
to improve load carrying capacity



======================================================================

IRC:SP:83-2018
Bonded overlays need to be used with great caution as they are not suitable over moderately 
or badly distressed pavements or over concrete with reactive aggregate problems or over poor 
subgrade.
All treatments for the preparation of the existing slabs as specified for partially bonded overlay 
are also applicable to fully bonded overlays. Besides this. all bond-preventing materials such 
as joint sealing compound, bituminous materials used for repair, paint marking, greasy and oily 
marks etc. should be meticulously removed. Where ever necessary, light chiseling to scarify 
the surface for effective bond and to remove loose materials at the surface may be done. The 
surface is initially flushed with water to remove all traces of spilled oil or bitumen driplings. On 
the saturated surface dry slabs, bonded rigid overlay should be laid immediately after applying 
a thin layer (about 1 mm) of 1:1 cement sand paste/slurry as bonding medium. Shot blasting the 
existing surface without using grouts reportedly gives the best results (Ref: Research University 
of Texas, USA). For more details separate guidelines be referred. It has been the experience 
that fully bonded overlays with passage of time end up with partial bond. Fully bonded over lay 
may be designed as per the formula given below:
	
h0 = (hm
- - he)
(Eq. 11.3*)
* Further guidance may be taken from IRC:SP:17
11.6.5	
Additional precautions for concrete overlays
	
(1)	
In high rainfall areas, particularly where the drainage is not satisfactory and/
or on pavement carrying very heavy traffic of more than 1500 commercial 
vehicles per day. Mild steel reinforcement at the rate of 3 kg/sq.m should be 
provided in fully bonded and partially bonded overlays. Mild steel reinforcement 
mesh@ 3-6 kg/sq.m may also be provided in overlay across cracks in existing 
pavement. This reinforcement will be provided 60-75 mm below the top surface 
of overlay.
	
(2)	
Mild steel shear pegs, if required, may be provided. A mild steel bar mesh, 
extending 500 mm on either side of the crack may also be embedded at mid­ 
depth in the concrete overlay. Joints in the overlay may be matched with those 
in the existing pavement both in type and location. Extra care may be taken to 
ensure that all edges and corners of the concrete slabs are fully coated with 
the cement slurry. This is particularly important as these regions are more 
susceptible to warping as well as initial differential drying shrinkage stresses 
and failure of bond in bonded concrete.
	
(3)	
Efforts shall be made to minimize evaporation of water from the top surface by 
misting/fogging after 2 to 3 hours of laying concrete slabs and also by providing 
tentage at lower height with one end closed for avoiding wind tunnel effect to 
minimize plastic shrinkage. Addition of 0.2% fibres reduces the width of cracks if 
any, in case of concrete overlays. Casting of slabs from 1 am to 4 am in the early 
morning, may develop shrinkage cracks due to high warping stresses, if proper 
precaution regarding the covering of the PQC slabs with proper arrangements 
are not taken. These cracks which are noticed after 24 hours of laying slabs, 
shall be immediately filled with drv silica fume powder, fly ash and cement using

small quantity of water by application with brush. This type of treatment may be 
used for cracks of width less than 6 mm. These pavements after repair shall be 
covered with wet jute sheet (with minimum water).
11.7	
Rehabilitation of Soft Earthen Shoulders
11.7.1	
Shoulders should provide lateral support to the edges of the pavement, be of sufficient 
width and strength to support the parking of heavy vehicles under all weather conditions, shed off 
water, be durable and protect the lateral sub-drainage to the pavement below. Soft soil shoulders 
cannot comply with such requirements.
11.7.2	
However on many of the National and State highway projects the earthen shoulders 
are constructed using fine soils which comply with the specifications for sub-grade but are easily 
eroded and worn away by heavy vehicles parking. The protection of lower side shoulder of super 
elevated portion requires special treatment or stabilization to withstand the cumulative run-off 
from both carriageways.
11.7.3	
A report recommending the turfing or upgrading of the soft earthen shoulders is 
provided in Appendix D for the information of designers and maintenance engineers. Three 
options are given: turfing, using a trafficable soil gravel mixture and brick on edge.
12 REPAIR MATERIALS
12.1	
General
12.1.1	
Repair materials should have short setting times and develop strength fast enough to 
allow reopening of the lanes to traffic. In high traffic corridors the sections to be repaired can only 
be closed to traffic for a few hours. Lane closure of 6 to 24 hours is considered optimum. Portland 
Cement Concrete modified with chemical admixtures or polymers used in these applications is 
expected to become strong enough to carry traffic within 6 to 24 hours after placement. Rigorous 
requirements for mix design and strength are stipulated for EOT concrete applications. The uses 
of such concretes are bound to increase in future because with increasing traffic levels, only 
limited duration lane closure for repair is possible. This type of high early strength concrete is just 
emerging but durability related issues of such concretes are not & fully settled. A more cautious 
approach is recommended to be followed in India.
Para 12.3 of the guidelines briefly gives some details for such fast track concretes. Specialist 
literature like NCHRP report 540 “Guidelines for Early-Opening- to Traffic Portland Cement 
Concrete for Pavement Rehabilitation” which may be referred to, if interested.
12.1.2	
Repair materials may be classified under Three General Types:
	
a)	
Cementitous - Generally comprising of a Portland cement, gypsum or magnesium 
phosphate specially formulated to provide opening times of 2 - 8 hours or 20 - 24 
hours (Ref: NCHRP Report 540).
	
b)	
Polymer based -Generally comprising of an epoxy, methyl methacrylate, 
polyester-styrene or polyurethane based resin mixed with aggregates and a 
catalyst (hardener) formulated to provide opening times 6-8 hours.



======================================================================
PAGE 99 of 140
======================================================================
91
IRC:SP:83-2018
	
c)	
Bituminous - Comprising of a bituminous binder and aggregate mix, these 
materials are generally considered for making a temporary patch only.
12.1.3	
The polymer based resins are preferably used for small areas and volumes of 
repair. An exception is patching of dowel slots where cement mortar is preferred to match the 
thermal properties of the surrounding concrete. The rapid setting cement based materials are 
used for larger areas and volumes to minimize differential thermal behavior and to minimize 
costs.
12.1.4	
The minimum cube compressive strength to allow traffic is 32 MPa.
Note:	 It is necessary to remind that the several publications by FWHA and ACPA (USA) mentioned in 
Appendix-A report compressive strengths according to ASTM C 39 which tests cylinders (150 
mm dia x 300 mm) long whereas in India the standard method for determining and reporting the 
compressive strength (IS:516) uses cubes (150 mm). The target cube compressive strength = 
cylinder Comnpressive strength/0.80 .
12.1.5	
The repair materials shall be designed and tested in the laboratory and tested on the 
road so to conform to the manufacturers specifications.
12.1.6	
The Table 12.1 gives a guide to the selection of suitable patching material according 
to the size and depth of patch contemplated.

Cement Mortars for Patching
12.2.1	
The cement patch mixes often use IS:269 type Portland cement and also proprietary 
cementitious material that gain strength very quickly. To decrease the water-cement ratio a water 
reducing admixture may be required for 43/53 Grade Cement. In addition with accelerators to 
shorten the concrete setting time and aluminium powder to reduce shrinkage may be used.
12.2.2	
The Table 12.2 shows information on rapid-setting hydraulic binders or cementitious 
materials that are currently used for patching concrete pavements. Such binders often contain 
chloride based accelerators that may cause corrosion of dowel bars. Some polymer modified 
cement concrete mixes may reach a compressive strength of about 28 MPa within time as given 
in the Table 12.2.

12.2.3	
Some of the rapid-setting hydraulic binders are proprietary materials and in this case 
careful attention should be paid to manufacturers specifications. They should also be selected 
to match the climatic conditions that are expected during the repair work.
12.3	
Fast-Track Concrete for Large Patching
12.3.1	
Fast-track concrete or high early strength concrete is essential for full-depth/partial 
depth patching when early opening to traffic is required.
12.3.2	
High early compressive strength concrete (20 - 25 MPa in 24 hours) is usually obtained 
using Grade 43 or 53 high-early strength cement, high cement content (350-450 kg/m) lower 
water-cement ratios (0.3 to 0.35 by weight), well graded aggregates, and chemical accelerators. 
Super-plasticisers are also used to make the concrete mixture more workable during placement. 



======================================================================
PAGE 101 of 140
======================================================================
93
IRC:SP:83-2018
Fly ash, silica fume and ground granulated blast furnace slag are sometimes used in the mix 
to partially replace some of the Grade 43 or 53 cement. In some ready to use proprietary items 
polymers are also used.
12.3.3	
Aggregate gradation uniformity will improve concrete strength, workability, and long-
term durability. The coarse and fine aggregate grading should be chosen to minimise voids in the 
matrix.
12.3.4	
Calcium chloride (CaCl2) should not be added as an accelerator under any 
circumstances.
12.3.5	
Insulating blankets (or other insulation measures) can also be used in the first 24 
hours to help strength gain by retaining the heat of hydration. Caution shall be taken, though, 
to avoid thermal shock when the blankets are taken off. Thermal shock may cause premature 
cracking of the concrete.
12.4	
Elastomeric Concrete for Patching
12.4.1	
Elastomeric concrete is a polyurethane based material designed to develop early 
high strength and easy bonding to a variety of materials. It comprises of a modified binder, fine 
aggregate and glass fiber. It hardens very quickly. It is relatively more expensive than normal 
epoxy mortar formulations but offers saving in the depth of the patch. Refer Table 12.3.

12.5	
Resin Mortars for Patching
12.5.1	
Commonly used resin binders are epoxy, poly urethane and methacrylate polymers. 
Resin binders should be selected for the climatic conditions that are expected during application 
work.
12.5.2	
The various components of resin system must be kept in tightly closed containers. 
Smoking may not be allowed in the vicinity of the resins. After expiry of shelf-life, material shall not 
be used without rechecking its quality through laboratory tests. The following handling practice 
for resin materials and mixes is required:
	
a)	
Working in a well-ventilated area (in case of laboratory tests)
	
b)	
Storing the resin materials below eye level
	
c)	
Using disposable containers, equipment and gloves, wherever feasible
	
d)	
Using safety goggles when handling resin compounds
	
e)	
Temperature of mix shall not be more than 60°C.
12.5.3	
There is no solvent material for removing set resin-formulations. However unset/
partial set resin from containers may be cleaned by:
	
a)	
Mixture of equal proportions of ethyl alcohol and benzene
	
b)	
Mixture of equal proportions of ethyl alcohol and toluene
	
c)	
Toluene
	
d)	
Benzene
	
e)	
Ethyl alcohol
	
f)	
Local soap/detergent
12.5.4	
In addition to these guidelines, manufacturers recommendations for mixing, patching 
and curing should be strictly followed.
12.5.5	
Fine or coarse aggregates depending on the application may be used in the epoxy resin 
formulation . The grading of fine aggregate, which is mainly used for repair is given in Table 12.4. 
Size of coarse aggregate is maximum 20 mm. Fine sand passing 1.18 mm sieve of FM 1.0 is used.

IRC:SP:83-2018
12.5.6	
In epoxy formulations with tertiary amine as hardener, the quantity of the tertiary 
amine is limited between 4 gm - 10 gm per 100 gm epoxy resin for temperature range 40°C to 
10°C. In resin mortars, generally one part by weight of resin formulation is mixed with 3-5 parts 
by weight of medium to fine sand. In case of epoxy resin concrete using larger maximum size of 
aggregate, the proportion of aggregate may be as high as eight (8) parts to one (1) part of resin 
formulation by weight.
12.5.7	
The quantity to be mixed at a time should normally not exceed 2 kg because of the 
short pot life of the resins. The cement concrete temperature may be at least 15°C and preferably 
about 25°C, prior to application of the synthetic resin. Under cool weather conditions, electric 
heaters, for lighting 1000 Watt electric bulbs may be used in such a manner that the surface 
temperature stays below 40°C during the hardening period.
12.5.8	
In general the compound is not heated beyond 60°C or cooled below 15°C. After 
applying the first tack coat on the bottom as well as sides of the prepared pit groove, the sides 
of the pit groove are given a second coat of resin formulation. Special care is required along 
the edges and at comers which are more prone to be left uncoated. For small sized work, a 
20 mm hair brush may be used. Before the tack coat loses its tackiness, resin-sand mortar or 
concrete, depending on the depth of the patch, is placed in the grooved recess with the help of 
a trowel. For patches thicker than 20 mm, the sand is combined with a coarse aggregate having 
maximum size not greater than one-third the thickness of the patch. If the patch is deeper than 
50 mm, it is built up in two or more layers to reduce heat build up and subsequent thermal 
contraction. Full compaction is ensured by rodding. A light layer of the dry sand should be spread 
over the finished patch. After application, the resin patch is kept at a temperature of 30°C - 40°C 
to accelerate curing by infrared lamps.
12.5.9	
The use of polyester resins as bonding media between old and new concrete is 
generally ruled out on account of their high susceptibility to moisture. Table 12.5 gives the typical 
formulations and properties.
12.6	
Bituminous Materials for Patching
12.6.1	
The use of bituminous mixes is very exceptional. Experience with bituminous binders 
for patching concrete slabs is not satisfactory and they are generally not recommended except 
for use as a temporary patch in emergency conditions when other more suitable materials are 
not available at site.
12.7	
Joint Sealants and Backer Rods
12.7.1	
The following section shall also be read in conjunction with Chapter 6.
12.7.2	
Joint sealants can be divided into two broad categories:
	
(i)	
Liquid (Field moulded) sealants which are poured or gunned into the 
joint
	
(ii)	
Preformed factory moulded seals which are compressed into the fresh 
concrete or hardened joint

New Materials
New concrete repair materials based on chemical formulations have surfaced in the local market 
in India. These are proprietary items. Proprietary firms are advocating an effective and fast 
result, particularly in the area of minor crack repairs. The present guidelines do not make any 
recommendations about the same. Highway Agencies may consider using them on selective 
basis after being satisfied about them and reporting about their performance to IRC for evaluation 
and wider publication after acceptance.

14 PLANNING THE MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS
14.1	
General Objectives
14.1.1	
The general principles and objectives of highway maintenance as it particularly 
concerns the preservation of concrete pavements is dealt with in this section.
14.1.2	
Concrete pavements generally deteriorate gradually in life (5- 25 years) and deteriorate 
quicker as they approach the effective service life (30- 40 years). Refer Fig. 1.6 in Chapter 
1. Spot repairs and restoration of isolated parts are performed to prevent or slow the overall 
deterioration of the concrete pavement.
14.1.3	
The deterioration can affect the whole pavement structure beyond the effective 
service life and therefore also affect the safety and comfort of the user and the maintenance 
costs. Earlier intervention to restore its condition before there is significant drop in pavement 
servicability should be the objective of the maintenance strategy. The maintenance and repair of 
concrete roads is therefore as essential as that of any other concrete structure.
14.2	
Organisation and Management
14.2.1	
The maintenance of Highway Pavements generally embraces all the activities 
illustrated in Fig. 14.1.
Fig. 14.1 Schematic Diagram of Maintenance Management System
14.2.2	
Maintenance of a road requires proper supervision of skilled workmen who are 
adequately trained in various aspects of maintenance. The supervisory staff generally known 
as junior engineers in this country, is therefore to be given training in various aspects of cement 
concrete pavement work. They should be conversant with the specifications for various types 
of repair works, the choice of repair, the quality control measures needed to achieve good 
workmanship, use and upkeep of equipment and tools and safety measures to be adopted 
during the maintenance operations.
14.2.3	
Planning and scheduling of the maintenance operations should be given due 
importance. The annual renewal programme should be drawn up well in advance keeping in

IRC:SP:83-2018
102
view the condition of the surface, prescribed renewal cycle and any improvement work carried 
out recently or scheduled to be taken up in the near future. It is useful for easy comprehension 
to depict the renewal programme on bar chart indicating the renewals carried out in the last 
eight years. The budgeting for maintenance expenditure should also be done well in advance 
and the allocation of resources to the different operations of maintenance should be finalised 
simultaneously. This would facilitate the field engineer to plan and implement his programme 
effectively.
14.3	
Periodical Monitoring
14.3.1	
The Table 14.1 lists the types of formal inspections and surveys with recommended 
frequencies.

14.4 
Distress Identification and Classification
14.4.1	
By early detection, classification and repair of defects in their initial stages the rapid 
deterioration of the pavement and its joints can be prevented.



======================================================================
PAGE 111 of 140
======================================================================
103
IRC:SP:83-2018
14.4.2	
The first step to planning a maintenance operation is the evaluation of the existing 
pavement in terms of its physical condition and both its functional and structural capacity. For this 
purpose, condition surveys should be undertaken for the visual assessment of the pavement, 
which would cover not only the type but also the magnitude of the distress and its location. Apart 
from visual surveys, pavement surface evaluation based on riding quality (i.e. road roughness) 
and skid resistance should also form the basis for taking maintenance decisions.
14.4.3	
Necessary information about the routine maintenance needs will be readily available 
as the maintenance staff is expected to be continuously in touch with the physical condition 
of the road. However, for deciding periodic treatments and long term maintenance strategies, 
condition surveys carried out at a fixed frequency are a must. Keeping this in view, it is desirable 
that at least two condition surveys are conducted on each stretch of road every year, one before 
and the other after the monsoon i.e. the same frequency as with flexible pavements. Generally 
the condition surveys are carried out on foot because cracking and joint problems may not 
be discernible from a vehicle even if travelling at a slow speed. The data collected should be 
recorded methodically kilometer wise. It is desirable that these visual surveys are carried out by 
an experienced engineer at a responsible level. See Chapter 4 Proforma 4.3.
14.4.4	
Based on the condition evaluation, the causes for the various defects observed 
should be examined in detail as discussed in Chapter 4 and a decision taken whether to initiate 
a particular maintenance activity, defer the same or to go in for more detailed investigations to 
determine the treatment/rehabilitation needs precisely. Where distress on the pavement has 
reached the stage of pot holing, spalling and/or the slabs are rocking under traffic which affects 
the smooth operation of traffic, it should be rectified straightway. For other defects like cracking, 
ravelling etc., the optimal strategy should be determined having regard to the various factors 
involved including the finances available and a decision taken whether to go in for temporary 
measures like sealing/resurfacing or to strengthen/reconstruct the pavement. If the latter appears 
necessary, further investigations about structural deficiencies shall be taken up as mentioned in 
Para 4.4. In other words the planning of the various maintenance operations should be correlated 
and looked upon as a total system rather than each activity being considered in isolation. There 
can be sometimes more than one strategy to address a distress problem.
14.4.5	
Once the overall maintenance plan has been drawn up, attention should be given to 
the proper organisation management of the whole programme including deployment of various 
resources, i.e. men, materials and equipment, in an efficient manner. For each maintenance 
activity the work at site should be carefully controlled so that the optimum output and quality are 
achieved.
14.5	
Performance Standards for Maintenance
14.5.1	
The general objective of road maintenance is to provide a clear and smooth ride so 
traffic may pass safely and comfortably. The performance standards define the level at which the 
facility is to be maintained.
14.5.2	
Maintenance standards should consider the following:
	
a.	
Traffic data (volumes and axle loading)
	
b.	
Surface texture

The need to minimise traffic disruptions
14.5.3	
The basis of maintenance standards set out in this Guideline is based on the following 
fundamentals:
	
(a)	
Pavement surface - The pavement surface shall be kept thoroughly clean as 
part of the routine maintenance program at a minimum frequency of twice a 
year in rural stretches and four times a year in the habited/built up stretches so 
to protect the concrete surface from accelerated abrasion and to prevent stones 
lodging in and damaging joints (Table 14.2).
	
	
Stones and other debris on the carriageway are a safety hazard (causing broken 
windshields and swerving of vehicles to avoid larger debris) and damage the 
pavement surface. Soil and other debris accumulated beside kerbs and chute 
drains in median and beside barrier kerbs etc. prevents free drainage of water 
increasing the risk of damage under traffic.

cracking shall be repaired before the rainy season to prevent infiltration of water 
into the foundation layers.
	
(c)	
Settlement, Heave, Distortion, Faulting - Correction of surface irregularities 
shall be scheduled when the surface deviation reaches 38 mm in a length of 



======================================================================

======================================================================
105
IRC:SP:83-2018
2.5 m or when the riding quality is objectionable (> 4000 mm/km). This type of 
defect otherwise results in poor riding quality and extra loading on the slabs 
which accelerates pavement deterioration. Diamond grinding shall be applied 
when the level difference between two slabs across a joint or cut becomes more 
than 4 mm.
	
	
Regular inspection below approach slabs at bridges is also very necessary to 
detect signs of voids under the slabs and/or springyness/pumping. Settlement 
of approach slab is otherwise likely to occur. Early detection and filling of voids 
can often prevent slab settlement.
	
d)	
Spalling - Transverse spalling exceeding 100 mm in the direction of travel and 
more than 6 mm deep or other similar type defects which induce extra loading 
on the slabs and adversely affect comfort shall be repaired.
	
e)	
Joint separation - separation between the concrete slabs exceeding 3 mm 
shall be filled to prevent infiltration of water into the foundation layers. Similar 
separation/erosion occurring between the interface of concrete pavement and 
paved/unpaved shoulder should also be tilled up/repaired promptly to prevent 
run off further eroding and eventually undermining the edge of the concrete 
pavement.
14.6	
Training
14.6.1	
The MoRT&H Specifications for Road and Bridges specifies the importance of building 
in quality assurance into the planning and execution of all the works including the pavement 
works.
QUOTE “The Contractor shall ensure that all the actions are taken to build in quality assurance 
in the planning and execution of the works. The quality assurance shall cover all stages of 
work such as setting-out selection of materials, selection of equipment and plant, deployment of 
personnel and supervisory staff, quality control testing, etc.”
END OF QUOTE (Ref: Clause 105.3).
14.6.2	
Training is an integral part of Quality Assurance. The Contractor should get his staff 
trained for the following through Seminars and Training workshops:
	
(i)	
Durable concrete pavement mix design (for partial/full depth replacement and 
full panel replacement).
	
(ii)	
For pavement evaluation and identification of distress/severity rating
	
(iii)	 For cleaning of joints
	
(iv)	 For priming of joint groove and installation of sealants
	
(v)	
Marking of repair boundaries, hacking out distressed concrete and refilling of 
concrete and epoxy concrete/quick setting cementations materials
14.6.3	
The training of staff should therefore form an essential part of the execution of any 
maintenance strategy. The owner of the pavement should make it mandatory to make provision 
in the contract/document for training of Contractors’ staff so that the diagnosis of the cause and 
quality of the repair job is assured.

15 ARRANGEMENT FOR TRAFFIC AND SAFETY
15.1 
Traffic Control
15.1.1	
Since maintenance operations involve considerable hardship, inconvenience and 
hazard to traffic and also hazards to maintenance workmen, all possible precautions should be 
taken to make safe arrangements for traffic. These include erection of barriers, signs, red flags 
and lights including flickering caution lights. Efforts should be made to confine work in half the 
pavement width at a time, leaving the other half for use by the traffic. Where this is not possible, 
diversion roads may have to be constructed or the traffic diverted to some other alternative 
routes. The maintenance operation itself can be conveniently confined to a small length at a 
time, say 30 m.
15.1.2	
Traffic diversion shall be planned and implemented in accordance with the 
recommendations of IRC:SP:55 “Guidelines on Traffic Management in Work Zones”. The 
lettering shall be legible from a speeding vehicle at 100 m. Traffic signs should be of no less 
than 900 mm x 600 mm in case of rectangular signs and 900 mm in case of circular and 
triangular signs.
15.1.3	
The traffic shall be clearly warned sufficiently in advance. The appropriate warning 
sign to be used is the “Man at work” sign, as per IRC:67 “Code of Practice for Road Signs”. If 
half the road width alone is available for traffic, the “Narrow Road Ahead” sign should also be 
displayed. If closure extends into the night or several days, the signs shall be retro-reflective 
by an approved manufacturer. During night in urban stretches, (and where practical in rural 
stretches) there should be adequate lighting with a red lantern/red reflectors. Adequate ward and 
watch shall be provided to prevent stealing of all the traffic control devices.
15.2	
Safe Working Environment
15.2.1	
The safety of the worker shall also be addressed in the program. Job instructions 
shall include safety items that should be addressed while undertaking repairs. These should 
include:
	
(a)	
Use of high visibility clothing
	
(b)	
Correct lifting techniques
	
(c)	
Understanding hazardous materials used and correct mixing and application
	
(d)	
Moving vehicles outside the site
	
(e)	
Correct use and handling of plant
	
(f)	
Awareness of underground and or overhead cables and utility services
	
(g)	
Availability and general awareness of First Aid Kits

APPENDIX – D 
TREATMENT AND UPGRaDING OF ERODED SOFT EARTHEN SHOULDERS
The narrow soft earthen shoulders typically observed on State and National Highway projects 
are important design shortcoming.
The MoRT&H Clause 305.2.1 provides for a mixture of soil, moorum, and gravel but the designers 
generally keep the specification for the earthen shoulder the same as for sub-grade material as 
in the case illustrated below which specifies a material satisfying the design CBR of 6%. 
Photo 1 Erosion, Wear and Tear of Soft Earthen Shoulder. 
Trucks preferring to park on outer lane.
Shoulders should however provide lateral support to the edges of the pavement, be of sufficient 
width and strength to support the parking of heavy vehicles under all weather conditions, shed off 
water, be durable and protect the lateral sub-drainage to the pavement below. Soft soil shoulders 
cannot comply with such requirements. 



======================================================================
PAGE 131 of 140
======================================================================

IRC:SP:83-2018
Soft shoulders are easily eroded. After erosion they do not provide comfortable walk for 
pedestrians, cannot provide a margin for error to avoid accidents nor be used by vehicles for 
parking. The erosion of shoulders is both superficial and internal and such erosion seriously 
undermines the embankments if left untreated which is often the case in rural areas. 
Erosion is often more severe at the interface of paved to unpaved shoulder. Transverse erosion/
gullying of shoulders can develop by piping and often be concealed by poor control of over 
growth. 
The severity of soft shoulder’s erosion will increase after every rainy season and a situation will 
be created where the edges of the flexible (and the rigid) pavement will be seriously undermined 
by lack of lateral support. (Photo 2) 
Photo 2 Complete Erosion and Undermining of Rigid Pavement has Commenced
Proper treatment can be provided by turfing, brick on edge or from soil aggregate mixture.
Turfing the shoulder and whole side slope may prove satisfactory under certain climatic conditions 
as illustrated in the Photo 3.

generally comply with a close graded GSB (Grading I) material. PI in the range 
3 – 12%. (Photo 4).

It is further recommended that where the condition of existing soft shoulders is poor and 
unsatisfactory, the top 20 cm be replaced by hard granular shoulders with CBR > 30 as above as 
part of the engineering improvements proposed for the short term operations and maintenance 
contracts.
Recommended specification for special surface course gravel suitable for a trafficable 
unpaved shoulder are based on the materials described in the Technical Paper by N.B. Lal and 
S.C.Sharma(Ref: 1).

DETAILS OF MU-METER AND BRITISH PENDULUM TEST
Mu-Meter: It is a battery-powered equipment used as a continuous friction measuring and 
reporting system, mainly designed for testing road surfaces, airport runways and taxiways. 
Features like fully shock absorbed suspension, aerodynamic fairings; and low centre of gravity 
ensure that the laterally loaded wheels remain in firm contact with the road surface at all times, 
even at high speeds.
This equipment consists of a small three-wheeled trailer (weight 254 kg) incorporating electronic 
measuring systems which operate in conjunction with a computer carried in the chosen towing 
vehicle. The trailer unit comprises of a triangular frame on which two friction measuring wheels 
are mounted as shown in Fig. 1. The built-in recorder of Mu-meter is shown in Fig. 2.The rear 
wheel which drives the recorder also measures the distance. It measures the sideway coefficient 
of friction generated between the test surface and the smooth tread tyres operating at 7.5 degrees 
angle to the directions of travel under the wet condition. The speed of measurement for normal 
recording is 64 km/hr. In Mu-meter, the force required to slide the tyre is divided by the wheel 
load and multiplied by 100 to calculate the skid number. The skid resistance numbers for various 
traffic speeds are indicated in Table 1.

British Pendulum Tester: The British pendulum test is a common procedure for laboratory 
as well as field measurement of the low-speed friction of a road surface material. It is widely 
suggested that the measured low-speed friction is largely governed by the surface microtexture 
of the road material, and many researchers and practitioners have considered the friction 
measurements made by the British pendulum test to be an indirect form of measurement of 
available microtexture of the road material. The test results demonstrated that the low-speed

friction measurements by the British pendulum tester (as shown in Fig. 3) were significantly 
affected by test surface macrotexture. British pendulum test may not produce a correct assessment 
of the skid resistance of the true road surface. The value measured by the tester is expressed in 
terms of British Pendulum Number (BPN). British Pendulum Tester gives higher skid resistance 
rating than dynamic tyre and trailer test. British Pendulum Number rating between 45 and 55 
indicates a satisfactory surface in only favourable weather and vehicle conditions. Rating of 55 
or greater indicates generally acceptable skid resistance (SN) in all conditions. A 65 and above 
rating indicates a good to excellent skid resistance in all conditions. The BPN measurements are 
taken on wet surface.
