ROUTE MARKER SIGNS FOR STATE ROUTES
1.
INTRODUCTION
1.1.
On
the
recommendation
of
the
Planning
Commission,
States have declared certain through routes within
their
respective
jurisdictions as State Routes and assigned them route numbers.
It
has been considered desirable
for various reasons that route mark-
ing signs should be fixed along State Routes.
1.2.
To
ensure
that
a
uniform
type
of route marker sign
is
used on all State Routes in India, the type design given
herein
has
been
prepared
by
the
Specifications
and
Standards Committee
(personnel given on inside front cover).
The design was approved
by the Executive Committee in their meeting held
in
March
1969
and
later
by
the
Council
of
the Indian Roads Congress in their
meeting held at Bhubaneswar on the 26th and 27th May, 1969
for
general adoption.
2.
DESIGN
2.1.
A
'State
Route'
marker
sign
shall
consist
of
a
shield
marked
on
a
rectangular plate 450 mm by 600 mm.
The design
is given in Plate
1.
2.2.
The
border
of
the
shield shall be in black.
The upper
portion of the shield within the black border shall have a
brilliant
green background, the colour conforming to the
Indian
Standard
Colour
No.
221.
The name
of the S fate
in full or in an abbre-
viated* form, shall appear in
white
over
the
green
background.
The background of the lower portion shall be
white.
The
letters
SR'
(State
Route)
and
numerals of the route number shall be in
black on this white backrgound.
2.3.
The size, shape and spacing of letters and numerals
shall
conform to those given in Fig.
1 and Plates
1, 5 and 6.
* N.B.—Names
of
States
upto
five
letters in length can be accommodated
in full on the
shield.
For
longer names,
thinner
letters
(the
height however
remaining 80 mm) or suitable abbreviations may be used.

The sign shall be erected on State Routes ahead
of ther
intersections
with
other
important
roads,
immediately
after the
intersections
as
confirmatory
signs,
and at such other points that
may be considered necessary to guide the
through
traffic,
e.g.,
at
suitable places through built-up areas.
3.2.
The
route
markers
shall
be
erected as indicated in the
drawing titled "Arrangement for Erection of State
Route
Marker

3.3.
On
roads
without
kerbs, they shall have a clear distance
of 2 to 3 metre
between the post and the edge of the
carriageway.
On
roads
with
kerbs,
the
sign
post shall not be less than 60 cm
away from the edge of the kerb.
To avoid specular reflection from
the sign face, the sign shall be turned slightly away from
the

The sign shall be erected on the State Route at a
distance
of 100 to 150 metre
