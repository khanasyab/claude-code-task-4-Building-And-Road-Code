Manual FOR PlanNing and DEVELOPMENT OF URBAN ROADS AND STREETS
Introduction
India is facing rapid urbanization due to economic growth and industrialization. The urbanization 
process has been accompanied with increased urban sprawl, travel demand and trip distances. 
Therefore, it is imperative that urban mobility of people and goods be planned to minimize 
congestion and other social and environmental impacts. City planning shall be done with 
integrated land-use transport strategies to address people’s needs and improve road mobility 
and safety for all users.
“Cities are for people.”
Sustainable mobility as a concept aims to reduce not only one’s own travel footprint but also 
that of society. Therefore, a sustainable transport system should address not only an individual’s 
mobility needs but also that of society at large. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs 
(MoHUA) Government of India (GoI) has taken several steps in this direction, including the 
National Urban Transport Policy (NUTP) issued in 2006 and revisited in 2014.This policy aimed 
to bring about comprehensive improvements in urban transport services and infrastructure. The 
focus of policy is on moving people rather than vehicles. The MoHUA has also launched the 
National Mission on Sustainable Habitats, which addresses norms for parking and congestion 
charges, pedestrianization and cycling and proposes model regulations for integrating transport 
planning with master plans. The Smart City Mission – an initiative of the government - has also 
prioritized street design and improvement based on citizen consultations. 
To respond to these initiatives, the Indian Roads Congress decided to prepare a Manual for 
Planning and Development of Urban Roads and Streets, which are principal infrastructure for 
movement of people and freight in a city. Accordingly, Urban Roads and Streets Committee (H-8) 
was entrusted with the task of preparing this Manual. The H-8 Committee in its meeting held on 
20.05.2017 entrusted the work of preparation of initial draft to Shri Ashok Bhattacharjee. Later, 
Ms. Shreya Gadepalli was also requested to assist in the task of preparation of the draft. The 
initial draft prepared was discussed by the subgroup consisting of Shri D.P. Gupta, Ms. Paromita 
Roy, Prof. (Dr.) M. Parida, Dr. Ch. Ravi Sekhar, Dr. Sewa Ram and Ms. Sonal Shah and valuable 
inputs were received from Shri Amit Bhatt and Ms. Anjlee Agarwal. The H-8 Committee approved 
the document in its meeting held on 18.08.2017 for placing before the HSS Committee. 
The composition of the H-8 Committee is given below:

document in its meeting held on 24th October, 2017. The Executive Committee in its meeting 
held on 2nd November, 2017 considered and approved the document for placing before the 
Council. The Council in its 213th meeting held at Bengaluru on 3rd November, 2017 considered 
and approved the draft for printing.
The manual advocates for an allocation of equitable road space for all users and creating pedestrian 
friendly, green streets to make our city spaces liveable, universally accessible and inclusive. 
This manual provides a framework for classifying, planning and developing road networks in 
new urban areas and retrofitting of existing urban roads and streets. It further outlines a street 
design and implementation process to enable the urban local bodies to effectively implement the 
planning guidelines.

Chapter 1 
Land Use and Transport Infrastructure 
1.1	
Urban Roads and Streets Challenges
The following challenges underpin the planning of transport infrastructure in urban areas in India. 
1.1.1	
Land-use transport integration
Urban planning has traditionally focused on land use planning with zoning regulations and 
development control norms for orderly development of the city. Urban roads and streets constitute 
the basic transport infrastructure in towns and cities. The urban road and street network system 
is largely determined by land use planning through either the Master Plan or the Development 
Plan of the city. 
An integrated land use- road network system provides safe and comfortable transport system. 
Currently, the secondary and local street network is either not developed or not planned in 
consonance with the primary network system of the master plan/development plan. This leads to 
skewed distribution of traffic over the street network, concentration of local traffic at a few major 
junctions on arterial roads leading to long queue lengths, while the secondary network remains 
under-utilized. This also forces pedestrian/non-motorized transport to take long detours even 
for short distances, and even inducing them to switch to motorized modes, which exacerbates 
motorized traffic congestion.
1.1.2	
Zoning regulations and development controls
Specific zoning regulations, development control norms and building bylaws guide the 
development of buildings, but there are no defined norms in the Master Plan/Development Plans 
to guide road network planning and development process. For example, there are no street 
bylaws for regulated development of roads in urban areas.
1.1.3	
Auto dependence and large trip distances
Excessive Right of Way (ROW) for arterial roads with scant respect for needs of vulnerable road 
users leads to automobile oriented development, especially in new cities and urban extension 
areas. Compact cities ensure that work trips are kept to a minimal distance. There is need for 
improved facilities for pedestrians and cyclists.
1.1.4	
Urban road infrastructure development
The current practice of single land-use planning leads to sprawl in cities that results in increased 
motorization requiring more road capacity (Fig. 1). There is need to ensure that the geometric 
design norms and standards for urban roads are suitable for all users, not only motorized traffic. 
Safe mobility and universal accessibility need to be an integral part of planned urban transport 
development.

Fig. 1 Vicious Motorization Cycle
1.1.5	
Impact on congestion, air quality and road safety
High speeds are one of the primary causes of road fatalities. Urban roads facilitating high vehicle 
speeds create unsafe environments for pedestrians/cyclists in particular, due to lack of facilities 
for these road users. The high level of motorization also results in high level of pollution with 
negative health impact.
In the present scenario, with enhanced socio-economic base, affordability of population has 
increased and the number of private motorized vehicles has increased significantly in recent 
decades. As a nation, there is no cap on owning private vehicles. Vehicle ownership continues 
to increase unchecked, supported with growing aspirations of a rapidly urbanizing society. 
However, it is necessary to strengthen and improve the public transport system so that people 
are attracted to shift their mode of travel from car to walk/cycle or use of non-motorized transport 
for short trips and to public transport for long trips. Simultaneously, travel demand management 
measures such as on-street parking management, congestion pricing, road tolls and transit-
oriented development are required to disincentivize the use of personal motor vehicles.
1.2	
Spatial Planning and Transport Policy
Integrated spatial and transport planning in existing and new urban areas can reduce motorized 
travel by influencing the location, scale, density, design and mix of land uses, making it safer 
and easier for people to access jobs, shopping, leisure facilities and services by public transport, 
walking and cycling. Compact, dense and interconnected layouts are more suitable for providing 
public transportation. Urban growth should be encouraged along mass rapid transit corridors to 
achieve transit oriented development i.e. compact growth supported with mixed land uses, dense 
street networks and mixed income housing. Consistent application of these planning policies will 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:118-2018
5
reduce reliance on private modes of transport and enable people to make sustainable transport 
choices. This will help in reducing congestion and air pollution. 
1.3	
Mobility Planning
Mobility planning in urban areas should give priority to the needs of pedestrians, cyclists and 
non-motorized transport along with motorized vehicles. Focus should be given to mode priority 
indicated in Fig. 2.
An urban mobility system should be inclusive and equitable in terms of system adoption and 
infrastructure provisions. Planning should be done at two tiers: city-level and zonal, ward or 
local area plan levels, such that macro city level plans are duly supported with a second tier 
of detailed plans to facilitate walking and cycling within and across neighbourhoods, thereby 
providing sustainable, short distance, safe travel options.
1.3.1	
Mode priorities
The priority in urban transport planning should shift from planning for motor vehicles to non-
polluting, energy efficient, people-centric and safe modes of transport providing access to all.

Universal accessibility
Improved mobility is a crucial and necessary element in alleviating poverty for all, including 
women, children, elderly and persons with disabilities. It provides opportunities for everyone 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:118-2018

to play an active role in society - economically, socially and culturally. Universally accessible 
design will help increase the number of people walking and the number of people using public 
transportation. To ensure this, pedestrian environment and all transit systems – buses, bus 
shelters, Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), metro, rail terminals and stations etc. should not only be 
accessible, but should also provide continuity in the complete trip chain.
A complete trip chain (connectivity and seamless journey) starts from the point of origin to the 
walk/commute, cycle and/or wait for transport, boarding, travel and alighting followed by the 
walk/commute to the final destination (Fig. 3). Each trip chain must ensure pedestrian safety 
for all including persons with and without disabilities. Any break in the trip chain results in 
lack of access and independent mobility. Inaccessible links require taking an indirect route, 
increasing travel times, fatigue, uncertainty and potential modal conflicts. The goal must be 
for people to have access to all vehicles and the full-service area, as well as the pedestrian 
environment.1 
Fig. 3 Complete Trip Chain
1.3.3	
Urban road safety
Road safety and safety audits are becoming imperative in the current scenario where number 
of road accidents and fatalities have been escalating every year. Inclusion of safety audits 
at the planning and design stage of road projects should become a practice to cater to the 
needs of vulnerable road users especially pedestrians, wheelchairs, cyclists, non-motorized 
transport (NMT) users and two-wheelers. The Urban and Regional Development Plan 
Formulation and Implementation Guidelines (URDPFI) provide safety indicators to be followed 
and inclusion of road safety in development plans, mobility plans etc. For road safety audits, 
IRC:SP:88 - 2019 "Manual on Road Safety Audit" should be referred.

Chapter 2 
Urban Roads and Streets
Good street planning and design is a key element of smart development. Streets are places 
where land use and transportation connect. The planning and design of road networks must 
prioritize accessibility to destinations by different groups of people – men, women, children, 
elderly and persons with disabilities - using different modes of transport i.e. walking, cycles, cycle 
rickshaws, buses, mini-buses, auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws, two-wheelers and four wheelers. .
The major components of street network planning are:
	
Pattern of the street network: A pattern of streets with fine grid of narrow streets that 
result in numerous connections and short blocks, makes it easier to move around - 
people have more than one way to reach a destination. Street design that considers 
this concept can help reduce traffic congestion. It can also make it possible for children 
to walk or bicycle to school.
	
Right of way: Streets with balanced distribution of right of way for non-motorized 
users and motorized vehicles improve movement and safety of all users in mixed 
traffic conditions.
	
Physical elements along the streetscape: Streets are designed for all users as per 
existing  and projected  demand, including various components such as carriageway, 
footpath, trees , road side furniture required to make ‘complete streets’.
2.1	
Design Principles, Objectives and Street Components
Urban Roads refer to the primary network comprising of arterial roads of a city-region and 
provide intra-city and regional connectivity through rapid transit, high frequency public transit 
and motor vehicle movement. They connect large land uses such as terminals, city-regional 
health, education, recreation and transit facilities, and constitute an ‘Arterial Road’ network. 
These roads have provision of footpaths for pedestrians and may require physical segregation 
for non-motorized vehicles. 
Urban Streets refer to the secondary network of the city comprising of ‘Sub-Arterial, Collector 
and Local Streets’. These connect neighbourhoods to the arterial road network and provide 
accessibility within neighbourhoods. While collector roads also connect large land uses, this 
network is pedestrian and non-motorized vehicle focused with an emphasis on creating active 
public spaces. 
2.1.1	
Design principles
	
Accessibility: People should be able to move safely and seamlessly through the city.
	
Safety and Comfort: Streets are safe, clean and walkable.  
	
Ecology: Streets are climate resilient and reduce impact on the natural environment.
	
Social Concerns: Streets cater to the access needs of local communities, elderly 
and persons with disabilities.

2.1.2	
Design objectives
The design objectives of urban roads and streets shall be:
	
Allocate the right of way equitably between motorized and non-motorized road users 
duly catering to the needs of pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users, thereby 
promoting both accessibility and mobility. Encourage people to walk, cycle and use 
public transport by making the experience safer, comfortable and pleasant. 
	
Create safe, traffic calmed environments that promote healthy lifestyles and respond 
to the distinctive nature of communities and places.
	
Provide climatic resilience and promote environmental sustainability by incorporating, 
enhancing natural features (trees, natural drains, foliage) and preventing/mitigating 
negative socio-economic and environmental impacts. 
	
Create lively and vibrant public spaces catering to the needs of all, especially the 
most vulnerable road users such as women, children, the elderly and persons with 
disabilities. 
2.1.3	
Street components and definitions
Terminology
Accessibility: Facilities offered to people to reach social and economic opportunities, measured 
in terms of time, cost, comfort, and safety that are associated with reaching such opportunities.
Bus Rapid Transit (BRT): High quality bus based mass transit system that delivers fast, 
comfortable, reliable and cost-effective urban mobility through the provision of segregated right-
of-way infrastructure, rapid and frequent operations, and excellence in marketing and customer 
service.
Complete Streets: Streets that are designed for all uses as per existing and projected local 
demand, including all modes of mobility as well as street vending, trees, street furniture etc.
Greenway: A waterway or strip of land set aside for recreational use of environmental protection 
and where vegetation is encouraged along with exclusive facilities for cycling and walking.
Mass Rapid Transit (MRT): A high quality public transport system characterized by high capacity, 
comfort, overall attractiveness, use of technology in passenger information system, and ensuring 
reliability using dedicated right of way for transit vehicles (i.e. rail tracks or bus lanes).
Non-Motorized Transport (NMT): Human powered transportation such as walking and cycling.
On-Street Parking: The space occupied by vehicles to park along the edge of the street or 
carriageway which otherwise could have been used by motorized or non-motorized traffic.
Intermediate Public Transport: The term refers to informal public transport, including vehicles 
like auto rickshaw, vans, tempo, jeeps, private city buses and private city minibuses that operate 
on a shared or per seat basis on informally organized routes operated by private sector and has

9
intermediate stops.  The service may or may not have a predefined “fare structure.”  The term 
“Intermediate Public Transport (IPT)” means the same.
Public Transport (PT): Shared passenger vehicle which is publicly available for multiple users. 
The term “PT” as used in this document and other toolkits includes city buses and Mass Rapid 
Transit (MRT).
Parking Management: A mechanism to ensure the efficient use of street space, and over time, 
parking fees can be introduced to manage demand.
Sustainable Transport Modes: Walking, cycling, and public transport (including a regular bus 
service as well as an MRT system) are categorized as “sustainable modes” of urban transport 
because when compared with personal motor vehicles, they consume least amount of road 
space and fuel per person-km and also cost much less to build the infrastructure. 
Traffic calming: Traffic calming measures ensure pedestrian and vehicle safety by reducing 
speed. Traffic calming slows down vehicles through vertical displacements, horizontal 
displacement, real or perceived narrowing of carriageway, material/colour changes that signal 
conflict point.
	
Right of Way (RoW): It is the space between two property lines, reserved in any 
legal development plan/planning document/spatial plan for the movement of all 
transport modes. The RoW of roads is designated under the ‘Transportation’ land use 
(Fig. 4). 
	
Cross section of the road: It shows the space allocation for all motorized vehicles 
(cars, scooter, buses etc.), non-motorized vehicles (cycle, cycle rickshaws etc.), 
pedestrians, medians, street furniture, utilities, etc. within the right of way.

	
Non-Motorized Vehicle Track: It is a space reserved for movement of only non-
motorized vehicles like cycle, cycle rickshaws and hand pull carts.
	
Multi-functional Zone: A multi-functional zone ranges one to two metres wide. It 
is provided between the pedestrian zone and carriageway to provide amenities. It 
accommodates tree pits, storm water swales, auto-rickshaw stands, cycle-rickshaw 
stands, hawker zones, paid car parking, bus stops, traffic police booths, telecom 
boxes, fire hydrants, junction boxes, street lights/pedestrian lights etc.
	
Bus Shelters and Intermediate Public Transport (IPT) Stands: This includes bus 
shelters and IPT shelters to provide a sheltered waiting area for users.
	
Traffic Calming Measures: Traffic calming slows down vehicles through vertical 
displacement, horizontal displacement, real or perceived narrowing of carriageway, 
material/colour changes that signal conflict point, or complete closure of a street. 
These improve both pedestrian and vehicle user safety.
	
Pedestrian Crossings: These can be indicated through road markings or as table 
top crossings and facilitate crossing at mid-blocks and intersections. 
	
Trees/Landscaping: Trees provide shade for the entire right of way. Planting can 
serve as water percolation pits, while improving the aesthetics of the street.

	
Street Lighting: This encompasses lighting for the carriageway, footpaths and 
Non- Motorized Vehicle (NMV) tracks.
	
Street Vending: Vendors provide affordable goods and services for all road users, 
especially pedestrians and cyclists. They are considered as a street element for 
Indian streets. 
	
Signage: This includes mandatory, and regulatory, cautionary, direction and 
information traffic signages for pedestrians, cyclists, public transport and motor 
vehicle users.
	
Carriageway: It is a space meant for movement of motorized vehicles and can be 
divided/undivided depending upon the category of road. Fair share of space within 
right of way should be provided for pedestrians, cyclists and other non-motorized 
vehicles while planning for the carriageway. On local streets where the carriageway 
maybe shared by pedestrians, non-motorized and motorized vehicles, speeds shall 
be reduced through traffic calming elements.
	
Service Lanes: These are traffic calmed, shared streets provided at the edge of 
arterial roads to provide property access, where there are too many entrances 
(say at every 15 m or less).They can increase the mobility function of the main 
carriageway while also maintaining liveability for non-motorized road users.
	
Parking Access: The space occupied by vehicles to park along the edge of the 
street or carriageway which otherwise could have been used by motorized or non-
motorized traffic.
Underground Space
	
Urban Street Utilities: All city underground sewers, water, electric and other 
communication cable lines should be properly mapped and re-laid wherever possible 
/feasible in underground service ducts or Hume pipes. Careful location and planning 
of physical infrastructure services and urban utilities is critical –to allow easy access 
for regular repair and maintenance of utilities, while causing minimum disruption or 
disturbance to other street users.
	
The conventional construction of open/covered roadside drain systems has drained 
out precious rain water without capturing the potential of recharging depleting 
ground water. In many instances, the covering of natural drains, dumping of waste 
and sewage has also resulted in impeding the natural cleaning of drains. Therefore, 
there is an urgent need to focus on storm water drainage system planning and 
management.
	
Common Utility Ducts/Duct Bank: Common ducts may be provided for city level 
utilities (such as sewers, water supply, electricity etc.) and separately for street 
utilities (such as local storm water drains, information technology, telecom, street 
lighting cables, etc.) during the laying/relaying/retrofitting of roads, in order to 
facilitate efficient repairs, maintenance of all systems, without disruptions of the 
street during such activities. For more details, refer to IRC:98.

2.2	
Classification of Urban Roads and Streets
The following typologies of urban roads with specific functions and development norms be 
adopted:
	
Urban Expressways
	
Arterial Road
	
Sub Arterial Road
	
Collector Street
	
Local Street
	
Non-Motorized Transport (NMT) Streets and Greenways 
2.2.1	
Urban Expressways
	
An urban expressway is defined as an urban arterial highway for high speed regional 
passenger and goods traffic from inter-city highways/expressways to connect to 
other inter-city highways entering the city at specific locations. These are full access 
control and having divided carriageways provided generally with grade separators 
at intersections. In new areas, urban expressways maybe planned as a primary ring 
road around a city or metropolitan region to connect with the regional road network 
comprising primarily of National Highways, State Highways etc.
	
All regional level passenger and freight terminal centres maybe located on this ring 
road to have faster access, regional distribution and intermodal transfer opportunity. 
	
Urban expressways should connect to the arterial road network at specific locations. 
	
Entry junctions with highways and primary ring roads of the city may have flyovers 
with/without cloverleaf structure to facilitate signal free movement of traffic either to 
destined or bypassing the city. 
	
Bypass roads may be considered for inter-city traffic, instead of new urban 
expressways running through city boundaries. Town planning schemes may be 
considered to obtain land for bypass roads to avoid the displacement of people and 
social and financial costs associated with land acquisition. Bypass roads shall be 
considered after a careful evaluation of alternate route options and a comparison of 
social, environmental/pollution and economic costs to users and non-users.
2.2.2	
Arterial Roads
A general term denoting a road/street primarily for through traffic, usually on a continuous 
route. Arterial roads facilitate mobility across the city and connect to long distance destinations 
within/outside the city, while providing safe NMT facilities. Safety for pedestrians will be ensured 
by providing dedicated footpaths, at-grade pedestrian crossing with a median refuge and at 
distances as per IRC:103. A dedicated non-motorized vehicle track network shall be provided. 
On-street parking shall be prohibited or restricted, except when there is space available for a 
service lane with parking.



======================================================================
PAGE 23 of 88
======================================================================
IRC:SP:118-2018
13
	
Arterial roads in new areas shall have a right of way of 45-60 m with future provision 
for mass rapid transit. 
	
In existing areas with a right of way less than 45 m, the arterial roads shall be 
classified based on their function in the street network and ensure minimum 
pedestrian and/or cycling facilities. The redesign shall increase passenger capacity 
by increasing frequency of mainline buses and/or implementing high-quality mass 
rapid transit, such as Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) or metro-rail.
2.2.3	
Sub-Arterial Roads
A general term denoting a road/street primarily for through traffic usually on a continuous 
route but offering somewhat lower level of traffic mobility than the arterial road. These are 
larger collector streets meant for movement through neighbourhoods and to connect to arterial 
roads. Sub-arterial roads shall have adequately sized footpaths as per IRC:103, continuous 
non-motorized vehicle network and street furniture to cater to the adjacent land use. The 
medians shall include pedestrian refuges for safe street-level crossing and at distances as per 
IRC:103. 
	
In new areas, the right of way shall vary from 30-45 m along with future provision for 
mass transit. 
	
In existing areas with a right of way less than 30 m, the sub-arterial roads can be 
classified based on their function in the street network and after ensuring minimum 
pedestrian, public transport and/or cycling facilities. The redesign shall be based 
on increasing passenger capacity by increasing frequency of mainline buses and/
or implementing high-frequency and high-quality mass rapid transit, such as Bus 
Rapid Transit (BRT) or metro-rail.
2.2.4	
Collector Streets
	
A street for collecting and distributing traffic from and to local streets and also for 
providing access to arterial/sub-arterial roads. They shall be designed with dedicated 
footpaths and crossings as per IRC:103. Various speed reduction measures will be 
employed to limit vehicle speeds to less than 40 kmph and ensure safety of NMT 
users. Public transport feeder buses may operate on such streets. In new areas, the 
right of way shall vary from 15-30 m. 
	
○	
Collector roads with a right of way of 24 m and above may have a divided 
carriageway with 2 lanes per direction, pedestrian facilities as per IRC:103 and 
cycle tracks. The median shall be intermittent to allow for connectivity to local 
streets and U-turns. 
	
○	
Collector roads with a right of way less than 24 m may have an undivided 
carriageway with one lane per direction and pedestrian facilities as per 
IRC:103. A combined cycle track maybe considered for roads with right of way 
varying between 20-24 m.

2.2.5	
Local Streets
	
A street for access to residence, business or other abutting property. Its primary 
function shall be for local traffic and access to properties and not through movement 
of traffic. For new areas, the right of way is recommended at 10-15 m. 
	
In existing areas, local streets may have a right of way less than 10 m, which primarily 
provide access to properties. In such cases, the streets may not have a dedicated 
footpath and can be designed as shared space that gives priority to non-motorized 
transport users. Various traffic calming elements will be employed to ensure that 
vehicle speeds are below 20 kmph - safe for intermingling of pedestrians, cyclists, 
and motor vehicles. Staggered on-street parking, chicanes, speed humps can serve 
as  traffic calming measures.
2.2.6	
Non-Motorized Transport Streets and Greenways
Non-motorized transport only streets: All motor vehicle traffic will be prohibited, using barriers 
and enforcement to prevent their entry and encroachment of non-motorized transport space. 
Such streets will be designed in compliance with universal access guidelines, with bicycle 
parking, and access for emergency response vehicles. Commercial deliveries to properties 
on such streets will be restricted to outside of normal hours. Streets shall be identified where 
pedestrian density is the highest, such as those in important market streets, historical and 
cultural areas, and develop them as non-motorized transport only streets with plazas, seating, 
trees and structures for shade, as well as space for organized street vending.
Non-motorized transport: Public transport only streets: Private motorized vehicle traffic will 
be prohibited but public transport services will be allowed, in addition to pedestrians and 
cyclists. Streets shall be identified based on the amount of non-motorized transport traffic and 
the need for access by and through movement of public transport modes. 
Greenways: The spaces along natural features such as water bodies, lakes and parks shall 
be developed as a network of exclusive facilities for walking and cycling only, with a variety of 
public spaces and natural features. Motor vehicle traffic will be prohibited on these roads. Such 
greenways shall have a minimum clear width of 7.5 m to accommodate two-way movement of 
cyclists and pedestrians. 
The planning considerations for new roads (Table 1) and redesign of existing roads (Table 2) 
are given for the above classes of roads. The right of way for various hierarchies of existing 
roads needs to allocate space drawing a balance between the needs of motorized vehicles 
and non-motorized vehicles including pedestrians.

Chapter 3 
Transport Network Planning
3.1	
Network Planning Principles
Urban road network systems are influenced by land use systems and development patterns, 
with a hierarchy of settlements based on urban functions, activities, and land constraints etc. 
However, the ease and quality of access to land uses and their functional inter-relationships 
are determined by connectivity. In the absence of network planning guidelines, often city 
and neighbourhood level accessibility is overlooked in the urban planning process leading to 
congested major roads and poorly connected neighbourhoods. 
The urban roads and street network shall:
	
Provide an efficient and safe access for ‘people’ and facilitate movement of non-
motorized traffic and pedestrians along with motorized traffic. 
	
Accommodate the travel demand of all road users with provision of space for all 
modes satisfying the safety, equity and environmental criteria.
	
Achieve universal accessibility with the specific provisions for people with disability/ 
restricted mobility/elderly, women and children for their safety and convenience.
	
Develop a complete road network system to distribute traffic over the entire network 
rather than concentration of traffic along a few corridors. The arterial road network 
shall be supplemented with secondary network of sub-arterial, collector and local 
streets through detailed planning at the ward, local area plan levels. 
	
Develop a secondary network for short distance (localised) non-motorized and 
motorized travel and integrate it with the arterial network for long distance travel.
	
○	
Provide direct pedestrian and non-motorized connectivity to transit stops and 
facilities in the neighbourhood. 
	
○	
Provide bus corridor space with adequate infrastructure support for efficient 
transit options to enhance modal share in favor of public transport.
	
○	
Provide designated and demarcated spaces for all public transport modes with 
strategically located spaces for Intermediate Public Transport (IPT-hired/shared 
modes) stands for efficient last mile connectivity option for people. Provide traffic 
control measures (signals, signages and road markings) on all urban arterial 
and collector roads for regulated movement of traffic. 
	
Suburban road network planning with low density, gated communities serviced by 
high speed corridors and cul-de sacs shall be avoided. These increase walking and 
cycling distances and do not facilitate planning for public transit. 
3.2	
Urban Road Network Pattern
Urban road network density, which determines block sizes are a key indicator of auto-centric or 
walkable neighbourhoods and cities. In several cities today, in the absence of well-developed 
secondary and local street networks, the local traffic tends to accumulate at a few major

junctions, causing large queue lengths and congestion at these locations, while majority of the 
internal streets remain under-utilized due to discontinuity. Lack of these networks also forces 
pedestrians and NMT to take long detours even for short distances, thus inducing them to switch 
to motorized modes, which in turn further adds to motorized traffic congestion. Often solutions 
such as flyovers and grade separators are proposed and implemented to reduce delays at major 
junctions while a better and sustainable solution may lie in increasing road network connectivity 
in the area and provide more route-options.
Network connectivity improves mobility, transportation choices, road safety and creates economic 
vibrancy (Fig. 6).

3.2.1	
Tools for measuring network connectivity
Connectivity is the primary purpose of any transportation network as it links locations between 
which people want to travel. Travel is a "derived demand" i.e. we travel to access locations, and 
the mode of travel is determined amongst other factors, by the road network. Travel demand 
modelling assigns a cost to travel that includes a time “cost”. All else being equal, shorter travel 
times are preferred. This is particularly true for bicycling and walking, which are slower than 
motorized travel. There are practical limits to how far a person will walk or cycle and therefore 
increased network connectivity can reduce travel distances for all modes, including walking and 
bicycling. 
An additional benefit of increased connectivity for these modes is having a wider range of routes 
from which to choose. A cyclist, for example, might choose a slightly longer route if he/she can 
use a bicycle lane, a street with less traffic, or a less steep hill. However, pedestrians invariably 
prefer shorter distances for travel.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:118-2018
21
Measuring the network connectivity is a critical tool in evaluating existing neighbourhoods 
for traffic throughput, efficient dispersal and walkability. It also provides a public policy tool to 
establish performance standards for new and/or existing developments. 
Network connectivity can be measured in any of the following ways:
3.2.1.1.	
Block Length Standard
A block is typically defined as the smallest 
fully enclosed polygon bounded by features 
such 
as 
publicly 
accessible 
motorized/ 
mixed-traffic roads or streams, on all sides 
(Fig. 7). Shorter blocks mean more intersections 
and, therefore, shorter travel distances and a 
greater number of routes between locations. 
For measuring overall connectivity of an 
existing area, the average block length for a 
defined area should not be more than say 125 
m. Any block length that exceeds 125 m on 
any side must provide additional pedestrian 
thoroughfares. A more direct method is the 
perimeter of an urban block. A walkable block 
perimeter ranges from 400 m to 500 m.
Fig. 7 Measuring Block Length
3.2.1.2.	
Block Area Standard
The block area should not be greater than 15000 m2. However, this is generally inadequate in 
measuring pedestrian connectivity because in case the length to width ratio of the block is high, 
it may still mean long detours for the pedestrians (Fig. 8).

3.2.1.3.	
Urban Block Sizes, Intersection Density and Spacing
Urban block sizes are a direct reflection of intersection density and spacing (see Fig. 9 for 
broad relationship). A well-connected street network would require around 100 junctions 
per  m2, excluding cul-de-sacs and dead-ends. Intersection spacing is a common form of 
measurement for network connectivity as it is easy to measure. As mentioned above, a 
well-connected street network would have a vehicular road at least every 250 m and a 
pedestrian or non-motorized transport pathway at least every 125 m. In case of hilly areas, 
these desirable distances may be reduced to 100 m and 80 m respectively. Fig. 10 illustrates 
case example of a few cities.

The block size in the Manhattan district of New York varies from 50-80 m X 120-285 m which 
creates a dense street network, whereas in Chandigarh, it is 800 m X 1200 m and in Naya 
Raipur it is 800 m X 800 m, which discourage walking (Fig. 10).

3.2.1.4.	
Pedestrian Route Directness (PRD)
Pedestrian Route Directness (PRD) is the ratio of route distance to straight-line distance for two 
selected points (Fig. 11). The lowest possible value is 1.00, where the route is the same distance 
as the "crow flies" distance. Numbers closer to 1.00 indicate a more direct route, representing 
a more connected network. Neighbourhoods with well-connected grid street networks and

23
relatively short blocks would have PRDs of 1.1-1.5, which is preferable. Neighbourhoods with 
more curvilinear streets and cul-de-sacs may have PRDs more than 1.5 (1.6-2.5). These are to 
be avoided. 
 
Straight-line distance = 560 m
Shortest Path Distance = 1200 m
Pedestrian Route Directness (PRD) = 2.14
Straight-line distance = 560 m
Shortest Path Distance = 620 m
Pedestrian Route Directness (PRD) = 1.1

3.2.1.5.	
Travel-shed Analysis
The actual distance travelled for a trip is a primary factor in determining whether a person 
walks or drives. This measure directly reflects that factor. The level of network connectivity 
and amenity access within an area can be assessed by measuring the share of property 
entries within actual (shortest) walking distance of any destination (using GIS – Geographic 
Information System software). The closer the travel-shed comes to filling the circle, the 
better connected it is (Fig. 12). The availability of amenities such as primary schools, parks 
and transit stops within 400 m walking distance of homes is a desirable standard for a well-
planned, connected neighbourhood.

Road network and throughput correlation
Increasing network connectivity is the most efficient way to reduce walking and cycling trip 
distances as well as congestion on major arterials. Distributing traffic over a network of streets 
and junctions reduces maximum queue length at any junction, reduces signal cycles and delays, 
and therefore increases overall traffic throughput through the entire area (Fig. 13). Further, due 
to optimal/reduced road width requirements of a dense network, lower speeds can be maintained 
during off-peak hours, thus enhancing road safety. A dense road network can have the following 
impact on travel2 : 
	
Reduce vehicle kilometres travelled by 30%-40%. 
	
Reduce motorized trip lengths by about 10%-20%. 
	
Reduce walking distances by about 35%-45%.

3.3	
Existing Urban Road Network and Retrofitting
The present road network currently favours motor vehicles and has a negative impact on the 
quality of public life, as they occupy majority of the public spaces for movement and parking. 
As much as 70-80% percent of the road space is occupied by 20-30 percent of people using 
private motor vehicles. The retrofitting of existing roads shall accommodate space for all users 
- pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, public transport modes/buses, and motor vehicles and 
functions and activities. The following strategies may be adopted: 
	
Network of Complete Streets: Urban roads shall be redesigned as “Complete Streets” 
to rebalance the existing allocation of road space by providing safe, comfortable and 
convenient environment for pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users and to 
enable universal accessibility. Additionally, wherever possible capacity of the existing 
road network shall be augmented by pedestrian and non-motorized paths at <125 m 
c/c (through public open spaces and plazas, along natural drains, side setbacks of 
buildings) to reduce block sizes and walking distances. This is critical in case of small

and medium sized cities where non-motorized transport may constitute 40-50 percent 
of all trips3. 
In Gujarat, amendment to the State Town Planning Act has enabled cities like Ahmedabad 
(Fig. 14) to prepare second tier of Local Area Plans (LAP) and create denser street networks 
to increase traffic carrying capacity and reduce walking distances. The current average block 
perimeter in the central business district in Ahmedabad is 743 m. The proposed LAP creates an 
improved street network with average block perimeter of 416 m. The new streets were created 
by:

Function to Precede Planned Character: Due to inadequate development of a 
secondary street network in many Indian cities, particularly small and medium sized 
cities, and adjoining land-use conditions, often streets function differently from their 
planned character. For example, even arterial streets may have frequent property 
access in the city core or serve primary and secondary schools. Thus, it is essential 
to balance their throughput roles with consistent abutting land use while prioritizing 
safety of vulnerable road users.

	
Distribution of Motorized Traffic: Existing road network shall be re-designed and 
managed to distribute high traffic volume over multiple roads with smaller right of way, 
instead of stand-alone corridor/junction capacity improvement strategies. Area level 
traffic management plans - comprising of pedestrianization, parking management, 
augmenting public transport services and traffic rerouting - shall be prepared for 
dense city cores with narrow streets or areas with significant mixed traffic. Projects to 
improve the network connectivity such as railway over bridges and pedestrian/non-
motorized transport pathways shall be considered.
	
Parking Management: Area level parking management shall be taken up as part 
of network improvement for effective utilization of the capacity of roads. On street 
parking spaces shall be organised, designated, and demarcated after leaving clear 
and uniform carriageway space and footpaths as per norms for orderly and smooth 
movement of vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians respectively.
	
Increase Passenger Capacity by Improving Public Transit Capacity: Urban 
road capacity can be increased by focusing on an efficient and sustainable mode 
of increasing passenger carrying capacity. This shall be done by investing in and 
increasing public transport capacity (especially in small and medium sized cities) and 
where relevant, Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), Metro, Light Rail Transit (LRT), etc.
	
One-way Streets and Couplets: The goals for one-way streets should be carefully 
reviewed, and maybe created to accommodate rapid transit (such as BRT) corridors 
or pedestrian zones and in mixed-use districts with heavy footfall. One-way streets 
can also be created to improve capacity of motorized vehicles. However it may result 
in longer trip distances, higher vehicle speeds and may also make it difficult for new 
drivers to navigate who are not familiar with the locality. In such cases, signalized 
pedestrian and cyclist crossings and traffic sign ages shall be considered to enable 
safe crossing and inform drivers. One-way streets should not have in a carriageway 
of more than 3 lanes. 
	
Further, couplets with two-phase signalling can be created when a parallel street at 
a close distance of 150-200 m is available. Where one-way streets or couplets are 
provided, two-way movement for non-motorized transport modes must be ensured. 
However, violations such as contra flow movement may be expected. To address the 
same, strict enforcement measures may be necessary. Service lanes are often useful 
in reducing such violations. 
	
Redesign of Streets in Urban Core Areas: The streets in dense urban cores in India 
often have inconsistent and narrow streets with a predominance of walking, cycling, 
use of intermediate public transport and two-wheelers. The use of 4-wheeler personal 
motor vehicles is marginal. The mobility challenge in these cities is to provide a safe, 
comfortable and convenient experience. Therefore, these streets require special 
attention as per the following guidelines:
	
○	
An area-based traffic management approach should be adopted, consisting of 
a network of one-way streets, signalized intersections, non-motorized transport 
priority streets and restricted through movement of personal motorized four-
wheelers. Due to the dense network of streets, vehicular traffic can be dispersed 
without endangering pedestrians. 



======================================================================
PAGE 38 of 88
======================================================================
IRC:SP:118-2018
28
	
○	
Arterial roads should have preferably no more than two carriageway lanes per 
direction. Pedestrian facilities should be provided as per IRC:103 with pedestrian 
crossings at all intersections and along mid-blocks not exceeding 50 m. Parallel 
motorized vehicle parking can be designated after providing pedestrian facilities. 
On-street parking management should be introduced on major thoroughfares.
	
○	
On streets less than 12 m right of way, pedestrians and vehicles may share 
the carriageway. Motor vehicle speeds shall be reduced with traffic calming 
elements or a protected space for pedestrians may be considered as motorized 
two-wheelers create an uncomfortable environment for pedestrians. This can 
be created with bollards or with a dedicated footpath, where space is available. 
The spacing of bollards should not be less than 1000 mm at key access points 
to permit movement of wheelchairs. 
	
○	
Enforcement of the above measures shall be ensured. 
3.4	
Urban Road Network for Greenfield Development
The urban planning approach needs a paradigm shift to a grid street network with dense, mixed 
use development to reduce travel lengths and auto dependency in cities. The close grid network 
will help uniform distribution of motorized traffic over the network and avoid congestion at critical 
points on arterial roads and neighbourhood roads simultaneously. This will also increase mobility 
space for all non-motorized modes. Whereas long distance travel can be catered by high speed, 
high capacity transit and motorized traffic on arterial network, the short/medium distance travel 
can largely be catered by a combination of para-transit and non-motorized modes on the 
secondary street network system. (Fig. 15) About 25-30 per cent of land space should generally 
be reserved in the Master Plan/Development Plan for all categories of roads. 
Urban road networks in Greenfield development areas may adopt the following strategies: 
	
Master Plan/Development Plan: The Master Plan giving layout of the arterial and 
sub-arterial network, regional-city level pedestrian, non-motorized transport routes 
and greenways for the city. The comprehensive transport/mobility plan maybe 
developed within the overall vision of the Master Plan/Development Plan.
	
Zonal/Ward Level Plans: The collector and local street network maybe detailed out at 
the zonal and ward levels, ensuring that they are connected across neighbourhoods 
and to the city-wide network. The Town Planning Scheme is a land pooling and 
readjustment scheme, which has enabled creation of a secondary network of streets 
in states like Maharashtra and Gujarat. It is an alternative to land acquisition and 
minimises displacement of people. It can be considered as a tool for road network 
development in new areas.
	
Vehicular Grid of 250 m: A vehicular grid of 250 m x 250 m of collector roads should 
form an efficient network system for residential and non-residential areas.  A grid of 
1000 m x 1000 m comprising of arterial roads shall be superimposed on the network 
system to provide motorized public and private transport movement connecting all 
major commercial, office and terminal complexes. A closer grid of 125 m x 125 m of 
local and non-motorized transport street network would further enhance cycle and

29
pedestrian movement with some streets free from motor vehicles. The location of bus 
nodes should be provided only on collector streets and above with an influence zone 
of 500 m.
	
Integration across City, Zone and Neighborhood: The integration of city, zone 
and neighborhood levels is important for an efficient urban transport system. In the 
neighborhood level greater emphasis is given on pedestrian/non-motorized vehicle 
users as well as accessibility of public transport.

	
Arterial Roads: Arterial roads form the primary road network and carry passenger 
and goods traffic connecting all major city level land use activity areas. Arterial 
roads shall provide distinct and segregated movement space for motorized and 
non-motorized modes/pedestrians along with all functional supportive street 
elements.
	
Mass Rapid Transit: Arterial and sub-arterial roads may have future provisions 
for high capacity transit system (Metro/BRT etc.) with inter modal transfer facilities 
along with physical and operational integration of multi modal system.
	
Minimal Disruption to Existing Environment: Road networks/alignments need 
to be planned with minimum disruption to existing settlements/structures, fertile 
and environmentally sensitive areas (lakes, mangroves, flood zones). 
3.5 	
Principles of a Pedestrian Network
	
Complete Segregation on all Roads: Physical segregation of pedestrians from 
the vehicles on the road is an important aspect to ensure pedestrian safety in 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:118-2018
30
urban areas. Importance of segregation should not be limited to providing only 
footpaths all along the road but should also include safe crossings on streets at 
strategic locations with various traffic control measures like traffic signals, road 
signages and markings.
	
Retrofitting of Existing Network: The retrofitting of existing roads shall follow 
the mode priority outlined in Fig. 2 and be designed as complete streets for each 
road category.
	
Encroachment-free Footpaths with Universal Accessibility: Footpaths should 
be continuous and barrier free for safe and comfortable movement by elderly, 
children and persons with disabilities (PwDs) and other users including street 
vendors, who provide affordable goods and services for pedestrians and non-
motorized vehicles.
	
Shared Local Streets with Traffic Calming Measures: Local streets, where 
pedestrians share the road space with other vehicles, must be traffic calmed. 
In case footpaths are not provided, it should have traffic calming measures to 
control the speed of vehicles to less than 20 kmph.
	
Active Streets: Streets where building edges/frontages are oriented toward and 
directly accessible from the street on foot to promote pedestrian activity. Two 
major aspects to be considered to transform a city street into an active street. 
	
○	
Create “eyes on the street” – by removing setbacks and boundary walls 
and building to the edge of the street right of way. This would allow people 
from inside to look out on to the pavement, thus enhancing women and girls’ 
safety security and discouraging criminal activities, misbehaviour, shady 
corners, etc. 
	
○	
Create commercial/hawking zones at regular intervals to encourage 
walkability, increase street activity and enhance safety.
	
Pedestrianized Streets/Plazas/Squares: In addition to a closed grid network 
in residential and commercial centres with provision for adequate and barrier 
free footpaths and active streets, car free pedestrian streets and plazas shall be 
considered for retail streets, market streets, and feeder streets to mass transit 
stations or inner-city areas. 
3.6	
Principles of a Non-Motorized Vehicle Network
Non-motorized vehicles offer low-cost, pollution-free mobility. Cycles occupy only one-fifth 
as much driving and parking space as automobiles. Due to lack of physical separation from 
motorized vehicles, non-motorized vehicles face inconvenience and safety hazards from 
faster moving traffic. Where motor vehicle lanes are saturated, cycling in a segregated 
track is often faster and safer than using a private motor vehicle. Good cycle tracks are 
continuous and provide for uninterrupted movement (Fig. 16).

Segregated and Continuous Non-Motorized Vehicle Network: Apart from 
segregated two-way cycle/non-motorized vehicle track on all arterial and sub-arterial 
roads, a non-motorized vehicle network may be developed at zonal/neighbourhood 
level and connected to non-motorized vehicle corridors on arterial roads for a 
continuous city level non-motorized vehicle network.
	
Smooth Riding Surface: The non-motorized vehicle tracks shall have a smooth 
surface. Paver blocks are discouraged. Further, proper drainage of storm water shall 
be ensured to prevent water logging. 
	
Barrier Free Non-Motorized Vehicle Tracks: Non-motorized vehicle tracks shall be 
free of obstructions such as manhole covers and on-street parking encroachments.
	
Redesigning Junctions and Mid-Block Crossings: Existing intersections and mid-
block crossings shall be redesigned with signages and road markings to ensure safe 
crossing paths for non-motorized vehicles.
	
Traffic Calming Measures: Speed of traffic on all shared streets shall be reduced to 
less than 20 kmph through traffic calming elements. 
3.7	
Principles of a Public Transport Network
	
Integrated Road and Transit Network System: A road network system defines the 
public transport accessibility level such that people can access it within 500 m walking 
distance. The arterial corridors provide for high capacity multi modal transit system 
and physical integration through interchange facilities (Fig. 17). The bus stands/

IRC:SP:118-2018
32
terminals, bus stops with adequate space provisions with amenities for passengers 
are critical requirements and need to be incorporated in secondary road network 
plans. 
	
Enhanced Public Transport Accessibility: The enhanced use of public transport 
largely depends on universal accessibility, frequency of service, travel time, comfort 
and travel cost. Public transport service frequency and quality improvement should 
receive consideration of the state/city government for reduction of road congestion, 
optimum utilisation of road network, improvement of air quality and efficient energy 
use. 
	
○	
Bus stops should be located 40-45 m distance from the pedestrian crossing 
points of an intersection to facilitate access. 
	
○	
Stands for all intermediate public transport/last mile connectivity modes (auto-
rickshaws, cycle rickshaws, cycle sharing, e-rickshaws) should be located in the 
multi-functional zone within 12-15 m distance of the bus stops.
	
Optimum Utilisation of Road Space: Exclusive bus corridor on arterial roads and 
bus lane marking on secondary road system without any encroachment by other 
modes will ensure orderly and smooth movement of traffic on road carriageway. This 
will also ensure optimum utilisation of road space and also enhance the carrying 
capacity of traffic.

Multi-modal Integration
Multimodal transportation system is the integration of various modes of travel – bus rapid transit, 
city bus, metro, light rail transit, monorail, walking and cycling for better, advanced and efficient 
service (Fig. 18). Particularly, in the vicinity of 500 m of mass transit stations, multi-modal 
integration includes:
	
Minimizing travel time and cost for majority of commuters by providing multiple mode 
options for all sections of society with safety and affordability. Minimize the number 
and the time required for mode transfers for maximum commuters.

	
Feeder and Shared Mode Corridors: Shared intermediate public transit is functional 
in many cities and is the main form of public transit in small and medium sized cities. 
In large cities, they should be organised with necessary route mapping and stand 
locations to provide 500 m last mile connectivity. Rickshaw as a non-polluting, energy 
efficient intermediate public transport mode has tremendous potential to reduce 
private motor vehicle use for short intra and inter colony movements apart from 
providing access to metro/bus rapid transit stations in future. The collector and local 
road network should be the natural routes of operation to provide short distance low 
fare travel option. In small and medium sized cities, sheltered stops/stations should 
be provided for commuters, and where possible, their routes and frequencies should 
supplement a well-planned public transit service. 
	
Transit Interchange Hubs: The guidelines given below maybe adopted for integrated 
passenger and bus terminals.
	
○	
All such terminals should have preferably collector/sub arterial roads on two 
sides of the plot to facilitate entry and exit of buses and other modes.
	
○	
In case of approach from one side, two separate entry and exit to the road to be 
provided for vehicles. Separate entry and exit for pedestrians/passengers from 
the road should be provided for safety of passengers.
	
○	
All boarding and alighting of passengers should be within the terminal area only 
and no overspill on the road should be allowed.
	
○	
City bus stop should be within 100-200 meters from the terminal entry/exit with 
a clear pedestrian link with the terminal.
	
○	
No service road along the terminal to be provided to avoid misuse by illegal 
parking/stands etc.
	
○	
Proper organised space for parking/stand of intermediate public transport 
vehicles and vendors should be provided to facilitate transit passengers.
3.9	
 Principles for Intersections, Interchanges and Traffic Rotaries
One of the major challenges in creating dense, well-connected networks is the design and 
planning of frequent junctions along major arterial roads. The following strategies can be adopted 
at intersections to enable safe non-motorized transport crossing, while facilitating vehicular 
movement:  
	
Synchronization of signals (e.g. all pedestrian lights on one side of the road to be 
green when primary vehicular flow is red, etc.)
	
Pelican signals at pedestrian/non-motorized vehicle crossings with median islands for 
pedestrians waiting halfway through the crossing, with universal access.
	
Raised crossings for pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles. 
For design guidelines and standards of intersections and interchanges, refer IRC:SP:41 and 
IRC:92 respectively. For design guidelines for traffic rotaries, refer IRC:65.

Principles of Parking Management
The use of Personal Motor Vehicles (PMVs) shall be effectively managed by implementing a 
formal parking management system:
	
A parking management system shall be devised to promote sustainable modes of 
transport, price on-street parking to manage demand, improve the enforcement of 
no-parking zones and keep personal motor vehicles from obstructing non-motorized 
facilities.
	
Parking and no-parking zones shall be clearly demarcated. Footpaths, cycle tracks, 
and other non-motorized transport facilities will be designated as no-parking zones. 
Fig. 19 illustrates a proposed hierarchy of parking provision.
	
The Traffic Police shall ensure that footpaths, cycle tracks, and other non-motorized 
transport facilities remain free of encroachment by parked vehicles.
	
The revenue collected from the parking management program may be utilized to fund 
public transport and non-motorized transport improvements.

Principles of Street Vending Management
Street vending shall be managed in accordance with the provisions of the National Street Vendors 
(Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act 2014 and relevant state rules:
	
Street vending shall be regulated to ensure the continuity of footpaths and cycle 
tracks.
	
Existing culturally significant street vending markets shall be preserved.
	
Supportive infrastructure such as water taps, electricity points, waste bins, and public 
toilets shall be provided.

Chapter 4 
 Access Management
4.1	
Access Management Principles
The following principles may apply for access management on roads and streets in urban 
areas:
	
Where service roads are provided, arterial roads should not have a direct vehicular 
access to any plots or building from the road.
	
Larger plots with off-street parking facilities should be accessed from the side road. 
For smaller plots, parking should be unbundled and provided at strategic parking 
plots. 
	
All plots shall have pedestrian and cycle access directly from footpath and cycle track 
or service road along arterial roads. 
4.2	
Service Roads
Service roads improve safety and throughput by segregating property access points and 
parking from the main carriageway. They can increase the mobility function of the main 
carriageway while also maintaining liveability and smooth travel for non-motorized road users. 
With reduced speeds because of traffic calming, service roads can function as slow shared 
spaces.
Service roads should facilitate access to properties, discourage through movement and create a 
safe environment for pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles. However, it is difficult to maintain 
priority for pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles on service lanes that are wide enough for 
two-way car movements at high speeds.
4.2.1	
Design Principles and Standards
	
The need for a service road along an arterial road is determined by right of way and 
the frequency of property access points. If property access points would interrupt the 
footpath and cycle track at frequent intervals (more than once every 15 m), a service 
lane may be warranted.
	
The position of the footpath relative to a service road shall be determined by the 
character of the private property edge. If the street is lined by boundary walls or 
setbacks used for vehicle parking, the parking lane should be located at the edge of 
the right-of-way and the footpath on the carriageway side of the service road. Such a 
design is also appropriate if activities on adjacent properties spill over into the public 
right-of-way. 
	
In residential areas where there is a porous boundary between the street and private 
properties, the footpath can be placed on the property side. Likewise, in retail areas 
where there are no setbacks and buildings open directly onto the street, the footpath 
should be located at the edge of the right-of-way.

	
Loading and unloading of goods and on-street parking maybe accommodated within 
the multi-functional zone of the footpaths. Access into and out of a service road should 
be provided via a ramped crossing over the footpath and cycle track, which continue 
at original levels. Fig. 20 gives a broad idea of location of footpath relative to service 
lane.

b) Centre image
c) Right image
Fig. 20 Location of Footpaths Relative to Service Lane
Left image: When the road stretch is predominantly lined by high and opaque boundary walls 
(>1.2 m), the footpath should be located between the service lane and the cycle track/
carriageway.
Centre image: When the road stretch is predominantly lined by boundary walls less than 1.2 m 
height or allow visual connectivity, the footpath may be located on the outer edge so that it can 
promote liveability and interaction between public and private open spaces.
Right image: Adjacent to active commercial edges, the footpath may be located on the outer 
edge, where it can combine with private building plazas to create larger pedestrian spaces.

Chapter 5 
Street Design and Implementation Process
5.1	
Vision Statement
The goal of a street design process is to create complete streets to enable safe, comfortable 
and convenient access for all road users, address social concerns, promote environmental 
sustainability and reduce the impact on the natural environment, while creating vibrant and 
liveable public spaces. The design of urban streets promotes a collaborative and consultative 
process enabling professionals of different disciplines to work together to maximize the efficacy 
and long-term success of the same.
5.2	
Institutional Framework
Street Design Cell  
A Street Design Cell may be created within road departments of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), 
para-statal agencies and Public Works Department to develop comprehensive street design 
network plan for the city, review and monitor the street design and implementation process, 
arrange capacity building and training for technical and other personnel of the road department. 
This cell should also be involved in community engagement and advocacy. It shall include 
professionals to facilitate the above roles – urban and transportation planners/geographers, 
urban designers, landscape architects, traffic and civil engineers, GIS (Geographic Information 
System) specialists and external consultants advising on social and environmental safe guards, 
road safety, universal accessibility and women’s safety and security. The suggestive roles and 
responsibilities of the Street Design Cell are outlined in Annexure 1.
Co-ordination Committee
The successful implementation of street design projects will involve cooperation between multiple 
stakeholders, such as urban local bodies, traffic police, town planning agencies, consultants 
and others, at different stages. The urban local bodies may like to set up a Review Committee 
and convene regular meetings to oversee street design proposals produced by consultants, 
implementation and monitoring as well as to address inter-agency issues that may arise during 
this process. The Committee may include the following members:
	
Officials from the Municipal Corporation, such as,
	
○	
Head of the Street Design Cell,
	
○	
City Engineer,
	
○	
Zonal Engineers, 
	
Representative from public transport agencies,

	
Representative from non-government or community organisations
	
External experts 
Stakeholder Consultations
Stakeholder consultations may be organized in the form of charrettes, exhibitions and town halls 
during the conceptual design stage. Stakeholders can be characterized as primary, secondary 
and key. 
	
Primary stakeholders are beneficiaries and include commuters, residents, resident 
welfare associations (RWAs) etc.
	
Secondary stakeholders are people or groups who are indirectly affected. These may 
include those who offer services to the target groups, or whose jobs may be affected 
by the street design. These include auto-rickshaw or taxi drivers, street vendors, 
private bus operators, business owners and their groups.
	
Key stakeholders are those who can frame and enforce regulations or implement 
projects. These include local or state government agencies, elected representatives 
like Corporators, Members of Parliament or Legislative Assemblies, businesses, etc.
5.3	
Design Process for Existing Streets
The street design process for existing roads is shown in Fig. 21. The process for road networks 
in new cities or urban extension areas is outlined in Annexure 2.
5.3.1	
 Study Zone
The road or intersection identified for improvement shall be part of a larger study area within 
1 km radius of its right of way. If a local street is to be improved, the study area shall include a 
500 m radius from its right of way. The boundary of the study area shall be along plot boundaries, 
wherein 50 percent or more of property falls within this radius. 
 A base map of the study area will be prepared to include the road network, right of way, hierarchy, 
existing traffic management systems, existing and proposed public and mass transit facilities, 
intermediate public transport stands and plot and building details such as plot boundaries, 
building footprints, building heights and uses and major activity generators and attractors.

Proposed Concept Plan
5.4.1	
Choosing a standard street section
A standard street section must be selected in keeping with the provisions of the city’s Street 
Design Guidelines and RoW available. The design should be consistent with relevant plans, 
including plans for Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) networks, cycling networks, pedestrian networks, 
and pedestrian zones. This section must be then contextualized to different stretches.
5.4.2	
Line drawing
A line drawing must be developed based on selection of suitable right of way and subsequent 
traffic lanes must be offset to create kerb lines (See Fig. 25). However, it must be ensured 
that the clear width of footpaths does not fall below the minimum specified as per Pedestrian 
Facilities (IRC:103). Based on this, the position of major elements such as parking bays, trees, 
and bus stops can be determined along with the placement of street furniture.
Line drawings must be prepared for the road stretch and up to 50 m from the intersections along 
the road. Line drawings must clearly show the new kerb line in reference to the road median. The 
drawing must be complete with dimensions at 2 m intervals. Cross-sections may be prepared 
at every 50 m. Further, 3D models or visualisations of the proposed design may be prepared as 
these will be useful at stakeholder meetings and discussions see Figs. 26 and 27.

Community consultations
Consultations in the form of public exhibitions or presentations must be organized to explain the 
salient features of the project, its benefits and obtain community feedback, during this stage. The 
suggestions should be evaluated and the necessary modifications may be made to the proposal. 
5.4.4	
Coordination committee
The proposed designs should be presented to the Coordination Committee and designs reviewed 
based on feedback from them.
5.4.5	
Test on site with temporary installations and markings
Concept proposals should be marked on the road using chalk, traffic cones, and other temporary 
means and tested for functionality. In case any aspect of design is not compatible, the design 
should be modified as per site conditions. Detailed drawings should be prepared only after the 
Street Design Cell approves the concept plans.

implementation report. The tender documents shall be used for inviting bids from contractors.
5.6	
Implementation Plan
A brief description of each aspect of implementation such as
	
Implementation Phasing: This includes creating a phasing plan of implementing street 
design works keeping in view urgency of repairs, impact of the project and ensuring 
that traffic and pedestrian movement is least impacted.
	
Material Specifications: This includes describing detailed material specifications for 
various components of the street.
	
Quality Assurance: It includes creating a quality control guide for testing of relevant 
materials and workmanship on site as well as defining a standard code of practice for 
storage of material and for the construction process.
	
Work Zone Management Plan: This includes creating a plan to ensure safe storage of 
material, cleaning and maintenance of the site as well as smooth movement of traffic 
and safe movement of pedestrians during the implementation process as also safety 
of workers.
	
Supervision: This includes contract management and administration.
5.7	
Maintenance


be in-built into the contracts during implementation of road improvement/retrofitting 
projects. The defects liability period for the construction works may be aligned with 
the period of maintenance proposed.
	
The implementing agency must conduct regular audits to effectively monitor the work 
done and get the required repairs and maintenance done on a regular basis.
5.8	
Performance Monitoring
The city shall evaluate the impact of the project. As an example, following indicators could be 
adopted:
