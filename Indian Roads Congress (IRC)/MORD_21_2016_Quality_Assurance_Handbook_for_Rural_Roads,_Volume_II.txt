Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads
Preamble
For ensuring the requisite quality of construction, the materials and workmanship shall be subjected to 
quality control tests. These tests have been specified in respective Sections in Vol.I of this Handbook.
The frequency of tests required to be performed on different materials and the finished products shall be as 
specified in respective Sections in Volume I. The testing frequencies set forth are the desirable ones and the 
Engineer shall have the full authority to carry out additional tests as frequently as he may deem necessary, 
to satisfy himself that the materials and the workmanship comply with the appropriate specifications.
Setting up and maintaining an adequately equipped Field Laboratory as required for quality control of 
materials and workmanship shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. The Field Laboratory should 
have the needed equipment, trained man-power and essential documentation regarding sampling and 
test procedures.
Routine tests for Quality Control which are required to be conducted on a day to day basis shall be 
conducted by the Field Laboratory Staff. The Field Laboratory should preferably be located adjacent to 
the office of the Site Engineer and provided with amenities like water supply, electric supply, and proper 
access. The requirements of water supply and electricity supply will depend on the availability of these 
facilities in the vicinity of the project site. The Field Laboratory will have only those test equipment which 
are relevant to the project specifications.
The tests which are required to be done during the project preparation stage such as those pertaining to 
the suitability of construction materials, selection of quarries etc. or the tests which are required only once 
in a while for quality control shall be conducted in the District Laboratory. The District Laboratory will 
cover the testing requirements on a district level.
Tests requiring high level of skills and sophisticated equipment as also for the other quality checks 
will be carried out at the Central Laboratory under the control of the Chief Engineer, State Rural Road 
Development Agency. The Central Laboratory will, thus, act as the Control Testing Laboratory at the State 
level.
Any special or sophisticated tests for which the necessary equipment and expertise are not available in the 
Central Laboratory shall be outsourced.
119	
Equipment for Field Laboratory
The field laboratory should be equipped with essential equipment required for day to day tests for 
exercising quality control during construction. Further, only those test equipment which are relevant to 
the project specifications will be necessary. Where the Contractor is required to carry out the maintenance 
of road and structures, the field laboratory should have necessary equipment during maintenance period 
for exercising quality over maintenance activities.

Methods for Sampling of Materials for Laboratory Testing 
A true average or representative sample is such that its composition would be the same as that of any part 
of the quantity sampled if the whole were mixed to ensure homogeneity



======================================================================
PAGE 55 of 300
======================================================================
12
Section-100
122.1	
Purpose Of Sampling
The samples are taken from a lot representing a part or the whole of the material collected for inspection for 
the purpose of securing representative portions for visual and laboratory examination. The examination 
may be made to determine:
a)	
the average quality of the material in the lot,
b)	
the extent of variation in quality in the different portions of the material, and
c)	
conformity to the specified requirements.	
122.2	
Procedure for sampling of Agggragte (Conforming to IS:2430 1986) 
1.	
The aggregates shall be mixed and then scooped into a cone-shaped pile. Care shall be taken to 
drop each scoopful exactly over the same spot as otherwise the central axis of the, cone will be 
slackened and an uneven distribution of the particle sizes will result. 
2.	
After the cone is formed, it shall be flattened by pressing the top of the cone with the smooth 
surface of the scoop. 
3.	
Then it is cut into quarters by two lines which intersect at right angles at the centre of the cone. 
The bulk of the sample is reduced by rejecting any two diagonally opposite quarters. Accuracy in 
quartering is most easily attained, in the case of fine and all-in-aggregates, with damp material.
4.	
The reduction of the sample in the manner described above shall be continued till the desired 
quantity of the material i.e 1 kg to 12 kg required as per IS codel provisions is obtained for the 
laboratory sample.
122.3	
Procedure for sampling of Soil (Conforming to IS:2720 (P-1) 1983)
1.	
Soil sample as received from the field shall be dried in the air or in sun. In wet weather a drying 
apparatus may be used in which case the temperature of the sample should not exceed 60°C.
2.	
The clods may be broken with a wooden-mallet to hasten drying. 
3.	
3.The organic matter, like tree roots and pieces of bark should be removed from the sample.
Similarly, matter other than soil, like shells should also be separated from the main soil mass.
4.	
When samples are to be taken for estimation of organic content, lime content, etc, total sample 
should be taken for estimation without removing shells, roots, etc.
5.	
The minimum quantity of the sample taken for laboratory testing shall be vary from 50g to 15kg 
depending upon the type of soil and type of test to be conducted. 
122.4	
Procedure for sampling of Cement (Conforming to IS: 3535 1986)
1.	
The cement collected from cement bags shall be thoroughly mixed after breaking the lumps and 
removing the foreign materials. 
2.	
The material shall be scooped into a cone shaped pile. Care shall be taken to drop each scoopful 
exactly over the same spot as otherwise the central axis of the cone will be slackened.

Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads
3.	
After the cone is formed, it shall be flattened by pressing the top of the cone with the smooth 
surface of the scoop.
4.	
Then the cone is cut into quarters by two lines which intersect at right angles at the centre of the cone. 
5.	
The reduction is achieved by rejecting any two diagonally opposite quarters.
6.	
The reduction of the sample in the manner described above shall be continued till 11 kg of the 
material required for the laboratory testing is obtained.
122.5	
Procedure for sampling of Bricks (Conforming to IS: 5454 - 1978
1.	
The bricks shall be selected and inspected for each lot separately for ascertaining their conformity 
to the requirements of the relevant specification.
2.	
The number of bricks to be selected from a lot for visual characteristics in all cases and dimensional 
characteristics shall vary from 20 numbers to 50 numbers depend on the size of the lot and 
3.	
The number of bricks to be selected from a lot for physical characteristics like compressive 
strength, water absorption and efflorescence shall vary from 5 nos. to 15 nos. depend on the size 
of the lot as specified in relevant material specification.
122.6	
Procedure for sampling of Bitumen (Conforming to IS: 1201 -1978)
1.	
When the contents of the vessel are substantially homogeneous and the cross section of the 
vessel is uniform, an average sample is usually made up bycombining equal parts of samples 
drawn from levels at one-sixth, one-half and five-sixths of the depth of the liquid below the top 
surface.
2.	
A strong metal vessel of about half litre capacity shall be used for sampling, the handle of which 
shall be attached by a means not adversely affected by hot bitumen. Containers for the samples 
of liquid bituminous materials shall be small-mouth cans with cork-lined screw caps, except for 
emulsions. In which case they hall be wide-mouth glass jars or bottles. 
3.	
When possible, thoroughly mix the material to be sampled by circulating for several hours before 
samples are taken. Collect the sample from the sampler at the bottom of the tank in the bitumen 
sampler. When it is not possible to mix the contents of the tank, or when it is desired to ascertain 
if the contents of the tank are uniform.
4.	
The minimum quantity of the sample in the manner described above shall be vary from 1 ltr to 
5 ltr depending upon liquid or semi solid samples.
122.7 	 PRECAUTIONS DURING SAMPLING 
A sample shall not include material other than that to be sampled and shall not become altered, in the 
process of sampling. The following precautions shall be observed in sampling:
a)	
Samples shall be taken by, or under the immediate supervision of a person of judgement, skill 
and experience in sampling.



======================================================================
PAGE 57 of 300
======================================================================
14
Section-100
b)	
The sampling apparatus, and sample containers shall be dry and free from any substance which 
will contaminate the product.
c)	
The sample containers shall be closed immediately after the sample has been taken.
d)	
The operator engaged in sampling shall have clean hands free from any material (unless it be 
the material being sampled). Clean gloves may be worn. but only when essential to protect the 
operator from some health or other hazard.
e)	
Liquid materials in tanks and other bulk containers shall be sampled by the appropriate method. 
The sample shall be drawn through dip hatches. manholes . or other opening giving direct and 
unconfined access to the bulk of liquid. Samples shall not be drawn from dip-pipes or other 
fittings , nor shall gauge glasses or drain fittings be used for sampling purposes except where so 
specified.
f)	
Care shall be taken to see that nothing in the sampling procedure leads to contamination of the 
stock, for example, by dirt or other extraneous matter picked up by a wet bung, by fragments of 
stoppers or by other foreign matter and the sample containers are perfectly clean and dry before 
filling.
g)	
It is advisable to take more than one set of samples for check purposes in case of dispute, leakage 
or breakage in transit or for any other reasons.
h)	
Every possible precaution against fire hazard shall be taken when sampling flammable materials 
like cutback bitumens, etc.
i)	
Sample containers shall be labeled properly with all the relevant information.
j)	
Sample containers shall be sealed properly to prevent tampering. The type of packing used for 
samples which are to be transported depends largely on the means of conveyance and type of 
samples.

301.1.Grain Size Analysis
Purpose
Grain size analysis is carried out to determine the relative percentages of different sizes of particles in 
the sample. These sizes control the mechanical behaviour of coarse grained soil. Dry method of sieving is 
used for coarser fractions (retained on 4.75 mm sieve) and wet method is used for finer fractions (retained 
on 75micron sieve) and pipette method is used for fractions passing 75 micron sieve as standard method. 
The another subsidiary method for fractions passing 75 micron sieve is Hydrometer method. Both these 
methods are not applicable ,if less than 10 percent of the material passes the 75 micron IS sieve.

1.	
Prepare the sample as per sampling method as specified in Section 100 and drying it in air or oven 
and bring it to room temperature.
2.	
Clean all the sieves to be used (100 mm, 75 mm, 19 mm, and 4.75 mm). The sieves should conform 
to the requirements of IS 460 (Part I) – 1985.
3.	
Weigh the required quantity of material from the prepared sample in accordance with Note 1 
given below:
Note 1: Depending on the maximum size of material present in substantial quantities in the soil, the mass 
of soil sample taken for analyses may be as follows:

Place the sieves over a clean tray one over the other in the ascending order of size.
5.	
Shake the sieve with a varied motion, backwards and forwards, left to right, circular clockwise and 
anti clockwise, and with frequent jerking, so that the material is kept moving over the sieve surfaces.
6.	
Do not force the material through the sieve by hand, except for sizes coarser than 19 mm.
7.	
Break the lumps of fine particles, if any, with fingers against the side of the sieve.
8.	
Light brushing with a soft brush on the under side of sieves may be done to clear surface.

B. Wet Sieve Analysis
(for soil fraction passing 4.75 mm sieve and retained on 75 micron sieve)
1. 	
Take about 200g of the sample prepared by drying in oven at 105oCto 110oC and brought to room 
temperature.
2. 	
Soak the sample in water containing two grams of sodium hexametaphosphate or one gram of 
sodium hydroxide and one gram of sodium carbonate per litre of water and leave it for soaking 
overnight.
3. 	
Wash out the finer fraction passing through 75 micron sieve. Washing should be continued until the 
water paassing through 75 micron sieve is substantially clean.
4. 	
The extreme care shall be taken that the fraction retained on each sieve should be emptied carefully 
in seperate trays without any loss of material. 
5. 	
Then dry it in oven for 24 h at 105 oC to 110 oC and sieve the dry particles on 2 mm and 425 micron 
sized sieves and find the percentage of soil passing through each sieve and report the results in 
form EW-1
6. 	
Care shall be taken to see that the sieves are not overloaded. See Note 3.

301.2. Liquid Limit, Plastic Limit and Plasticity Index
Purpose
The Liquid and Plastic Limits (Atterberg Limits) of soil indicate the water contents at which certain 
changes in the physical behaviour of soil can be observed. From Atterberg limits, it is possible to estimate the 
engineering properties of fine-grained soils. Plasticity is the property that enables a material to undergo 
deformation without noticeable elastic recovery and without cracking or crumbling. Plasticity is a major 
characteristic of soils containing an appreciable proportion of clay particles.
Procedure
A. Liquid Limit (LL)
1. 	
Take 120 g of soil passing 425 micron IS sieve.
2. 	
Mix it with distilled water to form a uniform paste. The paste shall have a consistency that will 
require 30 to 35 drops of the cup to cause required closure of the standard groove. In case of clayey 
soils, paste may be left standing for 24 h to ensure uniform distribution of moisture throughout 
the soil mass.
3. 	
Remix the soil thoroughly and place a portion of the paste in the cup of the apparatus.
4. 	
Squeeze down and spread the sample with as few strokes of spatula as possible, at the same time 
trim it down to a depth of 1cm at the point of maximum thickness, Level the specimen to half the 
cup.
5. 	
Cut the paste with the standard grooving tool along the centre line In case where grooving tool 
type A does not give a clear groove as in sandy soil, use grooving tool type B or C.
6. 	
Start rotating the handle at 2 revolutions per second.

Section-300
7. 	
Count the number of blows till two parts of the sample come into contact at the bottom of the 
groove along a distance of 12 mm. This length shall be measured with the end of the grooving tool or 
a ruler.
8. 	
Record the number of blows and determine moisture content of the sample taken near the closed 
groove.
Liquid Limit Device
9.	
Repeat the test by changing the moisture content so that the number of blows to close the groove is 
not less than 15 or more than 35, such that the points on the flow curve are evenly distributed.
10.	
Plot a graph between log (number of blows) and moisture content and fit a straight line.
11.	
Read the moisture content corresponding to 25 number of blows from the graph. This gives the 
Liquid Limit of the soil.The Liquid Limit should be reported to the nearest whole number.

2.	
Mix it with distilled water to form a paste which is plastic enough to be easily moulded with fingers. In 
the case of clayey soils, leave the soil mass standing for 24 h to obtain a uniform distribution of moisture.
3.	
Take about 8 g of soil from the paste and make a ball.
4.	
Roll the ball on a glass plate with hand to make a thread of uniform diametre throughout its 
length. The rate of rolling shall be between 80 and 90 strokes per minute counting a stroke as one 
complete motion of the hand forward and back to the starting position again.
5.	
When the diametre of thread reaches 3 mm, remould the soil again to a ball.
6.	
Repeat the process of rolling and remoulding until the thread of soil just starts crumbling at a dia 
greater than 3 mm. This shall be considered a satisfactory end point, provided the soil has been 
rolled into a thread 3 mm in diametre immediately before. At no time, shall an attempt be made to 
produce failure at exactly 3 mm diametre by allowing the thread to reach 3 mm, then reducing the 
rate of rolling or pressure or both, and continuing the rolling without further deformation until the 
threads fall apart.
7.	
The pieces of the crumbled soil thread shall be collected in air tight container and the moisture 
content of the crumbled threads is determined.
8.	
Repeat the test two more times with fresh portion of the soil mix.
9.	
The average of the moisture content of the soil in the three trials calculated to the nearest whole 
number shall be the Plastic Limit of the soil.

Plasticity Index (PI)
Plasticity Index is determined by subtracting the value of plastic limit from the value of the liquid limit. PI

Proctor Density
(Light Compaction) Purpose
Compaction is measured in terms of dry density achieved. This is a function of water content, the 
compactive effort and the nature of soil. For the same compactive effort, this test determines the optimum 
moisture content and the maximum dry density of a given soil.

UNIVERSAL AUTOMATIC COMPACTOR
Procedure
1.	
Weigh the mould (W1) to the nearest 1g with base plate attached.
2.	
Take about 6 kg of air dried soil passing 19mm IS sieve for soils not susceptible to crushing 
during compaction, or about 15 kg of materials passing a 19 mm sieve for soils susceptible for 
crushing during compaction (see Note 1). Sieve this portion on a 19 mm sieve and reject the coarse 
fraction after recording its proportion of the total sample.
NOTE 1- The soil should be considered susceptible to crushing during compaction if the sample contains granular material 
of a soft nature, such as soft limestone, sandstone, etc. which is reduced in size by the action of the 2.6 kg rammer. The 
procedure given for soils susceptible to crushing during compaction can be applied to all soils, if it is convenient to do so.
Aggregations of particles shall be broken down so that, if the sample was sieved on a 4.75 mm IS sieve, 
only separated individual particles would be retained.
Two separate procedures for the test shall be used depending on whether the soil is susceptible to crushing 
during compaction or not.
Procedure for Soil not Susceptible to Crushing during Compaction: A 5 kg sample of air-dried soil 
passing the 19 mm IS test sieve shall be taken. The sample shall be mixed thoroughly with a suitable 
amount of water depending on the soil type (see Notes 2, 3 and 4).
The mould, with base plate attached, shall be weighed to the nearest 1g (m1). The mould shall be placed 
on a solid base, such as a concrete floor or plinth and the moist soil shall be compacted into the mould, 
with the extension attached, in three layers of approximately equal mass, each layer being given 25 blows 
from the 2.6 kg rammer dropped from a height of 310 mm above the soil. The blows shall be distributed 
uniformly over the surface of each layer. The operator shall ensure that the tube of the rammer is kept 
clear of soil so that the rammer always falls freely. The amount of soil used shall be sufficient to fill the 
mould, leaving not more than about 6 mm to be struck off when the extension is removed (see Note 5). The 
extension shall be removed and the compacted soil shall be levelled off carefully to the top of the mould by 
means of the straight edge. The mould and soil shall then be weighed to the nearest 1g (m2).
The compacted soil specimen shall be removed from the mould and placed on the mixing tray. The water 
content of representative sample of the specimen shall be determined as in IS: 2720 (Part 2)-1973.
The remainder of the soil specimen shall be broken up, rubbed through the 19 mm IS test sieve, and then 
mixed with the remainder of the original sample. Suitable increments of water (see Note 6) shall be added 
successively and mixed into the sample, and the above procedure from operations 5.1.2 to 5.1.4 shall be 
repeated for each increment of water added. The total number of determinations made shall be at least 
five, and the range of moisture contents should be such that the optimum moisture content, at which the 
maximum dry density occurs, is within that range.
Soil Susceptible to Crushing during Compaction (See Note 1)-
a)	
Five or more 2.5 kg samples of air-dried soil passing the 19 mm IS test sieve, shall be taken (see 
Note 2). The samples shall each be mixed thoroughly with different amounts of water to give a 
suitable range of moisture contents (see Notes 3 and 4). The range of moisture contents, at which 
the maximum dry density occurs, is within that range (see Note 6).



======================================================================
PAGE 69 of 300
======================================================================
26
Section-300
b)	
Each sample shall be treated as stated earlier.
c)	
Each compacted specimen shall be treated as stated earlier. d) The remainder of each soil specimen 
shall be discarded.
Compaction in Large Size Mould- For compacting soil containing coarse material up to 37.5 mm size, the 
2250 ml mould should be used. A sample weighing about 6 kg and passing the 40 37.5 mm IS sieve is used 
for the test. Soil is compacted in three layers, each layer being given 55 blows of the 2.6 kg rammer. The rest 
of the procedure is same as stated earlier.
NOTE 2- The removal of small amounts of stone (up to 5 percent) retained on a 19 mm IS Sieve will affect the density 
obtainable only by amounts comparable with the experimental error involved in measuring the maximum dry density. 
The exclusion of a large proportion of stone coarser than 19 mm may have a major effect on the density obtained compared 
with that obtainable with the soil as a whole, and on the optimum moisture content. There is at present no generally 
accepted method of test or of calculation for dealing with this difficulty in comparing laboratory compaction test results 
with densities obtained in the field. For soils containing larger proportions of gravel, the use of a bigger mould (2 250 ml) 
will avoid major errors. If proportion of gravel is more than 10%, modified MDD should be invariably found out or calculated 
so that FDD is correctly compared.
NOTE 3- The amount of water to be mixed with air-dried soil at the commencement of the test will vary with type of soil 
under test. In general, with sandy and gravely soils, a moisture content of 4 to 6 percent would be suitable, while with 
cohesive soils moisture content about 8 to 10 percent below the plastic limit of the soil would (plastic limit minus 10 to 
plastic limit minus 8) usually be suitable.
NOTE 4- It is important that the water is mixed thoroughly and adequately with the soil, since inadequate mixing gives rise 
to variable test results. This is particularly important with cohesive soils when adding a substantial quantity of water to 
the air-dried soil. With clays of high plasticity or where hand mixing is employed, it may be difficult to distribute the 
water uniformly through the air-dried soil by mixing alone, and it may be necessary to store the mixed sample in a sealed 
container for a minimum period of about 16 h continuing with the test.
NOTE 5- It is necessary to control the total volume of soil compacted; since it has been found that if the amount of soil 
struck off after removing the extension is too great, the test results will be inaccurate.
NOTE 6- The water added for each stage of the test should be such that a range of moisture contents is obtained which 
include the optimum moisture. In general, increments of 1 to 2 percent are suitable for sandy and gravelly soils and of 2 to 
4 percent for cohesive soils. To increase the accuracy of the test, it is often advisable to reduce the increments of water in 
the region of the optimum moisture content.
Calculations
Bulk Density gm in g/ml of each compacted specimen shall be calculated from the equation:
	
	
m2 – m1
 
gm = ---------------------
	
	
    Vm
where
m1 = mass in g of mould and base;
m2 = mass in g of mould, base and soil; and
Vm= volume in ml of mould.

The dry density, gd in g/ml, shall be calculated from the equation:
	
100 * gm
gd = ---------------------
	
100 + w
here
w = water content of soil in percent.
The dry density gd obtained in a series of determinations shall be plotted against the corresponding 
moisture contents w. A smooth curve shall be drawn through the resulting points and the position of the 
maximum on this curve shall be determined.
Reporting of results: The experimental points and the smooth curve drawn through them showing the 
relationship between moisture content and dry density shall be reported.
The dry density in g/ml corresponding to the maximum point on the moisture content/dry density curve 
shall be reported as the maximum dry density to the nearest 0.01.
The percentage moisture content corresponding to the maximum dry density on the moisture content/ 
dry density curve shall be reported as the optimum moisture content and quoted to the nearest 0.2 for 
values below 5 percent, to the nearest 0.5 for values below 5 to 10 percent; and to the nearest whole 
number for value exceeding 10 percent (see Note 7).
The amount of stone retained on the 19 mm IS Sieve shall be reported to the nearest 1 percent.
The method of obtaining the result shall be stated (2.6 kg rammer method). The procedure used shall also 
be stated, that is, single sample or separate sample and size of the mould used.
NOTE 7- For some highly permeable soils such as clean gravels, uniformly graded and coarse clean sands, 
the results of the laboratory compaction test (2.6 kg rammer method) may provide only a poor guide for 
specification on field compaction. The laboratory test often indicates higher values of optimum moisture 
content than would be desirable for field compaction and the maximum dry density is often much lower 
than the state of compaction that can readily be obtained in the field.

Factors affecting Compaction
Compaction is measured in terms of the dry density achieved. This is found to be a function of
1.	
the water content
2.	
the compactive effort applied to the soil, and
3.	
the nature of the soil.
These effects are briefly discussed below
The effect of water content on compaction :
The shearing resistance to relative movement of the soil particles is large at low water contents. As the 
water content increases, it becomes relatively easier to disturb the soil structure, and the dry density 
achieved with a given compactive effort increases. However if the dry density is plotted against the water 
content for a given compactive effort, it will be seen that the dry density reaches a peak, after which any 
further increase in water content results in a lower dry density.
From the dry density / water content curve, we can determine two quantities;
(a)	
the maximum dry density, and
(b)	
the optimum water content at which this maximum dry density is achieved
The effect of variations in compactive effort:
Both the maximum dry density and the optimum water content are found to depend on the compactive 
effort used. Increasing the compactive effort increases the maximum dry density, but reduces the 
optimum water content. The air void ratio at the peak density remains very much the same.
It may be seen that, at high water contents, there is little to be gained by increasing the compactive effort 
beyond a certain point.
The effect of soil type on compaction:
The highest dry densities are produced in well-graded coarse-grained soils, with smooth rounded 
particles. Uniform sands give a much flatter curve, and a lower maximum dry density. Clayey soils have 
much higher optimum water contents, and consequently lower maximum dry densities. The effect of 
increasing the compactive effort is also much greater in the case of clayey soils.
Figures 3 and 4 show typical results of compaction tests for different soils and different moisture contents.

Free Swell Index Test
Purpose
On saturation, certain soils expand in volume due to the presence of particular minerals. Soil with free 
swell index more than 50% is considered inadequate for use as fill material.
Procedure
1.	
Take two samples of oven dry soil passing through 425 micron IS sieve- 10g each.
2.	
Take two 100 ml graduated glass cylinders.
3.	
Pour the soil sample in each cylinder.
4.	
Fill distilled water in one cylinder and kerosene oil in the other cylinder up to 100 ml marks.
5.	
Remove the entrapped air by gentle shaking or stirring with a glass rod.
6.	
Leave the samples to settle and allow sufficient time (24 h or more) for the soil samples to attain 
equilibrium state of volume.
7.	
Read the final volume of soil in each cylinder.
8.	
Determine the differential free swell index Sd using the formula
Volume of soil in water - Volume of soil in kerosene
	
Sd= --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- x 100
Volume of soil in kerosene.
9.	
If the value of Sd is 50 per cent or more, the soil is expansive and not suitable for use as embankment 
fill material.

Deleterious Content (Organic Matter) Purpose
Deleterious contents of soil such as organic matter affect its characteristics and behaviour adversely and 
must therefore be within 2%.
Procedure
1.	
Take an air dried sample of soil and determine its moisture content. Using another sample, produce 



======================================================================
PAGE 74 of 300
======================================================================
31
Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads
about 100 g of soil passing the 10 mm I.S. sieve. Pulverise this sample to pass through 425 micron 
I.S.sieve.
2.	
In case the soil contains a high percentage of sulphides or chlorides it may be neutralised with 
dilute sulphuric acid or washed with distilled water to remove the salts.
3.	
Take 5g of soil from thoroughly mixed soil passing 425 micron sieve and place it in a glass weighing 
bottle. The weight of the sample should be less (upto 0.2g) for soils with higher content of organic 
matter.
4.	
Add 10 millilitres of potassium dichromate solution into the conical flask with a burette and add 
20 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid. Swirl the mixture for about one minute and keep it on a heat 
insulated surface for 30 min to allow oxidation.
5.	
Add 200 ml of distilled water along with 10 ml of orthophosphoric acid and 1 ml of sodium 
fluoride as the indicator. Shake the mixture vigorously. If the indicator gets absorbed, add another 1 
ml of the indicator.
6.	
Add ferrous sulphate solution from a second burette until the colour of the solution changes from 
blue to green. Add a further 0.5 ml of potassium dichromate to change the colour from green to 
blue.
7.	
Add ferrous sulphate solution drop by drop with continuous swirling until the colour of the 
solution changes blue to green with a single drop. Note the total volume of ferrous sulphate 
solution used in the experiment.
Calculations
The total volume of potassium dichromate used to oxidise the organic matter in the soil is given by the 
following formula
V = 10.5 (1.0-Y/X)
Where
Y = total volume of ferrous sulphate used in the test
X = total volume of ferrous sulphate used in the standardization test

301.6 Deleterious Content (Soluble Sulphate)
Purpose
Sodium sulphate is present in some Indian soils. The salt is easily hydrated and dehydrated under the 
influence of climatic changes. There are enormous volume changes during this process of hydration and 
dehydration, which influence the engineering properties of soils.
Procedure
1.	
Take the soil sample in a state in which it can be crumbled. If necessary, dry it in oven at 105oC to 
110oC. Break the lumps in a mortar with a rubber covered pebble. Mix the sample thoroughly and 
sub-divide it by quartering.
2.	
Take 10 g of soil from the sample in a 250 ml bottle with 100ml of distilled water. Shake it 
occasionally for about 2 h with a mechanical shaker. Allow the soil to stand overnight. In case the 
soil is dispersive, add 0.5 to 1.0 g of pure potassium nitrate to flocculate the particles.
3.	
Filter and take 25 ml of filtrate in a beaker. See if the solution is alkaline from phenolphthalein 
indicator. If so, add concentrated hydrochloric acid to just neutralize the solution. Add further 4 
ml of hydrochloric acid to make the solution acidic.
4.	
Boil the solution. Remove the solution from heat and add hot barium chloride solution in a fine 
stream with constant stirring, till there is no precipitation with further addition.
5.	
Place the beaker on a steam bath for a minimum period of 4 h and allow precipitate to settle. 
Further the precipitate through ashless filter paper wash free from chloride irons, dry and ignite 
filtration can be done through a pre-weighed sintered glass crucible or a Gooch crucible. In case of 
filter paper after drying, ashing shall be done. On a low flame and the precipitate then ignited over 
a burner or in a muffle furnace at 600oC to 700oC for half an hour.
6.	
Cool in a dessicator, weigh and note the residue. This is the weight of the barium sulphate.
7.	
Calculate the corresponding weight of sodium sulphate and determine its percentage as follows:
	
a)	
Sulphate (SO4) percent by mass = 41.15 W1 /W2
	
b)	
Sodium Sulphate (Na2 SO4)percent by mass = 60.85 W1/W2

Note: Rapid Moisture Metres are also available in market. These are based on the principle that water 
will react with calcium carbide to form acetylene gas. Quantity of gas formed is directly proportional to 
the water present. The quantity of gas can be read from a pressure gauge which is calibrated in percentage of 
moisture on wet weight basis. This can then be converted to moisture content based on dry weight.

c. Rapid Determination of Water Content with Infra – Red Lamp Torsion Moisture Meter
Procedure
1.	
Set the 100 percent scale division of the calibrated drum to align with the index mark with the help 
of drum drive knob.
2.	
With the pan placed on the pivot check that the pointer is aligned with the index line and the 100 
percent scale division. If not, set the pointer with the help of initial setting knob.
3.	
Rotate the drum drive knob anti-clockwise and bring the 0 percent scale division in line with the 
index mark, thus prestressing the wire through an amount equal to 100 percent scale division (this 
represents the amount of unbalance). The pointer will now be above the index mark.
4.	
Raise the lamp housing and carefully distribute the test material evenly on the sample pan until 
the pointer returns to the index mark (approximately 25 g of the material will be needed in one 
operation).
5.	
Lower the lamp housing and switch on the infra – red lamp with the help of the switch provided 
on the left hand side. Insert the thermometer in its socket and bracket. Adjust the control knob 
between 95 and 100 on the scale if it is desired that the temperature of drying is around 110°C. The 
sample will now begin to lose water and pointer will rise above the index.
6.	
Calculate the water content (w) on the dry weight basis from the water content (m) as obtained on 
the moisture balance scale, as follows:

Figure 5 Set up for Rapid Determination of Moisture Content
Procedure
1.	
The apparatus required for the test includes one metallic pressure vessel with clamp for sealing 
cup and a gauge calibrated in percentage water. One counterpoint balance, a scoop for measuring 
calcium carbide and three steel balls of 12.5 mm diameter and one steel ball of 25 mm diameter.
2.	
Set up the balance and place the sample in the pan till the mark on the balance arm mass lines up 
with the index mark.
3.	
Unclamp the clamping screw to move the U-clamp off the cup. Lift off the cup. Clean the cup and 
the body.
4.	
Hold the body horizontally and gently deposit one level scoopful of calcium carbide halfway 
inside the chamber. Then lay the chamber down without disturbing the absorbent charge and 
transfer the soil weighed out as above from the pan to the cup.
5.	
Holding cup and chamber approximately horizontal bring them together, without disturbing 
sample or absorbent, bring the U clamp round and clamp the cup tightly into place.
6.	
With the gauge downwards( except when the steel balls are used) shake the moisture meter up 
and down vigorously for 5 seconds, then quickly turn it so that the gauge is upwards, give a tap 
to the body of the moisture meter to ensure that all the contents fall into the cup.
7.	
Hold the rapid moisture meter downwards, again shake for 5 seconds, then turn it with gauge 
upwards and tap. Hold for one minute. Repeat this for a third time. Once more invert the rapid 
moisture meter and shake up and down to cool the gas. Turn the rapid moisture meter with the 
gauge upwards, and dial horizontal held at chest height when the needle comes to rest, take the 
reading. The readings on the meter are the percentages of water on the wet mass basis.
8.	
Alternatively, the three smaller steel balls can be placed in the cup along with the soil and the 
larger one in the body along with the absorbent and seal up the unit as usual. Hold the rapid

Section-300
moisture meter vertical so that the material in the cup falls into the body. Now holding the unit 
horizontally, rotate it for 10 seconds so that the balls are rolled round the inside circumference of 
the body. Rest for 20 seconds. Repeat the rotation – rest cycle until the gauge reading is constant 
(usually this takes 4 to 8 min). Note the reading as usual.
9.	
Finally release the pressure slowly (away from the operator) by opening the clamp screw and 
taking the cup out, empty the contents and clean the instrument with a brush.
10.	
Calculate the water content (w) on the dry mass from the water content (m) obtained on the wet 
mass basis as the reading on the rapid moisture meter, as follows:
	
	
	
     m
	
	
w = ------------------ x 100 percent
	
	
	
(100-m)
	
where,
	
w = percent water content of the dry mass 
	
m = percent water content of the wet mass
Note: The absorbent is highly susceptible to absorption of moisture and so shall not be exposed to atmosphere, as a result 
the absorbent suffers deterioration and will give results on the lower side. Replace the lid of the absorbent container firmly.
The absorbent suffers deterioration with time.

301.8	 Measurement of In-situ Density / Degree of Compaction a. Sand Replacement method
Purpose
Field density of soil affects its permeability and compressibility. Also the compaction of soil is measured in 
terms of dry density achieved.
Procedure
1.	
The pouring cylinder shall be filled so that the level of the sand in the cylinder is within about 10 
mm of the top. Its total initial weight (W ) shall be found and shall be maintained constant 
throughout the tests for which the calibration is used. Volume of sand equivalent to that of the 
excavated hole in the soil (or equal to that of the calibration container) shall be allowed to run out 
of the cylinder. The shutter on the pouring cylinder shall then be closed and the cylinder placed on 
a plane surface such as the glass plate. (Sand should be clean natural sand passing 1.0 mm IS sieve 
and retained on 600 micron).
2.	
The shutter on the pouring cylinder shall be opened and sand allowed to run out. When no further 
movement of sand takes place in the cylinder, the shutter shall be closed and the cylinder moved 
carefully.
3.	
The sand that has filled the cone of the pouring cylinder (that is the sand that is left on the plane 
surface) shall be collected and weighed to the nearest gram repeated at least three times and the 
mean weight (W2) taken.
4.	
The internal volume (V) in cc of the calibrating container may be calculated from its internal 
dimensions.
5.	
The pouring cylinder shall be placed concentrically on the top of the calibrating container after 
being filled to the constant weight (W1). The shutters on the pouring cylinder shall be closed 



======================================================================
PAGE 82 of 300
======================================================================
39
Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads
during this operation. The shutters shall, be opened and sand allowed to run out. When no further 
movement of sand takes place, the shutter shall be closed. The pouring cylinder shall be removed 
and weighed to the nearest gram.
6.	
These measurements shall be repeated at least three times and the mean weight (W
3) taken.
7.	
A flat area, approximately 45 cm square, of the soil to be tested shall be exposed and trimmed 
down to a level surface, preferably with the aid of the scraper tool.
8.	
A round hole approximately 10 cm dia and the depth of the layer to be tested upto a maximum of 
15 cm depth shall be excavated in the soil. No loose material shall be left in the hole. The metal 
tray with a central hole shall be laid on the prepared surface of the soil with the hole over the 
portion of the soil to be tested - the hole in the soil shall then be excavated using the hole in the 
tray as a patter. This tray shall be removed before the pouring cylinder is placed in a position over 
the excavated hole. The excavated soil shall be carefully collected and weighed to the nearest 
gram(Ww).
9.	
The moisture content (W) of the excavated soil shall be determined by taking representative sample of 
soil. Alternatively, the whole of the excavated soil may be dried and weighted (Wd).
10.	
The pouring cylinder filled to the constant weight (WI) shall be placed so that the base of the 
cylinder covers the hole concentrically, the shutters on the pouring cylinder shall be closed during 
this operation. The shutter shall then be opened and sand allowed to run out into the hole.
11.	
The pouring cylinder and surrounding area shall not be vibrated during this period. When no 
further movement of sand takes place, the shutter shall be closed. The cylinder shall be removed 
and weighed to the nearest gram (W4) (See Note).
Note: It is necessary to make a number of repeated determinations say 4 to 5 and to average the results, since 
the dry density of the soil varies appreciably from point to point.
12.	
The weight of sand (Wa) in g required to fill the calibrating container shall be calculated from the 
following formula.
	
Wa = WI – W2 - W3
	
Where
	
W1 - Weight of pouring cylinder and sand before pouring into calibrating Cylinder in g.
	
W2 - Mean weight of sand in cone in g.
	
W3 - Mean weight of cylinder with residual sand after pouring into calibrating cylinder
and cone in g
13. 	 The bulk density of the sand Ys in (g/cc) shall be calculated from the formula:
	
Ys = Wa /V
	
Where
	
V = Volume of calibrating cylinder in cc
14.	
The weight of sand (Wb) in g required to fill the excavated hole shall be calculated from the following 
formula.
	
Wb = W1 - W4 -W2

c. Measurement of Density of Soil in place by Nuclear Density Gauge
Purpose
This is a quick method of determining the in-situ density of soil using gamma ray scattering and neutron 
thermalization. 



======================================================================
PAGE 86 of 300
======================================================================
43
Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads
Procedure
For this test a special equipment which measures in place density using gamma radiation is used. Gauge 
usually contains a small gamma source (about 10mCi) such as Cesium – 137 on the end of a retractable 
rod. The measurement of density is based on extent of Compton Scattering and Photoelectric absorption 
of Gamma radiations through the material and the measurement of moisture content is based on the 
thermalization of fast neutron radiation when passing through the material being tested.
Gamma rays are emitted from the source which interact with electrons in the surrounding material. 
Density of material is then correlated to the number of gamma rays received by the detector. 
Standardization of the Gauge 
A.	
Prior to use of the gauge, a set of standard counts must be taken and used for all of the measurements 
to be made on a particular day. 
B.	
In order to take a standard count, bring the gauge handle to “SAFE” position. Place the Reference 
Standard/ Standard block on compacted material, at least 10 feet away from any obstructions or trenches.
C.	
Place the gauge on the Reference Standard with the handle end of the reference Standard away from 
the operator. The gauge must be seated inside the guide rails along the edges of the Standard block, 
and the back of the gauge up against the handle of the reference standard.
D.	
The bottom surface of the gauge must be clear of any debris that would prevent the gauge from seating 
firmly on the Reference Standard. Press the Standard button and complete the standard test. 
The following procedure is used for measuring the density of soil.
1.	
Using the options in the menu, enter the basic soil parameters such as max. dry density and 
optimummoisture content.
2.	
Make the surface even by using a guide plate or any other suitable equipment.
3.	
Make a hole by pounding a steel rod with a similar diameter to that of gauges retractable rod. The 
hole should be at least 50mm deeper than the intended depth of measurement. The Drill Rod is 
marked in 50mm (2-inch) increments to aid in judging the depth
4.	
Nuclear Density Gauges normally operate in two modes.   i) Direct Transmission   ii) Back 
Scatter For measuring the density of soil, set the equipment to ‘Direct Transmission Mode’.
5.	
Place the gauge over the prepared site carefully. Press the trigger into the handle release the 
LATCH and push the handle down until the approximate correct measuring position is obtained.
6	
Lower the source rod into the hole. Set the handle to the depth position required. At the correct 
depth, release the trigger and lift the handle just above the notch then push the handle one more 
time until hearing the sound “CLICK” as the INDEXER accurately position the gauge.
7.	
Re-verify the depth from the display. Slightly push the gauge towards yourself so that the source 
rod is in contact with the material.
8.	
The measurement can be taken by simply pressing the MEAS key. Most measurements will be 
made, by using the “NORM” in measure mode, which takes a one-minute test.
9.	
Read the detector count on the panel. Use the calibration chart provided by the manufacturer to 
obtain density of material.



======================================================================
PAGE 87 of 300
======================================================================
44
Section-300
10.	
It may be noted that the detector count is inversely proportional to the density of the surrounding 
material.
11.	
The Nuclear Density Gauges are calibrated at the factory. Since the source material undergoes 
decay, it needs to be calibrated from time to time in accordance with the procedure given by the 
manufacturer.
Nuclear Density Gauge
d. Measurement of Density of Soil in place by Non- Nuclear Density Gauge(Electrical Density gauge)
Purpose
This is a quick method of determining the in-situ density of soil by direct transmission of 3.0 MHz radio 
frequency voltage through a set of steel darts of driven into the soil
Procedure
Non-nuclear, portable, microprocessor based gauge for determining of moisture and density of compacted 
soils using Complex Impedence technique without the need to know the 	 Particle Size Distribution of the 
material being tested. It measure the electrical dielectric properties and moisture levels of compacted soils 
using high radio frequency travelling between darts driven into the soils being tested. The darts depth of 
penetration determines the depth of measurement.
Field Calibration/ Soil Model 
Before EDG is used for density/ moisture testing, a Soil Model Calibration is required to be carried out. 
Soil Model should preferably have between 6 and 12 points, 2 or 3 different densities within expected in-
situ range, 2 different moisture contents within expected in-situ range.
Soil Models can be completed on trial areas on site or in laboratory using any traditional method (Sand 
replacement/core cuter/NDG etc).
Repeat the testing process for the required number of points to complete the Soil Model. Once the soil 
model is complete, EDG calculates a FIT for it. FIT refers to the overall accuracy of the developed Curve.
1.	
Take the four conical Darts and place them on the template and pound them, one by one, into the 
ground with the Hammer up to shoulder of the darts.



======================================================================
PAGE 88 of 300
======================================================================
45
Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads
2.	
Attach the Soil Sensor to the Dart Template using the velcro system provided. Connect the 
temperature sensor to the soil sensor and bury it close to the test location in a small hole made 
using a T handle provided.
3.	
Now connect each of the connecting cables to the soil sensor and connect the other end of each 
cable to a single opposing positioned dart A-A. and between the two sets of the tapered darts, four 
point to point electrical measurements are made.
4.	
Press the Test button at the bottom right of the screen to begin a test.
5.	
Now connect the cables to the other two opposing Darts positioned as B-B. Ensure that cables do 
not cross each other during any of the tests.
6.	
The dielectric properties that are measured by the unit are compared to a “soil model, which has 
been developed and programmed into the unit prior to testing. These soil models are required once 
for each soil type. The soil model is used as calibration reference during the testing procedure.
7.	
This soil model is used by the unit through a proprietary corrections algorithm to automatically 
determine the density and moisture content for the material being tested.
8.	
In addition, the temperature probe, which is inserted into the material being tested ensures 
accurate results by compensating for changes in the recorded temperatures.
9.	
This completes the test and compaction test results are displayed directly on the EDG screen. 
Advantage over Nuclear Density gauge
The nuclear method entails cumbersome health, safety, and training requirements, including certification 
of operators, personnel exposure monitoring, nuclear source licensing, and special procedures for storage 
and transport of shielded field instrumentation. Because of their relative unreliability, health risks to the 
operator, and the costs of complying with the special requirements of using nuclear density gauges, Non 
Nuclear Density gauge is far more cost-effective for in-situ density measurenment of soil.

Purpose
Checking of levels of subgrades and different pavement courses is required to ensure that design thickness of 
various layers are actually transferred on to the ground.
Procedure
The levels of the subgrade and different pavement courses as constructed, shall not vary from those 
calculated with reference to the longitudinal and cross-profile of the road shown on the drawings or as 
directed by the Engineer beyond the tolerances mentioned in Table 301.10.1.

Provided, however, that the negative tolerance for wearing course shall not be permitted in conjunction 
with the positive tolerance for base course, if the thickness of the former is thereby reduced by more than 
6 mm for flexible pavements and 5 mm for concrete pavements.
For checking compliance with the above requirement for subgrade, sub-base and base courses, 
measurements of the surfaces levels shall be taken on a grid of points placed at 10 m longitudinally and 2.5 
m transversely. For any 10 consecutive measurements taken longitudinally or transversely, not more
than one measurement shall be permitted to exceed the tolerance as above, this one measurement being not 
in excess of 5 mm above the permitted tolerance.
For checking the compliance with the above requirement for bituminous wearing courses and concrete 
pavements, measurements of the surface levels shall be taken on a grid of points spaced at 6.25 m along 
the length and at 0.5 m from the edges and at the centre of the pavement. In any length of pavement, 
compliance shall be deemed to be met for the final road surface, only if the tolerance given above is 
satisfied for any point on the surface.

Surface Regularity
	
(Using a 3 m Straight Edge)
Purpose
Regularity of surface is essential for a smooth riding on the road surface.
Procedure
1.	
The 3 metre straight edge may be made of steel or seasoned hard wood. When made of wood, it 
may be 75 mm wide and 125 mm deep and its test face should preferably be shod with a metallic 
plate. The edge should be perfectly straight and free from warps, rots or defects of any kind.
2.	
Periodically, the straight edge should be checked for its trueness with a string or a metallic master 
straight edge. The straight edge should be rectified or replaced as soon as the same has lost its 
trueness.
3.	
The depressions under the straight edge are to be measured with a graduated wedge. The wedge 
should be metallic. The depressions should be graduated to read undulations up to 25 mm with a 
least count of at least 3 mm.
4.	
For recording depressions in the longitudinal profile of the road surface, the straight edge is placed 
longitudinally, parallel to the centre line of the road. Measurements along two parallel lines are 
sufficient for a single lane road.
5.	
The straight edge may be placed at the starting point with the wedge inserted between it and the 
test surface, where the gap is maximum. Take the reading.
6.	
The straight edge may then be slid forward by about 1.5 m distance and the wedge reading repeated. 
This process may be continued. .
7.	
Mark the locations with depressions in excess of the specified magnitude.
8.	
Count the number of undulations exceeding the specified magnitude.

Section-300
Note:	 (i) A team of three persons consisting of two workmen and a supervisor would be required for 
one straight edge and two graduated wedges. The two workmen will operate the straight 
edge, while the supervisor will record measurements with the wedges and do the markings 
on the road.
	
(ii) At vertical curves, additional templates will be required.

CBR of Remoulded and Soaked Soil Samples
(Static Method and Dynamic Method)
Purpose
CBR value of a soil is an index which is related to its strength, modulus of subgrade reaction, modulus of 
resilience and plasticity index. The index is highly dependent on the condition of material at the time of testing.



======================================================================
PAGE 93 of 300
======================================================================
50
Section-300
The test will be performed on remoulded specimens which may be compacted either statically or 
dynamically.
LABORATORY CBR TEST APPARATUS
Preparation of Specimens
Remoulded Specimens: The dry density for remoulding should be either the field density or if the subgrade 
is to be compacted, at the maximum dry density value obtained from the Proctor Compaction test. If it is 
proposed to carry out the CBR test on an unsoaked specimen, the moisture content for remoulding 
should be the same as the equilibrium moisture content which the soil is likely to reach subsequent to the 
construction of the road. If it is proposed to carry out the CBR test on a soaked specimen, the moisture 
content for remoulding should be at the optimum and soaked under water for 96 hours.
Soil Sample – The material used in the remoulded specimen should all pass through a 19 mm IS sieve. 
Allowance for larger material may be made by replacing it by an equal amount of material which passes a 
19 mm sieve but is retained on a 4.75 mm IS sieve. This procedure is not satisfactory if the size of the soil 
particles is predominantly greater than 19 mm. The specimen may be compacted statically or dynamically.
Procedure
I. Compaction by Static Method
1.1	
Find the weight of oiled empty CBR mould with base plate and filter paper placed in.
1.2	
Calculate the weight of soil required at OMC by using the formula: 
	
	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
        OMC
Percentage Compaction Required x MDD (g/cc) x (1 + ----------------) x volume of mould 
	
	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
          100
1.3	
Take about 6 kg of dry soil and mix it thoroughly after adding the quantity of water required to 
bring it to OMC at which it can be compacted by pressing it to attain its maximum dry density.
1.4	
Take the required quantity of this soil as calculated in step 1.2.
1.5	
Place this soil in the mould and obtain compaction by pressing in the displacer disc, placing a filter 
paper between the disc and the soil.

Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads
2. Compaction by Dynamic Method
2.1	
Take 6 kg of oven dried soil.
2.2	
Add water (optimum water content required to attain max. dry density) to it and mix it thoroughly.
2.3	
Take the empty weight of oiled CBR mould.
2.4	
Fit the extension collar to the mould.
2.5	
Place a spacer disc in it and then place one filter paper over it.
2.6	
Fill the soil mixture in the mould in 3 layers by giving 55 blows of 2.6 kg rammer with a drop of 
310 mm to each layer.
2.7	
Remove the collar and trim off by a straight edge.
2.8	
Then remove the mould from base plate, take the spacer disc out.
2.9	
Invert the mould and fix it in position on the base plate after placing a filter paper. The dynamically 
compacted specimen is now ready for testing.
3. Finding degree of compaction
3.1	
After compaction, weigh the mould with specimen.
3.2 	 Find the weight of the specimen.
3.3	
Take a portion of the remaining sample left in the tray and find the moisture content. 
(As in Test EW-7)
3.4	
Find the dry density and compare it with the maximum dry density and find the degree of 
compaction (%) by comparing this with the maximum dry density.
4. Determining Swelling Index
4.1	
After weighing the moulds, place weights to produce a surcharge equal to the weight of the base 
material and pavement to the nearest 2.5 kg shall be placed on the compacted soil specimen. Place 
this assembly in the mould.
4.2	
Place the tripod having the micrometer in place and adjust the stem to touch the micrometer 
indicator and find the initial reading on the micrometer.
4.3	
Then place the mould in water tank and soak it for 96 h.
4.4	
After 96 h, find the micrometer reading.
4.5	
Find the difference in readings.
4.6	
Find the swelling index by dividing the swelling by the height of the specimen before soaking.
Express this in percentage. (Form EW-11)

5. Determining CBR in Unsoaked Condition
The mould containing the specimen in unsoaked condition with the base plate in position but the top 
face exposed shall be placed on the lower platen of the testing machine. Surcharge weights, sufficient to 
produce an intensity of loading equal to the weight of the base material and the pavement shall be placed 
on the testing machine.
Rest of the procedure will be same as described below for the test in soaked condition
CBR in Soaked Condition
5.1	
After 96 h of soaking and after measuring the swelling, find the weight of the mould with soaked 
specimen (to be used for finding degree of compaction after soaking).
5.2	
Drain the excess water by keeping the specimen vertically or by tilting for 10- 15 min (for sandy 
specimen no tilting is to be done).
5.3	
Remove the filter paper on the specimen and keep it in the CBR testing machine to show penetration 
when the specimen is loaded.
5.4	
Place the same surcharge weight as used while soaking.
5.5	
Adjust the penetration measuring micrometer and the platform on which the CBR mould containing 
the specimen rests, to show penetration when the specimen is loaded.The plunger shall be seated 
under the load of 4 kg.
5.6	
Start loading the specimen, after adjusting the penetration dial and the proving ring to zero mark. 
The load shall be applied at the rate of 1.25mm/min.
5.7	
Note the deflections in the dial gauge of the proving ring for corresponding penetrations as per 
the requirement. (deflections are noted for penetrations of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 4.0, 5.0, 7.5,10.0 and 
12.5 mm of the plunger).
5.8	
Plot the deflections against the penetration (in mm) in a semi-log graph. (Alternatively, deflections 
can be converted into loads and plot penetration versus load).
5.9	
Find the correction required to be applied for the deflections (when an S-type curve is formed, the 
lower bend can be avoided by drawing a straight line), see Figure 1.
5.10	 Correct the deflection by shifting the points actually plotted, (if a correction of 0.5 mm is observed, 
instead of taking deflection for penetration of 2.5 mm, deflection for 3 mm shall be taken).



======================================================================
PAGE 96 of 300
======================================================================
53
Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads
5.11	 Take the deflection for 2.5 mm and, 5 mm (for corrected curves, corrected deflection shall be taken).
5.12	 Convert these deflections into loads by applying the calibration factors.
5.13	 Find the CBR values for these penetrations by using the formula.
        PT x 100
CBR = -------------------
       Ps
Where PT =Corrected unit test load corresponding to the chosen penetration from the curve.
 Ps=Unit Standard load for the same depth of penetration from the table given below.

Unit Standard Load
Total Standard Load
2.5 mm
70 kg/sq cm
1370 kg
5 mm
105 kg/sq cm
2055 kg
5.14	 The higher of the two values is reported as CBR (Form EW-12).
Generally the CBR value at 2.5 mm penetration will be higher than that at 5 mm penetration and in such 
case, the former shall be taken as the CBR value for design purpose. If the CBR value corresponding to a 
penetration of 5 mm exceeds that for 2.5 mm, the test shall be repeated. If identical results follow, the CBR 
corresponding to 5 mm penetration shall be taken for design. The CBR value is reported in percentage.

Purpose
A combination of well graded coarse and fine aggregates is essential for producing a durable granular 
mix for pavement courses.
Procedure
1.	
The coarse aggregates used for granular construction are normally of the sizes 80 mm, 75mm, 
53mm, 40 mm, 37.5mm, 26.5mm, 20 mm, 19mm, 10 mm ,9.5mm and 4.75 mm. The fractions from 



======================================================================

======================================================================

Section-400
4.75 mm to 150 micron are termed as fine aggregates. The size 4.75 mm is a common size appearing 
in both the fractions.
2.	
Grading pattern of aggregates – coarse, fine or combined – is determined by sieving a sample 
successively through all the sieves mounted one over the other in order of size, with the larger 
sieve on the top. The material retained on each sieve after shaking, represents the fraction of 
aggregate coarser than the sieve in question and finer than the sieve above.
3.	
Sieve analysis gives the gradation and the fineness modulus which is an empirical factor obtained 
by adding the cumulative percentages of aggregates retained on each of the dividing standard 
sieves and dividing by 100.  The larger the figure, the coarser the material.
4.	
Bring the sample to an air dry condition either by drying at room temperature or in oven at a 
temperature of 100oC to 110oC. Take the weight of the sample.
5.	
Clean all the sieves and sieve the  sample successively on the appropriate sieve starting with the 
largest.
6.	
Shake each sieve separately over a clean tray.
7.	
On completion of sieving, note down the weight of the material retained on each sieve.
8.	
Report the results as percentage by weight of sample passing each of the sieves as shown in Form

Aggregate Impact Value (Dry and Wet) Purpose
The purpose of determining the Aggregate Impact Value is to assess its resistance to disintegration 
against impact loading.
Procedure
1.	
Take the test sample consisting of aggregates the whole of which passes 12.5 mm IS sieve and is 
retained on 10 mm IS sieve. Dry the aggregate comprising the test sample in an oven for a period 
of four hours or till such time that its weight becomes constant at a temperature of 105oC to 110 oC. 
Cool the aggregates.
2.	
Use the aggregates as obtained above for conducting the test in a dry condition, following the

procedure described below. For conducting the test under wet conditions, immerse the oven dried 
sample in water for 3 days. Surface dry the sample by suitable cloth and follow the procedure 
described later in this Section.
3.	
Aggregate shall be filled in the cylindrical measure in 3 layers by tamping each layer  by 25 blows. 
Determine the net weight of aggregate in the measure (W1). Transfer the sample from the measure 
to the cup of the aggregate impact testing machine and compact it by tamping 25 times.
4.	
The hammer is raised to height of 38 cm above the upper surface of the aggregate in the cup and is 
allowed to fall freely on the specimen.
5.	
After subjecting the test specimen to 15 blows at an interval of not less then one second, the 
crushed aggregate is sieved on IS 2.36 mm sieve.
6.	
Weigh the fraction passing through IS 2.36  mm sieve (W2).  Form SB-2

Submerge the sample in water for three days. Make it surface dry, and put the sample in the cup 
of Testing Machine. Fix the cup firmly on position on the base of the machine.
2.	
Raise the hammer until its full face is 380 mm above the upper surface of aggregate in the cup and 
allow it to fall freely.
3.	
Subject the test sample to 15 such blows.
4.	
Remove the crushed aggregate from the cup and sieve it on 2.36 mm IS sieve. Wash it with water 
till no further significant amount passes in one minute.

402.3(b)	Elongation Index
Procedure
1.	
The sample shall be sieved in accordance with the following table .
2.	
In order to separate elongated material, each fraction is then gauged individually for length in a 
length gauge. 
3.	
The pieces of aggregates from each fraction tested which could not pass through the specified 
gauge length with its long side are elongated particles and are collected separately to find the total 
weight of aggregates retained on the length gauge from each fraction.
4.	
The total amount of elongated material retained by the length gauge is weighed to an accuracy of 
at least 0.1 percent of the weight of the sample.
This test is not applicable to sizes smaller than 6.3 mm.
Combined Flakiness & Elongation Index
To determine this combined proportion, the flaky stone from a representative sample should first be 
separated out. Flakiness index is weight of flaky stone metal divided by weight of stone sample. Only the 
elongated particle is separated out from the remaining (non flaky) stone metal. Elongation index is weight 
of elongated particles divided by total non-flaky particles. The value of flakiness index and elongation 
index so found are added up.

Water Absorption of  Aggregates
Purpose
Water absorption shows the porosity of aggregates in one way, which indirectly indicate its strength against 
external loading.
Procedure
The test piece about 1 kg shall be washed to remove dust and immersed in distilled water in a glass vessel at 
a room temperature 20oC to 30oC for 24 h. Soon after immersion and again at the end of the soaking  period, 
entrapped air shall be removed by gentle agitation. This will be done by rapid clock wise and anticlock wise 
rotation. The vessel shall then be emptied and test piece be allowed to drain. The test piece shall then be 
placed on a dry cloth and gently surface dried with the cloth.  It shall be transferred to a second dry cloth 
when the first one removes no further moisture. It shall be spread out not more than one stone deep on the 
second cloth and left exposed to atmosphere away from direct sunlight or any other source of heat for less 
than 10 min  until it appears to be completely surface dry. The sample shall then be weighed (B).
The sample will be dried in an oven at 100 to 110oC for not less than 24 h.  It shall then be cooled in a 
dessicator to room temperature and weighed (A)  The water absorption shall be calculated  from the formula.

Polished Stone Value
Purpose 
To determine  the relative measure of the ecxtent to which different types of aggregates in wearing surface 
will polish under traffic loading.
Preparation of Specimens
a)	
At least 3 kg of 10mm particles shall be taken for each sample to be tested. The particles actually 
used in the preparation of the test specimens shall all pass the 10 mm IS Sieve and be retained on 
the 8mm IS Sieve and shall be neither flaky nor elongated. These shall be clean and free from dust.
b)	
Each specimen shall consist ofa single layer of40 to 50 ofthe particles spaced ag closely as possible 
and covering an area of 90.5 x44.5 mm, set in a sand-cement mortar* with their exposed surfaces 
proud of the mortar. The surface of the specimen shall be flat across the shorter dimension but shall 
be curved in the arc of a circle of 400 mm diameter along the longer dimensfon. The individual 
particles shall be mounted in such a way that the surfaces exposed to wear are as nearly flat as 
possible, and in any case no sharp edges should be there to the polishing tyre.
c)	
The specimens shall be not less than 12.5 mm thick, and shall be of such a shape as to 
permit their being clamped round the flat periphery of the road wheel of the accelerated 
polishing machine so as to form a continuous outer surface of particles with an outer 
diameter of 405 mm.
Accelerated Polishing of Specimens 
1.	
The specimens shall be rigidly clamped round the periphery of the road wheel of the accelerated 
polishing machine; the wheel will accommodate 14 specimens, and it has been found useful when 
mounting the specimens on the wheel to insert strips of polythenet about 0.25 mm thick between 
and beneath them.
2.	
The pneumatic-tyred wheel shall be brought to bear on the surface of the specimens with a total 
load of 40 kg and the road wheel started up and brought. to a speed of 320 to 325 rev/min Water 
and the sand shall be fed continuously at the rates specified about 12 g/min of sand and 20 g/min 
of water for a period of 3 hours + 5 min.
3.	
The machine and specimens shall then be thoroughly cleaned by washing so that all traces of sand 
are removed and the machine operated for a further three hours, except that in place of the sand 
and water the air-floated emery powder specified and water shall be fed continuously at a uniform 
rate and in such a way that the emery powder and water are continuously and uniformly spread 
over the surface of the tyre and the specimens where they are in contact. This requires about 2 g/
min of emery powder and 5 g/min of water.
4.	
After 3 hours &5 min running with the emery powder, the machine shall be stopped and the 
machine and specimens cleaned. The specimens after polishing are extremely sensitive to handling, 
and fingering of the polished surfaces shall be avoided. The specimens shall then be tested on the 
friction tester.
5.	
The weight of the swinging arm including the slider shall be 1.5 + 025 kg, the centre of gravity 
lying on the axis of the arm at a distance of 405 + 5 mm from the centre of suspension. The test shall 
be made at a temperature of 20 +2oC.

Section-400
6.	
The tester shall rest upon a firm level surface and the levelling screws shall be adjusted so that 
the column is vertical. The axis of suspension of the pendulum shall then be raised so that the 
arm swings freely, and the friction in the pointer mechanism shall be adjusted so that when the 
pendulum arm and pointer are released from the right-hand horizontal position the pointer comes 
to rest at the zero position on the scale.
7.	
The specimen shall then be rigidly located with its longer dimension lying in the track of the 
pendulum, and centrally with respect to the rubber slider and to the axis of suspension of the 
pendulum. The height of the axis of suspension of the pendulum shall then be adjusted so that in 
traversing the specimen the rubber slider is in contact with it over the whole width of the slider 
and over a length of 75 + 1.5 mm of the specimen under a normal load of 2.25 + 0.05 kg.
8.	
The surfaces of the specimen and the rubber slider shall then be wetted with a copious supply of 
clean water, care being taken not to disturb the slider from its set position. The pendulum and 
pointer shall then be released from the horizontal position and the reading of the pointer recorded 
to the nearest whole number. The procedure shall then be repeated with a second specimen of 
the same material. If the values obtained from the two specimens differ by more than 3 percent, a 
further specimen or specimens shall be tested until two values agree within this limit.
9.	
The mean of the two values of the coefficient of friction, expressed as a percentage, shall be reported 
to the nearest whole number.

Sand Equivalent  Value
Purpose
This test is conducted to determine the permissible quantity of claylike fines in an aggregate thus affecting 
the quality of aggregate.
Sample Preparation
a)	
Take at least 1500 g of material passing 4.75-mm IS Sieve.
b)	
Split or quarter enough material to fill four can measures to the brim or slightly rounded above 
the brim
c)	
Materials shall be damped to avoid segregation or loss of fines during the splitting or quartering 
operations
d)	
Each time a measure full of the materials shall be dipped from the sample, tap the bottom edge of 
the measure on a work table or other hard surface at least four times.
e)	
Then it shall be jogged slightly to produce a measure of consolidated materials level full or slightly 
rounded above the brim.
f)	
Determine and record the amount of material contained in these four measures either by mass or 
by volume in a dry plastic cylinder.
g)	
This material shall be returned back to the sample and shall be proceed to split or quarter the 
material making necessary adjustment to obtain this predetermined mass or volume.
h)	
When this mass or volume shall be obtained, two successive splitting operations without adjustment 
shall be the proper amount of materials to fill the measure.

Determination of Optimum Quantity of Lime to Attain the Specified Reduction in PI and \ or 
to achieve the Specified CBR
Purpose
When clayey soils with high plasticity are treated with lime, the plasticity index is decreased and the soil 
becomes friable and easy to be pulverised, having less affinity with water. All these modifications are 
considered desirable for stabilization work.
Procedure
The various factors on which the properties of soil-lime depend are soil type, lime content, compaction, 
curing and additives, if any. However, there is no standard method of mix design. If lime is used mainly for 
highly plastic clay, then the lime content may be decided based on lime fixation limit or at a higher value 
to reduce the plasticity index and swelling values up to the desired limits. Unconfined Compressive Strength 
Tests may be considered as a criterion for the design of mix. A number of trials may be required to arrive at 
the optimum proportions.
403.5 	
Unconfined Compressive Strength  of  Stabilised Soils
Purpose
Unconfined Compressive Strength of stabilised soil is an indication of the Lime reactivity of modified soil.

a)	
Fine Grained Soils – Not less than about 90 percent of the soil passing a 2.36 mm IS Sieve
b)	
Medium Grained Soils – Not less than about 90 percent of the soil passing a 20 mm IS Sieve.
c)	
Coarse Grained Soils – Not less than about 90 percent of the soil passing a 40 mm IS Sieve. Tapered

75
Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads
	
b. For medium grained soils 200 mm high x 100 mm mean diametre Ejecting plungers and 
displacing collars for use with the above moulds will be used.
1.	
The weight of the stabilized soil (W ) required for moulding into a specimen of the required dry 
density shall be calculated in accordance with the mould used. In the case of soils stabilised with 
a solid stabiliser, for example, cement, this weight shall be calculated from the formulae :
	
For fine grained  soils (100 x 50 mm moulds) :
       Vfm
W1   = (Vf + ----------------- )  γdg = (196 + 1.96 m) γdg
        100
	
For medium grained soils (20 mm x 100 mm moulds)
      Vfm
W1   = (Vm + ----------------- )  γdg = (1570 + 15.7 m) γdg
      100
	
Where
	
V = volume of mould for fine grained soil in cm3
	
m = the moisture content of the soils plus stabiliser in percent
	
γd = density of dry soil plus stabiliser in g/cm3, and
	
Vm  = volume of mould for medium grained soils in cm .
2.	
The appropriate weight of material shall be placed in the mould into which, using a displacing 
collar, the lower plug has been inserted to a distance of 15 mm. During filling, the stabilised soil 
shall be tamped gently and uniformly so that the upper plug can be inserted at a distance of 15 mm.
3.	
The upper plug should be inserted and the mould assembly placed in the compression device or 
testing machine. 
4.	
After removal of the  displacing collars, pressure shall be applied to the plugs until the flanges are 
in contact with the barrel of the mould. 
5 . 	
After the pressure has been maintained for about ½ min, the load shall be released and the mould 
removed from the press. The plugs shall then be removed from the mould.
6.	
The plunger shall then be inserted into the end of the mould having the smaller diameter and the 
specimen released from the taper by gentle hammering or pressure. The specimen shall then be 
removed from the mould and weighed to the nearest 1 g (W2).
Curing
A.	
The specimen shall be completely coated with paraffin wax or other suitable wax or otherwise suitably 
projected by methods such as wrapping in polyethylene to maintain it at its specified moisture content 
care being taken not to leave holes in the wax film and to complete the coating as quickly as possible 
to prevent the absorption of wax, and it shall then be weighed to the nearest 1 g (W3). 
B . 	
It shall subsequently be stored for a period  depending on the process and type of stabilizer 
employed, under conditions in which it is protected from mechanical damage and kept at a 
temperature of 27 + 2oC .

Section-400
C.	
After the curing period and before testing, the specimen shall again be weighed to the nearest 1 g 
(W4). Any 100 mm high x 50 mm diameter specimen which has lost more than 2 g in weight and any 
200 mm high x 100 mm diameter specimen which has lost more than 5g in weight during the curing 
period shall be discarded.
Test Procedure
1.	
After weighing, the wax shall be removed form the end of the specimen and, if desired, from the 
sides, care being taken to avoid damaging the soil surface.
2.	
The length of the specimen (L) shall be measured to the nearest 0.25 mm by means of the callipers, 
and recorded.
3.	
The specimen shall then be placed centrally on the lower platen of the compression testing machine. 
4.	
And  the load shall be applied to the ends of the specimen. The load shall be applied so that 
the rate of deformation is uniform, approximately 1.25 mm/min. The maximum load exerted by the 
machine during the test shall be recorded P kg.
5.	
The moisture content shall be determined  on a representative sample of fragments taken from the 
interior of the specimen, and recorded.

Test for Medium and Coarse Grained Stabilised Soil
Preparation of Specimen
For Specimens Compacted to a Pre-determined Dry Density
Using only material passing the 20 mm IS Test Sieve for medium grained soils, and only material passing 
the 40 mm IS test sieve for coarse grained soils, the stabilised soil shall be prepared as described in
IS : 4332 (Part I) – 1967.
The weight of the stabilised soil (W1) required for moulding into a specimen of the required dry density 
shall be calculated from the formulae :
For soils stabilised with solid stabiliser: 
	
	               V
W1    = (V + --------------  m) γd g = (3375 + 33.75m) γd g

Where
V = volume of mould  in cm3
m  = the moisture content of the soils plus stabiliser in percent, and
γd = density of dry soil plus stabiliser in g/cm3,
1.	
The material (W1) shall be divided into three equal parts by weight. One of the parts shall be 
placed in an assembled mould and the surface levelled off. Using a tamper fitted with a collar at 
the 10cm mark and a vibrating hammer, the material shall be compacted uniformly until the collar 
comes into contact with the upper surface of the mould. 
2.	
The surface of the layer shall be scarified with the palette knife before adding the next layer, which 
shall be compacted in similar manner to the first layer, but using a tamper fitted with a collar at the 
5 cm position. 
3.	
A 150 mm cube mould, less base plate shall then be placed squarely on top of the cube mould, the 
compacted surface scarified with the palette knife, and the final layer added using the tamper with 
the collar at the 150 mm position.  
4.	
The upper mould shall then be removed and the surface of the specimen  carefully leveled off 
the end of the mould using the trowel and vibrating tamper, care being taken not to spill any loose 
material during this final operation.

5.	
The mould containing the specimen shall then be covered with a metal plate and stored at 
temperature of 27oC ± 2oC until the following day when the specimen shall be removed from the 
mould for further curing.  The specimen shall then be weighed to the nearest 1 g (W2).
Curing
A.	
The curing tin shall be placed over the specimen, and the tin and specimen then inverted. The lid 
shall then be placed in position and sealed with suitable tape. The tin containing the specimen 
shall then be weighed to the nearest 1g (W2).

employed, at a temperature of 27oC + 2oC.
C.	
After the curing  period, and before testing, the tin containing the specimen shall again be weighed 
to the nearest 1 g (W4). Any specimen that has lost more than 10g in weight during the storage period 
shall be discarded.

(a)	
After weighing, the specimen shall be removed from the tin.
(b)	
The specimen shall then be placed centrally on the lower platen of the compression testing machine in 
such a manner that the load shall be applied to opposite sides of the cube as cast, that is, not to the top and 
bottom. The load shall be applied without shock and increased continuously at a rate of approximately 
35 kgf/cm2/min until the resistance of the cube  to the increasing load breaks down and no greater load 
can be sustained. The maximum load exerted by the machine can be recorded (P kg).
(c)	
The moisture content shall be determined on a representative sample of fragments taken from the 
interior of the specimen and recorded.
(d)	
The unconfined compressive strength (p) of the specimen shall be calculated from the formula :

Purpose
Better the pulverisation and degree of mixing, higher is the strength. Presence of unpulverised dry 
lumps of soil reduces strength and durability of stabilised soil.
Procedure
1.	
Pulverise the soil using agricultural implements like tractor – towed disc harrows and rotavators 
to the extent that it passes the requirements given below.

2.	
Take a sample of pulverised soil approximately 1 kg in weight. Weigh it accurately (W1).
3.	
Spread it on the 425 micron sieve and shake it gently, Taking care to break the soil lumps as little as 
possible. Sieve the soil and weigh the soil retained on the sieve (W2 ). Break the lumps of finer soil in the 
retained material until all the individual particles finer than the aperture size of the sieve are separated.
4.	
Place the soil again on the sieve and shake until sieving is complete. Weigh the retained material 
on the sieve (W3).
5.	
Calculate the per cent soil passing the sieve from the following expression

Volumetric Analysis
Purpose
The test is conducted to make sure that adequate quantity and composition of material have been used in 
the construction.
Procedure
1.	
Dig a pit 0.5 m x 0.5 m in the area where random checking is to be carried out. Take out all the 
WBM material from the pit. One of the test procedures given below can be used.
2.	
Test 1
	
Refill the pit with the dug material without compacting. If the pit can be filled by using not more 
than 65% of the dug material, it is indicative of adequate compaction and use of specified quantity 
of all materials combined together.

Test 2
(i)	
Separate out the portions of the WBM material passing and retained on 11.2 mm size sieve when 
type B Screenings have been used. When Type A Screenings have been used, the proportions of 
WBM material passing and retained on 13.2 mm size sieve should be determined.
(ii)	
Measure the loose volumes of the two portions using cylinders of known volume and compare the 
combined volume with the combined specified quantities of Coarse Aggregate + Screenings + 
Binding Material.
(iii)	 The volume of material retained on 11.2 mm size sieve ( or 13.2 mm size sieve, as the case may be) 
shall be compared with the specified quantities of coarse aggregate viz 0.91 to 1.07 cu. M per 10 sq 
m for WBM gradings 2 and 3. Due allowance shall be made for crushing during rolling.
(iv)	 The material passing 11.2 mm size sieve ( or 13.2 mm size sieve, as the case may be) shall be compared 
with the specified quantities of Stone Screenings and Binding Material or Crushable Screenings as the 
case may be.
(v)	
For the Coarse Aggregates, the quality may be checked by conducting an Aaggregate Impact Test 
and determining the presence of any oversize aggregate.
(vi)	 For the finer fractions passing 425 micron size sieve, the Plasticity Index shall be determined to 
check that it is less than 6.

502.2 Test for  Bitumen Emulsion  :  Viscosity by Saybolt – Furol Viscometer
Purpose
Viscosity indicates the resistance to flow due to its internal friction. Higher the viscosity lower the rate of 
flow. The test is conducted to see if it is in the specified range. The Saybolt Furol Viscometer is used for 
determining the Viscosity. The Test result is expressed in seconds for the flow of 60 cc of the emulsion 
sample through a 3.8 mm diameter orifice under the specified conditions of the test. Procedure using the 
special equipment is given below.



======================================================================
PAGE 133 of 300
======================================================================
Section-500
90
Procedure
1.	
Clean the oil tube with a solvent, such as benzene, and remove excess solvent from the gallery.Pass 
the entire material through a 150 micron wire strainer before introducing into the oil tube.
2.	
After the tube is cleaned, pour into the tube a quantity of the material to be tested, sufficient to wet 
the entire surface of the tube.  Allow to drain out.
3.	
The plunger commonly supplied with the viscometer shall never be used on instruments maintained 
as standards. Insert the cork stopper not less than 6.0 mm and not more than 9.5 mm into the lower 
end of the air chamber at the bottom of the oil tube, taking care that the cork fits tightly enough to 
prevent the escape of air, as tested by the absence of oil on the cork after it is withdrawn.
4.	
If the test temperature is above that of the room, heat the material to not more than 1.5oC below the 
temperature of test. The required test temperature for Rapid and Medium setting emulsion is 50 oC 
and for Slow setting ,test temperature is 25oC.
5.	
Pour the material into the oil tube until it ceases to overflow into the gallery. Keep it well stirred 
with the oil tube thermometer, care being taken to avoid touching the outflow tube.  Adjust the bath 
temperature until the temperature of the material remains constant.
6.	
After thermal equilibrium has been attained, no further adjustment shall be made in the bath 
temperature. The test results shall be discarded if the indicated bath temperature varies by more 
than +0.03oC.
7.	
After the temperature of the material in the oil tube has remained constant within +0.02oC of the 
desired temperature for one minute with constant stirring, withdraw the oil tube thermometer and 
remove the surplus liquid quickly from the gallery by means of the withdrawal tube so that the level 
of the material in the gallery is below the level in the oil tube proper. Insert the tip of the withdrawal 
tube at one point in the gallery.
8.	
The test shall be started over again if the tip of the withdrawal tube touches the overflow rim.Under 
no condition shall the excess liquid be removed by rotating the withdrawal tube around the gallery.
9.	
Place the receiving  flask in position so that the stream of liquid from outlet tube strikes the neck of 
the flask, care being taken that the graduation mark on the receiving flask is not less than 10cm, not 
more than 13cm, from the bottom of the bath. Snap the cork from its position and at the same instant 
start the timer.  Stop the timer when the bottom of the meniscus of the liquid reaches the mark on 
the neck of the receiving flask.
10.	
Time in seconds as determined by the prescribed procedure, with the proper calibration correction, 
is the Saybolt Furol viscosity of the material at the temperature at which the test is made. The 
requirement Criterion is given in Table 502.2.1.
11.	
Report the results to the nearest 0.1 second for viscosity values below 200 seconds and to the nearest 
whole second for values 200 seconds or above.

502.3  Residue of Bitumen Emulsion on 600 Micron Sieve
Purpose
Three tests are required to assess the suitability of Bituminous material for road construction work.
Procedure
1.	
Wash the 600 micron IS sieve with xylene and then acetone. Place it in the dish, dry in the oven at 
100 o C to 110 oC for one hour, cool and weigh, together with the dish, to the nearest 0.01g (W ).
2.	
Remove the sieve from the dish and moisten with the solution. Remove uniformly the 4-litre sample by 
gentle agitation and strain immediately through the sieve into the clean, dry weighed container (W4).
3.	
Sieve the low and high viscosity emulsion at room temperature and 50 oC respectively. When 
whole of the emulsion has passed through the sieve, remove the sieve and weigh the container to 
the nearest 1 g (W).
4.	
Wash the sieve repeatedly with distilled water until the washings run clear. Place the sieve in the small 
dish to dry for two hours in the oven at 105+/-5 oC. Cool and reweigh together to nearest 0.01 g (W).



======================================================================

Calculate the Residue as follows:
	
	
	
	
          W3 –W1
Residue, percentage retained =  --------------------- x  100
	
	
	
	
          W2 – W4
where
	
W1	
=	
mass in g,  of sieve and small dish

502.4  Storage Stability Test on Emulsions
Purpose
This test is used to determine the ability of an emulsion to remain as a uniform dispersion during storage
Procedure
1.	
Place 500 ml of emulsion sample in each of the two cylinders.
2.	
Stopper the cylinders and allow them to stand undisturbed for 24 h.
3.	
About 55 ml is siphoned from the top and placed in oven for about 2 h at a temperature of 163°C + 
2.8°C.
4.	
They are removed, allowed to cool and weighed.
5.	
After removal of the top sample, another 390 ml is siphoned off from each of the cylinders. Weigh 
about 50 g and place in oven for about 2 h at a temperature of 163°C + 2.8°C.
6.	
Remove the samples from the oven, allow the sample to cool and weigh.
7.

502.5  Flash Point Test of Bitumen Cutback
Purpose
The flash point of bitumen that contains a volatile distillate is the temperature at which it begins to give 
off ignitable vapour. The principal purpose of flash-point testing is to determine maximum safe mixing 
and applying temperatures.
Procedure
1.	
Clean and dry all parts of the cup and its accessories thoroughly before conducting the test. Take 
particular care to avoid the presence of any solvent used to cleanthe apparatus after a previous test.
2.	
Fill bitumen into the cup up to the indicated mark.
3.	
Place the lid and set in the stove to heat the bitumen.
4.	
Insert the thermometer.
5.	
Apply heat at 50 - 60C per minute.
6.	
Stir at the rate of 60 rpm.
7.	
First apply the test flame at a temperature at least 170C below the actual flash point and then at 
interval of 10C to 30C.
8.	
Discontinue the stirring during the application of test flame.
9.	
Record the temperature reading on the thermometer at the time of the flame application which 
causes a bright flash to give the flash point of bitumen  (Form  BC – 2). The requirement Criterion is 
given in Table 502.5.1.

Procedure 
1.	
Carry out the test at 24 ± 5.5°C tap water of not over 250 ppm CaCo3 hardness.
2.	
Weight 460 g of the air dried/graded limestone aggregates in the mixing pan.
3.	
Weigh 4 g of CaCO3 dust in the mixing pan and mix with the 460 g of aggregate for approximately 1 
min by means of a mixing blade to obtain uniform film of dust on the aggregate particles. The total 
weight of aggregate shall be 460 g.
4.	
Pipette 9.3 ml of water to the aggregate and CaCO3 dust mixture into the mixing pan and mix 
thoroughly to obtain uniform wetting.
5.	
Weigh 35 g bitumen emulsion into the aggregate in the pan and mix vigorously with the mixing 
blade for 5 min by a back and forth motion in an elliptical path of the mixing blade of spoon. At the 
end of the mixing period, tilt the pan and permit any excess emulsion not on the aggregate to drain 
from the pan.
6.	
Tap water of not over 250 ppm CaCO3 hardness is required for spraying over the sample.
7.	
Remove approximately one half of the mixture from the pan and place it on absorbent paper and 
evaluate the coating.
8.	
Immediately spray the mixture remaining in the pan with tap water from the constant head water 
spraying apparatus to cover the mixture. The distance from the spray head to the sample shall be 
305 ± 75mm. Then carefully pour off the water. Continue   spraying and pouring off the water until 
the overflow water runs clear. Carefully drain off the water on the pan. Scoop the mixture from the 
mixing pan on to absorbent paper for evaluation of coating retention in the washing test.

BS U-Tube Modified Reverse Flow Viscometer 
Procedure
1.	
Capillary type of Viscometers either BS U-Tube Modified Reverse Flow Viscometer  or Standard 
Brookfield shall be used for the test.
2.	
To calibrate, charge the clean dry viscometer by pouring the reference material. Place the charged 
viscometer in the viscometer bath long enough to reach the test temperature. Measure to within 
0.1s the time required for the leading edge of the meniscus to pass from the first timing mark to the 
second. Calculate the Viscometer constant as follows :
	
C = V / t
	
Where
	
V = viscosity in centistokes for the standard liquid, and t = efflux time in seconds
A. Determination of Kinematic Viscosity by BS U-Tube Modified Reverse Flow Viscometer 
Procedure
1.	
Mount the BS U-tube viscometer in the constant temperature bath keeping tube L vertical. Pour 
sample through tube N to a point just above filing mark G, allow the sample to flow freely through 
capillary R, taking care that the liquid column remains unbroken until the lower mark H and then 
arrest its flow by closing the timing tube with a cork or rubber stopper in tube L. Add more liquid, 
if necessary to bring the upper meniscus slightly above mark G. 
2.	
After allowing the sample to attain bath temperature and any air bubble to rise to the surface 
(usually about 20-30 min is required), gently loosen the stopper allowing the sample to flow until it 
is approximately at the lower filling mark H and press back the stopper to arrest flow.
3.	
Remove the excess sample above filling mark G by inserting the special pipette until its cork rests 
on top of the tube N and apply gentle suction until air is drawn through. The upper meniscus shall 
coincide with mark G.
	
Allow the viscometer to remain in the constant temperature bath for a sufficient time to ensure that 
the sample reaches temperature equilibrium. It takes about 20 min at 38°C, 25 min at 100°C and 30 
min at 135°C.

B. Determination of Absolute Viscosity by Cannon Manning  Vacuum Capillary Viscometer 
1.	
Heat the sample to a temperature not more than 60°C for the tars and pitches and not more than 
90°C for bitumen above their respective approximate softening point temperature respectively 
until it has become sufficiently fluid to pour. Transfer about 20 ml into a suitable container and 
maintain it to a temperature 135 ± 5.5°C stirring occasionally to prevent local overheating and allow 
the entrapped air to escape.
2.	
Charge the viscometer by pouring the prepared sample to within ± 2 mm of fill line E. Place the 
charged viscometer in an oven or bath maintained at 135 ± 5.5°C for a period of 10 ± 2 min to allow 
large air bubbles to escape.
3.	
Maintain the bath at the test temperature within ± 0.1°C. Place the charged viscometer vertically in 
the water bath with the help of a holder so that the uppermost timing mark is at least 2 cm below 
the surface of the bath liquid.
4.	
Establish a vacuum of 30 ± 0.05 cm of mercury in the vacuum system and connect it to the viscometer 
with the valve closed.
5.	
After the viscometer has remained in the bath for 30±5 min open the valve and allow the asphalt to 
flow into the viscometer.
6.  	
Measure to within ± 0.5sec., the required for the leading edge of the meniscus to pass between 
successive pairs of timing marks. Upon completion of the test remove the viscometer from the bath 
and place it in an inverted position in an oven maintained at 135 ± 5°C until asphalt is drained off 
thoroughly from the viscometer.

C. Determination of Absolute Viscosity by Standard Brookfield Viscometer
1.	
Read and Understand the information in the instrument manufacturer’s operating instruction 
before proceeding.
2.	
Turn on thermosel power.
3.	
Set the proportional controller to desired test temperature.
4.	
Refer to the operating instruction for calibration of controller.
5.	
Wait 1.5 h (or until Equilibrium temperature is obtained) with the selected spindle in the chamber ( 
check control lamp).
6.	
Remove sample holder and add the volume of sample specified for the spindle to be used. Exercise 
caution to avoid sample overheating and to avoid ignition of sample with low flash point. Calculate 
the mass required  from specific gravity or density data for the sample. Approximately 8 to10 ML 
will be required.
7.	
Do not overfill the sample container. The sample volume is critical to meet the system calibration 
standard. Thoroughly stir filled asphalt coatings to obtain a representative sample.
8.	
The Liquid level should intersect the spindle shaft at a point approximately 3.2 mm (1/8in) above 
the upper “conical body”- “Spindle shaft” interface.
9.	
Using the extracting tool, put the loaded chamber back into the thermo container.
10.	
Lower the viscometer and align the thermo-container.
11.	
Insert the selected spindle into the liquid in the chamber, and couple it to the viscometer. Proper 
spindle selection may require testing with more then one spindle.
12.	
Allow the asphalt to come to the equilibrium temperature ( about 15 min.)
13.	
Start Brookfield models RV,HA,HB viscometer at 20 rpm, LV Model at 12 RPM .Observe the meter 
reading .if it is between 2 and 98 units, proceed with the test.
14.	
Record three readings 60 s apart at each test temperature.
15.	
Follow the procedure for each test temperature required.

16.	
If reading are above 98 units at the lowest test temperature, decrease the spindle rpm setting and 
continue with the test.
17.	
If the reading is above 98, use the next smaller spindle and repeat the procedure using the sample 
volume specified .
18.	
Multiply the viscosity factor by the Brookfield reading to obtain viscosity in centipoises.
19.	
Do not change the speed(rpm setting) during a viscosity measurement, as this will change the shear 
rate.

504.1 (b) R&B Softening Point Test
Purpose
Softening point is the temperature measured in oC at which a bituminous binder attains a particular degree 
of softness under specified test conditions. It signifies the temperature at which bitumen passes from semi 
solid state to liquid state and indicates the atmospheric temperature at which the bitumen is likely to 
bleed.

504.1 (c) DuctilityTest on Residue of Paving Bitumen or Emulsion (obtained from Thin Film Oven 
Test)
Purpose
Ductility indicates the amount of stretch that the bitumen will undergo without breaking.  It signifies the 
property by virtue of which bitumen can exist in a thin film without breaking. This test is conducted on 
the residue of paving bitumen obtained from rolling Thin film oven test.
Procedure
1.	
The bitumen residue sample is prepared as per IS : 9382 and this residue is melted to a temperature 
of 75°C to 100°C above the approximate softening point until it becomes thoroughly fluid.
2.	
It is strained through IS sieve 30 (see IS: 460-1962), poured in the mould assembly and placed on a 
brass plate, after a solution of glycerine and dextrine is applied at all surfaces of the mould exposed 
to bitumen.
3.	
Thirty to forty min after the sample is poured into the moulds, the plate Assembly along with the 
sample is placed in water bath maintained at 27.0°C ± 0.5°C for 30 min.

5.	
After trimming the specimen, the mould assembly containing sample is replaced in water bath 
maintained at 27.0°C ± 0.5°C for 85 to 95 min.
6.	
The sides of the mould are then removed and the clips are carefully hooked on the machine without 
causing any initial strain.
7.	
The pointer is set to read zero.
8.	
The machine is started and the two clips are thus pulled apart horizontally.
9.	
While the test is in operation, it is checked whether water in the tank of the testing machine covers 
the specimen both above and below it by at least 25 mm and is maintained continuously within 
±0.5°C of the specified temperature.
10.	
The distance at which the bitumen thread breaks is recorded (in cm) and reported as ductility value.
11.	
Report the average of three normal tests,as the ductility of the sample, provided the three 
determinations be within ± 5 percent of their mean value. (Form BC – 7).

504.2 (d) Separation Test
Purpose
The separation of modifier and bitumen during hot storage is a property that indicates how long will it 
take to separate and thus controls the laying operations
Procedure
1.	
The separation is evaluated by comparing the ring and ball softening point of the top and   bottom 
samples taken from a conditioned, sealed tube of polymer modified bitumen.
2.	
Place the empty tube, with sealed end down in the rack Heat the sample carefully until sufficiently 
fluid to pour.
3.	
Pass the molten sample through IS Sieve of 600 micron mesh size. After thorough stirring, pour 50.0 
g into the vertically held tube. Fold the excess tube over two times and crimp and seal.



======================================================================
PAGE 154 of 300
======================================================================
Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads
111
4.	
Place the rack containing the sealed tubes in a 163 ± 5°C oven. Allow the tubes to stand undisturbed 
in the oven for a period of 24 ± 4 h. At the end of the period, remove the rack from the oven and 
place immediately in the freezer at 6.7 ± 5°C, taking care to keep the tubes in a vertical position at 
all the times. Leave the tubes in the freezer for a minimum of 4 h to solidify the sample completely.
5.	
Upon removing the tube from the freezer, place it on a flat surface. Cut the tube into three equal 
length portions with the spatula and hammer. Discard the centre section, and place the top and 
bottom portions of the tube into separate beakers. Place the beakers into a 163 ± 5°C oven until the 
bitumen is sufficiently fluid to remove the pieces of aluminium tube.
6.	
After thoroughly stirring, pour the top bottom samples into appropriately marked ring and ball 
softening point test. Prepare the rings and apparatus according to the test procedure given in
7.	
Report the difference, in °C, between the softening points of the respective top and bottom samples.

504.2 (e) Loss on Mass by Thin Film Oven Test
Purpose
To determine the effect of heat and air on bituminous materials when heated to a standard temperature 
under specified conditions.
Procedure
1.	
Stir and agitate thoroughly the material as received, warm if necessary, to ensure a complete mixture 
before a portion is removed for the test.
2.	
Heat the container in an oven at 100° to 110°C for 30 minutes. Cool and weigh. Weigh into the 
container 50.0 ± 0.5 g of the material. If the quantitative value of the mass change is desired, cool 
the samples for the oven test to room temperature and weigh each sample separately to the nearest 
0.001 g. 
3.	
Bring the oven to a temperature of 163,± 1°C and place the sample container in the revolving shelf. 
Close the oven and rotate the shelf during the entire test at a rate of 5 to 6 rev/min, the temperature 
being maintained at 163 ± 1°C for 5 hours after the sample has been introduced and the oven has 
again reached the temperature. The 5-hour period shall start when the temperature reaches 162°C 
and in no case shall the total time, during which the sample is in the oven, be more than 5 hour 15 
minutes. At the end of the specified heating period remove the container from the oven.Ccool to 
room temperature, and weigh to the nearest 0.001 g and calculate the loss due to heating.
Reporting 
When determined, report the average loss of the material in the two containers as the percent by mass of 
the original material.

504.2 (f)    Determination of Complex modulus
Purpose
The determination of complex modulus (G*), Phase angle (Sin δ) and G*/Sin δ of modified bituminous 
binders.



======================================================================
PAGE 155 of 300
======================================================================
Section-500
112
Significance and Use
The test temperature for this test is related to the temperature experienced by the pavement in the 
geographical area for which the use of binder is intended. The shear modulus is an indicator of stiffness 
or resistance of binder to deformation under load at specified temperature. The complex (G*) modulus 
and phase angle (Sin δ) define the resistance to deformation of the binder in the visco-elastic region. The 
complex modulus and phase angle are used to evaluate performance aspect of modified bitumen, where 
elastic ‘recovery is insignificant.
A Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) and parallel plate test geometry is used for the determination of 
complex modulus (G*) .
The standard is suitable for use when the complex modulus (G*) varies between 100 Pa and 10 Mpa. The 
range of test temperature lies in between 35°C and 85°C depending upon grade, type and conditioning of 
the test sample.
The recommended frequency of testing is 10 rad/s.The complex modulus (G*) and phase angle (Sin δ) are 
calculated as apart of the operation of the rheometer using software available with the equipment.
The complex modulus (G*) and phase angle (Sin δ) decrease with increasing shear strain.
The shear stress is calculated from the applied or measured torque, measured or applied strain and the 
geometry of the test specimen.
This test can be performed through third party from the recognized institute like CRRI / IIT’s as      	
DSR equipment is not commonly available .

504.2 (g) Determination of FRASS Breaking Point
Purpose
To determine the behaviour of bituminous materials under low temperatures and to find out whether 
these products would stand the low temperature or not .
FRAASS Breaking Point — It is the temperature at which bitumen first becomes brittle as indicated by the 
appearance of cracks when a thin film of the bitumen on a metal plaque is cooled and flexed in accordance 
with the specified condition.
Procedure
Preparation of Test Sample
Soften the material to the pouring consistency at a temperature not more than 60°C for tars and pitches and 
not more than 90°C for bituminous materials above the respective approximate softening point and stir it 
thoroughly until it is homogeneous and is free from air bubbles and water. Prepare the convenient number 
of plaques.
For Materials of Softening Point Below 70°C
1. 	
Place an amount of the sample corresponding to 0.40 ± 0.01 ml in the unheated liquid or solid state 
on a clean tared plaques. For normal bitumens of specific gravity 1.03 ± 0.4 at 27°C, a weight of 0.4 
± 0.01 g may be used.



======================================================================
PAGE 156 of 300
======================================================================
Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads
113
2. 	
Place the plaque on heating plate and heat the baffle plate continuously until the bitumen just 
flows. Manipulate the plaque by hand, replacing on the heating plate, if necessary, until the plaque 
is uniformly coated.
3. 	
Obtain the final smooth film by replacing the plaque on the heating plate for a short time. Reweigh 
the plaque when it has cooled.
4. 	
For conveniently conducting the test and to make measuring of bitumen more accurate, the 
prescribed quality of bitumen for each test may either be weighed directly on the steel strip or 
extruded from a small press .The mould of the press is cylindrical in form, measuring 20 mm in 
diameter by 20 mm in height, having a slit in the bottom 20 mm long by 0.5 mm wide through 
which is extruded a 0.4-ml strip of standard dimension.
5. 	
If necessary, remove bubbles from the surface of the film by shock cooling the heated bitumen and 
subsequent reheating. The sudden cooling can conveniently be achieved by pressing the heated 
plaque on the powdered solid carbon dioxide. Protect the plaque from dust and allow it to stand 
for one to four hours before testing.
6.	
Fill the annular space between wide test-tube and eccentric test-tube to about half  its  height with 
acetone. Place the plaque between the clips of the bending apparatus, bending the plaque gently to 
do so, and mount the bending apparatus in the wide test-tube.
7. 	
Add solid carbon dioxide through the funnel to the acetone at such a rate that the temperature 
falls at a rate of 1°C per minute. Commencing at a temperature of at least 10°C above the expected 
breaking point, bend the plaque once every minute by turning the handle at  a rate of one rev/sec 
until it is checked and then turning it backwards at the same speed. Record the temperature at 
which one or more cracks appear on bending as the breaking point.
8.	
Calculate the mean of three determinations which lie between a range of 3°C, and report it to the 
nearest 1°C as the breaking point.
NOTE: This test is useful for the areas having sub zero temperature.

505.10 Rate of Spread of Aggregates
The rate of spread of aggregates by the aggregate spreader or any other suitable means can be checked 
by measuring the area covered by each lorry/truck/any other device of known capacity. This can also be 
checked by removing the spread aggregates from small areas of the road and weighing them. A 20 cm 
square metal frame is laid on the new surface dressing, and all the aggregates within the enclosed area are 
collected, washed in solvent to remove bitumen and then weighed, and the rate of spread of aggregates 
is calculated. It is measured along the road at intervals of between 4 m to 8 m. The variation in the rate of 
spread of aggregates should be within -+/- 20 per cent of the mean.

From these curves, the bitumen content shall be obtained for the following conditions:
	
(1)	 Point of maximum stability
	
(2)	 Point of maximum density
	
(3)	 Point of 4 percent air void 
21.	
The optimum binder content shall be the average value of these three, and can be used in the 
design.
22.	
The values of flow and VFB are found from the graphs, corresponding to bitumen content OBC. All 
the design values of Marshall stability, flow, voids and VFB are checked at the Optimum Bitumen 
Content, with the specified design requirements of the mix.
	
Caution: Mixes with high Marshall stability values and very low Flow values are not desirable as the 
pavements of such mixes may be brittle and are likely to crack under heavy traffic
	
Marshall Quotient (Stiffness): is the ratio of stability and flow.

509.2     Water Sensitivity (Retained / Indirect Tensile Strength )of   Bituminous Paving Mixtures
Purpose
To know the resistance of compacted Asphalt mixtures to moisture-induced damage and  the result may 
be used to predict long-term stripping susceptibility of bituminous mixtures.
Procedure
1.	
Make at least 6 compacted specimens for each mixture, 3 to be tested dry and 3 to be tested   after 
partial saturation and moisture conditioning with a freeze-thaw cycle.
2.	
Compact these  6 specimens with a Marshall compactor so that the compacted specimens  have air 
voids of 7.0 ± 0.5 percent. This level of high air voids can be obtained by adjusting the number of 
Marshall blows applied on each side of the specimen by trial and error.
	
Calculate Air void content from the bulk specific gravity of the compacted specimen and the 
maximum theoretical specific gravity of the loose bituminous mixture
3.	
Separate the 6 specimens into 2 subsets so that the average air voids of the two subsets are 
approximately equal.
4.	
One set will be tested dry. Keep it at room temperature and then place in a 25ºC ± 0.5ºC water bath 
for 2 hours prior to determining their indirect tensile strength.
5.	
The other subset will be conditioned as follows: 
	
a) Place and submerge the 3 specimens in the vacuum container filled with water at room 
temperature. Apply a vacuum of 13-67 kPa absolute pressure (10-26 inches Hg partial pressure) for 
30 minutes. Remove the vacuum and leave the specimens submerged in water for 5 to 10 minutes. 
[Note: The water saturation procedure noted above deviates from AASHTO T283, which obtains a 
specified degree of saturation. The above procedure keeps the time of saturation constant.] 
	
b) Wrap a plastic film around each saturated specimen and place the wrapped specimen in a 



======================================================================
PAGE 168 of 300
======================================================================
Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads
125
plastic bag containing 10 ml of water and seal the plastic bag. Place the plastic bag in a freezer at 
temperature of - 18ºC ± 3ºC for a minimum of 16 hours. Remove the specimens from the freezer. 
	
c) Place the specimens in a water bath maintained at 60ºC ± 1ºC for 24 hours. Remove the plastic bag 
and the plastic film from each specimen after placing the specimens under water. 
	
d) Remove the specimens from hot water bath and place in a water bath maintained at 25ºC ± 0.5ºC 
for 2 hours. 
	
e) Remove the conditioned specimens and test for indirect tensile strength.
6. 	
Determine the indirect tensile strength of the 3 dry and 3 conditioned specimens at 25ºC ± 0.5ºC 
after removing from water bath. First, measure their mean thickness (t). Then place the two steel 
loading strips on the bottom and top of the specimens across diameter and place in the Marshall 
testing machine or a compression-testing machine. Apply load to the specimens diametrically at a 
vertical rate of 50 mm (2 inches) per minute.
7. 	
Record the maximum compressive strength noted on the testing machine and continue loading 
until a vertical crack appears in the specimen. Remove the cracked specimen from the machine and 
visually estimate the approximate degree of moisture damage (extent of stripped or bare aggregate) 
on the fractured faces of the specimen on a scale of 0 to 5 (5 being the most stripping).
8.	
Calculate the tensile strength of each specimen as follows in SI units: 
	
St = 2000 P/ π t d
	
where, 
	
St = tensile strength, kPa 
	
P = maximum loads, N 
	
t = specimen thickness, mm 
	
d = specimen diameter, mm
9. 	
Express the numerical index of resistance of bituminous mixture to the detrimental effects of water 
as the ratio of the original strength that is retained after accelerated moisture and freeze-thaw 
conditioning
	
Calculate the Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR) as follows:
	
Tensile strength ratio (TSR) = S2 / S1
	
where,
	
S1 = average tensile strength of the dry subset, kPa 
	
S2 = average tensile strength of the conditioned subset, kPa

600.9 Height, Bond and Verticality by Plumb Bob
Purpose
It is necessary to check the height of each course, its bond and vertically for ensuring long term durability
Procedure
All bricks shall be thoroughly soaked in water and made skin dry before use.  All brickwork shall be laid 
in English Bond even time to time, in accordance with the drawings or as directed by the Engineer. The 
vertically will be measured with a plumb.  The height will be measured with a steel tape to the nearest 
millimeters.
600.10  Consistency of  Cement Mortar
Purpose
The consistency of mortar determines its behavior during application. It depends upon initial fluidity, 
water retentivity etc.
Procedure
A standard cone weighing 300 ± 2g; 150 mm in height and a diametre of 75 mm at the base. The cone is 
mounted on a vertical shaft fastened to an adjustable holder (Fig. 2). The holder has a mechanism which 
releases the shaft. The apparatus also has an instrument dial which records the depth of penetration of the 
cone into a mortar mix kept in a conical container below. The conical container for mortar is 180 mm deep 
with a diametre of 150 mm at the top.
Fill the conical container with mortar mix to a level 1cm below its rim.  Place the mortar mix in the conical 
mould in one continuous operation and compact it by a tamping rod, which is 25 mm square and 200 mm

long. Bump the mould filled with mortar mix 5 or 6 times over a flow table so as to level the surface of the 
mortar.
Place the container over the base below the penetration cone of the apparatus.  Bring the apex of the 
penetrating cone in contact with the surface of the mortar and clamp the cone in position.  Release the cone 
now and allow it to sink into the mortar mix.  After the cone has stopped penetrating into the mortar, set 
the dial once more to record the position of cone.  The difference between dial readings before and after 
penetration gives the depth of penetration of the cone into the mortar.
Repeat the test on another sample; report the average of two determinations as the consistency of the 
mortar.

A mercury manometer, connected as shown in Fig. 8 , indicates the vacuum. A synthetic rubber gasket 
shall be permanently sealed to the top of the funnel and shall be lightly coated with petroleum or light cup 
grease during the test to ensure a seal between the funnel and the dish.  Care shall be  taken to ensure that 
none of the holes in the perforated dish is clogged from the grease used on the rubber gasket.  Hardened 
filter paper of a grade equivalent to Carl Schleicher and Schuell filter paper No.576 or to Whatman No.50 
filter paper shall be used.  It shall be of such diametre that it will  lie flat and completely cover the bottom 
of the dish. 
Adjust the mercury relief column so as to maintain a vacuum of 5cm as measured on the manometer. Seat the 
perforated dish on the greased gasket of the funnel. Place a wetted filter paper in the bottom of the dish. Turn 
the stopcock to apply the vacuum to the funnel and check the apparatus for leaks and to determine that the 
required suction is obtained. Then turn the stopcock to shut off the vacuum from the funnel.
FIG 8 APPARATUS ASSEMBLY FOR WATER RETENTION TEST
Mix the mortar to a consistency to give a flow of 110 to 115.  Immediately  after making the flow test return 
the mortar on the flow table to the mixing bowl and remix the entire batch for 15 sec at medium speed. 
Immediately after remixing of the mortar, fill the perforated dish with the mortar to slightly above the rim. 
Tamp the mortar 15 times with the tamper. Ten of the temping strokes shall be applied at approximately 
uniform spacing adjacent to the rim of the dish and with the long axis of the tamping face held at right 
angles to the radius of the dish.  The remaining five tamping strokes shall be applied at random points 
distributed over the central area of the dish.  The tamping pressure  shall be just sufficient to ensure filling 
of the dish. On completion of tamping, the top of the mortar should extend slightly above the rim of the 
dish.  Smooth off the mortar by drawing the flat side of the straight edge (with the leading  edge slightly 
raised )  across the top of the dish.  Then cut off the mortar to a plane surface flush with the rim of the 
dish by drawing the straight edge with a sawing motion across the top of the dish in two cutting strokes, 
starting each cut from near the  center of the dish.  If the mortar is pulled away from the side of the dish 
during  the process of drawing the straight edge across the dish, gently press the mortar back into contact 
with the side of the dish using the tamper.

Turn the stopcock to apply the vacuum to the funnel.  The time elapsed from the start of mixing the cement 
and water to the time of applying the vaccum  shall not exceed 8 min.  After suction for 60 sec quickly turn 
the stopcock to expose the funnel to atmospheric pressure. Immediately slide the perforated dish off from 
the funnel, touch it momentarily on damp cloth to remove droplets of water and set the dish on the table. 
Then, using the bowl scraper, flow and mix the mortar in the dish for 15 sec.  Upon completion of mixing, 
place the mortar in the dish for 15 sec.  Upon completion of mixing,  place the mortar in the flow mould 
and determine the flow.  The entire operation shall be carried out without interruption and as quickly as 
possible, and shall be completed within an elapsed time of 11 min after the start of mixing the cement and 
water for the first flow determination.
Calculation :
Calculate the water retention value for the mortar as follows ; Water retention value = A/B  x 100
Where
A = flow after suction and
B = flow immediately after mixing

Plastic Scraper.
Tamping  Rod- A metal bar 25 mm square and 200 mm long.
Trowel- This shall have  a steel blade 100 to 150 mm in length with straight edges.
Flow Table – The standard table
Preparation of Moulds - The interior faces of the specimen moulds shall be thinly covered with mineral 
oil or light cup grease. After the moulds are assembled, excessive oil or grease shall be removed from the 
interior faces and the top and bottom surfaces of each mould. Moulds shall then be set on plane, non-
absorbent, non-corrodible and non-reactive base plates that have been thinly coated with mineral oil or 
light cup grease.
Preparation of Mortar -  The mortar shall be of the materials and proportions intended for use in the 
construction mixed to give a flow of 110 to 115. The mixing procedure for sample made in the laboratory 
shall be as given above.
Trial Mixing - Trial mortars shall be made with specified proportion of dry ingredients and adding 
different percentages of water until the specified flow is obtained. Each trial shall be made with fresh 
mortars. The mixing shall be done mechanically as described earlier.
The mixing of the ingredients shall be carried out at a temperature of 27 +2°C and all ingredients before 
mixing shall be brought to the same temperature.
The dry ingredients shall then be placed in the mixing bowl and mixed for 30 sec. Over the next 30 sec, 
while mixing, water shall be poured at a uniform rate into the bowl and the mixing shall be continued 
for 60 sec.    The mixer shall then be stopped and the paddle and sides of the bowl shall be cleaned down 
in about 15 sec with the plastic scraper. The bowl shall be covered with a damp cloth and the mortar be 
allowed to stand for a period of 10 min.
The mortar shall then be remixed for 60 sec.
When using lime putty, the procedure shall be as described above, except that the sand and lime putty 
shall be premixed by hand or in the mixer until the lime appears to be uniformly distributed.
Remixing of Mortars in the Laboratory - Samples of mortar received in the laboratory for testing shall 
be examined for any leakage or evaporation and segregation or bleeding of the liquid. The whole of the 
sample, with any liquid which has separated or has condensed inside the container, shall be transferred as 
completely as possible to an impermeable working surface and remixed, using a trowel, until it appears 
homogeneous.
The top of the flow table shall be carefully wiped clean, dried and the flow mould shall be placed at the 
centre. A layer of mortar about 25 mm in thickness and mixed in accordance with A-4.1.1 shall be placed 
in the mould and tamped 20 times with the tamping rod. The tamping pressure shall be just sufficient to 
ensure uniform filling of the mould. The mould shall then be filled to overflow with mortar and tamped, 
as specified for the first layer. The mortar shall be cut off plane and level with the top of the mould by 
drawing the straight edge of a trowel (held perpendicular to the mould) with a sawing motion across the 
top of the mould. The top of the table shall be wiped clean and dried, taking care to remove any water 
from around the edge of the flow mould. The mould shall then be lifted away from the mortar and the 
flow table shall be immediately dropped through a height of 12.5 mm, 25 times in 15 sec. The flow is the 
resulting increase in average base diameter of the mortar mass, measured on at least four diameter at 
approximately equispaced intervals expressed as a percentage of the original base diameter.

Test Specimens
Cubes - The mould as prepared shall be filled with the mortar to about half height and the layer compacted 
by tamping it with the tamping rod  in a uniform manner over the mortar surface in such a way as to 
produce full compaction of the mortar with neither segregation nor excessive laitance. The mould shall 
then be completely filled and the upper layer of the mortar compacted in a similar manner, after which the 
surface of the mortar shall be struck off plane and level with the top of the mould, using a trowel.
Curing and Storage of Test Specimens - The specimens shall be stored at a place free from vibration, either 
in moist air at a temperature of 27 ± 2°0 and relative humidity of not less than 90 percent or under damp 
sacks, matting or other suitable damp material covered completely with polyethylene or other similar 
impervious sheeting, at a temperature of 27 ± 2°C for 1 to 3 days, depending on the early strength of the 
mortar, from the time of adding the water to the other ingredients. The specimen shall then be marked 
for later identifications, removed from the moulds and stored in clean water until the time of test. The 
temperature of the storage water shall be 27 ± 2°C.
When cubes are made at site, records of the maximum and minimum air and water storage temperature 
shall be kept during the period, using maximum and minimum thermometres or continuous recording 
instruments. The cubes shall be sent to the testing laboratory when they are not less than 3 days nor more 
than 7 days old, well packed in damp sand or in wet sacks, and when necessary enclosed in polyethylene 
bag or sealed container, so that they arrive at the laboratory in a damp condition not less than 24 h before 
the time of test. On arrival at the testing laboratory, the cubes shall be stored in clean water maintained at 
a temperature of 27 ± 2°C until the time of test.
Number of Specimens - Three or more specimens shall be made for each period of test specified.
Procedure
The specimen shall be tested immediately on removal from the curing water in which it has been stored 
and while it is still in a wet condition. Any loose material shall be removed from the sides of the specimen. 
The dimensions of the specimen shall be noted before testing. The bearing surfaces of the testing machine 
shall be wiped clean and the specimen shall be placed in the machine in such a manner that the load shall 
be applied to opposite sides of the cube as cast, that is, not to the top and bottom.
The axis of the cube shall be carefully aligned with the centre of thrust of steel plates bearing the testing 
machine.  No packing other than auxiliary steel plates shall be used between the faces of the specimen and 
steel platens of the testing machine.
The load on the specimen shall be applied without shock and at a uniform rate of 2N/mm2 to 6N/mm2 per 
min until failure occurs.
The maximum load at failure shall be noted.
Calculation
The compressive strength shall be calculated as follows :

======================================================================
PAGE 187 of 300
======================================================================
144
Section-800
Standards IS : 10262-1982 and SP 23 ( S & T) – 1982 may be used. The mix so developed must be approved 
by the Executive Engineer in charge of works before use at site.
800.17	
Moisture Content of Coarse and Fine Aggregate
Purpose
The strength of concrete depends upon the amount of water present in it, hence the importance.
Procedure
Oven drying methods as described under the clause 301.7 shall be used for this purpose. The moisture 
content of aggregates can be determined separately for coarse and fine aggregates as well as for the 
combined aggregates.
800.18	
Cement Consumption
Purpose
Cement being a costly commodity, its consumption affects the total cost.
Procedure
Cement must be stored properly on wooden platforms, stacking not more than eight bags high and at 
least 450mm clear off the walls.  The contractor shall keep proper records in respect of type of cement, lot 
no., date of manufacture, manufacturer’s certificate regarding quality, test results, and its consumption on 
various works from time to time.
800.19  Workability of Concrete by Slump Test
This method of test may be used in the laboratory or during the progress of work in  the laboratory or 
during the progress of work in the field, for determining the consistency of concrete where the nominal 
maximum size of the aggregate does not exceed 38 mm.
Apparatus
Mould - The mould for test specimen shall be in the form of the frustum of a cone having the following 
internal dimensions :
	
Dimensions                          Cm
	
Bottom diameter                   20
	
Top diameter                         10
	
Height                                     30
The mould shall be constructed of metal (brass or aluminum shall not be used) of at least 1.6 mm (or 16 
BG) thickness and the top and bottom shall be open and at right angles to the axis of the cone. The mould 
shall have a smooth internal surface. It shall be provided with suitable foot pieces and also handles to 
facilitate lifting it from the moulded concrete test specimen in a vertical direction as required by the test. 
A mould provided with a suitable guide attachment may be used.
Sampling
In the case of concrete containing aggregate of maximum size more than 38 mm, screen the concrete 
through 1 ½ inch screen to exclude aggregate particles larger than 38 mm.



======================================================================
PAGE 188 of 300
======================================================================

Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads
Procedure
Clean thoroughly the internal surface of the mould so that it is free from superfluous moisture and any set 
concrete before commencing the test.   Place the mould on a smooth, horizontal, rigid and non- absorbent 
surface, such as a carefully leveled metal plate, the mould being firmly held in place while it is being filled. 
Fill the mould  in four layers, each approximately one – quarter of the height of the mould.  Each layer 
with twenty five strokes of the rounded end of the tamping rod.  The  strokes in a uniform manner over 
the cross-section of the mould and for the second and subsequent layers penetrate into the underlying 
layer.  The bottom layer shall be tamped throughout its depth. After the top layer has been rodded, the 
concrete shall be struck off level with a trowel or the tamping rod, so that the mould is exactly filled. Any 
mortar which may have leaked out between the mould and the base plate shall be cleaned away. The 
mould is removed from the  concrete immediately by raising it slowly and carefully in a vertical direction. 
This allows the concrete to subside and the slump shall be measured immediately by determining the 
difference between the height of the mould and that of the highest point of the specimen being tested. The 
above operations shall be carried out at a place free from vibration or shock, and within a period of two 
min after sampling.
Slump - The slump measured shall be recorded in terms of millimetres of subsidence of the specimen 
during the test. Any slump specimen which collapses or shears off laterally gives incorrect result and if 
this occurs the test shall be repeated with another sample. If, in the repeat test also, the specimen should 
shear, the slump shall be measured and the fact that the specimen sheared, shall be recorded.

This clause specifies a procedure for determining the workability of concrete, where the nominal maximum 
size of the aggregate does not exceed 38 mm. The test is designed primarily for use in the laboratory, but if 
circumstances permit, it may also be used in the field. It is more precise and sensitive than the slump test 
and is particularly useful for concrete mixes of very low workability as are normally used when concrete 
is to be compacted by vibration; such concrete may consistently fail to slump.
Procedure
The sample of concrete to be tested  gently in the upper hopper, using the hand scoop.  Fill the hopper 
with its brim and open the trap door so that the concrete falls into the lower hopper. Certain mixes have 
a tendency to stick in one or both of the hoppers. If this occurs, the concrete may be helped through 
pushing the rod gently into the concrete from the top. During this process, cover the cylinder by trowels. 
Immediately after the concrete has come to rest, the cylinder shall be un-covered, the trap-door of the 
lower hopper opened, and the concrete allowed to fall into the cylinder. The excess of concrete remaining 
above the level of the top of the ‘cylinder shall then be cut off by holding a trowel in each hand, with the 
plane of the blades horizontal, and moving them simultaneously one from each side across the top of the 
cylinder, at the same time keeping them pressed on the top of the cylinder. Wipe clean the outside of the 
cylinder.  The above operation shall be carried out at a place free from vibration or shock. . The weight 
of the concrete in the cylinder shall then be determined to the nearest 109 g. This weight shall be known 
as the weight of partially compacted concrete. The cylinder shall be refilled with concrete from the same 
sample in layers approximately 5 cm deep, the layers being heavily rammed or preferably vibrated so as 
to obtain full compaction. The top surface of the fully compacted concrete shall be carefully struck off level 
with the top of the cylinder.
Calculation
The compacting factor is defined as the ratio of the weight of partially compacted concrete to the weight

800.22   Curing of Concrete
Purpose
Curing is the process for preventing the loss of moisture from the concrete.  Prevention of moisture is 
necessary for concrete to develop strength.
Procedure
1.	
Start curing immediately after the compaction of concrete.
2.	
Use water which is good for construction (clause 2000.33)
3.	
Protect the concrete by covering with moist gunny bags, canvas, Hessian  or similar material.
4.	
Keep all exposed surface of concrete after 24 hours in a wet or damp condition by pounding or by 
covering with a layer of sacks, canvas, Hessian or similar material.
5.	
Keep the surface wet for a period of not less than 14 days from the date of placing of concrete. 
800.23  Schmidt’s  Rebound Hammer Test
Purpose
Rebound hammer test is used for assessing the likely compressive strength of concrete with the help of 
suitable correlation between rebound index and compressive strength and assessing the uniformity of 
concrete.



======================================================================

Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads
Method
1.	
For testing, smooth, clean and dry surface is to be selected. If  loosely adhering scale is present, this 
should be rubbed of with a grinding wheel or stone. Rough surfaces resulting from incomplete 
compaction,spalled or tooled surfaces do not give reliable results and should be avoided.
2.	
The point of impact should be at least 20 mm away from any edge or shape discontinuity.
3.	
For taking a measurement, the rebound hammer should be held at right angles to the surface of 
the concrete member. The test can thus be conducted horizontally on vertical surfaces or vertically 
upwards or downwards on horizontal surfaces. If the situation demands, the rebound hammer 
can be held at intermediate angles also, but in each case, the rebound number will be different for 
the same concrete.
4.	
Around each point of observation, six readings of rebound indices are taken and average of these 
readings after de!eting outliers becomes the rebound index for the point of observation.
5.	
The rebound numbers are influenced by a number of factors like types of cement and aggregate, 
surface condition and moisture content, age of concrete and extent of carbonation of concrete.
Acceptance Criterion
A correlation should be developed by simultaneously testing the two properties on the same sample and 
used for establishing acceptance criterion. As such, the estimation of strength of concrete by rebound 
hammer method cannot be held to be very accurate and probable accuracy of prediction of concrete 
strength in a structure is + 25 percent.

800.24  Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity
Purpose
Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity method is used to estimate the quality of in-situ concrete. The Ultrasonic pulse 
velocity of concrete is mainly related to its density and modulus of  elasticity.

Section-800
ULTRA SONIC PULSE VELOCITY TESTER
If the pulse velocity of concrete by cross probing is 3.0 km/sec or more, the concrete is of acceptable 
quality.  If the velocity is less than 3 km/sec, further investigations are called for.
Method
1.	
Take two transducers operating in the frequency range of 20 KHz to 150 KHz. Keep one transducer 
in contact with one end of concrete member and the other transducer with the other surface of the 
concrete member.
2.	
Measure the length L of the pole and also time taken T for the pulse to travel this distance.  Thus 
the average velocity = L/T
3.	
Use the following chart to get some idea about the quality of concrete; however, correlations 
developed at site are the best. The quality of concrete in terms of uniformity, incidence or absence 
of internal flaws, cracks and segregation, etc, indicative of the level of workmanship employed; 
can thus be assessed using the guidelines given in Table 800.24

4.	
The assessment of compressive strength of concrete from ultrasonic pulse velocity values is not 
adequate because the statistical confidence of  the correlation between ultrasonic pulse velocity

and the compressive strength of concrete is not very high. The reason is that a large number of 
parameters are involved, which influence the pulse velocity and compressive strength of concrete 
to different extents.
5.	
The estimated strength may vary from the actual strength by + 20 percent.
Reference IS: 13311 
800.25 Accelerated Curing Test of Concrete
Purpose
Normally, the strength of concrete is found out after 7 days and 28 days. For some construction activities, 
it may be too late and no need to know the strength earlier.
ACCELERATED CURING TANK
Tolerances
Tolerances can be specified depending upon the required strength of the concrete and its importance.
Method
1.	
Prepare the specimen and store it in moist air of at least 90% relative humidity and at a temperature 
of 27+2oC for 23 hrs + 15 minutes.
2.	
Lower the specimen, into a curing tank with water at 100 deg C and keep it totally immersed for 
3½ hours  + 5 minutes.
3.	
The temperature of water shall not drop more than 3oC after the specimens are placed and should 
return to boiling within 15 minutes.
4.	
After curing for 3 ½ hours + 5 minutes in the curing tank, the specimen shall be removed from the 
moulds and cooled by immersing in cooling water 27+2oC for a period of at least one hour.
5.	
The corresponding strength at 28 days can be found out from the following correlation. (It is 
however suggested that a new specific correlation should be developed for the specific concrete 
used at site.)
	
R28= strength at 28 days = 8.09 + 1.64 Ra
	
Where Ra = Accelerated Curing Strength in MPa. Reference IS : 9013

800.27 Flexural Strength of Concrete
Purpose
To determine the Flexural Strength of Concrete, which comes into play when a road slab with inadequate 
subgrade support is subjected to wheel loads and / or there are volume changes due to temperature / shrinking.
Procedure
Test specimens shall be prepared by moulding concrete to a beam section, curing and storing in accordance 
with standard procedure.  The section of the beam shall be  square of 100 mm or 150 mm.  The overall 
length of the specimen shall be 4d to 5d.  The ratio of d to the maximum particle size of aggregate shall be 
not less than three.
Circular rollers manufactured out of steel having cross section with diametre 38 mm will be used for 
providing support and loading points to the specimens.  The length of the rollers shall be at least 10 mm 
more than the width of the test specimen.  A total of four rollers shall be used, three out of which shall be 
capable of rotating along their own axes. The distance between the outer rollers (i.e span) shall be 3d and 
the distance between the inner rollers shall be d.  The inner rollers shall be equally spaced between the 
outer rollers, such  that the entire system is systematic.
The specimen stored in water at temperature 24oC to 30oC for 48 hrs before testing shall be tested 
immediately on removal from water; whilst they are still wet.  The test specimen shall be placed in the 
machine correctly centered with the longitudinal axis of the specimen at right angles to the rollers. For 
moulded specimens, the mould filling direction shall be normal to the direction of loading.
The load shall be applied slowly without shock at such a rate as to increase the stress at a rate of  7kg/sqcm 
per minute.

machine. The cores shall be tested as per IS : 516.



======================================================================
PAGE 226 of 300
======================================================================
183
Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads
The trial length shall satisfy surface levels and regularity; and demonstrate that the joint-forming 
methodology is satisfactory. The hardened concrete shall be cut over 3m width and reversed to inspect the 
bottom surface for any segregation taking place.
1501.19  Batching & Mixing of Materials
Purpose
The strength and durability of concrete depends upon the materials, their proportions, and proper mixing.
Procedure
It must be ensured that all batching is done by weight. Volume batching of aggregates may be permitted 
as a special case in small projects with the approval of the Engineer.
The system of weigh batching will be checked and its calibration carried out from time to time.
1501.20  Hot / Cold Weather Concrete including Compaction
Purpose
Proper precautions must be taken, if concreting is to be done in extreme weather conditions.
Procedure
No concreting shall be done when the concrete temperature is above 30oC measured at the point of placing 
and the ambient temperature is more than 35oC. Similarly in cold weather, no concreting shall be done 
when the concrete temperature is below 5oC and the temperature is descending.
1501.21  Compaction Equipment (Needle, Screed and Plate Vibrators) Purpose
For concrete to develop its desired properties, it is essential that its compaction is done properly. 
Procedure
The compaction of pavement is normally achieved by a vibrating screed supplemented by two internal 
vibrators. Vibrating screed may be supplemented by portable needle vibrator.
It may be ensured that proper compaction equipment is provided as per specifications and that the 
compaction activity is carried out for the specified duration.
1501.22   Separation Membrane  (Thickness and Laying) Purpose
A separation membrane usually of polythene sheet, is provided between the concrete slab and the sub- 
base.
Procedure
It must be checked whether the separation membrane to be provided is as per specifications, particularly 
with regard to its thickness and that it is laid without creases.
1501.25  Alignment of Joints

======================================================================
PAGE 227 of 300
======================================================================
184
Section-1500
Procedure
The alignment of joints shall be checked at the end of each days work and made sure that it is as per 
specifications.
1501.26  Depth of Dowel Bars
Purpose
Dowel bars are provided in joints.
Procedure
The depth at which dowel bars are provided will be as per specifications and drawings.
1501.27  Texturing and Edging
Purpose
The pavement surface is given a texture before it hardens so that is prevents skidding.
Procedure
Just before the concrete becomes non-plastic, the surface shall be textured with an approved long handled 
steel or fibre brush conforming to the stipulations laid down in IRC : 43.
After belting and / or texturing has been completed, but before the concrete has taken its initial set, the 
edges of the slab shall be carefully finished so as to leave the pavement edges smooth and true to line. The 
floating, finishing and edging etc. shall be done using a wooden / steel bridge with legs straddled apart 
so as not to touch the pavement.
1501.28  Pavement Thickness: As per drawings. A tolerance of ± 10 mm is permitted in thickness.
1501.29 Pavement width : As per drawings
1501.30  Transverse Contraction Joints
The Contraction joint shall consist of a mechanically sawn joint groove 3 mm to 5 mm wide and upto 
1/4 to 1/3 depth of the slab. The sawn joints shall be cut as soon as the concrete has undergone initial 
hardening and is strong enough to bear the weight of crew and the cutting machine. These joints shall 
be subsequently widened to 10 mm width and depth of 20 mm by appropriate saw to house the sealant. 
These joints shall be spaced 2.5 m - 3.75 m. The joints should be plugged on both the ends with pieces of 
synthetic tarfelt to prevent ingress of water from median/shoulder.
1501.30  Surface correction
While the concrete is still in the plastic stage, the surface shall be inspected for irregularities with a profile 
checking template and any needed correction made by adding or removing concrete followed by further 
compaction and finishing. As soon as practicable after the concrete has been compacted, its surface shall be 
smoothened by longitudinal float operated from the work bridge. The float shall be worked with a sawing 
motion, while held in a floating position parallel to the carriageway centre line and passed gradually from 
one side of the pavement to the other. Movements ahead along the centre line of the carriageway shall be 
in successive advances of not more than one half the length of the float.

Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads
1501.31  Concrete Core Density
Core density shall be taken after 28 days age of concrete. The homogeneity of Roller Compacted Concrete 
layer shall also be assessed from the cores. A minimum of three cores shall be taken from each day’s trial 
work. The average of three cores for the day shall be the core density for day’s work.
Four full depth cores of diameter at least 100 mm (2 cores for each day’s work) at 28 days will be cut by 
core cutting machine. The core shall be tested as per IS:516. The crushing strength of cores with height 
to diameter ratios between 1 and 2 may be corrected to corresponding standard cylinder of height to 
diameter ratio of 2 by multiplying with the correction factor obtained from the following equation:
	
	
f = 0.11 n + 0.78
	
where,  
	
	
f = correction factor 
	
	
n = height to diameter ratio
The concrete in the work represented by the core test shall be considered acceptable if the average 
equivalent cube strength of the cores is at least 85 percent of the cube strength (characteristic strength) of 
the grade of concrete specified for corresponding age and no individual core has a strength less than 75 
percent.

BRICKS
2000.1 Colour and Dimensional Check of bricks
Purpose
It is necessary to check the size and colour of bricks before using them.
Procedure
It should be seen that the bricks have a uniform colour and are free from cracks, organic matter and flows 
and nodules of free lime.  They should have rectangular faces with sharp corners and emit a ringing sound 
when struck.
The size should be as per local practice with tolerance of +5 percent.
2000.2 Water Absorption of Bricks
Purpose
Bricks which absorb more water than normal will produce weaker masonry, as they will make the mortar dry.



======================================================================

Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads
Procedure
Dry the specimen in a ventilated oven at a temperature of 105 to 115oC till it attains substantially constant 
mass.  Cool the specimen to room temperature  and obtain its weight M .  Do not use specimen which are 
warm to touch.
Immerse completely dried specimen in clean water at a room temperature of 27+ 2oC for 24 h. Remove 
the specimen and wipe out any traces of water with a damp cloth and weigh the specimen.  Complete the 
weighing 3 min after the specimen has been removed from water (M2). Water absorption, percent by mass 
after 24 hour immersion in cold water is given by the following formula
	
	
	
	
  M2  – M1

2000.3 Efflorescence of Bricks
Purpose
Bricks that show moderate to serious efflorescence are considered unfit for use in road structures.
Procedure
A shallow flat bottom dish of glass, porcelain or glazed stoneware and of size 180 mm x 180 mm X 40 
mm depth for square shaped and 200 mm dia X 40 mm depth for cylindrical shaped.containing sufficient 
distilled water to completely saturate the specimens is used for the test. Place the end of the bricks in the 
dish, the depth of immersion in water being 25 mm. Place the whole arrangement in a warm (between 
20oC and 30oC) well ventilated room until all the water in the dish is absorbed by the specimens and 
the surplus water evaporates. Cover the dish containing the brick with a suitable glass cylinder so that 
excessive evaporation from the dish may not occur. When the water has been absorbed and brick appears 
to be dry, place a similar quantity of water in the dish and allow it to evaporate as before. Examine the 
bricks for efflorescence after the second evaporation and report the results.
The liability to efflorescence shall be reported as ‘Nil’, ‘Slight’, ‘Moderate’, ‘Heavy’ or ‘Serious’ in 
accordance with the following definitions.

2000.4 Compressive Strength of Bricks
Purpose
The Compressive Strength of bricks broadly indicates the overall quality of   the raw material and its 
manufacturing process.
Procedure
Remove unevenness observed in the bed faces of bricks to provide two smooth and parallel faces by 
grinding. Immerse in water at room temperature for 24 h. Remove the specimen and drain out any surplus 
moisture at room temperature. Fill the frog and all voids in the bed face flush with cement mortar (1 
cement, clean coarse sand of grade 3 mm and down). Store under the damp jute bags for 24 h followed by 
immersion in clean water for 3 days. Remove and wipe out any traces of moisture.
Places the specimen with flat faces horizontal, and mortar filled face facing upwards between two 3 ply 
plywood sheets each of 3 mm thickness and carefully centered between plates of testing machine. Apply 
load axially at a uniform rate of 14 N/mm2 per minute till failure  occurs. Note the maximum load at 
failure. The load at failure is considered the maximum load at which the specimen fails to produce any 
further increase in the indicator reading on the testing machine. Observations are recorded in Form BR-3.

STONES
2000.5 Shape and Dimensions of Stones
Purpose
The quality and durability of stone masonry depends on the size and shape of stones besides other 
ingredients.
Procedure
The stone shall be hard, sound, free from defects like cavities, flaws, sand holes and patches of soft material. 
Stones shall conform to the requirements of IS : 1597 (Part 1).
The shape and dimensions of stones shall be checked before use.
2000.6 Water Absorption of Stones
Purpose
Water absorption shows the porosity of stones in one way. The more, it absorbs, the less it is durable.
Procedure
The test piece about 1 kg shall be washed to remove dust and immersed in distilled water in a glass vessel 
at a room temperature 20oC to 30oC for 24 h. Soon after immersion and again at the end of the soaking 
period, entrapped air shall be removed by gentle agitation. This will be done by rapid clock wise and anti 
clockwise rotation. The vessel shall then be emptied and test piece be allowed to drain. The test piece shall 
then be placed on a dry cloth and gently surface dried with the cloth. It shall be transferred to a second dry 
cloth when the first one removes no further moisture. It shall be spread out not more than one stone deep 
on the second cloth and left exposed to atmosphere away from direct sunlight or any other source of heat 
for less than 10 min  until it appears to be completely surface dry. The sample shall then be weighed (B).
The sample will be dried in an oven at 100 to 110oC for not less than 24 h. It shall then be cooled in 
a dessicator to room temperature and weighed (A) The water absorption shall be calculated  from the 
formula and shall be the average of three determinations.

2000.7 Dressing of Stones And Determination of Compressive Strength 
Purpose
The dressing of stone is done to bring them into the required shape and compressive strength is checked 
to know its strength to bear the load.
Procedure
The dressing of stones shall be  done as per the requirement and methods specified in IS : 1129 and 
compressive strength is calculated as mentioned below:
Test Pieces And Conditioning
1. 	
Test pieces shall be in the form of cubes or cylinders. They shall be cut or drilled from the samples. 
The diameter or lateral dimension (distance between opposite vertical faces) of a test piece shall 
not be less than 50 mm and the ratio of height to diameter or lateral dimension shall not be less 
than 1:1 
2. 	
The load-bearing surfaces shall be finished to as nearly true, parallel and perpendicular planes as 
possible by using rock cutting saws, grinding polishing wheels or abrasive powder. The dimensions 
of the faces under loading shall be measured to the nearest 0.2 mm.
3. 	
The load-bearing surfaces and the direction of the rift shall be carefully marked on each test piece 
after finishing.
4. 	
Three test pieces shall be used for conducting the test in each of the conditions mentioned below. 
In each of these conditions, separate tests shall be made for the specimen when the load is parallel 
to the rift and perpendicular to the rift. In all twelve test pieces shall be used.
5. 	
The test pieces shall be immersed in water maintained at 20 to 30°C for 72 h before testing and 
shall be tested in saturated condition.
6. 	
The test pieces shall also be tested in a dry condition and shall be dried in an oven at 105 ± 5°C for 
24 h and cooled in a desiccator to room temperature (20 to 30°C).
7.  	
The load shall be applied without shock and increased continuously at a rate of approximately 140 kg/
cm2 of the area per minute until the resistance of the test piece to the increasing load breaks down and 
no greater load is sustained. The maximum load applied to the test piece shall be recorded and the 
appearance of the stone and any unusual features in the type of failure shall be noted.
8. 	
The maximum load in kg supported by the test piece before failure occurs, divided by the area of 
the bearing face of the specimen in cm2 shall be taken as the compressive strength of the specimen.

BLOCKS
2000.8 Dimension
Purpose
To check the size of solid concrete Blocks because Concrete masonry building units shall be made in sizes 
and shapes to fit different construction needs.
Procedure

Air Permeability Method
1.	
This method is based on the relationship between the flow of air through the cement bed and the 
surface area of particles comprising the cement bed.  The cement bed is 1cm high and 2.5cm in 
diametre.
2.	
Knowing the density of cement, calculate the weight required to make a cement bed of porosity 
0.500 ( = 0.500 x ρx V where ρ – density of cement, V – volume).  Place this quantity of cement in 
the permeability cell in a standard manner.
3.	
Slowly pass on air through the cement bed at a constant velocity against the rate of air flow until 
flow metre shows a difference in level of 30-50cms.
4.	
Read the difference in level (h1) of manometre and the level of the flowmetre. Repeat these 
observations to ensure that steady conditions have been reached as shown by a constant h1/h2 value.

2000.13 Initial and Final Setting Time of Cement
Purpose
Cement, when used in construction, should set in a reasonable time. It should not set too early, so that it 
can be transported to the place where it is to be placed. Also it should not take too long for setting, so that 
the formworks can be removed and further work started.
Procedure
1.	
Prepare a neat cement paste by mixing the cement with 0.85 times the water required to give 
a paste of standard consistency, using potable or distilled water in the moist room where the 



======================================================================
PAGE 257 of 300
======================================================================

temperature should be maintained at  27 + 2 oC and Humidity should be more then 65%.
2.	
Start a stop watch at the instant when water is added to the cement.
3.	
Fill the Vicat mould with the cement  paste, the mould resting on a non-porous plate.
4.	
Fill the mould completely and smooth off the surface of the paste making it level with the top of 
the mould.
5.	
Lower the needle  gently until it comes in contact with the surface of the test block and quickly 
release, allowing it to penetrate into the test block.
6.	
In the beginning,  the needle will completely pierce the block.  Repeat this procedure until the 
needle fails to pierce the block beyond 5.0 + 0.5 mm measured from the bottom of the mould.
7.	
The period elapsing between the time when water  is added to the cement and the time at which 
the needle fails to pierce the test block to a point 5.0 + 0.5 mm measured from the bottom , is called 
shall be the initial setting time.
Final Setting time
1.	
Replace the needle  by the annular attachment.
2.	
The cement shall be considered as finally set when, upon applying the needle    gently to the 
surface of the test block, the needle makes an impression, thereon, while the attachment   fails to 
do so.
3.	
The period elapsing between the time when water is added to the cement and the time when 
cement is finally set as indicated above, shall be the final setting time.
4.	
In the event of a scum forming on the surface of the test block, use the underside of the block for 
the determination.
5.	
The results of initial and final setting time shall be reported nearest to 5 minutes.

2000.14 Soundness of Cement
Purpose
The testing of soundness of cement is done to ensure that the cement does not show any appreciable 
subsequent expansion. The non soundness of cement is due to the presence of excess of lime, excess of 
magnesia or excessive proportion of sulphates.

LE-CHATELIER MOULD
Procedure
Requirements
Soundness of cement can be determined by two methods, namely Le-Chatelier method and Autoclave 
method.  The unaerated cement should not have an expansion of more than 10 mm and 0.8 percent 
respectively when tested by the two methods.  In the event of cements failing to comply with any or both 
the requirements mentioned above, further tests would be undertaken on another portion of the same 
sample after aeration. Aeration shall be done by spreading out the sample to a depth of 75 mm at a relative 
humidity of 50 to 80% for a total of 7 days. The expansion of cements 80% aerated shall be not more than 
5 mm and 0.6% when tested by Le-Chatelier and Autoclave method respectively.
Method 1: Le-Chatelier Method
1.	
Prepare a cement paste by gauging cement with 0.78 times the water required to give a paste of 
standard consistency.
2.	
Oil the mould lightly.  Keep it on a lightly oiled glass plate and fill up the mould with cement paste.
3.	
Cover the mould with another piece of lightly oiled glass sheet and immediately submerge the 
whole assembly in water at 27 ± 2oC and keep it there for 24 h.
4.	
Measure the distance separating the indicator points.  Submerge the mould again in water and 
bring it to boil in 25-30 minutes.  Keep it boiling for 3 hours.  Remove the mould from water and 
allow it to cool.
5.	
Measure the distance between the indicator points. Difference between two measurements gives 
the expansion of cement. The mean of the two values should be reported to the nearest 0.5mm to 
represent the expansion of the Cement.

Permissible value 10 mm
Method 2 : Autoclave Method
1.	
A cement paste shall be made with 500g of cement and sufficient water to give standard consistency.
2.	
A mould of 25 mm x 25 mm size and internal length of 282 mm shall be thinly oiled; and filled 
with cement paste in two layers; compacting with thumb or forefingers by pressing the paste into 
corners.  After compacting the top layer, flush it with a trowel.
3.	
Remove the specimen from the mould after 24 ± 0.5 h and place it in the autoclave at room 
temperature in a rack so that the four sides of each specimen are exposed to saturated steam.
4.	
Initially the air will be allowed to escape from the autoclave by keeping the vent valve open. The 
valve shall be closed when the steam begins to escape and the gauge pressure of autoclave allowed 
to reach 2.1 MPa in about 1 to 1.25 h from the time the heat is turned on.
5.	
Maintain the pressure of 2.1 ± 0.1 MPa for 3 hours. Shut off the heat supply and allow it to cool at 
a rate such that pressure comes down to 0.1 MPa at the end of one hour. Any pressure remaining 
shall be released.
6.	
Open the autoclave and immediately  keep the test specimen in water, the temperature of which 
is above  90oC. The water surrounding the specimens is cooled at a uniform rate to 27 ± 2oC in 15 
min. The temperature of water is then maintained at 27 ± 2oC for 15 min.
7.	
Take  the specimens out of water, make them surface dry and measure their lengths.
8.	
The difference in lengths of the test specimen before and after autoclaving shall be calculated to 
the nearest 0.01 percent of the effective gauge length which is the length between the innermost 
points of the metal inserts used as reference points shall be reported as the autoclave expansion of 
the cement. A contraction (negative expansion) shall be indicated by prefixing a minus sign to the 
percentage expansion reported.

2000.15 Compressive Strength of Cement
Purpose
The compressive strength of hardened cement is the most important property as it controls the mix 
design. Strength tests are not conducted on neat cement paste because of difficulties of excessive shrinkage 
and subsequent cracking. Strength of cement is therefore found indirectly, by testing cement mortar in a 
specific proportion.

HAND OPERATED COMPRESSION TESTING MACHINE 
Procedure
1.	
Take 200 g of Cement and 600 g of Standard Sand (Ennore) in a non-porous enamel tray and mix 
them at Temperature 27± 2oC  of the test room with a trowel for one minute, then add water equal 
to (P/4  + 3.5) percent of combined weight of   cement and sand and mix the three ingredients 
thoroughly until the mixture is of uniform colour.  The time of mixing should not be less than 3 
min and not more then 4 minutes. If time of mixing exceeds 4minutes then this sample should be 
rejected and fresh sample should be prepared.
2.	
Immediately after mixing, the mixture is filled into a cube mould of 7.06 cm; the area of each face 
being 50 sq.cm.
3.	
Compact the mortar either by placing it on the vibrationing table for two minutes at the specified 
speed of 12000 ±  400 vibrations per min.
4.	
Keep the compacted cube in the mould at a temperature of 27 oC ± 2 oC and at  least 90 percent 
humidity for 24 h.
5.	
At the end of 24 h, remove the moulds and immediately submerge them in clean fresh water which 
should be renewed after every 7 days and its temperature should be maintained 27 oC ± 2 oC and 
keep them there until taken out just before conducting the test.
6.	
Test three cubes for compressive strength for each period of curing after 3 days , 7 days and 28 
days.  The cubes shall be tested on their sides without any packing.  The rate of loading shall be 35 
N/mm2 per min.
7.	
The compressive strength is calculated by dividing the maximum load applied to the cubes during 
the test divided by the cross sectional area calculated from the mean dimensions of the section and 
shall be expressed to the nearest 0.5 N/mm2.

2000.16  Lime Reactivity
Purpose
This method of test covers the procedure for determining the reactivity of the pozzolanic material with 
hydrated lime, as represented by compressive strength of standard mortar test cubes prepared and tested 
under specific conditions.
Size and Number of Test Specimens - The tests specimen shall be 50 mm cubes. At least three specimens 
shall be made for each period of test specified.
Apparatus
Cube Moulds - Mould for the 50 mm cube specimens shall be of metal not attacked by cement-pozzolana 
or lime-pozzolana mortar and there shall be sufficient strength and stiffness to prevent spreading and 
wrapping. The moulds shall be rigidly constructed in such a manner as to facilitate the removal of the 
moulded specimen without damage. The moulds shall be machined so that when assembled ready for use 
the dimensions and internal faces shall be accurate to the following limits:
The height of the moulds and the distance between the opposite faces shall be 50 ± 0.1 mm for new moulds, 
and 50 ± 0.5 mm for moulds in use. The angle between adjacent interior faces and bet-ween interior faces 
and top and bottom planes of the mould shall be 90 ± 0.5 degrees. The interior faces of the moulds shall be 
plane surfaces with a permissible variation of 0.02 mm for new moulds and 0.05 mm for moulds in use. 
Each mould shall be provided with a base plate having a plane surface machined to a tolerance of 0.1 mm 
and made of non-absorbent and non-corrodable material. The base plate shall be of such dimensions as to 
support  the mould during the filling without leakage.
Preparation of Moulds - The interior faces of the specimen moulds shall be thinly covered with mineral oil 
or light cup grease. After assembling the moulds, excessive oil or grease shall be removed from the interior 
faces and the top and bottom surfaces of each mould. Moulds shall then be set  on plane, non- absorbent 
base plates that have been thinly coated with mineral  oil, or light cup grease.
Preparation of Mortar - Clean appliances shall be used for mixing. The temperature of the water and that 
of the test room at the time when the mixing operation is being performed shall be from 27°C ± 2oC
The dry materials of the standard test mortar shall be lime : pozzolana : standard sand in proportion 1 :

Section-2000
The amount of water for gauging shall be equal to that required to give a flow of 70 ± 5 percent with 10 
drops in 6 sec (as determined by the procedure given below)
The following quantities of materials are suggested for preparation of mortar:
	
150 g	 	
Hydrated lime
	
300 x Mg	
Pozzolana
	
1350 g	 	
Standard sand
These quantities will suffice for preparing six test specimens.
Determination of Flow
Trial mixing - With dry material as given above, make mortars with different percentages of water until 
specified flow is obtained. Make each trial with fresh mortar. The mixing shall be done mechanically by 
means of mixing apparatus.   Place the dry paddle and the dry bowl in the mixing position in the mixer. 
Then introduce the materials for batch into the bowl and mix in the following, manner:
(a)	
Place all the mixing water in the bowl.
(b)	
Add the pozzolanic mixture to the water, then start the mixer and mix at the slow speed (140 ± 5 
rev/min) for 30 sec.
(c)	
Add the entire quantity of sand slowly over a period of 30 sec,  while mixing at slow speed. (d) 
Stop the mixer, change to medium speed (285 ± 10 rev/min),  and, mix for 30 sec.
(e)	
Stop the mixer, and let the mortar stand for one and a half min. During the first 15 sec of this 
interval, quickly scrape down into the batch any mortar that may have collected on the side of the 
bowl, then for the remainder of this interval, cover that bowl with the lid.
(f)	
Finish by mixing for one minute at medium speed (285 ± 10 rev/min).
(g)	
In any case requiring a remixing interval, any mortar adhering to    the side of the bowl shall be 
quickly scraped down into a batch with the scraper prior to remixing.
Upon the completion of mixing, the mixing paddle shall be shaken to remove excess mortar into the 
mixing bowl.
Carefully wipe the flow-table top clean and dry and place the mould at the centre. Place a layer of mortar 
about 25 mm in thickness in the mould and tamp 20 times with the tamping rod. The tamping pressure 
shall be first sufficient to ensure uniform filling of the mould. Then fill the mould with mortar and tamp as 
specified for the first layer. Cut off the mortar to a plane surface flush with the top of the mould by drawing 
the straight edge of a trowel (held nearly perpendicular to the mould) with a sawing motion across the top 
of the mould. Wipe the table top clean and dry, particularly taking care to remove any water from around 
the edge of the flow mould. Lift the mould away  from the mortar one minute after completing the mixing 
operation. Im-mediately drop the table through a height of 12.5 mm ten times in 6 sec.
The flow is the resulting increase in average base diametre of the mortar mass, measured on at least four 
diametres at approximately equi-spaced intervals expressed as a percentage of the original base diametre.
The materials for each batch of moulds shall be mixed separately using the quantities of dry materials, 
conforming to the proportions specified and the quantity of water as determined. Mixing of mortar shall 
be done mechanically as described.

Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads
Moulding Test Specimen - Immediately following the preparation of the mortar place the mortar in a 50 mm 
cube mould in a layer of about 25 mm thickness and tamp 25 times with the tamping rod. The tamping shall 
be just sufficient to ensure uniform filling of the mould. Then fill the mould to overflow and tamp as specified 
for the first  layer. On the completion of the tamping, the tops of all cubes shall extend slightly above the tops 
of the moulds. Cut off the mortar to a plane surface flush with the top of the mould by drawing the straight 
edge of a trowel (held nearly perpendicular to the mould) with a sawing motion across the top of the mould.
Storage and Curing of  Specimens – Cover  the surface of the spe-cimen in the mould with a smooth and 
greased glass plate. Keep the specimens with the moulds along with the cover plates under wet gunny 
bags for 48 hour. Then remove the specimens from the moulds and cure at 90 to 100 percent relative 
humidity at 50°C ± 2oC  for a period of eight days. Samples shall not be cured under water.
Note - This may be achieved by keeping the specimens in a one liter capacity wide mouth jar with screwed 
lid over a galvanised iron sheet platform placed at bottom of the jar. The platform is covered with a piece 
of paper. Water is kept to a depth of about 10 mm at the bottom, below the level of the platform. After 
placing the specimen fitting the lid, the jar is sealed with insulation tape and kept in an incubator adjusted 
for 50° ± 2°C for eight days.
Procedure for Test - Remove the specimens after curing for eight days in the incubator as described above 
and test for compressive strength after, they reach the room temperature. Test not less than three cubes. 
The cubes shall be tested on their sides without any packing between the cube and steel platens on the 
testing machine. One of the platens shall be carried on a ball and shall be self-adjusting, and the load shall 
be steadily and uniformly applied, starting from zero and at a rate of 35 kg/cm2/min.
Calculation - Calculate the compressive strength from the crushing load and the average area over which 
the load is applied. Express the result nearest to 1 kg/cm2.
Faulty Cubes and Retests - Cubes that are manifestly faulty or that give strength differing by more than 15 
percent from the average value of  all test specimens, made from the same sample and tested at the same 
period, shall not be considered in determining the compressive strength.  After  discarding such cubes, if 
less than two strength test values are left for determining the compressive strength at any given period, a 
retest shall be made.

Lime
Lime when used as a part of composite mortar shall conform to the specifications of class A and B of IS: 
712. The main Physical requirements to be conformed are Fineness ( IS: 6932, Pt-4) ,Residue on Slaking 
(IS: 6932, Pt-3),Setting time( IS: 6932, Pt-11), Compressive strength( IS: 6932, Pt-7), Soundness, Le Chatelier 
expansion (IS: 6932, Pt-9)	
2000.17 Purity of Lime (Determination of Total Calcium Oxide in Lime) Purpose
The lime should have a purity of at least 50% by weight of CaO when tested as follows:
Procedure
1.	
Take one gram of powdered lime, accurately weighed, in a platinum crucible. Place it in an oven 
maintained at 105 ± 2oC until, on cooling and weighing, constant mass is obtained.
2.	
Heat the crucible first gently and then ignite in a muffle furnace at 1000oC. Cool the crucible in a 
desiccator and weigh to a constant mass.

Section-2000
3.	
Transfer the ignited lime, to a beaker, add 50 ml of water and mix well, add 10 to 15 ml of 
concentrated hydrochloric acid, and boil for 15 min. Filter, wash with hot water, ignite and weight 
to constant mass.
4.	
To the filtrate, add concentrated hydrochloric acid, if necessary, in sufficient amount to make 
the total amount equivalent to 10 to 15 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Add a few drops of 
nitric acid and boil. Dilute to 200-250 ml. Add slight excess of ammonium hydroxide and keep 
just below the boiling point until the odour of ammonia is barely perceptible.  Filter off the iron 
and aluminium hydroxide while hot, collecting the filtrate in a 250 ml volumetric flask. Wash 
with hot water. Ignite the residue in a platinum crucible, blast, cool in a desiccators and weigh as 
aluminium oxide and ferric oxide. Make up the filtrate to 250 ml.
5.	
Pipette out 50 ml of the filtrate in a beaker and dilute to 100 ml.  Heat to boiling and add slowly 
about 35 ml of boiling ammonium oxalate solution. Continue boiling for 2 or 3 min and allow the 
precipitated calcium oxalate to settle for half an hour.
6.	
Filter the precipitated calcium oxalate through filter paper. Wash thoroughly with small portions 
of dilute ammonium hydroxide (1 N) and then with hot water until the washing do not decolourise 
a hot dilute potassium permanganate solution in the presence of dilute sulphuric acid.
7.	
Puncture the filter paper and transfer the precipitate to the beaker already used for precipitation 
with a fine jet of hot water. Add abut 50 ml of dilute sulphuric acid, heat to 60oC and titrate 
with standard potassium permanganate solution with constant stirring. Towards the end of the 
titration, introduce the filter paper which was used for filtration into the titration vessel and carry 
out the titration till the end point is reached.
8.	
Carry out a blank with all reagents following the procedure as outlined for this method.  In the 
case of magnesium limes, decant through a filter paper, redissolve the  calcium oxalate in the 
beaker and in the filter paper with dilute hydrochloric acid and wash the filter paper four times 
with hot water and finally with dilute ammonium hydroxide (5 N) in a slight excess and proceed 
as before.  For the second filtration, use the same filter paper as was used before.
9.	
If it is desired to complete the analysis in as short a time as possible, a portion of 50 ml of the 
filtrate from the ferric and aluminium oxide determination should be precipitated in the usual 
way with excess of ammonium oxalate. Boil for about 5 min and let the calcium oxalate settle 
clear.  Decant through a qualitative filter paper and cool the filtrate (with ice water if possible). 
Add diammonium hydrogen phosphate solution in large excess and 5 to 10  ml of ammonium 
hydroxide solution. Stir rapidly with rubber ‘policeman’. From the amount of precipitate thus 
formed, one can judge whether the lime contains sufficient magnesium oxide to require a double 
precipitate or not.  For accurate work, if there is more than a slight amount of magnesium oxide, a 
double precipitation should be carried out, using a fresh 50  ml aliquot.

impurities, particularly when there is not much flow in the river. The organic matters interface with 
the setting action of cement and the bond characteristics of aggregates.   Moss and algae results in air 
entrainment reducing its strength; excessive silt and clay result in greater water requirement, increased 
shrinkage and increased permeability.
Procedure
1.	
Organic Impurities
	
Mix the soil sample with 3% solution of Sodium hydroxide in water.  Keep it for 24 h and compare 
the color development with a standard color chart. If the color of sample is darker than the standard 
color, organic impurities are more than permissible, and either the sample should be rejected or 
corrective measures taken.
2.	
Clay, Fine silt and Fine Dust **
	
a. Pour a sample of aggregate into a graduated measuring jar containing water and rod the 
aggregate nicely to remove the particles of clay and silt adhering to aggregate particles.
	
b. Shake the jar so that all the clay and silt particles get mixed with water and keep it in undisturbed 
condition.
	
c. Measure the thickness of layer of clay and silt standing over the fine aggregate particles to 
calculate the percentage of clay and silt in the sample of aggregate.
	
d. The limits of deleterious material as given in IS : 383 1970 are given below. Please note that the 
sum of the percentages of all the deleterious material should not exceed 5.

Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads
Procedure
Three edge bearing test shall be performed when the pipe is surface dry.  The test specimen shall be 
tested in a machine so designed  that a crushing force may be exerted in a true vertical plane through one 
diameter  and extending the full length of the barrel of the pipe but excluding the sockets, if any
Any mechanical or hand powered device may be used in which the head that applies the load moves at such 
a speed as to increase the load at  a uniform rate of approximately 20 percent of the expected crushing load 
per linear meter per min. The loading device shall be calibrated within an accuracy of ±2 percent.  The testing 
machine used for the load tests should produce a uniform deflection throughout the length of the pipe( Fig.11).
The lower bearing block shall consist of two hardwood or hard rubber strips fastened to a wooden or steel 
beam or direct to a concrete base, which shall provide sufficient rigidity to permit application of maximum 
load without appreciable deflection. Wooden or rubber strips shall be straight,have a cross-section of not less 
than 50 mm in width and not less than 25 mm nor more than 40 mm in height and shall have the top inside 
corners rounded, to a radius of approximately 15 mm. The interior vertical sides of the strips shall be parallel 
and spaced apart a distance of not more than 1/12th of the specimen diameter but in no rase less than 25 mm. 
The bearing faces of the bottom strips shall not vary from a straight line vertically or horizontally by more 
than 1 mm in 375 mm of the length under load. About 6 mm thick hard rubber or felt should be placed/fixed 
at the lower face of the upper wooden block which shall come in contact with the surface of the pipe.
The upper bearing shall be a rigid hardwood block or a block with hard rubber facing at least 150 mm x 150 
mm in cross section. After placing the specimen in the machine on the bottom strips, the top bearing shall be 
symmetrically aligned in the testing machine. Load shall be applied at the rate indicated above until either the 
formation of 0.25 mm wide crack or ultimate strength load, as may be specified, has been reached.  The 0.25 
mm crack load is the maximum load applied to the pipe before a crack having a width of 0.25 mm measured 
at  close intervals, occurs throughout a length of 300 mm or more.  The crack shall be considered 0.25 mm in 
width when the point of the measuring gauge penetrates 1.5 mm at close intervals throughout the specified 
distance of 300 mm. The ultimate load will be reached when the pipe will sustain no greater load.

Section-2000
The crushing strength in Newton per linear meter of pipe shall be calculated by dividing the total load 
on the specimen by the nominal laying length. Effective length of the pipe shall be taken as the nominal 
laying length of the specimen.
2000.39 Hydrostatic Test
1. Test Specimen 
The specimens for determination of leakage under internal hydrostatic pressure shall be sound and full-
size pipe
2. Procedure
a.	
The pipe shall be supported in such a way so that the longitudinal axis is approximately horizontal 
and the exterior surface excepting the supports can be examined readily. 
b.	
The specimen shall be filled with water and the air expelled. Pressure shall be applied at a gradual 
rate until the specified test pressure is reached, or beads of water on the pipe surface is seen, 
whichever occurs first.
c.	
Pressure shall be maintained for1min ± 30 s for each 10 mm of wall thickness, or for twice that entire 
period if the application of pressure resulted in the formation of beads of water on the pipe surface.
d.	
If the test pressure has been reached without the beads of water growing or running, the test 
pressure shall be maintained constant for 1 min ± 30 s for each 10 mm of wall thickness. At the end 
of the holding period the pressure shall be released immediately.
2000.40 Absorption Test
1. Test Specimen 
Each specimen selected at random shall have a square area of 100 cm2 ± 10 percent of the length of the 
pipe as measured on surface of the pipe, and a thickness equal to the full depth of the pipe thickness and 
shall be free from visible cracks.
2. Procedure
a.	
Specimens shall be dried in a mechanical convection oven at a temperature of 105°C to 115°C until 
two successive weighings at intervals of not less than 8 h show an increment of loss not greater 
than 0.1 percent of the mass of the specimen. The drying time shall be not less than 36 h. The dry 
mass of the specimen shall be the mass after the final drying determined at ambient temperature.
b.	
After drying and weighing as specified above the specimens shall be immersed in clean water at 
room temperature for the specified period. The specimens shall then be removed from the water 
and allowed to drain for not more than one minute. The superficial water shall then be removed 
by absorbent cloth or paper and the specimens weighed immediately.
c.	
The least count/accuracy of the weighing balance shall be 0.1 g which the test specimen shall be 
weighed.
3. Calculation and Report
The increase in mass of the specimen over its dry mass shall be taken as the absorption of the specimen 
and shall be expressed as a percentage of the dry mass. The results shall be reported separately for each 
specimen.

2000.41	   Permeability Test
1. Procedure
The dry surface of the pipe shall be scrapped by wire brush and loose particles, if any, removed. Sealant 
shall then be applied to the lower portion of the cup and shall be pressed on the pipe. The water shall then 
be filled in the cup with wash bottle after hardening of the sealant. The glass tube with cork shall then be 
fixed in the cup as shown in Fig. Water in the tube shall then be filled using wash bottle and air shall be 
allowed to escape during filling. Precaution shall be taken so that water does not leak either from cup ends 
or from rubber stopper. Water shall be filled up to zero mark and reading taken at every half- hour interval 
up to 2 hours. On each pipe, simultaneously three tests shall be done immediately after curing of coating 
is completed as shown in Fig. 12    .
FIG :12 PERMEABILITY TEST
2. Initial Absorption
The drop of water level in the stand pipe at the end of 2 h is initial absorption. The difference in any two 
readings shall not be more than 0.8 cm3.
3. Final Permeability
Fill the water in the stand pipe again up to the mark and take readings at half-hour interval up to 4 
hours. Absorption in the fourth hour, that is, difference between fourth and third reading is the final 
permeability. The average reading of three tests conducted on a pipe shall be expressed in cm3 and this 
shall not exceed 0.3 cm3.

2000.42    Straightness Test
1. Procedure
A rigid straight edge, made into a gauge of the form and dimension shown in Fig.13   shall be placed in the 
bore of the pipe with edge X in contact with the pipe internal surface and/or the line parallel to the pipe 
axis. Hold the plane of the gauge in a radial plane.
FIG :13     STRAIGHTNESS TEST
If both ends of the gauge, when so placed are in contact with the internal surface of the pipe, the deviation 
from straightness is excessive. If this condition occurs at any one of four different positions of the gauge. 
Approximately equally spaced around the pipe circumference the pipe does not comply with the particular 
requirement.
If both ends of the gauge, when used as described above, are not in contact with the internal surface 
of the pipe at both ends, the gauge shall be reversed so that edge Y, placed as above, is adjusted to the 
internal surface of the pipe. If the two studs in edge Y cannot be made to touch the surface of the pipe 
simultaneously, the deviation from the straightness is excessive.
If this condition occurs at any four position of the gauge the pipe does not conform with this particular 
requirements.
Note :  The number of test specimens and the method of their selection shall be in accordance with the 
specification for the type of pipe being tested as per IS 458.
Reference IS : 3597.

1. FIELD CBR BY Dynamic Cone Penteration Test  (DCPT)                                                                                                                      
Purpose
To determine the CBR of existing subgrade using Dynamic Cone Penteration Test equipment .
Procedure
1.	
The underlying principle of the DCP is that the rate of penetration of the cone, when driven by 
a standard force, is inversely related to the strength of the material as measured by. Where the 
pavement layers have different strengths, the boundaries between the layers can be identified and 
the thickness of the layers determined.
2.	
The instrument is held vertical and the weight carefully raised to the handle. Care should be taken 
to ensure that the weight is touching the handle, but not lifting the instrument, before it is allowed 
to drop and that the operator lets it fall freely and does not lower it with his hands. If during the 
test the DCP tilts from the vertical, no attempt should be made to correct this as contact between 
the shaft and the sides of the hole will give rise to erroneous results. If the angle of the instrument 
becomes worse, causing the weight to slide on the hammer shaft and not fall freely, the test should 
be abandoned.
3. 	
It is recommended that a reading should be taken at increments of penetration of about 10 mm. 
However it is usually easier to take readings after a set number of blows It is therefore necessary to 
change the number of blows between readings according to the strength of the layer being penetrated. 
For good quality granular roadbases readings every 5 or 10 blows are normally satisfactory but for 
weaker sub-base layers and subgrade readings every 1 or 2 blows may be appropriate.

2. ROUGHNESS SURVEY BY FIFTH WHEEL BUMP INTEGRATOR
Purpose
To determine the unevenness in the pavement surface that adversely affect the riding quality of a vehicle.
Procedure
Automatic Road Unevenness Recorder comprises of a trailer of single wheel with a pneumatic type 
mounted on chaise over which are installed profile recording and integrating devices. The equipment 
records the displacement of the vehicle chassis relative to the rear axle per unit distance traveled

Appendix
designated as Bump value, (D) in mm and expressed as Unevenness Index (UI) mm/km. 
The machine has panel board fitted with two nos. of electronic counters for counting the unevenness 
index value. The digital meter for unevenness index ranges from 100 mtrs to 1000 mtrs. For automatic 
displaying of UI values Data Storage in memory to display on panel board. The operating speed of the 
machine is 32±1 KM/Hr, and is towed by a vehicle. Its wheel on the pavement surface and the vertical 
reciprocating motion of the axle is converted into unidirectional rotatory motion by the integrator unit; 
the accumulation of this unidirectional motion is recorded by operating sensor inserted in the circuit of 
electronic counter once for every one centimeter of accumulated unevenness. Unevenness index values 
are obtained from the roughness survey. The interval for recording UI values is 100mts.
In general roughness Survey is conducted for the following reasons.
•	
Degree of surface finish or the riding quality of the road can be assessed
•	
Surface irregularities of highways can be immediately attended for rectification
Roughness Test Analysis and Results
The raw Bump Integrator counts obtained are converted into calibrated roughness index (Unevenness 
Index – UI). Since, each vehicle responds differently to unevenness due to its own unique springs 
and shock absorber and change over time and wear, the equipment was calibrated to obtain standard 
Unevenness Index using Merlin equipment.
Where,
UI = Corrected Unevenness Index expressed in mm/km
