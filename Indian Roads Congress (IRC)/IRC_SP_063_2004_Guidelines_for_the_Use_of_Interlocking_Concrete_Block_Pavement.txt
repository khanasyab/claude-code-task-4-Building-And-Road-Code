The draft was discussed by the Highways Specifications and Standards Committee during its
meeting held on the 22nd May, 2004 and the draft was approved subject to modifications in light of
the comments made by
its members. The modified document as received from the Convenor, H-5
Committee was placed before the Executive Conmiittee in its meeting held on 25th May, 2004. The
Executive Committee considered the Guidelines for being placed before the Council. The Council in
its 172nd Meeting held at Nainital (Uttaranchal) on the 12th June, 2004 approved the document for
publication subject to modification in light of the comments/suggestions given by the participants.
The document has been modified suitably by Dr. L.R. Kadiyali, Convenor, H-5 Committee.
1. SCOPE
Interlocking Concrete Block Pavements have been extensively used in a number of countries
for quite sometime. Considering their advantages and potential for use, the guidelines have been
prepared for the design and construction of such pavements, giving the suggested applications, design
catalogues, construction practices and specifications for their use.
2. APPLICATIONS

2.2.
Advantages and Limitations of Interlocking Concrete Block Pavements.
2.2.1.
Advantages
(i)
Since the blocks are prepared in the factory, they are of a very high quality, thus avoiding
the difficulties encountered in quality control in the field.
(ii)
Concrete block pavements restrict the speed of vehicles to about 60 km per hour, which
is an advantage in city streets and intersections.
(iii)
Because of the rough surface, these pavements are skid-resistant.
(iv)
The block pavements are ideal for intersections where speeds have to be restricted and
cornering stresses are high.
(v)
The digging and reinstatement of trenches for repairs to utilities is easier in the case of
block pavement.
(vi)
These pavements are unaffected by the spillage of oil from vehicles, and are ideal for
bus stops, bus depots and parking areas.
(vii)
They are preferred in heavily loaded areas like container depots and ports as they can
be very well designed to withstand the high stresses induced there.
(viii)
In India, the laying of concrete block pavements can be achieved at a low cost because
of the availability of cheap labour.
(ix)
Since the concrete blocks are grey in colour, they reflect light better then the black
bituminous pavements, thus bringing down the cost of street lighting.
(x)
The cost of maintenance is much lower than a bituminous surface.
(xi)
Block pavement does not need in-situ curing and so can be opened to traffic soon after
completion of construction.
(xii)
Construction of block pavement is simple and labour-intensive, and can be done using
simple compaction equipment.
(xiii)
Maintenance of block pavement is simple and easy. Also, the need for frequency of
maintenance is low as compared to bituminous pavement.
(xiv)
Structurally round blocks can be recycled many times over.
(xv)
Unlike concrete pavements, block pavement does not exhibit very deterioratory effect
due to thermal expansion and contraction, and are free from the cracking phenomenon.
(xvi)
Use of permeable block pavement in cities and towns can help replenish depleting
underground sources of water, filter pollutants before they reach open water sources,
help reduce storm water runoff and decrease the quantum of drainage structures.
2.2.2.
Limitations
(i)
Concrete block pavements cannot be used for high speed facilities.
(ii)
The riding quality is reasonably good for low-speed traffic, but is inferior to that observed
on a machine laid bituminous or concrete pavement.
-

======================================================================
IRC:SP:63-2004
(iii)
The noise generated is high, 5-8 dB (A) higher than bituminous surfaces.
—
(iv)
A very good attention to pavement drainage
is needed because the water can seep
through the joints.
3. TYPES AND SHAPES OF BLOCKS
The blocks can be interlocking horizontally and vertically, as shown in Fig
1.
Present day interlocking blocks have evolved in shape after observing their performance. The
three phases in the evolution of the shape of the blocks are shown in Fig. 2.
The rectangular shape shown in Fig. 2(i) is the shape which was intended for imitating the
stone set blocks. The shape shown in Fig. 2(ii) is an improved version with many dentated faces for
better contact between adjoining blocks thus enhancing the interlocking effect and friction between
them. This helps in increasing the shear strength of the block system and thus the load dispersal
capacity. The block shown in Fig. 2(iii) is a further improvement over dentated rectangular block. The
block shown in Fig. 2(iv) gives still better interlock and is suitable for fully mechanized paving.
The dentated blocks further can be grouped as shown in Fig. 3 into three categories as under:
Category A:
Dentated units are designed to key into each other on all four faces and which, by their
plan geometry when keyed together, resist the widening of the joint. These blocks are
generally capable of being laid in herringbone bond pattern (as explained in Section
8).
Category B:
These blocks are dentated on only two sides. Their dimensional accuracy of laying
:
helps in bringing about the interlock effect on other faces. Generally, with some
exceptions, these blocks can only be laid in stretcher bond, as explained in Section 8.
Category C:
These are not dentated type but depend on dimensional accuracy for interlocking effect.
These blocks can be laid only in a stretcher bond.

In addition to regular blocks described above, supplementary blocks of half size would be
required for paving purpose. In the case of rectangular blocks, more number of half blocks would be
generally required than other category of blocks.

Special Grass Blocks
For improving aesthetic looks of paved areas, architects have been making use of block
pavement extensively. The numerous paving blocks and their joints mellow down the harshness created
by large transverse joints formed in conventional concrete pavement.
For improving aesthetics further, grass blocks have been developed. These when constructed
in a grid formation allow space in the pavement for growing grass as shown in Fig. 4. These are best
suited for walkways, driveways, etc. Coloured blocks also add to the aesthetic beauty.
4. COMPOSITION OF BLOCK PAVEMENT
4.1.
General
Except for the top wearing part of the pavement, the base and sub-base layers are similar to the
conventional flexible or rigid pavement. Depending upon the load coming on them, the composition
of the pavement differs.
4.2.
Typical Pavement Composition
A few typical compositions normally used are given in Figs. 5 and 6.
4.3.
Block Thickness
Interlocking concrete blocks come in different thicknesses. These blocks serve as wearing
surface but at the same time help in reducing the stresses imposed on subgrade and also help in
resisting pavement deformation and elastic deflections similar to the base course of a flexible pavement.

Fig. 6. A typical cross section of block pavement for heavily trafficked roads
For Category 'A' blocks used for light traffic, such as, pedestrians, motor cars, cycles, etc., a block
thickness of 60 mm is adequate; for medium traffic, a thickness of 80 mm
is generally used; for
heavily trafficked roads, Category 'B' blocks of the thickness 100-120 nrmi are used. Thick blocks are
best suited where high volumes of turning movements are involved.
Non-uniformity in thickness of blocks affects the evenness of the surface. A block pavement
which is initially paved to a levelled surface will settle unevenly with the movement of vehicles, as
shown in Fig. 7. In view of this, all blocks should be of the same thickness, with a maximum allowable
tolerance limits of ± 3 mm. Similarly, variations in length and width of blocks should be hmited to ±
2 to 3 mm for ensuring uniform joint width and avoiding staggering effect.
4.4.
Sand Bedding and Jointing
A layer of sand bedding is provided between block pavement and base/sub-base for the following
reasons:
(i)
To provide a cushion between the hard base and the paving blocks
(ii)
The base or sub-base will have some permitted surface unevenness. By providing a
layer of sand bed, the paved block can be levelled perfectly.
(iii)
The sand bed acts as a barrier and does not allow propagation of cracks formed in base/
sub-base.
(iv)
The sand also helps to keep lower part of the joint filled with sand and provides added
interlocking effect.

Fig. 7. Effect of thickness variations in paving blocks
The sand bed should not be too thick lest it would be difficult to control the surface level of the
blocks. A layer thickness of 20 to 40 mm is found to be satisfactory.
For block pavement to perform satisfactorily, it is necessary that the lower layers are profiled
to proper level and finish and that the bedding sand layer is of uniform thickness. Varying thickness of
sand bed ultimately results in uneven surface of the pavement.

is very important for the block pavement to perform
satisfactorily. The sand used should be free from plastic clay and should be angular type. It should not
be of degradable type for e.g., sand produced from lime stone, etc. is likely to get powdered under the
loading.
-^..^^
Joints between blocks are filled by fine sand. Normally, the bottom 20 to 30 mm of the joint
gets filled with bedding sand, whereas, the remainder space has to be filled with jointing sand by
brooming it from the top. The joints are normally 2 to 4 mm wide.
4.5.
Base and Sub-base Layers
These layers are the important structural layers of a block pavement. The materials used for
base construction consist of either bound material like lean concrete or soil-cement or bituminous
layers or unbound materials like wet mix macadam or WBM. The sub-bases are generally of granular
material. The sub-base can function as drainage layer as well, provided proper disposal arrangement
for water is made. The base course layer is normally provided where heavy vehicular traffic is likely.
Besides intensity of loading, the type of soil encountered determines the type and thickness of
base and sub-base. For weak subgrade soils like clays, where ground water table is shallow, bound
bases are preferred.

4.6.
Edge Restraint Blocks and Kerbs
Concrete blocks on trafficked pavements tend to move sideways and forward due to braking
and manoeuvring of vehicles. The tendency to move sideways has to be counteracted at the edges by
special edge blocks and kerbs. The edge blocks should be designed such that the rotation or displacement
of blocks is resisted. These are to be made of concrete of high strength to withstand the traffic wheel
loading without getting damaged. These members should be manufactured or constructed in-situ to
have at least a 28 day compressive strength of 30 MPa or flexural strength of 3.8 MPa. As far as
possible the edge blocks should have vertical face towards the inside blocks. A few typical edge
blocks are also shown in Fig. 8.

The road kerbs provided on the edge of the road also serve the purpose of edge blocks as
shown in Fig. 8. In case the kerbs are not provided, it has to be replaced by edge strips.
5. STRUCTURAL DESIGN OF CONCRETE BLOCK PAVEMENT
5.1.
Suggested Design Procedure
Design procedures have been developed by agencies abroad based on successful performance,
or mechanistic principles. They cover a variety of roads ranging from the lightly trafficked to the
heavily trafficked. In the absence of research in India, it is recommended that the catalogue of designs
given subsequently may be used.
5.2.
Lightly Trafficked Pavements
Pedestrian side-walks, footpaths, cycle tracks, car parks and malls are lightly trafficked. In
such situations, the pavement can consist of blocks 60 mm thick laid over a sand bedding 20-30 mm
and a base course 200 mm thick. The base course can be in WBMAVMM/crushed stone/soil-cement.
This design can be adopted for the range of subgrade soils met with in India. A typical cross-section
is given in Fig. 5.
-
5.3.
Block Pavements Subjected to Commercial Traffic
-
City streets and highway sections subjected to commercial traffic (trucks and buses) require a
heavier section. Though design methods based on empirical approach and mechanistic behaviour are
available, enough work has not been done in India to evolve the country's own design procedure. In
the absence of such knowledge, the ad-hoc design catalogues based on international experience as
given in Table
1 are suggested for adoption. A design life of 20 years can be considered for determining
the repetitions of standard axles.
5.4.
For block pavements for industrial applications like container yard and port wharf and
roads and warehouses the following thickness is recommended, based on international experience:
Block
:
100 mm
Sand Bedding
:
'
30-50 mm
Hydraulically bound base

6.2.
Salient Mix Design Aspects
The commonly used processes for the manufacture of pre-cast cement concrete paving units
require dry, low-slump mixes. The desired characteristics of the mix are as under:
Water/cement ratio
:
0.34 to 0.38
Water content of the mix
:
5 to 7% of total mix
Quantity of cement in mix
:
Generally not less than 380 kg/m^ depending on the
equipment being used for block making. Upper limit of
cement shall not be more than 425 kg/m\ Flyash also
can be used in the mix, replacing Ordinary Portland
Cement to an extent of 35 per cent.
The above values are for general guidance only. The actual mix design has to be made to suit
each individual requirement.
Aggregate/cement ratio
:
3:1 to 6:1
Aggregates
:
Should be sound and free from soft or honeycombed
pieces. The proportion of coarse aggregate in the mix is
typically 40 per cent and the fine aggregate (sand) 60
per cent. The size of coarse aggregate should lie between
6 mm and 12 mm and the gradation should be in the
recommended range for cement concrete mixes
in
general.
Strength
In general terms, the paving block must have adequate
strength to withstand handling, construction stresses and
effects of traffic, though the strength as such
is not
considered a vital factor in the satisfactory performance
of a block pavement. However,
it is suggested that the
minimum compressive strength of a single block should
be above 30 MPa.
Addition of Pigments
:
To provide the desired colour to paving blocks,
appropriate type and amount of pigments are added
' ^'
during mixing, in the form of powder or slurry. Although
organic pigments render brighter colours than inorganic
pigments, the former are adversely affected by the
alkaline environment of concrete and do deteriorate with
time. Inorganic pigments, mostly metal oxides, are more
durable and hence preferred for consistency and purity.
Saturation of colour takes place with a pigment volume
of around 5 to 9 per cent of cement content. Pigments
should be finer than cement (fineness value between 2
and 15 m'/gm). For the same slump, addition of pigments
14



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 48
======================================================================
IRC:SP:63-2004
requires increase in mixing water, which in some cases
may lead to lowering of flexural and compressive
strength of concrete; therefore, suitable adjustments in
mix proportions may become necessary.
Other Additives
Under special circumstances, super-plasticizers at around
0.4 per cent of cement by weight may be added for high
early strength. Water repellant admixtures of calcium
stearate are sometimes used to reduce water absorption.
Air entraining agents, when added to the mix, cause some
reduction in the needed amount of cement. Further
reduction is achieved by substituting part of the cement
with blast-furnace slag or pozzolanas like flyash; besides
reducing cost, these also control "efflorescence" (surface
deposition of salts
as a result of water movement
upwards).
6.3.
Manufacture of Paving Blocks
The method of manufacture of paving blocks has an important bearing on the quality, durability
and level of finish - dimensional tolerance, etc. all of which reflect on the ultimate performance of the
block pavement during service. At the very outset, therefore, it is to be emphasized that hand-casted
concrete blocks are unacceptable for use and that an appropriate plant should be used which would
make it possible to apply high pressure together with controlled vibration. Adaptation of production
facilities designed for high quality hollow masonry blocks, though feasible, is not as economical and
as efficient as the use of purpose designed machinery for paving block manufacture. Essentially, the
manufacturing process involves compacting concrete, in a steel mould clamped to a vibrating table,
by hydraulic pressure.
Concrete is fed into the mould from a hopper by a drawer - if a second hopper is added, a block
can be made of two kinds of concrete having "backing" and "facing" surfaces. In the "facing" of the
block, the top 5 mm has greater amounts of cement and sand to make
it more durable and skid-
resistant, and extra pigment is added for the coloured face vis-a-vis the rest of the block. In the first
stage of compaction, pre-vibration is effected by running the vibrators attached to the vibratory table,
the frequency generally being in the range of 50 to 100 Hz. In the second stage of compaction,
compression pressure
is applied to the tamper heads, also fitted with vibrators for a high level of
surface finish. Blocks are extruded from mould by forcing down the tamper heads, after the vibrating
table is disengaged from the mould. The blocks thus prepared are stacked either in a single layer or
multiple layers for curing, depending on the plant used being single layer or multi-layer.
6.4.
Dimensional and other Requirements of Paving Blocks
For normal paving work, the length of a paving block should ordinarily be not greater than
twice the mean width; the thickness
is a minimum of 60 mm; the maximum length generally not
exceeding 280 mm; the width generally is in the range 75 to 140 mm with a maximum chamfer of 10
mm (preferably chamfer should be in the range 3-5 mm). The sides of the block should be perpendicular
15



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 48
======================================================================
IRC:SP:63-2004
to the top and bottom faces except that the top edge may be chamfered. The blocks should have the
following dimensional tolerances:
Plan dimensions
±
2 mm
Thickness
±
3 mm
"
To ensure durability, the average water absorption in a block should not exceed 5 per cent; and
for cold regions in a standard freeze-thaw durability test, the weight loss should not exceed
1 per cent.
In situations, where parts of blocks are to be used e.g., around manholes, the block should be
puipose-cut at site.
It is to be recognized that variations in the thickness of blocks used for a paving job can be a
major cause for the loss of surface profile, as shown in Fig. 7 on an exaggerated scale. In the interest
of maintaining a good surface profile, the block thickness should be controlled carefully; this can be
done to advantage by adopting multi-layer method of manufacture of paving blocks, which reduces
the variation in block thickness.
Annexure give suggested technical specifications for laying block pavements.
6.5.
Bedding and Joint Filling Sand
6.5.1.
Bedding sand
: It is well established that if proper attention is not paid to the quality
of bedding sand, and if the thickens of the bedding sand layer is not uniform enough, serious irregularities
in surface profile can result; excessive differential deformation and rutting can occur early in service
life of the block pavement. The desired gradation of bedding sand should be as under
:
IS Sieve Size
Percent Passing
9.52 mm
100
4.75 mm
95-100
2.36 mm
80-100
.
1.18 mm
50-95
600 micron
25-60
300 micron
10-30
150 micron
0-15
75 micron
0-10
Care should be taken to see that single-sized or gap graded sands or sands with excessive
amount of fines or plastic fines should not be used. The shape of sand particles should preferably be
sharp rather than rounded, since the sharp sands possess higher strength and resist the migration of
sand from under the block to less frequently trafficked areas. Eventhough sharp sands are relatively
more difficult to compact than rounded sands., the use of sharp sands should be preferred for the more
heavily trafficked pavements. The bedding sand should be free of deleterious materials.
16



======================================================================
PAGE 27 of 48
======================================================================
IRC:SP:63-2004
6.5.2.
Joint filling sand
: The gaps in between two paving blocks (typically about 3 mm
wide) need to be filled by sand^ relatively finer than the bedding sand. The desired gradation for the
joint filling sand is as under:
IS Sieve Size
Per cent Passing
2.36 mm
100
1.18 mm
90-100
600 micron
60-90
.
300 micron
30-60
150 micron
.
15-30
75 micron
0-10
It is necessary to restrict the fines (silt and/or clay) to 10 per cent, since excessive fines make
joint filling very difficult. Similarly,
it is not advisable to use cement in the joint filling sand which
will not only make it difficult to completely fill the joints but would also adversely affect the desired
flexibility characteristics of the paving block layer. The joint filling sand should be as dry as possible;
otherwise complete filling ofjoints will be difficult. To overcome the problem of efflorescence on the
surface of paving block layer, the joint filling sand should be washed to remove soluble salts.
6.6.
Base Material
^
The engineering properties of base materials, which include load spreading properties to reduce
stresses on the subgrade and desired drainage characteristics, have an important bearing on the
performance of a block pavement. Although, local availability and economics generally dictate the
choice of base material at the design stage, the commonly used materials considered suitable for base
courses are unbound crushed rock, water-bound macadam, wet mix macadam, cement bound crushed
rock/ granular materials, and lean cement concrete.
In broad terms, wherever the subgrade is weak (having a CBR value below 5) use of bound
granular materials, like, cement treated crushed rock, requiring a relatively thinner base, should be
preferred while for high strength subgrades, unbound crushed rock can be used. The climatic and
environmental factors also need to be considered during the choice of a base material.
6.7.
Sub-base Material
'
Generally, a sub-base is warranted where commercial traffic is expected. The quality of sub-
base materials is inferior to the base materials and includes natural gravels, cement treated gravels and
sands and stabilized subgrade materials. The quality of sub-base materials should be in conformance
withIRC:37-2001.
7. DRAINAGE
Block pavement with joints filled with sand is not a waterproof layer and hence care has to be
taken to drain out the surface water seeping through the joints in initial stage of the construction. This
17



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 48
======================================================================
IRC:SP:63-2004
water can find way to sand bed below, base, sub-base and siibgrade layers. Unless these layers are free
draining, appropriate drainage aiTangement has to be provided. The drainage provided generally consists
of subsurface drains surrounded by filter material or a geotextile, which would allow the water to pass
through and at the same time prevent the escape of bedding/ jointing sand. Typical subsurface drainage
arrangement used in block pavement is shown in Figs. 9 and 10.

A crossfall of 2 per cent slope
is generally sufficient to drain the surface run-off but
it is
desirable to provide 3 per cent crossfall in the case of heavily trafficked roads to avoid formation of
water puddles. The block pavement should be at least 5 mm above the manholes, side drains, etc.^
8. CONSTRUCTION
8.1.
General
The construction of block pavement involves preparation of subgrade, sub-base and base course
layers, bedding sand and finally the laying of blocks. The block paving can be done entirely by manual
labour. However, for efficient construction work, the work force has to be properly trained for this
specialised job. Paving can also be done by mechanical means.
8.2.
Preparation of Subgrade
This is the foundation layer on which the block pavement is constructed. Like in conventional
pavements the water table should be at a minimum depth of 600 mm below the subgrade. Subgrade
should be compacted in layers of 150 or 100 mm thickness as per 1RC:36-1970. The prepared subgrade
should be graded and trimmed to a tolerance of ± 20 mm of the design levels, and its surface evenness
should have a tolerance of within 15 mm under a 3 m straight edge.
8.3.
Base and Sub-base Course
Base and sub-base courses are constructed in accordance with standard procedures contained
in the relevant IRC Specifications,
like, IRC:37-2001, IRC:50-1973, IRC:51-1993, IRC:63-1976,
19



======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 48
======================================================================
IRC:SP:63-2004
IRC: 19-1977. When cement bound base are proposed it may be constructed using rolled lean concrete
as per IRC:SP-49. The quality control specified in IRC:SP-1 1 shall apply. Constructing the layers to
proper level and grade is very essential to maintain the level and surface regularity of the block pavement.
8.4.
Placing and Screeding of Bedding Sand
The thickness of the sand bed after compaction should be in the range of 20-40 mm, whereas,
in the loose form
it can be 25 to 50 mm.
It is preferable to restrict the compacted thickness to 20-25
mm to reduce the risk of any localized precompaction, which would affect the final block surface
level. Bedding sand should not be used to fill-up local depressions on the surface of a base or sub-
base. The depressions should be repaired in advance before placing sand.
Sand to be used should be uniformly in loose condition and should have a uniform moisture
content. Best moisture content is that when sand is neither too wet nor too dry and have a value of 6 to
8 per cent. Requirement of sand for a day's work should be prepared and stored in advance and
covered with tarpaulin or polythene sheets.
The processed sand is spread with the help of screed boards to the required thickness. The
screed boards are provided with nails at 2-3 m apart which when dragged gives the desired thickness.
The length of nail should take into account the surcharge to be provided in the uncompacted thickness.
Alternatively, the screed can be dragged on edge strips kept on both sides as guide. Asphalt paver can
be employed in large projects. The sand is subsequently compacted with plate vibrators weighing 0.6
tonnes or more. Level checks shall be carried out on a grid pattern to establish that the desired level is
achieved. Local correction can be done either by removing or adding extra sand followed by levelling
and compacting the layer. There will be some settlement of sand after the blocks are placed and
compacted, which must be allowed for, while fixing the level of sand bed.
The effect of undulating surface of base or sub-base on the profile of block pavement is explained
in Fig.
12. The blocks will settle after trafficking in such a manner that the surface profile becomes
parallel to base/sub-base profile. Sand bed assumes uniform thickness under moving loads.
8.5.
Laying of Blocks
Blocks can be laid generally by manual labour but mechanical aids like hand-pushed trolleys
can expedite the work.
Normally, laying should commence from the edge strip and proceed towards the inner side.
When dentated blocks are used, the laying done at two fronts will create problem for matching joints
in the middle. Hence, as far as possible, laying should proceed in one direction only, along the entire
width of the area to be paved.
While locating the starting line, the following should be considered:
-
On a sloping site, start from the lowest poiht and proceed uphill on a continuous basis,
to avoid down hill creep in incomplete areas.
-
In case of irregular shaped edge restraints or strip,
it is better to start from straight
'
,
string line as shown in Fig.
13.

8.6.
Bonds or Patterns of Laying Blocks
The blocks can be placed to different bonds or patterns depending upon requirement. Some
popular bonds commonly adopted for block paving are:
(i)
Stretcher or running bond
(ii)
HeiTingbone bond
(iii)
Basket weave or parquet bond
- \,
The typical layout of these bonds are given in Fig. 14.
8.7.
Establishing the Laying Pattern
^
In relation to the starting line, the blocks should be placed at the correct angle to achieve the
final orientation as required by the laying pattern. If the edge restraint is straight and suitably oriented,
the first row of blocks can abut
it. For iiTcgular-shaped and unfavourably oriented edge restraints, a
stringline should be established a few' rows away to position the first row.
With the help of gauges, the joint width specification (2 to 4 mm) should be checked in the
first few square metres, where
it should be ensured that the block alignment is correct. The laying
patterns and face should be established (Fig. 15) to permit fast and easy laying without the necessity
of forcing a block between previously positioned blocks. To start with, full blocks should be used;
only subsequently, cutting and in-filling at edges be permitted. Under no circumstances should the
blocks be forced or hammered into the bedding sand at this stage of laying. For cutting paving blocks,
hydraulic or mechanical block cutters, or power saws are used. Cut units less than 50 mm minimum
dimension should not be used, as these are difficult to cut accurately and can be dislodged under
traffic. Where space does not permit use of a larger segment, use premixed concrete or a sand-cement
mortar instead.
The control over alignment, laying pattern and joint widths can be maintained by the use of
chalked string lines, at about 5 m intervals.
8.8.
Different Methods of Construction of Block Pavement
8.8.1. Manual methods
: In the traditional manual method, the sand is roughly screeded and
a skilled worker (called a pavior) levels the sand and then embeds the block using a hammer; he works
backwards so as to have a continuous view of the completed pavement in order to obtain a good
finish. A pavior, along with an assistant, can lay 50 to 75 m- of paving per day.
An alternative to the above method, the block layers (generally unskilled labourers) work on
the completed surface, moving forward.
For optimum output, it is advantageous to select an easy fitting block shape, with the desirable
size being that which can be easily accommodated in the worker's hand; in addition, the blocks should
be chamfered for easy handling and their weight should preferably be less than 4 kg.

The output of finished pavement varies widely with training of workmen, over a wide range
from a low of 20 to a high of 120 m-/man-day; the higher outputs being for industrial hard standings
where intrusion like manholes, etc. are minimal. To keep up the speed of work,
it
is important to
maintain an adequate supply of paving blocks to the laying site for manual paving. Ordinarily, hand
pushed trolleys are adequate for the purpose, but for large projects employing a number of laying
teams, use of powered trolleys is preferable.
Care must be taken to see that paving blocks are not tightly butted against each other, otherwise
there could be non-uniformity in the laying patterns and the blocks may spall or even crack. Joint
widths of 2 to 4 mm can be maintained if, when laying a paving unit, it is held lightly against the face
of an adjacent laid unit and allowed to vertically slide into position.
Since each workman may produce slightly different joint widths,
it
is desirable to rotate
workmen along the workface, and also periodically interchange the personnel laying and transporting
blocks.
The average joint width can be measured and checked, by determining
statistically the
representative values of average length and breadth of blocks at the project site and then obtaining
average distance between joints, say 40 blocks apart; or
it can be done by measuring joint widths
directly, using a calibrated, hardened steel mandrel which is forced into joints at a series of randomly
selected locations, to obtain a statistically representative figure.
,
8.8.2. Mechanised methods
: Mechanised laying requires the use of specialised equipment?-
for transporting and placing clusters of paving blocks. The size of paving block cluster suitable for
paving, is usually 0.3 to 0.5 m- in area for hand-operated equipment; for fully mechanised equipment,
the cluster surface area can be upto about
1 .2 m-. These clusters are designed to maintain a joint space
of about 3 mm between blocks, when clamped together (Fig.
16).
Since the blocks are placed in separate clusters, there exists the possibility of damage if joints
between adjacent clusters run uninterrupted throughout the pavement. To overcome this problem,
clusters may be arranged so that the joints are periodically staggered both along and across the cluster
axis or link blocks are installed by hand across these joints (Fig.
17).
Mechanised laying must be coordinated with the manufacturer, so that the blocks are delivered
stacked on pallets in the required pattern; in some cases, spacing ribs may be cast on the sides of
blocks to preserve the required joint spacings.
8.8.3. Compaction
: For compaction of the bedding sand and the blocks laid over it, vibratory
plate compactors are used over the laid paving units; at least two passes of the vibratory plate compactor
are needed. Such vibratory compaction should be continued till the top of each paving block is level
with its adjacent blocks. It is not good practice to leave compaction till end of the day, as some blocks
may move under construction traffic, resulting in the widening of joints and comer contact of blocks,
which may cause spalling or cracking of blocks. There should be minimal delay in compaction after
laying of the paving blocks to achieve uniformity of compaction and retention of the pattern of laying;
however, compaction should not proceed closer than 1 m from the laying face, except after completion
of the pavement.

Fig. 17. Staggered installation of block clusters
During vibratory compaction of the laid blocks, some amount of bedding sand will work its
way into the joints between them; the extent of sand getting worked up into the joints will depend on
the degree of pre-compaction of sand and the force applied by the block compactor. Standard compactors
may have a weight of about 90 kg, plate area of about 0.3 m- and apply a centrifugal force of about 15
kN, while heavy duty compactors may weigh 300-600 kg, have a plate area of about 0.5-0.6 m- and
apply a centrifugal force of 30-65 kN. Where the bedding sand has been pre-compacted and for heavily

======================================================================
PAGE 38 of 48
======================================================================
IRC:SP:63-2004
trafficked block pavements, heavy duty compactors should be used. After compaction by vibratory
plate compactors, some 2 to 6 passes of a vibratory roller (with rubber coated drums or those of static
weight less than 4 tonnes and nominal amplitude of not more than 0.6 mm) will further help in
compaction of bedding sand and joint filling.
8.8.4. Joint filling
: The importance of complete joint filling cannot be over-emphasised.
Unfilled or partially filled joints allow blocks to deflect, leading to loose blocks, possibly spalling the
edges and a locally disturbing bedding sand layer, as shown in Fig. 18.
After the compaction of the bedding sand has been completed (and some bedding sand has
been forced up in the joints between blocks), the joints should be completely filled with sand meeting
the desired specifications, as given in Section 6. The joint filing sand should be stockpiled at suitable
locations for convenience. There should be minimum delay in joint filling; the process should in any
case, be completed by the end of the day's work.

IRC:SP:63-2004
The operation of joint filling comprises of spreading a thin layer of the joint filling sand on the
block surface and working the sand into each joint by brooming. Following this, a far passes of heavy
plate compactor are applied to facilitate fine sand to fill the joints. The sand should be broomed or
spread over the surface with a small surcharge.
Dry sand and dry blocks are best for the filling of joint, as damp sand tends to stick at the very
top of the joints; also, if the blocks is wet and the sand dry, the sand will again stick at the joint top.
Hence, if either the blocks or sand are wet, one may get a false impression of the joints being full, but
the next rain will reveal that they are actually hollow. If the weather does not allow sand and blocks to
be dry, the joint filling sand should be washed in by light sprinkling of water. In this case, several
cycles of application of sand, water-sprinkling and plate compaction will be necessary to completely
fill the joints.
8.8.5. Opening to traffic
: Until all the joints are completely filled, no traffic should be permitted
over the block pavement. In case of lime or cement treated layers in the pavement,
it must be ensured
that these are given at least 14 and 7 days respectively to cure, before traffic is permitted. The block
pavement should be inspected frequently, to ensure that any incompletely filled joints, exposed by
traffic and/or weather are promptly filled. Such frequent inspection should be continued till dust and
detritus from the roadway tightens the surface of the joints.

8.8.7. Detailing block pavements
: Essentially, there are three important aspects in detailing.
These are
:
(i)
Curves
(ii)
Treatment of intrusions, and
(iii)
Changes in alignment
.
.
.
8.8.7.1. Curves
: It is necessary to cut the paving units to fit the edge restraints. Rectangular
blocks of a similar or contrasting colour as an edging have been used to minimise the visual effects of
small errors in block cutting. To avoid unsightly and potentially weak construction joints, it is often
preferable to change the laying pattern at the curve. For example, as shown in Fig. 19, the curve itself
can be installed in herringbone bond and yet the pavement can revert to stretcher bond on the approaches.

8.8.7.2. Pavement intrusions
: On some pavements, like in city streets, there could be several
intrusions, like, manholes, drainage gulleys, etc. where mating these intrusions with the pavement is
desirable. Fig. 20 shows how this should be done around a manhole.
Around intrusions,
it is good practice to lay along both sides of the intrusion simultaneously
so that closure is made away from the starting workface, rather than carrying the pavement around the
intrusion to return to the original -laying face (Fig. 20) to avoid accumulation of closing en-or.

8.8.7.3. Changes in alignment
: Changes in alignment of a road pavement can some times be
achieved by the use of special blocks. However,
it is generally easier to choose a block that can be
installed in herringbone bond and simply cut the blocks to
fit the edge restraints. Where aesthetic
requirements or shape of the paving unit dictate the use of stretcher bond, then only a 90° shape
change in alignment can be achieved without cutting the blocks (Fig. 21). At intersections,
if a
herringbone bond laying pattern is adopted, the paving can proceed without the need for construction
joints (Fig. 22). An alternative to this is to install a shoulder (support) course of rectangular paving
units between the mail] roadway and the side streets; this permits different laying patterns to be used
in the two roadways.
8.9.
SpeciHcations
Annexure-1 gives the specifications for laying. The BIS Specifications for Precast Concrete
Blocks for Paving (under publication) may be followed for the manufacture and testing of blocks.

9. MAINTENANCE
-
9.1.
General
Like any other road work, block pavement also should be maintained to give long service. The*
maintenance requirement of block pavement
is minimal. The block pavement requires
initial
maintenance soon after its laying, say after a week or two for checking sand in the joints. Subsequently,
the maintenance is in the form of replacing any damaged block/blocks or raising the settled section, if
any. Repair especially after laying a cable duct is much simpler in the case of block pavements. The
cut area can be reinstated without any blemish.
9.2.
Initial Maintenance
After about a week of laying the blocks there is a need to inspect the surface^to check for any
loss of sand at joints. Wherever sand level has dropped down
it should be reinstated. This type of
inspection should continue for two to three months till the sand level is stabilized and topping up is no
more required. With time the joints receive fine dust and detritus thus making them waterproof. During
rains these joints may allow weeds to grow but these normally should get eliminated with the traffic.
In case it does not get eliminated these may have to be controlled by spraying herbicide or by manual
removal. Annual inspection, however, will be required.
9.3.
Storage of Blocks
For the purpose of reinstating damaged blocks it is necessary to stockpile a small percentage
of blocks from the lots used in the construction. The size and colour of the blocks may be difficult to
obtain at a later date matching with the original blocks. For important projects, it is normal to stockpil
,
blocks from
1 per cent to 3 per cent initial supply for subsequent use.

IRC:SP:63-2004
9.4.
Coating and Cleaning
As part of preventive maintenance, blocks can be sealed using compounds,
like, silicone,
acrylics and silica flourides for enhancing the colour, reducing absorptive nature of the blocks and for
improving surface toughness. These coating have
life of
1
to 3 years and hence they have to be
repeated as per the requirement. The most durable of these chemicals is solvent-borne acrylics which
are abrasion resistant and also minimize chemical effects of spillage even at 60°C.
Cleaning of block pavement can be done by mechanical brooms, compressors or even by
manual means. For removing certain stains, chemicals, like, oxalic, acetic and phosphoric acids etc.
are used. Sometimes
it may be expedient to replace the blocks where stains have penetrated to a
greater depth.
