GEOMETRIC DESIGN STANDARDS FOR
RURAL (NON-URBAN) HIGHWAYS
1.
INTRODUCTION
1.1.
"Geometric
design"
deals with the visible
elements
of
a highway.
Sound
geometric
design
results in economical opera-
tion of vehicles and ensures safety.
1.2.
The
Specifications
and
Standards
Committee
of
the
Indian Roads Congress had previously published a
few
Papers
on
geometric aspects of design.
The first Paper
entitled:
"Horizontal
and Transition Curves for Highways" appeared in the I.R.C. Journal
in 1947.
This was followed by two other Papers on
* 'Sight Distance
and
Vertical
Curves"
in
1950 and 1952 respectively.
For
many
years, these Papers served as a guide for design of highways
in this
country.
Later,
in
1966,
some
important
extracts
from
these
Papers were published by the Congress under the title **Geometrics
of Roads".
1.3.
Following
the
adoption of metric system, ther^
was
a
need to revise
this
publication
with
suitable
modifications in the
light of other standards brought out by the I.R.C. in the intervening
period
as
also
more
recent
practices
round the world.
To fulfil
this need,
a
new
draft was prepared in the I.R.C.
Secretariat
by
L.R. Kadiyali
and
A.K.
Bhattacharya.
This
was
reviewed and
modified by
a
Working Group set up
by
the
Specifications
and
Standards Committee consisting of:
Dr. M,P. Dhir
H.P. Sikka
A.K. Bhattacharya
1.4.
The modified draft was approved
by
the
Specifications
and Standards Committee in their meeting held on 16th May, 1977.
It was later approved by the Executive Committee through
circula-
tion and then
by
the
Council of
the
Indian Roads
Congress
in
their 93rd meeting held on the 3rd June, 1978 subject to certain modi-
fications which were left to a Working Group comprising Prof. C.G.
Swaminathan,
R.C.
Singh,
Col. Avtar Singh, R.P. Sikka and P.C.
Bhasin, Secretary IRC.
The
final modification and editing of
the
1



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 64
======================================================================
IPC: 73-1980
text was done jointly by R.P.Sikka, Member-Secretary, Specifications
and Standards
Committee and K. Arunachalam.
2.
SCOPE
2.1.
The publication
is based primarily on existing standards
and
recommendations
of the Indian Roads Congress, with suitable
modifications and additions in the light of current engineering prac-
tice.
The standards
prescribed are essentially advisory
in
nature
but may be relaxed somewhat in very difficult situations if
conside-
red judicious.
Effort in general should, however, be to aim at stand-
ards higher than the minimum indicated.
2.2.
The text deals with geometric design standards for rural
highways**,
i.e. non-urban
roads
located predominantly in
open
country
outside
the built-up
area.
The
alignment may however
pass through isolated stretches of built-up nature as long as
charac-
ter of the
road
as
a whole does not change.
The standard is
not
applicable
to
urban
roads or city streets.
It is also not applicable
to
expressways.
Geometric
design
elements of road
intersections
are not considered in the standard either.
2.3.
The
geometric
features
of
a highway
except
cross-
sectional
elements
do not lend
to stage construction.
Geoiiietric
defitciencies are costly and sometimes
impossible to rectify later on
due
to
the
subsequent
roadside
development.
Therefore,
it
is
essential
that
geometric
requirements should be kept in view right
in the beginning.
3.
CLASSIFICATION OF NON-URBAN ROADS
3.1.
Non-urban roads in
India are
classified into
five
cate-
gories:
(i) National Highways
(ii) State Highways
(iii) Major District Roads
(IV) Other District Roads
(V) Village Roads
**These should not be confused with Rural Roads which
refer commonly
to
Other District Roads and Village Roads.
While geometric design
elements
of
Rural Roads are duly covered
in
this
publication
alongwith
roads
of higher
category, more comprehensive
guidance
about different facets of design and
construction of the Rural Roads can be had
from the IRC Special
Publication
No. 20,
**Manual on Route
Location,
Design, Construction and Maintenance
of Rural Road^ (Other District Roads and Village Roads)**.

IRC
:
73-1980
3.2.
National Highways are main highways
running
through
the length and breadth of the country connecting major ports, foreign
highways, State
capitals, large industrial and tourist centres
etc.
3.3.
State
Highways
are
arterial
routes
of
a State linking
district headquarters and important cities within the State
and con-
necting them with National Highways or highways of the neighbour-
ing States.
3.4.
Major
District
Roads
are
important
roads
within
a
district serving areas of
production and
markets,
and
connecting
these with each other or with the main highways.
3.5.
Other District Roads are roads
serving
rural
areas
of
production and providing them with outlet to market centres, taluka/
tehsil headquarters, block development headquarters, or other main
roads.
3.6.
Village Roads are roads connecting
villages
or
groups
of villages with each other and to the nearest road of a higher cate-
gory.
4.
TERRAIN CLASSIFICATION
4.1.
The geometric design of a highway
is
influenced
signi-
iicantly by terrain conditions.
Economy dictates choice of different
standards for different types of terrain.
Terrain
is classified
by the
general slope of the country across the highway alignment, for which
the criteria given in Table
1 should be followed.
While
classifying
a terrain, short isolated stretches of varying terrain
should
not
be
taken into consideration.

5.
DESIGN SPEED
5.1.
Choice of design speed depends on the
function
of the
road as also terrain conditions.
It
is
the
basic
parameter
which
determines all other geometric design features.
Design
speeds
for
various classes of roads should be as given in Table 2.

5.2.
Normally "ruling design speed'*
should
be
the
guiding
criterion
for
correlating
the
various
geometric
design
features.
"Minimum
design
speed"
may,
however,
be adopted in sections
where site conditions, including costs, do not permit a
design based
on the "ruling design speed".
5.3.
The design speed should
preferably
be
uniform
along
a
given
highway.
But
variations
in terrain may make changes in
speed unavoidable.
Where this
is so,
it is desirable that the
design
speed
should
not
be
changed
abruptly,
but in a gradual manner
by introducing successive
sections
of
increasing/decreasing
design
speed
so
that
the
road users
get
conditioned
to
the
change by
degrees.

6.1.2.
In high banks or deep cuts, the land width
should
be
suitably
increased.
Similarly,
a
higher
value
should be adopted
in unstable or landslide-prone areas.
The need for
a
wider
right-
of-way at important road intersections should also be kept in view.

6.1.3.
If a
road
is
expected
to
be
upgraded
to
a
higher
classification
in
the
foreseeable
future,
the
land
width
should
correspond to the latter.
6.1.4.
In
order
to
prevent
overcrowding
and
preserve
sufficient
space
for
future
road improvement,
it is advisable to lay
down restrictions on
building
activity
along
the
roads.
Building
activity
should
not
be
allowed
within
a prescribed distance from
the road, which
is defined by a hypothetical line set back
from the
road
boundary
and
called
the
''Building
Line".
In
addition,
it
will be
desirable
to
exercise
control
on
the
nature
of
building
activity
for
a
further
distance beyond the building line upto what
are. known
as
the
''Control
Lines".
Building
and
control
lines
are illustrated in Fig.
1 with respect
to
the
road
centre
line
and
road boundary.

Notes:
(1) The roadway widths given
above
are
exclusive
of parapets (usual
width 0.6 m) and side drains (usual width 0.6 m).
(2) The roadway widths for
Village Roads are on the basis^of a single
lane carriageway
of 3 m.
If a
higher
pavement
width
is adopted,
the roadway width should be increased correspondingly.
(3) In hard rock stretches, or unstable locations where excessive cutting
might lead to slope
failure,
width of roadway may be
reduced by
0.8 ra on two-lane roads and 0.4 m in other cases.
However, where
such stretches occur in
continuous
long length,
reduction in road-
way width
should not be
effected
unless
requisite
passing
places
vide para 6.2.3 are provided.
(4) On
horizontal
curves,
the
roadway
width
should
be
increased
corresponding to the
extra
widening
of carriageway
for curvature
vide para 9.6.
(5) On roads subject to heavy snowfall, where regular snow clearance
is
done over long periods
to
keep the
road
open to traffic, roadway
width may be increased by
1.5 m for MDRs, ODRs, and VRs.
Passing places
are not
necessary
on
two-lane National and
State Highways having roadway width in accordance
with Table 6.
But on single lane
sections
having
narrower
roadway,
it may be
desirable to provide some passing places depending on actual needs.
On other roads, these should be
provided in
general at the rate of
2-3 per kilometre.
Their exact location should be judiciously deter-
mined taking into consideration the available
extra width on curves
and visibility.
Normally the passing places/lay-byes
should be
3.75 m wide.
30 m long on the inside edge
(i.e.
towards the
carriageway
side),
and 20 m long on the farther side.

6.2.4
Roadway width
for
muIti-Iane
highways:
For
miilti-
lane highways, roadway width should be
adequate for the requisite
number
of
traffic
lanes,
besides
shoulders
and
central
median.
Width of shoulders should
in general be 2.5
metres.
For width of
carriageway and median,
reference may be made to paras 6.4 and
6.6 respectively.
6.3.
Roadway Width at Cross-Drainage Structures
6.3.1.
General:
Cross-drainage
structures
are
difficult
to
widen at
a later
stage.
As
such,
the roadway
width
for them
should be decided very carefully at the planning
stage
itself.
The
minimum recommended
values in
this
regard
are given in paras
6.3.2 and 6.3.3.
For roads being built to
lower standards
initially
for some
reason, or
those
which
are
expected
to
be upgraded/
widened in. the foreseeable future,
it will be
desirable to go in for a
higher roadway width at the
cross-drainage
structures right
in
the
beginning.
6.3.2.
Culverts (upto 6 m span):
In plain and rolling terrain,
the overall width on culverts (measuredfrom outside to outside of the
parapet walls) should
equal
the
normal
roadway
width given
in
Table
5.
In mountainous or steep terrain, the clear roadway width
available on the culverts
(measuredfrom
inside to
inside ofparapet
walls or kerbs) should be as below:
All roads other than Village Roads
...
As given in Table 6
Village Roads
minimum
...
As given in Table 6
desirable
...
4.25 m
6.3.3.
Bridges (greater than 6 m span):
At bridges, the clear
width of roadway between kerbs should be as under:
Single-lane bridge
...
4.25 m
Two-lane bridge
...
7.5 m
Multi-lane bridge
...
3.5 m per lane plus
0.5 m for each carriageway
At causeways and submersible bridges, the minimum width of
roadway
(between
kerbs)
should be
7.5 m,
unless
the
width
is
specially reduced by the competent authority.
Where a footpath is
provided
for
the use
of pedestrians,
its
width should not be less than
1.5 m.

Width of Carriageway
6.4.1.
The standard width of carriageway shall be as indicat-
ed in Table

The total width
should be
determined
in
relation
to the design traffic and capacity of the roadway, see Section

Notes:
1.
**0n Village Roads,
the
carriageway
width may be
restricted to
3.0 m normally. Widths greater than 3.0 m may however be adopted
judiciously, depending on the type and
intensity of traffic, cost
and
related factors.
2.
Except on
important
trunk
routes,
an
intermediate carriageway
width of 5.5 metres may
also
be
adopted
instead
of regular two
lanes
if the same
is considered advantageous.
6.4.2.
Where the carriageway width changes, e.g. from single
lane to two lanes or two lanes
to four
lanes, the
transition should
be effected through a taper of
1 in 15 to
1
in 20.
6.5.
Shoulder Width
The width
of
shoulders
for
each
class
of highway
can
be
directly obtained using Tables
5, 6
and
7.
Shoulder
width
will
be
one-half the difference
between ihe roadway
width
(Table 5 or 6)
and carriageway width (Table 7).
6.6.
Median Width
6.6.1.
Medians should be as wide as possible, but their width
is often restricted by economic considerations.
Minimum desirable
width of medians on
rural
highways
is 5 metres, but this could be
reduced to 3 metres where land
is restricted.
On long bridges and
viaducts, the width of median may be reduced to
1.5 meters, but
in
any case this should not be less than
1.2 m.
6.6.2.
As
far
as
possible,
the median should be of uniform
width in a
particular
section
of the
highway.
However,
where
changes are
unavoidable, a transition of
1
in 15 to
1
in 20 must be
provided.

Ill rolling
and
hilly country, the median width will be
dictated by topography and the individual carriageways could be
at
different levels.
6.7.
Pavement Camber or Crossfall
6.7.1.
The
camber
or crossfall on straight sections of roads
should be as recommended in Table 8 for various types of surfaces.
For a given
surface
type,
the
steeper values in the Table may
be
adopted in areas
having
high
intensity
of
rainfall
and the lower
values where the intensity of rainfall is
low.

(1 in 33 to

6.7.2.
Generally,
undivided
roads
on
straights should
be
provided with a
crown
in
the middle and
surface
on either
side
sloping towards the edge. However on
hill
roads
this may not be
possible in
every
situation,
particularly in
reaches
with a winding
alignment where
straight sections are few and far between.
In such
cases, discretion may be
exercised and instead
of normal camber
the carriageway may be given a uni-directional crossfall towards the
hill side having regard to factors such as the direction of supereleva-
tion at the flanking horizontal curves, ease of
drainage, problem of
erosion of the down-hill
face etc.
6.7.3.
On
divided
roads,
i.e.
dual
carriageways
having a
median,
it
is usual to have a uni-directional crossfall for each carri-
ageway sloping towards the outer edge.
6.8.
Crossfall for Shoulders
6.8.1.
The
crossfall
for
earth
shoulders
should be at least
0.5 ptv
cent
steeper
than
the slope of the pavement subject
to
a.
minimum of 3 per cent.

PAGE 23 of 64
======================================================================
IRC
:

6.8.2.
If the
shoulders are paved, a crossfall appropriate
to
the type of surface should be selected with reference to Table 8.
6.8.3.
On
superelevated
sections,
the shoulders should nor-
mally have the same crossfall as the pavement.
7.
DESIGN TRAFFIC AND CAPACITY
7.1.
The
width
of
carriageway
should be sufficient
for
the
design traffk, i.e.
traffic
expected
on the road in the design
year.
Design
traffic
will
depend
on
the
rate
of growth of traffic,
the
design period, importance of road in the system, nature
of
roadside
development etc.
For making capacity
computations under
mixed
traffi<i conditions,
the
different
types of vehicles should be conver-
ted to a common unit known
as 'passenger car unit' by multiplying
their number
with
relevant
equivalency factors.
Tentative values
of equivalency
factors
are
given in Table 9.
Tliese are meant for
use in open
sections
in plain
terrain away from intersections.
For
more details in this respect,
reference may be made to IRC:64-1976

depend on factors
like the directional split of traffic, degree of access control, composition
of traffic
etc.
Depending on the
actual
conditions,
capacity
of a
4-
lane divided highway could be upto 20,000-30,000 pcus.
7.3
The standards in Table 10 are applicable where the visibi-
lity
is unrestricted
and
there
are no
lateral
obstructions
within
1.75 m from the edge of pavement.
These also presume that only a
nominal amount of animal
drawn
vehicles (say
5-10 per cent) are
present in the traffic stream during the peak hour.
For more details,
reference may be made to IRC:64-1976.

SIGHT DISTANCE
8.1.
General
8.1.1.
Visibility
is an important requirement for the safety
of
travel on highways.
For this,
it
is necessary that s-ight
distance
of
adequate length should be available in dilTerent situations to permit
drivers
enough time and distance to control their
vehicles
so
that
there are no unwarranted accidents.
8.1.2.
Three types of sight distance'^'* are relevant insofar
as
the design of summit vertical curves and visibility at
the
horizontal
curves:
Stopping Sight Distance;
Overtaking
Sight
Distance;
and
Intermediate Sight Distance.
Standards for these are given in paras
8.2 to 8.4,- and the general principles of their application in para 8.5.
Criteria for
measurement of
the
sight
distances are
set
forth
in
para 8.6. Application of the sight distance requirements
at horizon-
tal curves
is discussed in para 9.7,
**These are dealt with in greater detail in IRC:66-1976 "Recommended Practice
for Sight Distance on Rural Highways".

======================================================================
IRC

8.1.3.
For valley
curves,
the
design
is governed
by
night
visibility which
is reckoned
in terms of the Headlight Sight Distance.
This
is the distance ahead of the vehicle illuminated
by
the
head-
lights which
is within the view of the driver.
Standards
for
head-
light sight distance are given in para
8.7.
8.2.
Stopping Sight Distance
8.2.1.
Stopping
sight
distance
is
the
clear distance ahead
needed by a driver to bring his vehicle to a
stop
before
meeting a
stationary object in his path.
Minimum stopping
sight
distance
is
given by the sum of:
(i) distance
travelled
during the
perception
and brake reaction time and
(ii)
the
braking
distance.
Minimum
design values of stopping distance for different
vehicle
speeds
are
shown in T^ble
11.
These are based on perception and brake-reac-
tion time of 2.5 seconds and coefficient of longitudinal friction vary-
ing from 0.40 at 20 km/h to 0.35 at 100 km/h.
For
application
of
Table
II, the speed chosen should be the same as the
design speed
of the road.

him to overtake another
vehicle
safely.
Optimum
condition
for
design is one in which the overtaking driver can follow
the vehicle
ahead for a short time while he assesses his chances
for overtaking,
pulls out his vehicle, overtakes the other
vehicle
at design
speed of
the highway, and returns to his own
side of the road before meeting
any oncoming vehicle from the
opposite
direction
travelling at the
same speed.
8.3.2.
Design values for overtaking sight
distance
are
given
in Table
12.
These are based
on
a
time
component
of
9 to 14
seconds for the actual overtaking manoeuvre
depending
on design
speed, increased by about 2/3rd to take into
account
the
distance
travelled by a vehicle from the opposite direction
during
the same
time.

Application of Sight Distance Standards
Singlejiwo-lam roads
8.5.1.
Normally the attempt should be to
provide overtaking
sight distance in as much length of
the
road
as
possible.
Where
this
is
not
feasible,
intermediate
sight
distance,
which
affords
reasonable opportunities for overtaking, should be
adopted
as
the
next best alternative. In no case however should the visibility corres-
pond
to
l^ss
than
the
safe
stopping
distance
which is the basic
minimum for any road.
8.5.2.
No hard
and
fast
rule
can
be
laid down
for
the
application of overtaking sight distance
since
this
will
depend
on
site conditions, economics etc.
It will be good, engineering practice
however to use overtaking sight distance
in
the
case
of
following
situations:
(i) Straight
sections
of
road
with
isolated
ovcrbridges
or
summit
vertical curves where
the
provision
of overtaking
sight
distance
would
conveniently
result
in
unobstructed

It

desirable,

Headlight Sight Distance at Valley Curves
8.7.1.
During day time, visibility
is not a
problem on
valley
curves.
However for night travel the design must ensure
that
the
roadway ahead is illuminated by vehicle
headlights
to
a
suflScient
length enabling the vehicle to brake to
a
stop
if
necessary.
This
distance, called the headlight sight distance, should
at
least
equal
the safe stopping sight distance given in Table
II.
8.7.2.
In designing valley
curves,
the
follov^ing
criteria
of
measurement should
be
followed
as
regards
the -headlight
sight
distance:
(i) height of headlight above road surface is 0.75 m;
(ii) the useful beam of headlight is lipto one
degree upwards
from the
grade of the road; and
(iii) the height of object is
nil.

HORIZONTAL ALIGNMENT
9.1.
General
9.1.1.
Uniformity of design standards
is one of
the
essential
.requirements of a road alignment.
In a given section,
there
must
be consistent application of a design element
to
avoid
unexpected
situations being created for the drivers.
For instance, a short sharp
curve in an otherwise good alignment
is bound to
act
as
an
acci-
dent-prone spot if the designer is not
vigilant.
Similarly,
any
un-
necessary break in horizontal alignment at cross-drainage structures
should be avoided.
9.L2.
As a general rule, the horizontal alignment
should
be
fluent and blend well with the surrounding topography.
A
flowing
line which
conforms
to
natural
contours
is
aesthetically
prefer-
able to one with long
tangents
slashing
through
the terrain.
This
would not only help in limiting the damage to the environment
but
also assist in preservation of natural slopes and plant growth.
Due
consideration should also be given to
the
conservation
of
existing
features.
This aspect
is dealt with at length in IRC
Special
Publi-
cation No. 21-1979 "Manual on Landscaping of Roads'*.
9.1.3.
. Long tangent sections exceeding 3 km in length should
be avoided as far as possible.
A
curvilinear
alignment
with
long
curves
is better from the point of safety and
aesthetics.
9.1.4. As a normal rule, sharp curves should not be introduced
'
at the end of long tangents since these can be extremely hazardous.
9.1.5.
Short curves give appearance of kinks, particularly
for
small deflection
angles, and should be avoided.
The curves should
be
suflSciently
long
and
have
suitable
transitions
to
provide
pleasing appearance.
Curve length should be
at
least
150 metres
for a deflection angle of 5 degrees, and this should be
increased
by
30 metres for each one
degree
decrease
in
the
deflection
angle.
For deflection angles less than one degree, no
curve
is
required to
be designed.
9.1.6.
Reverse curves may be needed in
difficult
terrain.
It
should be ensured that there
is
suflftcient
length
between the two
curves for introduction of requisite transition curves.
9.1.7.
Curves in the same direction separated
by
short
tan-
gents, known as broken-back c^Tves, should be
avoided
as
far
as
possible in the interest of aesth^lics and safety
and
replaced
by
a
single curve.
If this is not feasible, a tangent length
corresponding
19



======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 64
======================================================================
IRC
: 73-1980
to 10 seconds travel time must at least be ensured between
the
two
curves.
9.1.8.
Compound curves may be used in difficult
topography
but
only when
it
is impossible to
fit in a single
circular
curve.
To
ensure safe and smooth transition from one curve to
the
other,
the
radius of the
flatter curve
should
not
be
disproportional
to
the
radius of the sharper curve.
A ratio of 1.5
:
1 should be considered
the limiting value.
9.1.9.
To
avoid
distortions
in
appearance,
the
horizontal
alignment should
be
co-ordinated
carefully
with
the
longitudinal
profile,
keeping
in
mind
that
the
road
is
a
three-dimensional
entity and does not consist simply of a plan and L-section.
Require-
ments in this regard are discussed in Section
11.
9.1.10.
The siting of the bridges and the
location
of the
ap-
proaches should be properly co-ordinated keeping in view the overall
technical feasibility, economy, fluency of alignment
and
aesthetics.
The following criteria may be followed in general:
(i) For major bridges above 300 metres span, proper siting of
the bridge should be the principal
consideration
and
the
approach alignment matched with the same;
(ii) For small bridges less than 60 metres span, fluency of
the
aiignment should govern the choice of the bridge location;
and
(iii) For
spans
between
60
and
300
metres,
the
designer
should use his discretion keeping
in view
the
importance
of the road, overall economic considerations
and aesthe-
tics.
9.2.
Horizontal Carves
9.2.1.
In general, horizontal curves
should
consist
of
a cir-
cular portion flanked
by
spiral
transitions
at
both
ends.

9.3.3.
Methods
of
attaining
superelevation:
The
normal
cambered section of the road
is changed into
superelevated
section
in two stages.
First stage
is
the
removal
of
adverse
camber
in
outer half of the pavement.
In the second stage,
superelevation
is
gradually built up over the full width
of
the
carriageway
so
that
required superelevation
is available at the beginning of
the circular
curve.
There are three different methods for attaining
the
supere-
levation:
(i) revolving pavement about the centre line;
(ii) revolving
pavement about the inner edge; and
(iii) revolving pavement about
the outer edge.
Plate 2
illustrates these methods diagrammatically.
The small cross-sections at the bottom of each diagram indicate the
pavement cross slope condition at different points.
Each of the above methods
is
applicable under
different con-
ditions.
Method
(i) which involves least distortion of the pavement
will be found suitable in most of the situations where
there
are
no
physical
controls,
and may
be
adopted
in
the
normal
course.
Method
(ii)
is preferable where the lower
edge
profile
is
a
major
control, e.g. on account of drainage.
Where overall
appearance
is
the criterion, method
(iii)
is preferable since the outer
edge
profile
which
is most noticeable to drivers
is not distorted.
The superelevation should be attained
gradually over
the full
length of the transition curve so
that
the
design
superelevation
is
available at
the
starting
point of the
circular
portion.
Sketches
in Plate 2 have been drawn on this basis.
In cases where transition
curve cannot for some reason be provided,
two-third superelevation
may be attained on the straight section before start of
the
circular
curve and the balance one-third on the curve.
In developing the required
superelevation,
it
should
be
en-
sured that the longitudinal slope of the pavement edge compared to
the centre-line (i.e. the
rate
of change
of
superelevation)
is
not
steeper than
1 in 150 for roads in plain and rolling terrain, and
1 in
60 in mountainous and steep terrain.
When cross-drainage structures
fall
on
a
horizontal
curve,
their deck should be superelevated in the same manner as described
above.
9.4.
Radii of Horizontal Curves
9.4.1.
On a horizontal curve, the centrifugal
force
is balanc-
ed by the combined effects of superelevation and side friction.
The
22



======================================================================
PAGE 33 of 64
======================================================================
IRC
:
73-1980
basic equation for this condition of equilibrium
is:
^ ^
127 {e^-f )
where
V =
vehicle speed in metre per second
V =
vehicle speed in km/h
g —
acceleration due to gravity in metre per see2
e =
supereleViition ratio in metre per metre
/ =
coefficient of side friction between vehicle tyres and
pavement (taken as 0.15)
R =
radius in metres
Based on
this
equation
and
the maximum
permissible
values of
superelevation given in para 9.3.1. radii for horizontal curves corres-
ponding
to
ruling
minimum and absolute minimum design speeds
are shown in Table
16.
9.4.2.
On new roads, horizontal curves should be designed to
have the largest practicable radius,
generally more than
the values
corresponding to the ruling design speed (see Table
16).
However,
absolute minimum values based on minimum
design
speed
(Table
16) might be resorted to
if economics
of
construction
or
the
site
conditions
so
dictate.
While
improvii^g
existing
roads,
curves
having radii
corresponding
to
absolute
minimum
standards
may
not be flattened unless
it
is necessary to realign the
road
for some
other reasons.
9.5.
Transition Curves
9.5.1.
Transition curves are necessary for a
vehicle
to
have
smooth
entry
from
a
straight
section
into a circular curve.
The
transition
curves
also
improve
aesthetic appearance
of the
road
besides
permitting
gradul
application
of
the
superelevation
and
extra widening
of carriageway
needed
at
.the horizontal
curves.
Spiral curve should be used for this purpose.
9.5.2.
Minimum
length
of
the
transition
curve should
be
determined from the following two
considerations and the larger of
the two values adopted for design.

(i) The rate of change of centrifugal acceleration should
not
cause discomfort to drivers.
From this consideration, the
length of transition curve
is given by:
J _
0.02 15 F»
- ~CR
length of transition in metres
speed in km/h
radius of circular curve in metres
80
(subject to a maximum of
0.8
and
15-\-V
minimum of 0.5)
(ii) The rate of change of superelevation (i.e. the longitudinal
grade
developed
at
the
pavement
edge
compared
to
through grade along the centre line) should be such as not
to cause discomfort
to
travellers
or
to make
the
road
appear unsightly.
Hate of change
should
not be steeper
than
1
in 150 for
roads
in
plain and rolling terrain, and
1 in 60 in mountainous/steep
terrain.
The
formulae
for
minimum length of transition on this basis are:
For Plain ami Rolling Terrain:
J _
2.7
-
T~
For Mountainous and Steep Terrain:
1.0 Fa
9.5.3.
Having
regard
to
the above considerations, the mini-
mum transition lengths for different speeds and curve radii are given
in Table
17.
9.5.4.
The elements of
a
combined
circular
and
transition
curves are illustrated in Fig. 2. For deriving values of the individual
elements like shift, tangent distance, apex distance etc. and
working
out coordinates to lay the curves in the field,
it is convenient to
use
curve tables.

Tables for Horizontal Curves for Highways".

sate the extra width
occupied
by
a
vehicle
on
the
curve
due to
tracking of the rear wheels, and
(ii) psychological widening
to
per-
mit easy crossing of vehicles since vehicles in a lane tend to wander
more on a curve than on a straight reach.
9.6.2.
On two-lane or wider roads
it
is
necessary
that
both,
the above components should be fully catered for so that the lateral
clearance between vehicles on curves
is
maintained
equal
to
the
clearance available on straights.
Position of single-lane roads how-
ever is somewhat different, since during crossing
manoeuvres
outer
wheels of vehicles have in any case to use the shoulders whether on
the straight or on the curve.
It
is therefore sufficient on
single-lane
roads if only the mechanical component of widening
is
taken
into
account.
9.6.3.
Based on the above considerations, the extra width
of
carriageway to be provided at horizontal curves on single
and
two-
lane roads is given in Table
18.
For multi-lane roads, the pavement
widening may be calculated by adding
half the
widening
for two-
lane roads to each lane.

On curves having
no
transition,
widening
should
be achieved in the same way
as
the
superelevation
i,e.
two-third
being attained on the straight section before start of the
curve
and
one-third on the curve.
9.6.5.
The widening should be applied equally on both
sides
of
the
carriageway, except that on hill roads
it will be preferable if
the
entire
widening
is
done
only
on
the
inside.
Similarly,
the
widening should be provided only
on
the
inside when
the
curve
is plain circular and has no transition.

9.6.6.
The
extra
widening may
be
attained
by
means
of
offsets
radial
to
the
centre line.
It
should
be
ensured
that the
pavement edge lines are smooth and there
is no apparent kink.
9.7.
Set-back Distance at Horizontal Curves
9.7.1.
Requisite sight distance
should be available across the
inside of horizontal
curves.
Lack
of visibility in the lateral direc-
tion may
arise
due to obstructions like walls,
cut slopes, buildings,
wooded areas, high farm crops etc.
Distance from the road
centre
line within
which
the
obstructions should be cleared to ensure the
needed visibility,
i.e.
the
"set-back
distance'*, can
be
calculated
vide procedure
described
in para 9.7.2.
But in certain cases, due
to variations
in
alignment, road
cross-section, and
the type
and
location of obstructions,
it may
become
necessary to resort to field
measurements to determine the limits of clearance.
9.7.2.
The set-back distance
is calculated from the following
equation (see Fig. 3 for definitions);
m = /?~(^— «) Cos e
where
6 =
—^
radians;
Z{^j\-—n)
m = the minimum
set-back distance to sight obstruction in
metres (measured from the centre line of the road);
R = radius at centre line of the road in metres;
n = distance
between
the
centre
line of the road and the
centre line of the inside lane in metres; and
5 = sight distance in metres
In the above equation,
sight
distance
is measured along the middle
of inner lane.
On
single-lane
roads,
sight
distance
is measured
along centre line of the road and
is taken as zero.
9.7.3.
Based
on
the
above equation,
design charts for
set-
back
distance
corresponding
to
the
safe
stopping
sight distance
are given in Fig. 4.
9.7.4.
Set-back
distance
for overtaking or intermediate sight
distance
can
be
computed
similarly but the clearance required
is
usually too
large
to
be
economically
feasible except on very
flat
curves.
9.7.5. When there is a cut slope on the inside of the horizontal
curve, the average height of sight line can be used as an approxima-
tion
for
deciding
the
extent
of
clearance.

distance, which
is the bare minimum requirement
for
design,
the
average height may be
taken as 0.7 m.
Cut slopes should be kept
lower than this height at the
line demarcating the set-back distance
envelope, either
by cutting back the slope or benching suitably.
In
the case of intermediate or overtaking sight distance,
height of sight
line above the ground should be taken as
1.2 m.
9.7.6.
Where horizontal and summit vertical curves
overlap,
the design
should
provide
for
the
required sight distance both in
the vertical
direction
along
the
pavement
and
in
the horizontal
direction on the inside of the curve.
9.8.
Hair-pin Bends
In
hilly
areas
it may become difficult to avoid beitds where
direction of
the
road
reverses.
Design
criteria
for
such
bends,
commonly known as the hair-pin bends, are dealt with
in' para
10.5.
10.
VERTICAL ALIGNMENT
10.1.
General
10.1.1.
The vertical alignment should provide
for
a
smooth
longitudinal profile consistent with
category
of
the
road
and
lay
of the
terrain,
Grade
changes
should
not
be too frequent as to
cause
kinks
and
visual
discontinuities
in
the profile.
Desirably,
there should be no change in grade within a distance of 150 m.
10.1.2.
A
short
valley curve within an otherwise continuous
profile is
undesirable
since
this
tends
to
distort
the
perspective
view and can be hazardous,
10.1.3.
Broken-back
grade
lines,
i.e.
two
vertical
curves
in
the
same
direction
separated
by
a
short
tangent,
should be
avoided due to poor appearance and preferably replaced by a single
long curve,
10.1.4.
Decks of small cross-drainage structures, (i.e. culverts
and minor bridges) should follow the same
profile
as
the
flanking
road section, without any break in the grade line.
10.1.5.
The longitundinal profile should be co-ordinated suit-
ably with the horizontal alignment.
This is discussed in Section
11.
10.2.
Gradients
10.2.1.
Grades should be carefully selected keeping
in
view
the
design
speed,
terrain
conditions and nature of traffic expected

It
is difficult and costly to flatten the gradients
later.
10.2.2. Recommended gradients for different classes of terrain
are given in Table 19.

10.2.3.
Gradients upto the 'ruling gradient' may
be
used as
a matter of course in design. However in special
situations such
as
isolated
over-bridges
in
flat
country
or roads
carrying
a
large
volume of slow moving traffic,
it will be desirable to adopt a
flatter
gradient of 2 per cent from the angle of aesthetics, traffic operations,
and safety.
10.2.4.
The 'limiting gradients' may be used where the
topo-
graphy of a place compels this course
or
where
the
adoption
of
gentler gradients would add enormously to the cost.
In such cases,
the length of continuous
grade
steeper
than
the
ruling
gradient
should be as short as possible.
10.2.5.
'Exceptional gradients' are meant to be adopted only
in very difficult situations and for short lengths not exceeding 100 m
at a stretch.
In mountainous and steep terrain,
successive stretches
of exceptional gradients must be separated by a minimum
length of
100 m having gentler gradient (i.e. limiting gradient or flatter).
10.2.6.
The rise in elevation over a length of 2 km
shall
not
exceed 100 m'in mountainous terrain and 120 m in steep terrain.
10.2.7.
Minimum gradients for drainage: On unkerbed pave-
ments
in
embankment,
near-level
grades
are
not
objectionable
when the pavement has sufficient camber to drain the
storm
water
33



======================================================================
PAGE 44 of 64
======================================================================
IRC

laterally.
However, in cut sections or where the pavement is provi-
ded with kerbs,
it is
necessary
that
the
road
should
have
some
gradient for eflScient
drainage.
Desirable
minimum
gradient
for
this purpose is 0.5 per cent
if the side drains
are
lined
and
1.0 per
cent if these are unlined.
10.2.8.
Grade compensation at curves on hill roads:
At hori-
zontal curves, the gradients should be eased by an
amount
known
as the *grade compensation' which
is
intended to
offset
the
extra
tractive effort involved at curves.
This should be
calculated
from
the following formula:
Grade
compensation (per cent) =
-~—~—
,
subject to a maximum of 751R where R
is
the
radius
of
the curve in metres.
Since grade compensation is not necessary for gradients flatter than
4 per cent, when applying grade compensation correction, the grad-
ients need not be eased beyond 4 per cent.
10.3.
Vertical Cur?€S
10.3.1.
Vertical curves are introduced for
smooth
transition
at grade changes..
Convex vertical curves
are
known
as summit
curves and concave vertical curves as valley
or
sag
curves.
Both
these should be designed as square
parabolas.
10.3.2.
The length of the vertical curves
is controlled by sight
distance requirements, but curves with greater
length
are
aestheti-
cally better.
10.3.3.
Curves should be provided at all grade changes exce-
eding those indicated
in
Table 20.
For
satisfactory
appearance,
the minimum length should be as shown in the Table.

Summit Curves:
10.4.1.
The
length
of summit
curves
is governed
by
the
choice of sight distance.
The length
is
calculated on
the basis of
the following formulae:
(a) For safe stopping sight distance
Case (i) When the length of the curve
exceeds the required
sight distance,
i.e. L is greater than S
^ - ~4A'
where
N —

i.e.
the
algebraic difference
between the two grades
L =
length of parabolic vertical curve in metres
S =
sight distance in metres
Case (ii) When the length
of
the
curve
is
less
than
the
required sight distance,
i.e. L is less than S
(b) For intermediate or overtaking
sight distance
Case (i) When the length of the curve
exceeds the required
sight distance,
i.e. L Is greater than S
^ - "9X
Case (ii) When
the
length
of
the
curve
is
less than the
required sight distance,
i.e. L is less than S
L=2S- N
10.4.2. The length of summit curve for various cases mentioned
above can be read from Plates 3, 4 and
5.
In
these
Plates,
value
of the ordinate ''M" to the
curve
from
the
intersection

of
grade lines is also shown.

Design Criteria for Hair-Pin Bends
10.6.1.
Hair-pin bends, where unavoidable, may be designed
either as a circular curve with transition at each
end, or as a
com-
pound circular curve.
The following
criteria
should
be
followed
normally for their design:
(a) Minimum design speed
...
20 km/h
(b) Minimum roadway width at apex
(i) National/State Highways
...
11.5 m for double-lane
9.0 m for single-lane
(ii) Major District Roads and
Other District Roads

(iii)
Village Roads

10.6.2.
Inner
and
outer
edges
of
the
roadway should be
concentric with respect to centre line of
the
pavement.
Where

number of hair-pin. bends have to be introduced^ a minimum inter-
vening distance of 60 m should be provided
between the successive
bends to enable the driver to negotiate the alignment smoothly.
10.6.3.
Widening of hair-pin bends subsequently is a difl&cult
and costly process.
Moreover, gradients tend
to become
sharper
as generally widening can be achieved only
by cutting the hill side.
These points should be kept in view at the planning stage, especially
if a series of hair-pin bends is involved.
10.6.4.
At hair-pin bends, preferably the
full roadway width
should be surfaced.
11. CO-ORDINATION OF HORIZONTAL AND
VERTICAL ALIGNMENTS
11.1.
The overall
appearance of a highway can be enhanced
considerably by judicious combination of the horizontal and vertical
alignments.
Plan and
profile
of the road should not be designed
independently but in unison so as to produce an appropriate
three-
dimensional effect.
Proper co-ordination in this respect will ensure
safety,
improve
utility
of
the
highway
and contribute to
overall
aesthetics.
11.2.
The
degree
of
curvature
should be in proper balance
with the gradients. Straight alignment or flat horizontal curves at the
expense
of
steep
or long grades,
or excessive curvature in a road
with flat grades, do not constitute balanced designs and
should
be
avoided.
11.3.
Vertical
curvature
superimposed upon horizontal cur-
vature gives a pleasing effect.
As such the vertical
and
horizontal
curves should coincide as far as.possible and their length should
be
more or less equal.
If this is difficult for any reason, the horizontal
curve should be somewhat longer than the vertical curve.
11.4.
Sharp
horizontal
curves
should be avoided at or near
the apex
of pronounced
summit/sag
vertical
curves
from
safety
considerations.
11.5.
Plate 7 illustrates some typical cases of good
and bad
alignment co-ordination.
12. LATERAL AND VERTICAL CLEARANCES
AT UNDERPASSES
12.1.
Lateral Clearance
12.1.1.
Desirably
the
full roadway width at the
approaches
should
be
carried
through
the
underpass.
This implies that
the
37



======================================================================
PAGE 48 of 64
======================================================================
IRC
: 73-1980
minimum
lateral
clearance
(i.e.
the distance between the extreme
edge of the carriageway and the face of nearest support, whether
a
solid abutment,
pier
or
column) should equal the normal shoulder
width.
12.1.2.
On lower category roads in hill areas having compara-
tively narrow shoulders,
it will be
desirable to increase the roadway
width at
underpasses
to a certain extent keeping in view para
6.3.
and the principles set forth in
IRC:54-1974 "Lateral
and
Vertical
Clearances at Underpasses for Vehicular Traffic''
12.1.3.
For desirable lateral clearances
at dual
carriageway
roads, reference may be made to IRC: 54- 1974.
12.2.
Vertical Clearance
12.2.1.
Vertical clearance at underpasses should be minimum
5 metres after making due allowance for any
future
raising/streng-
thening of the underpass roadway.
