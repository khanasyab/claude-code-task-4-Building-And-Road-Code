404. PLANNING CONSTRUCTION AND WORKMANSHIP
404.1 .
Necessary Information
404. 1.1.
For efficient planning, design and execution ofworks,
detailed information with regard to the following shall be furnished
to those responsible for such works:
(a)
Layout plan showing the orientation of the structure.
(b)
Dimension details of the structure with details of sections and levels
of foundation/ground levels, clear height from floor/ground level to
soffit, size and span, etc.
(c
) Type of stone/brick/block and class of masonry, types of bond and
final finish for the masonry, the mix of the mortar to be used,
etc.,
details of structural features, moulding and other special work.
(d)
Location and other details of embedments, like, water pipes, electrical
pipes, weep holes and junction, etc.
404.1.2.
Mortar
404.1.2.1. The mortar shall be mixed
in the approved
proportions. The mix shall be clean and free from materials, like,
soil/acid/alkali/organic matter or deleterious substances.
404.1.2.2.
Proportioning and mixing mortar: All mortar
shall be mixed by following the proportions specified. All the
mortar shall be mixed with minimum amount of water to get
maximum density with adequate workability. The mixing shall be
done intimately
in a mechanical mixer.
Hand mixing can be
resorted to so long as uniform density of the mix and its strength
are assured but shall only be allowed for very small and isolated
works, like, CD works. Hand mixing operation shall be carried
out on a clean watertight platform where
it is first mixed dry and
after obtaining a uniform colour, water shall be added. The mortar
shall then be mixed for not less than two minutes.
20



======================================================================
PAGE 31 of 52
======================================================================
IRC: 40-2002
For cement mortar gauged with lime, lime and sand shall be
ground into mortar. Immediately before use, the specified proportion
ofcement shall be added to a small quantity ofthe mortar and intimately
mixed for obtaining uniform distribution of cement.
404.1.2.3. The use ofretempered mortar shall not be permitted.
Mortar shall be mixed in such quantity as required for immediate
use. The mix, which has developed initial set, shall not be used.
Initial
set of mortar made with ordinary portland cement shall
normally be considered to take place in 30 minutes after mixing.
In case, the mortar has stiffened during initial setting time because
of evaporation of water, the same can be retempered by adding
water as frequently as needed to restore the requisite consistency
but this retempering shall not be permitted after 30 minutes of
mixing.
If at any
site, use of admixtures to mortar
is found
necessary, they shall be tested for suitability before use.
The cement mortar gauged with lime shall be used within half
an hour of mixing cement.
404.1.2.4. Test of mortar: Necessary tests to determine
compressive strength of the mortar,
its consistency and water
resistivity shall be carried out in accordance with IS:2250. For
compressive strength tests, the frequency of testing shall be
1 cube
for every 2 cubicmetre of mortar prepared subject to a minimum
of 3 cubes for a day's work.
It may be borne in mind that, in addition to compressive strength
of mortar,
its resistance against shear and
also
its adhesion or
bond with masonry unit are factors which affect the strength of the
mortar and of the masonry. The performance of mortar in this
respect will depend not only upon the bond developed in initial
stages of hardening of mortar but also on extent to which bond
21



======================================================================
PAGE 32 of 52

in
18:2250-1965.
404.2.
Brick Masonry
404.2.1. Brick masonry, in general, shall conform to the
requirements of !S:2212 "Code of Practice for Brick Work".
404.2.2. Wetting of bricks: All bricks immediately before
being laid, shall be thoroughly wetted in tank so as to have sufficient
moisture to effect a proper bond between the brick and mortar.
Minimum period of soaking prior to use shall be
1 hour. Soaked
brick shall be removed from the tank sufficiently in advance so
that they are skin dry at the time of actual laying. Two tanks shall
be provided one to soak the bricks and other to stack the wetted
bricks to remove the excess water and make bricks surface dry.
404.2.3. All brickwork shall be laid in English Bond, even and
true to line, plumb, level and all joints as specified. The bricks to
be used on the face and at all angles forming the junction of any
two walls shall be whole bricks of uniform size and rectangular
faces (Fig. 7).

404.2.4.
Mortar beds and other joints: All bricks shall be
laid with
fro^^ up,
if any, on a
full bed of mortar. When laying
brick shall be slightly pressed so that the mortar gets mto all the
hollow space of bricks to ensure proper adhesion. All head and
side joints shall be completely filled by applying sufficient mortar
to bricks already in place and on brick to be placed and the joint
shall not be more than 10 mm thick. All joints shall be properly
flushed and packed with mortar so that no hollow spaces are left.
All joints on exposed faces shall be tooled to give concave finish.
No brickbats or cut bricks shall be used except where absolutely
required for obtaining the dimensions of the different courses,
specified bond and for the desired shape. The brickwork shall be
built in uniform layers. Comers and other advanced work shall be
raked back. Brickwork shall be done true to plumb or in a specified
batter. During construction, the height of brickwork shall be
restricted to
1 metre at a time above the general construction level
to avoid settlement and improper jointing.
Steel tee or a straight
edge and plumb bob shall be used for constant checking during
progress of the work.
404.2.5.
Pointing: Pointing shall be carried out by using
cement sand mortar not leaner than 1:3. The mortar shall be filled
and pressed into the raked out joints before giving the required
finish. The superfluous mortar shall then be taken off from the
edges of the lines and the surface of the masonry shall be cleaned
of all mortar.
It shall conform to provisions of IS:2212. Raised
pointing which projects beyond the face of stone, brick or block
is
likely to get damaged due to floods or carbonation process and
hence should be avoided.

Plastering
404.2.6.1.
Plastering may be done only where
it is essential.
Sacrificial plastering, which means an additional layer ofplastering,
may be done only in selected parts ofthe structures over fast flowing
rivers or in severe aggressive environment.
404.2.6.2.
Plastering shall be started from top and worked
downwards. All putlog holes shall be properly filled in advance of
the plastering as the scaffolding is taken down. Wooden screeds
75 mm wide and of the thickness of the plaster shall be fixed
vertically 2.5 to 4.0 m apart to act as gauges and guides in applying
the plaster.
Prior to laying plaster, the surface of the wall should
be wetted. The mortar shall be laid on the wall between the screeds
using the mason's wooden float and pressing the mortar so that
the raked joints are properly filled. The plaster shall then be finished
off with a wooden straight edge reaching across the screeds. The
straight edge shall be worked on the screeds with a small upward
and sideways motion 50 mm or 75 mm at a time. Finally the surface
shall be finished off with mason's wooden float. Metal floats shall
not be used. When recommencing the plastering beyond the work
suspended earlier, the edges of the old plaster shall be scrapped
clean and wetted before plaster is applied to the adjacent areas.
No portion of the surface shall be left out initially to be patched up
later on. Plaster shall be finished to a true and plumb surface and
to the proper degree of smoothness as required by the Engineer.
The average thickness of the plaster shall not be less than the
specified thickness. The minimum thickness over any portion of
the surface shall not be less than the specified thickness by more
than 3 mm. Any cracks which appear in the surface and all portions

shall be done carefully so as not to disturb or wash out green mortar.
In case of composite mortar, curing should commence two days
after laying of masonry and shall continue for seven days.
404.2.7.2. Curing in hot weather has to be done for all finished
or partly completed work by covering and wetting in such manner
as will prevent rapid drying of the work.
404.2.7.3. Curing of finishes shall be started as soon as mortar
of pointing/plastering has hardened sufficiently so as not to be
damaged when watered.
It shall be kept wet for a period of at least
seven days.
404.2.7.4. During the period of curing, masonry work and
plastering shall be suitably protected from
all damages.
At the
close of the day's work or for any other period of cessation of
work, watering and curing shall have to be maintained.
Should
the mortar perish,
i.e., become dry, white or powdery through
neglect of curing, work shall be pulled down and rebuilt.
If any
stain appears during watering, the same should be removed from
the surface.

on which bricks will be laid. Immediately thereafter, the first course
of bricks shall be laid.
404.2.9.
Where future extension is contemplated, arrangement
suitable for developing bond between old and new masonry shall
be made at the out set.
404.2.10.
Joining old and new work: When fresh masonry
is to join with masonry that is partially or entirely set, the exposed
joining surface of the set masonry shall be cleaned, roughened and
wetted so as to effect the best possible bond with the new work.
All loose bricks and mortar or other materials shall be removed. In
the case of vertical or inclined joints, it shall be further ensured so
that proper bonds between the old and new masonry is obtained
by interlocking the bricks. Any portion ofbrick work that has been
completed shall remain undisturbed until thoroughly set.
404.2.11.
In case of sharp comer, specially in skew bridge, a
flat face of 100 mm shall be provided so as to have proper and
bonded laying of bricks.

for cement mortar since it segregates. Mortar may be fluid mixed
thoroughly and then poured in the joints. No dry or hollow space
shall be left anywhere in the masonry and each stone shall have all
the embedded faces completely covered with mortar.
404.3.4.6.

carefully in place with a wooden mallet immediately on placement
and solidly embedded in mortar before it has set. Clean chips and
spalls shall be wedged into the mortar joints and beds wherever
necessary to avoid thick beds or joints of mortar. No hollow space
shall be left anywhere in the masonry and each stone shall have all
the embedded
faces completely covered with the mortar. The
quantity of mortar consumed per cubic metre of stone masonry
shall be 0.25 to 0.30 cubic metre. For masonry works over rock, a
levelling course of cement concrete M-15 grade and having
minimum average thickness 150 mm shall be laid over rock and
then stone masonry work shall be
laid. The quantity of mortar
consumed per cubic meters of various type ofmasonry are generally

fitted dry, in order that any inaccuracy may be discovered and
corrected by stone cutter before
it is finally laid into mortar and
settled in its bed.
While carrying out haunch filling and cushioning (and also
while removing these during repairs) care shall be taken to ensure
stability of arch and also to avoid unsymmetrical loading on the
substructure and arch.
Cross camber shall be provided in the
top surface of concrete of haunch
filling and corresponding
drain holes in the face wall to facilitate easy drainage of seepage
water.
404.5.3,
Scaffolding:
The scaffolding in general shall be
sound and strong and shall be able to withstand all loads likely to
come upon
it. The holes left in masonry work for supporting the
scaffolding shall be filled and made good.
404.5.4.
Centering
404.5.4.1. The successful completion of an arch largely
depends on the design, construction and stripping of the centering.
Therefore, considerable thought should be given to the method
used in supporting an arch ring.
For design considerations, the
IRC:87 may be consulted.
Note
: Centering for special condition
shall be designed by experienced
Engineer who has the requisite theoretical and practical knowledge in
this field.
404.5.4.2. The number of full sets ofcentering required depend
upon the number of arch spans. For two or three spans, two or
three sets may be used. For five or more spans, three or more sets
35



======================================================================
PAGE 46 of 52
======================================================================
IRC: 40-2002
may be used depending on the location of the abutment pier. For
wide bridges,
it may sometimes be more economical to build the
centering for half width of the bridge and move sideways for the
other half. However, reference may be made
to IRC:87
"Guidelines for the Design and Erection of Falsework for Road
Bridges".
404.5.5.
Stripping
404.5.5.1. Wedges should be struck in pairs from the crown
outwards
to the springing line loosening them gradually without
shock to the arch ring. About half the wedges can be removed in
seven days and used in the adjoining arch. Centering should not
be struck under 2 to 4 weeks, 3 weeks being the usual time for
arches under 30 m span. Arches with higher ratio of rise to span
can be stripped earlier than those with lower ratio. All braces except
those that may be required for supporting scaffolding plank can be
removed. For high arches, stripping should commence at the top
taking down tier by tier.
404.5.5.2.
In multiple span arch bridges, centering must not
struck and stripped before the adjoining arch is built. Sometimes
it
is required that one or two arches may be kept undisturbed
between the arch last built and the arch being stripped off
404.5.5.3. Striking of centering: Centering shall not be struck
until the masonry has sufficiently hardened to maintain
its own
weight and the haunch portions are filled to half the rise in circular
arches and
1/3 rise in segmental arches. Where
it is intended to
reuse the formwork,
it shall be cleaned and made good to the
satisfaction of the Engineer.

405. EXPANSION GAP
IRC: 40-2002
405.1.
In case of long walls, an expansion gap of 40 mm
shall be provided for every 30 m length of wall. The gap should
be filled with premoulded bituminous sheet or any suitable flexible
material.
405.2.
Where foundations of abutments and returns walls
are at different levels, a gap of at least 40 mm in
width must be
left to separate them.

Annexure
(Ref. Clause 400)
SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF
MASONRY DURING FREEZING WEATHER
1. Storage
Masonry materials should be stored and protected at the job
site to prevent damage from wet, cold or freezing weather. Bagged
materials and masonry units should be stored elevated to prevent
migratioji of moisture from the ground and covered to protect the
sides and tops. Consideration should be given to the method
of stock piling sand
to permit heating of the materials,
if
required.
2. Forms and Shoring
Provide substantial and tight forms to prevent leakage ofmortar
or grout. Brace or shore forms to maintain position and shape. Do
not remove forms or shoring until masonry has hardened
sufficiently to carry its own weight and any other temporary loads
that may be placed on it during construction.
3.
Surface Conditions
Ice or snow that has formed on the masonry bed shall be thawed
by application of heat.
Apply heat carefully until top surface is
dry to the touch. Any section of completed masonry work that is
deemed frozen and damaged shall be removed before continuing
construction of that section.
38



======================================================================
PAGE 49 of 52
======================================================================
IRC: 40-2002
4. Condition of Masonry Units
(i)
Use only dry masonry units except as permitted below. Wet or
frozen masonry units shall not be laid. No wetting of concrete
masonry units will be permitted.
(ii)
For brick masonry units used in cold weather construction, initial
rates of absorption may range to a maximum of 35 mg. When
sprinkling is required to achieve proper absorption rates, heated
water shall be used.
Water shall be above 20 degrees C when
temperature of units is above freezing point and above 55 degrees
C when temperature of units is below freezing point.
