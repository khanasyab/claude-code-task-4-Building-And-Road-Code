CHAPTER

INTRODUCTION
Bridge inspection
is not merely a routine but an art, wherein
special
techniques and
exacting knowledge have
to
be
applied
to ascertain the physical
condition of
the
structure
and
recom-
mend suitable remedial
measures for portions adversely
affected.
At present the maintenance practice
in various States varies
and only
a handful of them have compiled the requirements of
periodic
inspection
and
maintenance
of
highway
bridges,
for
the use of their
staff.
It
is with the aim of providing uniformity
throughout the country and to serve
as guidelines
to the mainte-
nance engineers that this Manual on Highway Bridge Maintenance
Inspection
has
been
prepared
embracing
all
vital
aspects
like
status of inspecting
staff,
periodicity of inspection, records to be
maintained, complete
list of items to be
inspected,
etc.
The
utility of such a manual will go a long way in not only
maintaining our
old
obsolete
structures,
by undertaking timely
repairs/strengthening measures where necessary but also keeping
a
constant watch on our new
sophisticated
bridges
constructed
with
critical
designs and optimum
use
of
materials.

CHAPTER 2
RECORDS
2.1.
General
The
prime
need
for
any
bridge
maintenance
inspection
operation
is
a
complete
accurate
and up-to-date record
of
the
bridge.
The
utility of
field investigations
is
little served without
the
maintenance
of
proper
records.
The
records
should
thus
provide
a complete up-to-date history of the structure right from
the stages of construction.
2.2.
Bridge
Register
For maintenance
of
records
of
bridges,
a bridge register as
indicated
at Appendix
/, shall be used.
One bridge' register may
include the
reports
in
respect
of
several
bridges.
However,
for
each
bridge
there
must
be two
reports
i.e.
(i)
Original
Bridge
Report,
and
(ii)
Inspection
Report.
The reports
prepared
em-
bracing
all the important points as detailed under paras 3 and
4"
should be complete, clear and concise so that they could be easily
understood
without
any
ambiguity.
These
reports
shall
be
maintained by the concerned Works Division so as to make these
available
to
the
inspecting
officers.

CHAPTER 4
INSPECTION
4.1.
Time
of
Inspection
It
is
desirable to undertake inspections
in
those periods of
the year which
offer the most
critical evaluation
of the
perfor-
mance of the structure,
e.g. items such as foundations, protective
works, scour
effects, maximum
flood
levels etc. during and
after
the monsoons,
high
structures
affected by strong winds
during
those seasons when such winds are prevalent bearings and joints
during temperature extremes when there is likelihood of maximum
movement,
etc.
Apart from above, special inspections shall also
be undertaken
for unusual occurrences
like earthquake, passage
of
abnormal
loads,
etc.,
to
ascertain
the
performance
of
the
structure.
To
assess whether repairs have been carried or
not,
inspections should
generally be undertaken
after the monsoons.
4.2.
Status of Inspecting Officer and Frequency of Inspection
All
bridges
shall
be
inspected
by
a
competent
qualified
engineer once a year. However, bridges located in hilly terrain and
prone to effects of slips,
etc., shall be inspected twice a year
i.e.,
once before the monsoons and then
after the monsoons are over.
In
addition,
all major and
special type bridges
like
prestressed
concrete continuous
structures,
suspension bridges, cable stayed
girder bridges, etc. should also be inspected by a senior engineer.
4.3.
Inspection
Report
The inspection reports should cover the items
listed
in the
proforma
for
inspection
report
at pages 33 to 39
of
the
Bridge
Register
given
in
Appendix
I.
The
inspecting
officer
must
observe and report any structural
deficiency,
assess
its serious-
ness, recognise and
indicate
areas
of the bridge where any pro-
blems can be expected and suggest suitable preventive maintenance
measures.
Items
needing
urgent
attention
must
be
brought
immediately to the notice of the Competent Authority for under-
taking
necessary
remedial
measures.
The
items
of
inspection
as listed in the proforma for inspection report are briefly elucidated
below
for the guidance of the inspecting
officer.



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 52
======================================================================
16
Inspection
(1)
Approaches
The
inspecting
officer
shall
inspect- the
approaches
in
the
vicinity
of
the
bridge and check for unevenness, settlements
if any, cracking of the pavement, camber, longitudinal gradient,
proper functioning of the drainage
facility, damages to the guard
rails,
condition
of
approach
slabs,
erosion
or
damages
to
the
embankment,
settlement
or disturbance
of the slopes,
etc.
The
approach slabs shall also be examined for any untoward cracking,
movement away from
the
dirt wall and
to
see
that
no
portion
rests
on
the
wing
walls/cantilever
returns.
(2)
Protective Works
The protective works
like guide bunds,
spurs,
pitching
around
abutments,
etc.,
shall
be
inspected
during
the
floods
to
ascertain
the HFL,
scour
depth,
launching
of
apron,
etc.
and
after floods to examine the condition of existing slopes and
slope
pitching and adequacy of the apron.
The inspecting officer must
look for aspects
like launching of the apron, settling of the slope,
piping
action,
improper drainage
of
the
rain water causing the
slope to be disturbed, impact of waves carrying away the smaller
particles and thus disturbing
the
slope, any undue scour
at the
nose
of the bund and/or
at the toe
of the pitching and
give
his
recommendations
to
ensure
that
the
protective works
function
adequately.
The quantity of reserve stones available
at
site
for
meeting
emergent
situations
shall
be
checked
before
floods,
against
specified
quantity
and
duly
reported.
The
floor protection shall also be inspected both during
and after the floods to ascertain the extent of scour, cracking and
damage of the floor
if any, adequacx of the cut off walls and apron,
etc.
Specific recommendations
for augmentation
of the existing
provisions
if any shall also be given.
(3)
Waterway
The inspecting
officer shall inspect the waterway under
the bridge during the floods and
report about the following:
(i) The maximum
flood
love!
ohsorvcd
^iiul how
it compare?
with
the
design HFL.
(ii) The maximum observed afflux
(iii) The maximum
observed
scour,
its
loc.ition
.md
how
it
compares
with the design scour vahies.



======================================================================
PAGE 27 of 52
======================================================================
Inspectioti
17
(iv) Any abnormal change
in
the flow
pattern
both on
the
u/s. and
d/s.
of the bridge
;
(explain by sketch).
(v) Any
obstruction
in
the
waterway
like
presence
of
undergrowth
blocking a span or projection of the hard bank deflecting the stream
resulting in only part of the waterway being effective,
etc.
(vi) Whether the waterway provided
is adequate or not?
(4)
Foundations
The foundations being usually below the bed
level shall
be
inspected
during
high
floods
to
ascertain
adequacy
of
the
foundations
by comparing
the
observed maximum
scour
with
the design yalues and suggest suitable remedial measures
if the
foundations are
likely
to be endangered.
This can be achieved
by taking soundings around
the foundations.
In
case
of
deep
well
foundations,
to
ascertain
the maximum
depth
of
scour,
soundings
at regular
intervals during the
flood,
will have to be
taken.
Where sophisticated sounding techniques
are not
avail-
able the desired data may be collected by resorting to approximate
gauging
methods
like
a
weight
hung
from
a wire.
Further,
special attention be
laid on foundations resting in rock with the
overburden having
a tendency
to
get scoured and endangering
the
foundations.
The
scour
depths
in
such
cases
be
recorded
regularly
during
the floods with
a
view to
ensure the safety
of
foundations.
After the floods, the inspecting officer shall inspect
the
general
condition
of
the
foundations
to
ascertain
aspects
like cracking,
disintegration,
decay,
erosion,
cavitation, damage
due
to
impact
of
floating
bodies
in
the
river,
etc.
A remark
shall be added
in the inspection report
if the foundations cannot
be
inspected due
to presence
of water.
(5)
Sub-structure
(Piers, abutment and wing
walls)
The
inspecting
officer
shall
inspect
the
sub-structure
usually during dry weather when the flow in the river
is the mini-
mum, and report in respect of the following
:
(i) Concrete or RCC piers, abutments and wing walls for damages due to
impact,
cracks,
spalling
or
disintegration
of
concrete
particularly
at construction joints and
at the top where the superstructure
rests.
The spalied or cracked
sections
shall
be checked
to
ascertain upto
what
extent
guniting
or
reintegration
by
rich
cement
mortar
or
epoxy mortar
could
be
done
to
restore
the
structure
to
a
safe
condition.
(ii) Exposed
faces
of abutment* for
presence
of
any moisture indicating
inadequate
drainage
of
the
backfill,
proper

in
the
river.
(6)
Bearings
All
bearings
shall
normally
be
inspected
during
tem-
perature extremes and after the floods have passed.
They should
however,
also be
inspected
for unusual
occurrences
like
earth-
quakes, passage of excessive
traffic
loads,
unprecedented
floods
and battering on account of the same.
While inspecting different
types of bearings the following shall be kept
in mind
:
(i)
Metallic
Bearings
:
The metallic
bearings
shall be
inspected to ascertain
:

;
(b)
the proper functioniihg of bearings by observing excessive movements
if any, unusual
tilting of
the
rollers,
rollers jumping
off
the guides,
etc.
;
(c)
the
condition
of
the

The elastomeric
bearings
shall be inspected
to
ascer-
tain the following
:
(a) The physical condition of the pads
like oxidation,
creep,
flattening,
bulging, splitting, etc.
(b) the
cleanliness
of
the

particularly to
avoid contact with grease, oil, petrol, etc.
(7)
Superstructure
The inspecting
officer
shall
inspect the superstructure
and report
in respect of the following
:
(i) Reinforced concrete members
(a) The
stems
of
concrete
girders
shall
be examined
for
spalled,
disintegrated, cracked
or honey-combed areas,
specially over the bearings
;
(b) Webs
of box girders shall be inspected for cracks which
may occur due
to temperature
stresses
;
(c)
The soffit of the lower slab in box girder structures and
outside
faces
of
girders
shall
be
examined
for
any
significant cracks
;
(d) The articulation of concrete girder bridge being a vulner-
able part shall be examined for cracks.
In case cracks
are noticed suitable tell-tales
shall be put up to observe
them minutely and to ascertain whether the cracks are
developing further or not
;
(e)
For over-bridges, the under-side of the girders
shall be
examined
for
any damage
due
to
loads
of
excessive
height passing under the over-bridge
;
(f)
Any unusual
deflection
or vibration observed
shall be
recorded
;
(g) The

Inspection
shall be examined
to
ascertain the extent
of
deteriora-
tion, specially in areas where deck
is affected by saline
water or sea breeze.
In
cases
of
asphaltic
wearing
surface,
real
condition
of the deck may not be visible.
In such cases large cracks in the
wearing surface
are often
indications
of deck damage.
Efforts
shall be made to examine such areas by removing the asphaltic
wearing
coat.
Often the
inside
of the
deck
in such
cases
also
reveals the area
of distress or deterioration and thorough exam-
ination
of
the same should
be resorted
to.
Any
evidence
of
water passing through the cracks of the deck shall be recorded.
As a remedial measure,
it
is normal practice to repair cracks or
honey-combed areas by grouting or guniting with epoxy mortar.
(ii)
Prestressed
concrete members.—The
prestressed
con-
crete members
shall be examined
for
loss
of camber,
excessive
deflection, distress due to buckling, cracking and deterioration of
concrete,
cracking or
spalling
in
the
area around
the
bearings
and at cast-in-place diaphragms where creep and humping of the
girders may have an effect must be looked
for.
Where cracking
is found, location and size shall be noted and
tell-tales
installed
to watch
their
future
development.
The end anchorages
shall
be examined
for water
tightness and
corrosion
of
prestressing
wires.
(iii)
Structural
steel members.—The
structural
steel mem-
bers like trusses, girders, stringers, railings, etc. shall be checked
for
corrosion
cracking,
condition
and
looseness
of
any
bolts,
rivets and welds
in connections,
etc.
The
flanges and' webs
of
all sections shall be checked
for damage, misalignment and
the
web
stiffness for buckling.
All joints shall be checked
for their
worthiness.
The bolted joints of new bridges shall be got tight-
ened after one year of service.
All components of the truss mem-
bers must be checked in respect of alignment and any kinks and
bow in the members.
Any eccentricity in the connecting details
be
recorded.
The
bracing
shall
be
examined
for
any
traffic
damage and whether they are properly adjusted and functioning
satisfactorily.
Any
loss of camber
in the main girders assessed
from comparative readings
shall be recorded.
The
condition of paint
shall
be examined
and
the
extent
of corrosion
if any recorded.
The paint
shall never be allowed

to deteriorate to the extent that rusting
occurs.
Since the con-
necting
details
are more
susceptible
to
corrosion more
detailed
examination
of
these
units
shall
be done
specially
looking
for
deformation in reveted or bolted multiplate sections where mois-
ture may have entered and corroded the
plates.
Earth,
leaves
and any debris
at the members/joints shall be indicated
for
re-
moval, as they hasten the corrosive action.
In old bridges, with
trusses, deck system shall be examined to ascertain their adequacy
to carry present day loads.
Often, the existing deck load can be
removed to allow for higher traffic loads.
All these aspects shall
be examined
keeping
the
overall
safety and
the
serviceability
of the structure.
Unusual vibrations if observed shall be recorded.
(iv) Masonry arches.—The
drainage
facilities
at the
span-
drel walls of earth filled arch bridges shall be inspected to ascertain
whether
moisture
is
locked
up
in
filling.
The
spandrel
walls
shall be checked to ascertain that they do not separate from the
arch rings and they do provide lateral support to the
fill above the
arch rings.
The
condition
of
the
masonry
arch
ring
and
mortar
joints, presence of cracks, condition
of
plaster,
etc.
shall be
re-
corded.
Cracks,
shall be marked by red
paint
for
their
entire
lengths and
dated
tell-tales
placed
at
their
extremities and
in
between and numbered.
The
pattern
of
the
cracks and
their
location be recorded.
The flattening of the
profile of the
arch,
if
any,
shall
be
recorded.
All
vegetational
growth
shall
be
recorded
and
steps
suggested
for
their
removal.
(v)
Timber components.—As
timber components are more
susceptible to deterioration than concrete and
steel, they should
receive
more
careful
inspection
and
maintenance.
All
timber
members must be examined
for
decay,
rot,
splits,
evidence
of
failure,
etc., which impair the strength and
serviceability of the
member.
All splice
points
shall
be
checked
for
soundness
in shear
connections.
All bolts must be checked to see that they are tight
and in good condition. Components submerged under water shall
be checked to see whether they have decayed or not so as to estab-
lish the need of applying a suitable protective layer.
The timber

like cable bands holding the
sus-
penders
in proper position, condition of saddles and
anchorages
at
the
towers,
specially
against
corrosion
shall
be
carefully
examined.
The anchor
shall be checked for any signs of movement.
All steel p
rts
shall
be
checked
as
per
instructions
con-
tained
under
