INTRODUCTION
l.i.
The draft recommendations
for
estimating the
resistance
of soil below the maximum scour
level in the design of well founda-
tions of bridges were
finalised by a Subcommittee consisti^ig of the
following personnel at their meeting held on the

This
draft was
approved
by
the
Bridges Committee
in
their
meetings held on the
1 7th November, 1971
iind
14th April, 1972.
It
was later approved by the Executive Committee in
their meeting iield
on
the
26ih and
27th
April, 1972 and by the Council
in their 7Sth
meeting hcKi in Nainital on the 10th July, 1972.
1.2.
The
recommendations
given
in
this Standard
i.ave been
forniuiated on the basis of the observed behaviour of racdcis of well
foundations and
also the work done by many workers
in tins
iic.'d.
TIk- basic ussumpiions arc given
'\\\ Appendices.
1.3.
These studies have indicated that
:
(i) sharing of ihe moment between sides and
base
is conti-
nuously changing with the increase in deformation of the
soil
: and
(ii)
llio meciianics of sharing of the moment between
the sides
and
the
base
is entirely
difTerent for the
initial
stages of
loading
of
a
well
as
comparetl
to
its
ultimate
Cailiip;

1.4.
Elastic theoiy method
gives the
soil pressures
at the side
and the base under design loads, but to determine the actual factor of
safety
against
failure,
it
will be necessary to calcukie the ultimate
soil
resistance.
Iherefore, the design of well foundations
shall be
checked by both these methods.
2.
SCOPE
2.1.
The procedure
given
is
applicable
to
the
design of w^ill
foundations of bridge^
resting on
non-cohesive
soil
like sand and
surrounded
by
the same
soil
below maximum
scour
level.
The
provisions of these recomraenda lions
will not apply
if the depth of
embedment
is
less
than 0.5 times
the width
of foundation
in
the
direction of lateral forces.
3.
PROCEDURE FOR CALCULATING THE SOIL RESISTANCE
The
resistance of the
soil surrounding tiic well foundation shall
be checked
:
(i)
for calculation of base pressures by the elastic theory with
the use of subgrade moduli
; and
(ii) by computing
the ultimate
soil resistance with appropriate
factor of safety,
4. METHOD OF CALCULATION

INTRODUCTION
The
following assimipiions are made
in deriving
the equations
b.iscd on elastic theory
:
(i) The soil surrounding the well and below the base is perfectly
elastic, homogenous and follow? Hooke's Law.
(ii) Under design working loads, the
lateral deflections arc so
small that the unit soil leaction '*p" increases linearly with increasing
lateral deflection
"z*'
as expressed
by p = Khz where Kh
is the
oeflicient of horizontal subgi ade reaction at the base.
(iii) The
coefficient of horizontal
subgrade
reaction
increases
linearly with depth in the case of cohesionless soils.
(iv) The
well
is assumed
to be a rigid body subjected
to an
external unidirectional horizontal force H and a moment Mo at scour
level.

EQUATIONS FOR BASE PRESSURES
In the most general case, the centre of rotation can be above the
base atCi,
hase Cj or below the base at Cg,
It can be easily
visualised
that
the base moves* towards the centre
( f rotacion, if the
latter lies above the base so that the horizontal frictional force at the
base acts in the direction of H.
If the point of rotation
lies below
the base by a
similar argument,
it
is seen
that horizontal frictional
force at base must
be
in
the opposite sense to H.
The maximum
friclional force which can develop at the base
is
W.
At any parti-
cular instant only a fraction of it would be acting.
I.et
it be denoted
by ^fxW^^herc /J
is a
factor always
less than one.
It
is,
therefore,
clear ihat before movemeni takes place H must be between
1 and —1
respectively
so
that we can write that
for point of rotation
at
the
base a must be between the
limits —1 to
1.
In the particular case
of heavy wells met with in actual practice, the point of rotation shall
be assumed
to be at the base.
Let the well rotate about a point C
at
a
horizontal
distance Xc from
the
centre of the well shown
in
Fir
I.
P =
total horizontal soil reaction from the sides.
Mb =
resisting moment at the base.

OBSERVED FAILURE OF THE WELL FOUNDATION
UNDER ULTIMATE CONDITIONS
The pattern of failure of the
soil mass under
the application of
transverse forces to large and small depths of embedment
is depicted
in Fig.
2.
iV^^v.^:-^v^:•:--;,-;-
y
Fig. 2
The soil around the base in cither case slides over a circular cylindrical
path with centre of rotation somewhere above the base.
The plastic
flow
at
the
side
follows
the
usual
concept
as
in the case
of rigid
bulkhead at failure.
Fiiilurc has been observed
to occur at about 3*
rotation of the well in case of non-cohesive soils.
3. QUANTUM OF RESISTANCE
The observed variation of the lolal
ultimate resistance of the soil
HAass,
i.e., both at the base and the sides under varying direct loads
is
given in Fig.
3.
This study indicates that the total resisting moment increases with the
increase in the ratio of the direct load to the ultimate bearing capacity
of the
soil up to 0.5 to 0.7.
After that
it reduces.
It
is,
therefore,
necessary to ensure that
the bearing pressure adopted has a factor of
safety
of
two or
more
on
ultimate
bearing
capacity of the soil
cakmblcd by any rational formula.

POINT OF ROTATION AT FAILURE
(i) Morement of the point of rotation on the vertical axis
(a) Effect of geometry and horizontal loads
The geometry of the foundation,
viz., the ratio of the width of
foundation to the depth of embedment in the soil and the magnitude
of the horizontal loads have no effect in shifting the point of rotation
along the vertical axis as could be seen from Fig. 4.

(b) Effect of direct loads
The point of rotation
has
a
relation to the
ratio of the super-
imposed
vertical loads to the ultimate bearing capacity of the
soil a$
seen from Fig. 5,
Fig. 5
The actual variation is confined
to a narrow range between 0.75
and 0 8 times the depth of embedment below the scour level.
Taking
into account normally expected
vertical loads on
well
foundations,
a
fixed
value of 0.2 times depth above
the
base
of the foundation
has been adopted for working out the soil resistance.
(ii) Shift of the poiot of rotation along the horizontal axis
The point
of
rotation
undergoes
a
change
in
the
horizontal
direction depending upon the geometry of the foundation and
the
extent of deforpiation of the foundation.
Under ultimate conditions
the magnitude of horizontal shift of the point
as
function
of D/B
ratio is given in Fig.
6.
This shift in position of the point of rotation in the
horizontal
direction will cause variation
in the share of the moments between
the sides and the base.

5. METHOD OF CAJLCXILATION
5.1.
Base Resisting Momciit (Mb)
The base resisting moment
is the moment of the friclional force
mobilised
along
the
surface of rupture
which
is
assumed
to
be
cylindrical passing through the
corners of the base for a square v;5ll
as shown in Fig. 7.
For circular wells, the surface of rupluie
corres-
ponds to that of a part of sphere with
its
centre
at
the
point
of
rotation and passing through the periphery of the base.
If W
is the total vertical load augmented
by
appropriate
load
factors given
in sup-para
5.5 below, the load
per
unit
width
will
be W/B, which
will also be equal to the upward pressure as shown
in Fig.
8.
(i) For a reclaopi^ ^®
Consider the small arc of length RddC
at
an angle of JL from
the vertical axis.

Factor of safety
A suitable safeiy factor has to be ensured taking into account the
probable
variation of differcni
loads and
their combinations.
The
variation
of
strength
characteristic
of
the
soil
should
also
be
accounted for in calculating the resisting moment given by the above
expression.
Putting it mathematically
S Yi
(applied load or moment) ^
A (soil resisting moment)
(I)
where
Yj
-= load factor for a particular load
A = strength factor for '.he resistance of soil.
The passive resistance of the soil depends on the angle of internal
friction
for
variation
of which
a
reduction
factor of 1.25 may be
applied.
Further to take into account the special nature of risk of
failure of foundation, which
is most
important part of
the
bridge,
another reduction
factor of
1.15 may be
applied.
Hence
the total
coefficient
applicable
to
the Right Hand Side of the above expres-
sion (1) will come to 0.7.
As regards the Left Hand Side of the expression, the variation of
loads is described below
:

======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 36
======================================================================
IRC
: 45—1972
(i) Dead load
:
The dead load being more or Icf^s a permanent
load, a factor
1.1 would be sufficient for Ihe variations in densities of
materials and computational errors, etc.
(ii) Live load
:
Considering the effect of variation in IRC load*
ing met with
in bridges,
it
is adequate to adopt a factor
of
1.6 for
probable overloading with the combination
of
dead
load only and
1.4 with
other
combinations
except
with
wind
or
seismic.
With
cither wind or seismic due to reduced probability
of occurrence of
maximum live load, a factor of 1.25 is considered adequate.
(iii) Brakfng force, etc.
:
These
longitudinal
loads
will
cor-
respond to the coefficient adopted for live load.
Notes
:
(1) The
forces
due
to
characteristic
imposed
deformations
should be added, e.g., the horizontal load due to frictional resistance
of the bearings may include the increase in dead and live load.
(2) For normal
structures imposed
temperature deformations
of climatic origin and deformations due to creep and shrinkage can
generally
be
neglected
for
the
ultimate
analysis.
However,
for
statically
indeterminate
structures,
the
forces due
to
above
causes
should
be
considered.
Similarly,
the
forces due
to
settlement
of
support have also to be taken into consideration.
(iv) Water current force
:
Due to possible error of 20 per cent
in estimating the velocity, a factor of 1.4 may be adopted.
(v) Buoyancy
:
The effect of buoyancy in reducing the density
of submerged masses
is more or less a constant and can be taken as
unity.
(vi) Wind or seismic forces
:
When the bridge
is
not covered
by live load, a factor of 1.4 is considered adequate for wind or seismic
forces.
Due to
less probability of combination with maximum live
load, a reduced factor of 1.25 is adequate.
(vii) Earth pressure on
abutments
:
To account for increased
earth' pressure resulting from either the density of soil being higher or
26

IRC

the angle of internal friction being lower than determined by tests for
various reasons, a factor of 1»4
is considered adequate for Computa-
tion of earth pressure.
Accordingly,
the
following
combinations
of load
factors
are
obtained
:
I.ID
l.lD-f B+ 1.4(Wc 4-Ep +WorS)
I.ID -f 1.6L
I.ID + B+ 1.4(L + Wc + Ep)
1.1D + B + 1.25(L+ Wc +Ep
-f W or S)
where
D
= dead load
L
= live load including braking, etc.
B
= buoyancy
Wc = water current force
Bp = earth pressure
W
= wind force
S
= seismic force
(viii) Tilt and
shift
:
In the computation of applied momcnis,
effects of moments due
to
tilt and
shift of wells,
if any, about
the
plane of rotation shall also be considered.
6.
In order to ensure the factor of safety for ultimate resistance
according to above concept, the total resistance moment (Mr) reduced
by strength factor should
be not
less than the
tola! apphed
nionicni
(M) about
the point of rotation
