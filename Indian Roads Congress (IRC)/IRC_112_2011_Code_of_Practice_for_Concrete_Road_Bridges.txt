2 INTRODUCTION
The Design Criteria for Prestressed Concrete Road Bridges (Post-Tensioned Concrete);
IRC: 18 and Standard Specification and Code of Practice for Road Bridges Section
ill,
Cement Concrete (Plain and Reinforced); IRC: 21, both based on working stress method,
were first published in December 1 965 and October 1 966 respectively. The last revisions
of these two documents were carried out in the year 2000. These two codes stands with-
drawn on publication of this Code.
The past two decades have seen unprecedented growth of knowledge in the field of
concrete bridges, development of new structural forms, new methods of computer-based
analysis and design and development of high strength materials. The need for a new
rationalized code for bridge structures in general, based on the limit state approach, in line
with international practices, has been felt for a long time. Keeping this in view, the task of
writing a new code based on the Limit State Method, was taken up
in 2001 by the
Concrete (Plain, Reinforced and Prestressed) Structures Committee (B-4) and continued
over several terms of the Committee. The present composition of the Committee is as
follows:

IRC:112-2011
The task of drafting and finalization of the new Code of Practice for Concrete Road Bridge
was completed by the B-4 Committee in September 201 0. The draft was approved by the
Bridges Specifications and Standards Committee at its meeting held at New Delhi on
25^^ October 2010 and later by the Executive Committee on 27^^ October 2010. The draft
was discussed and approved by the Council of the Indian Roads Congress at the 1 92"^
Council Meeting held at Nagpur on 1 2'^ November 201 0.
The object of issuing the new Code of Practice for Concrete Road Bridges is to establish
a common procedure for design and construction of road bridges in India based on the
limit state method. This publication
is meant to serve as a guide to both design and
construction engineers, but compliance with the provisions therein does not relieve them,
in any way, of the responsibility for the stability, soundness, durability and safety of the
structures designed and constructed by them.
The design and construction of road bridges require an extensive and thorough knowledge
of the science and technology involved and should be entrusted only to specially qualified
engineers with adequate experience of bridge engineering, capable of ensuring correct
design and execution of bridge works.

======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
Reliability
Ability of a structure or a structural member to
fulfil the specified requirements
including the design working
life for which
it has been designed. Reliability is usually
expressed in probabilistic terms.
Design Criteria
Quantitative formulations that describe the conditions to be fulfilled for each limit state.
Design Situations
Sets of physical conditions representing the
real conditions occurring during a
certain time interval for which the design will demonstrate that relevant limit states
are not exceeded. ReferAnnexureA-1.
Transient Design Situation
Design situation that
is relevant during a period much shorter than the design
working
life of the structure and which has a high
probability of occurrence.
Note:
A transient design situation refers to temporary conditions of the structure, of use or
exposure, e.g. during construction or repair.
Persistent Design Situation
Design situation that
is relevant during a period of the same order as the design
working life of the structure.
Note:
Generally
it refers to conditions of normal use.
Accidental Design Situation
Design situation involving exceptional conditions of the structure or
its exposure,
including fire, explosion, impact or local failure.
Seismic Design Situation
Design situation involving exceptional conditions of the structure when subjected
to a seismic event.

Assumed period for which a structure or part cf
it
is to be used
for
its intended
purpose with anticipated maintenance but without necessity of major repair.
Load Arrangement
Identification of the position, magnitude and direction of a free action.
Load Case
Compatible
load
arrangements,
sets
of deformations and
imperfections

particular verification.
Limit States
States beyond which the structure no longer fulfills the relevant design criteria.
Ultimate Limit States
States associated with collapse or with other similar forms of structural failure.
Note:
These generally correspond
to the maximum
load-carrying
resistance
of
a structure or structural member.
Serviceability Limit States
States that correspond to conditions beyond which specified service requirements for a
structure or structural member are no longer met.
Irreversible Serviceability Limit States
Serviceability
limit states where some consequences of actions exceeding the
specified service requirements will remain when the actions are removed.
Reversible Serviceability Limit States
Serviceability
limit states where no consequences
of actions exceeding the
specified service requirements will remain when the actions are removed.
Serviceability Criterion
Design criterion for a serviceability limit state.

3.1 .3
Terms relating to actions (Also refer Annexure A-1
)
Action (F)
(a)
Set offerees (loads) applied to the structure (direct action);
(b)
Set of imposed deformations or accelerations caused for example,
by temperature changes, moisture variation, uneven settlement or
earthquakes (indirect action).
Effectof Action fHj
Effect of actions
(or action
effect) on
structural members,
(e.g.
internal force,
moment, stress, strain) or on the whole structure (e.g. deflection, rotation).
Permanent Action fGJ
Action that
is
likely to act throughout a given reference period and for which the
variation
in magnitude with time
is
negligible,
or for which the variation
is always
in the same direction (monotonic) until the action attains a certain limit value.
Variable Action CQJ
Action
for which the variation
in magnitude with time
is neither negligible nor
monotonic.
Accidental Action (A)
Action usually of short duration, but of significant magnitude, that may rarely occur on a
given structure dunng the design life.
Note:
An accidental
action can be expected
in some cases
to cause severe global
consequences on structures unless appropriate measures such as provision of
alternative load path are taken.
Seismic Action (A^)
Action that arises due to earthquake ground motions.
Geotechnical Action
Action transmitted to the structure by the ground,
fill or groundwater.

PAGE 19 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
Fixed Action
Action that has a fixed distribution and position over the structure or structural mennber
such that the magnitude and direction of the action are determined unambiguously for the
whole structure or structural member if this magnitude and direction are determined at one
point on the structure or structural member.
Free Action
Action that may have various spatial distributions over the structure.
Single Action
Action that can be assumed to be statistically independent in time and space of any other
acton acting on the structure.
Static Action
Action that does not cause significant acceleration of the structure or structural members.
Dynamic Action
Action that causes significant acceleration of the structure or structural members.
Quasi-static Action
Dynamic action represented by an equivalent static action in a static model.
Characteristic Value of an Action ("F^
Principal representative value of an action considered in the design process.
Note:
(1 )
Insofar as a characteristic value can be fixed on statistical basis;
it is chosen so
as to correspond to a prescribed
probability of not being exceeded on the
unfavourable side during a 'reference period' taking into account the design
working life of the structure and the duration of the design situation.
(2)
In absence of data for arriving at value as per (1 ) a nominal value is used which
conceptually performs the same function as that of characteristic value but is
not associated with any probability number.
7



======================================================================
PAGE 20 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
Nominal Value
Value fixed on non-statistical bases, for instance, on acquired experience or on physical
conditions, which may be used in place of characteristic value.
Reference Period
Chosen period of time that is used as a basis for assessing statistically variable actions.
Combination Value of a Variable Action
(v|/ ,^^)
'
Value chosen, insofar as
it can be fixed on statistical basis, so that the probability that the
effects caused by the combination will be exceeded is approximately the same as by the
characteristic value of an individual action.
It may be expressed as a determined part of
the characteristic value by using a factory^ </.
s.
•
Frequent Value of a Variable Action (h/,(2k)
Value determined, insofar as
it can be fixed on statistical basis,
so that either the total

GENERAL
4.1
' Scope
The Code of Practice for Concrete Road Bridges, hereinafter referred to as the 'Code',
this code strives to establish common procedures for the design and construction of
concrete road bridges including footbridges in India.
The requirements specified in the Code aim at achieving construction of safe, serviceable,
durable and economical bridges.
It covers design principles, detailed design criteria and
practical rules, material specifications, workmanship, quality control and all such aspects
which affect the characteristics/ability of the bridge to meet the aims.
This Code deals with the structural use of plain cement concrete, reinforced concrete,
prestressed concrete and composite construction using concrete elements in bridges and
is applicable to all structural elements using normal weight concrete (density in the range
of (24 ± 4 kN/m^) and made using
cements, aggregate, mineral admixtures, chemical
admixtures and water, as given in the Section dealing with material specifications in the
Code.
All provisions of the Code may not be applicable for hybrid structural systems, or for
structures using other types of concrete. However, for concrete portion of hybrid elements/
staictures and for other type of concrete, relevant provision of this Code may be used. The
term "other types of concrete" includes, but is not restricted to:
(1)

BASIS OF DESIGN
5,1
Aims of Design
5JJ
General performance reqyiremerite
The bridge, as a complete structural system and its structural elements should perform
their functions adequately and safely, with appropriate degrees of reliability during design
life and during construction.
It should withstand all actions, consisting of applied and induced
loads as well as environmental influences liable to occur, retaining its structural integrity,
and also withstand accidental loads (e.g. barge impact/vehicular impact) and earthquake
loads without causing damage, which is disproportionate to the causative event Adequacy
of performance is defined in terms of serviceability, safety, durability and economy.
5J .2
Reliability aspects and coda! approach
The term 'degree of reliability' is used to indicate the acceptably low level of probability of
failure in meeting the expected performance during a specified period of time.
Determination of the
reliability measured
in terms of statistical probability requires
knowledge of statistical parameters which define loading and material strengths. This data
together with knowledge of structural models of resistance enable evaluation of structural
performance in probabilistic terms. At the present state of knowledge, determination of
reliability is possible only in limited load cases for simple structures. The Code, therefore,
strives to achieve the desirable degree of reliability by approximate methods based upon
a combination of the following:
(1 )
Known statistical parameters describing properties of materials and
actions.
(2)
Deterministic models of structural behaviour.
(3)
The international practices and past experience of acceptable/
unacceptable performance of structures.
(4)
Partial factors for actions and resistance models based on
calibration and rationalisation of existing international practices.
5.1 .3
Safety, serviceability, durability and economy
The requirements of the Code directly address safety, serviceability and durability aspects.
18



======================================================================
PAGE 31 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
Economy is Indirectly addressed by:
(1)
Allowing maximum exploitation of materials and specifying use of
technologies which are consistent with the minimum/desirable
standards of safety, serviceability and durability,
(2)
Accepting appropriate levels of economic risks while specifying
performance levels by taking into consideration different design
situations, load combinations (events), importance of structure in
view of consequences of failure, and by specifying different
intended design lives for replaceable and non-replaceable parts.
5.2
Limit State Philosophy of Design
_
•
(1)
The response of the structure when subjected
to different
magnitudes of loads lies in different states (domains).
'Limit States'
are defined as limits of domains beyond which the structure does
not meet specified performance criteria.
In
'Limit State Philosophy' of design, various boundaries
of
acceptable/unacceptable performance are defined together with
the circumstances in which such performances are expected.
(2)
Two basic groups of limit states are considered;
(a) Ultimate Limit States (ULS): These limit states cover static
equilibrium and failure of structural elements or structure as
a whole, when acted upon by 'ultimate design loads'.
(b) Serviceability Limit States (SLS): These limit states deal with
the condition
of the structure subjected
to influence of
'serviceability design loads'. These conditions include level of
internal stress, fatigue failure, deflection, damage to structural
element such as cracking, and discomfort to users due to
vibrations.
(3)
The representative values of actions and combination of actions
representing
different design situations are defined. The
representative values of loads are modified by using load factors
for each of the basic limit states, which are then combined using
combination factors. The combination factors take into account the
probability of simultaneous occurrence of loads.
19



======================================================================
PAGE 32 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
(4)
The response of the structure
is calculated using principles of
mechanics and simplified established models describing behaviour
of concrete members. These methods also account for inherent
geometric variations which are kept within acceptable construction
tolerances.
(5)
The response of the structure
is required to
lie within acceptable
domain for different combinations of actions.
(6)
The structure designed by following this philosophy, and constructed
by satisfying other stipulations of the Code are deemed to meet
the general performance requirements stipulated in Clause 5.1.1.
5.3
Limit States
The structure shall be designed for the following limit states:
5.3.1
Ultimate limit states (ULS)
5.3.1.1
Limit state of equilibrium
When subjected to various design combinations of ultimate loads the bridge or any of its
components, considered as a rigid body, shall not become unstable.
5.3.1.2
Limit state of strength
The bridge or any of its components shall not lose its capacity to sustain the various ultimate
load combinations by excessive deformation, transformation into a mechanism, rupture,
crushing or buckling.
5.3.2
Serviceability limit states (SLS)
5. 3. 2. 1
Limit state of internal stress
The internal stresses developed in the materials of structural elements shall not exceed
the specified magnitudes when subjected to combination of serviceability design actions.
The stresses are to be estimated using resistance models to represent the behaviour of
structure, as stipulated in the Code.
5.3.2.2
Limit state of crack control
(1)
The cracking of reinforced, partially prestressed, and prestressed
concrete structures under serviceability load combinations is kept
within acceptable
limits of crack widths
in such a way as not to
adversely affect the durability or impair the aesthetics.
20



======================================================================
PAGE 33 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
(2)
Alternatively, the control of cracking
is deemed to be satisfied by
following restrictions on amount and spacing of reinforcement.
5. 3.2.3
Limit state of deformation
(1)
The deformation of the bridge or its elements when subjected to
combination of design actions shall not adversely affect the proper
functioning of its elements, appurtenances, and riding quality.
(2)
Deformations during construction
shall be controlled to achieve
proper geometry of finished structure.
5. 3. 2. 4
Limit state of vibration
(1)
For footbridges or component of bridges specifically designed to
carry footway loading, the direct verification of vibration
limits
is
required , for which specialist literature may be referred
.
(2)
For special types of bridges and their components dynamic effects
under action of wind are required to be calculated and verified to
be within acceptable limits. Model tests are required under certain
circumstances.
(3)
For other types of bridges, the
limit state of vibration under
serviceability load combinations is deemed to be satisfied by limiting
deflection of elements.
5. 3. 2. 5
Limit state of fatigue
The bridge or any of its components shall not lose its capacity to carry design loads by
virtue of its materials reaching fatigue limits due to its loading history. For carrying out
fatigue verification, specialist literature may be referred.
However, fatigue verification is not necessary for the following:
a)
For Reinforced concrete structures when the stress
in the tensile reinforce-
ment
is less than 300 MPa under Rare Combination of Serviceability Limit
State as against 0.8 f^ specified in Clause No. 12.2.2.
b)
For prestressed concrete structures under the frequent combination of action
and
prestressing
force,
only compressive stresses occur
at the extreme
concrete fibers, under Serviceability Limit State.
5.4
Actions and their Combinations
5.4.1
Types of action
(1)
An action is:
-
Direct action, i.e. force (load) applied to structure.
-
Indirect action,
i.e. forces arising from imposed or constrained
deformation, such as that caused by settlement, temperature
changes, seismic acceleration and impact loads.
21



======================================================================
PAGE 34 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
(2)
Actions are classified:
(a) By their variation In time (duration of application)
:
-
Permanent Actions (G), e.g. self-weight,
-
Variable Actions (Q), e.g. imposed live loads,
-
Accidental Actions (A), e.g. barge Impact loads.
Some variable actions acting for long durations are treated on
par with permanent actions. These are called 'Quasi-Permanent'
actions.
(b) By their nature and/or by response of the structure to them:
-
Static actions are those which do not cause significant
acceleration of members on which they act.
-
Dynamic actions are those which cause
significant
acceleration of members on which they act.
Some dynamic actions can be represented by 'Quasi-Static' actions,
which are the static values producing equivalent or representative
response (stress/deformation)
in the structure caused by the
dynamic action.
(3)
Prestressing force (P) is a permanent action with time-dependent
variation.
5.4.2
Characteristic and combinational values of actions
5.4.2.1
Characteristic value
The characteristic value of an action is generally the main representative value, which can
be based upon the statistical distribution of magnitudes of action (e.g. a mean value, or
upper or lower fractile value). Alternatively, a representative 'nominal value' is specified
which is treated as a characteristic value.
A single value is generally specified, except where the design is sensitive to variation of
magnitude
in which case lower and upper values (also referred to as
'inferior' and
'superior' values respectively) are also specified in addition to mean value. These may
be specified as absolute values or as a multiple of characteristic value.
5.4.2.2
Combinational value
(1)
A structure during its construction and service life is acted upon by
various direct or indirect actions at different times
in different
22



======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
combinations, representing various design situations.
Some of
these situations are represented by a few combinations chosen for
design checks, for which the response of the structure is calculated
and verified not to exceed the limit states.
(2)
The combinational value
is represented by characteristic value
multiplied by a factor, which takes into account the probability of
•
'
^
simultaneous occurrence of the most likely unfavourable values of
several independent actions.
(3)
Various design
situations (represented
by various
load
combinations) for which different limit states are to be checked are
given
in
IRC:6 and Annexure A-1.
All components
of the
structure are not required to be verified for all limit states and
all
possible combinations. The requirements or exemptions are covered
under relevant clauses of the Code dealing with such components.
5.5
"
Representative Values of Properties of Materials
5.5.1
General
The constituent materials of structure acting singly or in a composite action with other
materials have certain properties which determine their own response and the behaviour
of the structural elements when acted upon by various loads. Some of the material and
stmctural properties depend upon the type of load, its duration, magnitude, and the loading
history. Some properties are time-dependent, while others are affected by environmental
actions. Some properties depend upon the physical size (dimensions) of the structural
member.
Almost all the properties exhibit statistical variation in their numerical values. Many of the
properties show strong co-relations with other properties, which pemiit sufficiently accurate,
if not exact, estimation of their value from the values of other properties by use of
mathematical expressions. Correlations pre based on laboratory or field observations and
statistical regression analysis. A few of these properties are chosen as descriptive and/or
representative properties of the materials (e.g. self compacting concrete). They are often
used to define the material itself or its grade (e.g. concrete grade M 40 and reinforcing
steel Fe 500). Standard methods of testing for measuring such values are specified by
Bureau of Indian Standards or other national / international authorities.

5.5.2
Representative values
Depending upon the purpose of carrying out the evaluation, one or more of the following
three representative values are used in the design:
(1 )
Average or statistical mean value.
(2)
A lower fractile value
(inferior value) based on the
statistical
distribution function or the statistical mean value suitably reduced
by a factor.
(3)
An upper fractile value (superior value) based on the statistical
distribution function, or the statistical mean value suitably increased
by a factor.
The representative values of commonly used materials are defined in Section 6.
5.5.3
Other methods of assessment of properties
When higher level of accuracy is desired in evaluating response of the structure, use of
more accurate values of other properties than those obtained from co-relations used in
Section 6 and Annexure A-2 are required.
In such cases, these should be based upon one
of the following:
(1)
More accurate and elaborate methods/expressions which
incorporate more number of factors influencing the required values
reported
in specialist
literature from established and
reliable
sources.
(2)
Laboratory/field testing using standard methods of testing and
measurements and based on sufficient number of tests as required
by statistical methods of establishing desired accuracy (usually
95 percent confidence
level). Normally, to establish mean and
standard deviation, not less than 30 samples are required.
5.6
Analytical Methods to Evaluate Behaviour of Structures
5.6.1
Global analysis of structure
The purpose of this analysis is the verification of overall stability and establishment of
effects of action on the whole or a part of the structure. These effects include the
distribution of internal forces and moments as well as stresses, strains, curvatures, rotations
and displacements in static or dynamic modes. To carry out analysis the geometry, boundary
conditions and behaviour of the structure and its components need to be idealised. The
24



======================================================================
PAGE 37 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
structure is idealised by considering
it as made up of elements, which can be linear, two
dimensional or three dimensional. Classical methods of mechanics or modem techniques
such as finite element can be used for analysis. The mathematical model should be capable
of evaluating the desired effect with sufficient accuracy.
5.6.2
Local analyses
In addition to global analysis of structure or its elements, local analyses will be necessary
particularly in the regions of stress concentrations and geometric discontinuities.
5.6.3
Idealisation, modelling and adequacy
Behaviour of structure and
Its components can be represented to various degrees of
accuracy. The general principles as well as normally used methods are covered
in
Section 7. The idealisation and modelling should be adequate to estimate the relevant
action effects. The interaction of properties of constituent materials with heterogeneous
properties should be appropriately taken into account.
Appropriate methods of analysis such as elastic analysis, non-elastic analysis with limited
redistribution, plastic analysis with actual or idealised material properties are indicated
depending upon the level of accuracy required. Necessity of including the second order
effects in the analysis is indicated where it is important.
5.7
Design Based on Full Scale Testing
Design of some elements like crash barriers, fenders, prestressing anchors, etc., can be
based on full scale tests of the prototype. The failure load/capacity is defined as that
causing either irreparable damage, or pre-defined limit of deformation.
5.8
Durability Aspects
The durability recommendations of this Code are based on the strategies adopted regarding
aspects indicated in the following Clauses. These strategic options/choices in design,
detailing and construction are intended to ensure durability as well as serviceability and
safety, for a period not less than the intended service life of the structure.
5.8.1
Design service life
The following table indicates the 'design service life' of some common types of bridges.

5.8.2
Use of appropriate values of time-dependent material properties
Variation of strengths such as reduction of concrete strength by sustained loading as well
as degradation of materials, effects of creep and shrinkage of concrete, relaxation of steel
and fatigue are some of the time dependent design properties. The values of such time
dependent properties to be used in the design shall take into account design service life.
5.8.3
Specification of actions and action-effects
For actions of environmental origin, appropriate return period is specified depending on
the design
life. The probability of failure during life of structure depends on the return
period of load, the design
life and probability of failure in unit period for the specified
design value of load (unit period of one year and return period expressed in years are
nomrially used).
5.8.4
Control of properties of materials
The pemnissible limits of known harmful elements in acceptable and durable materials
are specified in Section 14.
5.8.5
Control of attack on materials by aggressive elements under different
atmospheric conditions
Certain aggressive chemical elements in the surrounding environment such as oxygen,
carbon-dioxide, sulphates and chlorides penetrate concrete and cause corrosion of
steel in concrete. The moisture content in concrete and temperature directly affect the
process of corrosion. The depth of penetration of these harmful elements into concrete
depends on the permeability of concrete and time.

The process of deterioration is mitigated by recommending suitable materials (such as
concrete having certain qualities), cover to steel, improved corrosion resistant steel, etc.,
for different classes of environment.
Externally applied protective barriers are indicated in certain circumstances.
5.8.6
Maintenance
Periodic inspection and adequate maintenance are prerequisites for ensuring durability
of structure. All records of inspection and repairs should be available to concerned authority.

SECTION 6 MATERIAL PROPERTIES AND THEIR DESIGN VALUES
6.1
General
V
6.1 .1
The analysis and design of the structure and its elements require knowledge
of the physical, chemical, mechanical, load-dependent, time-dependant and process-
dependent properties of its materials. The properties include those goveming the composite
action of materials acting interactively with one another as well as acting individually.
Simplified rules describing these properties which are consistent with the analysis and
design models permitted by this Code are given in the following Clauses.
6.1 .2
In special cases where more exact analyses and models of behaviour are
to be considered, more representative rules describing these properties are needed, some
of which are given in AnnexureA-2.
In addition, reference to international Codes, published
literature, laboratory test reports or field tests, may also be made. However, the reliability
of the referenced source and/or reproducibility of test values should be established.
6.1 .3
Some of the properties are strongly influenced by activities of construction
and work procedures. Use of appropriate technological methods, deployment of qualified
and trained work force combined with methods of quality assurance are requisite pre-
conditions for realising
in practice the properties assumed
in the design.
Minimum
acceptable standards of workmanship are given in Section 18.
6.1 .4
Specifications of structural materials to be used in construction of bridges
shall conform to the Indian Standards given in Section 18.
6.1 .5
Materials conforming to other international standards can be used provided
they meet the minimum requirements (lower or upper values as the case may be) given in
the relevant Indian Standards and this Code.
6.2
Untensioned Steel Reinforcement
6.2.1
Specification and grades
Reinforcement shall consist of hot rolled, thermo-mechanical or heat-treated rods, de-coiled
rods or cold worked steel of various grades given in Table 6.1. The grade designations,
definitive properties and other properties, as adopted by the relevant Indian Standards,
are given in Section 1 8 (Table 18.1). The steel may be coated, or galvanised to improve its
resistance to corrosion. Use of stainless steel is permitted subject to requirements stipulated
in Section 6.2.3.3.

Products with improved corrosion resistance
Reinforcing steel bars with improved corrosion resistance by any of the methods described
in Section 18 can be used as reinforcement provided they meet the minimum strength,
proof stress and elongation characteristics as specified in Table 18.1. The design properties
30



======================================================================
PAGE 43 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
are considered to be the same as per Clause 6.2.2 except as given in Clause 6.2.3.2 for
epoxy coated reinforcement.
6.2.3.1
Galvanised reinforcement
The strength as well as elongation and bond properties of galvanised reinforcement are
not adversely affected by galvanising.
6.2.3.2
Epoxy-coated reinforcement
Reinforcing bars conforming to IS 1 786 can be coated by fusion bonded epoxy conforming
to IS 13620-1993.
The bond of coated reinforcement is lowered by upto 20 percent of that of uncoated
reinforcement. In detailing of steel the lap length and anchorage lengths given in Section
1 5 should be increased by 25 percent.
6.2.3.3
Stainless steel reinforcement
Properties of stainless steel reinforcement shall not be inferior to the carbon steel
reinforcement of corresponding strength class. For bond properties reference should be
made to the relevant code or established on basis of tests.
Note:
The Indian Standard for stainless steel reinforcement is under preparation. The British
Standard BS:6744:2001
, which covers suitable stainless steels for use as reinforcement
may be refenred.
6.3
Prestressing Steel
6.3.1
Specifications, grades, strength, elongation and relaxation
Prestressing steel
in the following forms, conforming to Indian Standards given
in
Section 18. Tables 18.2 to 18.5 shall be used.
Plain or indented wires
'
'
Stress-relieved multi°p!y strands
.
High tensile steel bars
Steels conforming to other intemational standards but satisfying the minimum strength,
elongation, and relaxation characteristics of Indian Standards may be used.
6.3.2
lyiinimum sizes
The steels of nominal sizes and ultimate strengths having characteristics as mentioned in
Table 18.2 to 18.5 are pennitted for use
in bridges designed for normal
life (Refer
Table 5.1).

======================================================================
PAGE 44 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
For other bridges mentioned in Table 5. 1
, steels having smaller diameters than those given
in the Tables 18,3 to 18.5 but otherwise meeting the requirements of Indian Standards
mentioned therein, can be used.
6.3.3
Other properties
6.3.3. f
Ductility
The requirements of ductility of steel are deemed to be satisfied by use of steel having the
minimum elongations specified in Section 18.3.
The wires/strands shall also pass the bendability test (reverse bending) as specified in
relevant Indian Standards.
6.3.3.2
Tolerance on size/diameter
The relevant Indian Standards specify the manufacturing tolerances on diameters/size of
various products which remain valid for general acceptance of the material and the source
of supply.
6.3.4
Coated wires/strands
The wires/strands confonning to Indian Standards can be provided with protective coatings,
like galvanising orepoxy coating, carried out in specialised manufacturing units. However,
if the technological processes affect any of the mechanical and physical properties, such
modified properties should be taken into account in design.
6.3.5
Stress-strain properties for design
Typical stress/strain and ultimate elongation of prestressing wires and strands are shown
in Fig. 6.3 and 6.4. The actual E value varies between 195 GPa and 216 GPa. For
prestressing steels, the stress
is to be taken as force divided by the nominal cross
sectional area.
For the purpose of analysis and design, either the diagrams shown in Fig. 6.3 or the
simplified bilinear diagram as shown in Fig. 6.4 (any one of shapeA and shape B) can be
used. The 'E' value of 200 GPa for wires and 195 GPa for strands can be used in the
design up to the elastic limit (first part of bilinear diagram unless more exact value is
required, (e.g. for verification of elongation during stressing operations, which should be
taken on the basis of actual field tests.)

Concrete
Cement, fine aggregates, coarse aggregates, mineral admixtures and water constitute
the main material ingredients of concrete. Chemical admixtures are added to fresh concrete
to improve
its
workability.
For

of constituents
of concrete
Section 18 and the relevant Indian Standards may be referred. For use of concretes
designed to have special and different characteristics from those given in this Section,

Characteristic Strength Is the lower 5 percent tractile value of the
statistical distribution of strength
at 28 days, measured by
samples prepared and tested as per Section
18.5.4,

consisting
of
3
cubes
of
150
mm
size.
The grade designation
is the nearest lower limit of the range in
multiple of 5 MPa within which the actual characteristic strength
falls.
(2)
For concretes using mineral admixtures and those using high
early strength cements, the properties of setting time and time-
dependent strength gain are different from those of standard and
ordinary concrete. Cognisance of such modified properties should
be taken
in deciding de-shuttering
time,
curing period
and early age loading.
(3)
Use of Strength other than 28 days Strength:
Actual strength achievable (or achieved) at other than 28 days
strength, but not at more than 84 days
in case of slow setting
concretes, can be chosen to base the design/construction
choices,
if found more appropriate. This decision should
be based on achievement of early/delayed strength, and the age
at which the
first design load, apart from the self-weight,
is
expected to be resisted by the structure.
(b)
Standard Concrete is made on the basis of design mix proportioned
by weight of its ingredients, which in addition to cement, aggregates
and water, may contain chemical admixtures to achieve certain target
values of various properties in fresh condition, achievement of which
is monitored and controlled during production by suitable tests.
Generally, concretes up to strength Grade M50 are included
in
this type.
(c)
High Performance Concrete is similar to standard concrete but
contains additional one or more mineral admixtures providing
binding characteristics and partly acting as inert filler material which
increase
its strength, reduce
its porosity and modify
its other
properties in fresh as well as hardened condition. Concretes upto
Grade M90 are included in this type.

Stress-strain relationship for overall analysis of structure, stress-
strain relationship for sectional design, various moduli of elasticity,
Poisson's ratio, tensile strength, fracture mechanical strength, multi-
axial strengths,
etc., are the mechanical properties needed for
various purposes of design. Unless greater accuracy is needed
justifying separate and direct testing for these characteristics, the
values given in Table 6.5 may be used in design, which are based
on their relation to the compressive strength. The co-relation
equations are given in AnnexureA-2.
(4)
Some of the time-dependent behaviours of structure and time
dependent effects are permitted to be evaluated by using simplified
expressions, using appropriately modified values of some
properties,
(e.g. factored value of the modulus of elasticity to
incorporate creep effects).
Where greater accuracy is needed,
specialist literature or relevant intemational codes may be referred.
(5)
Relationship between Strength and Time:
The development of compressive strength of concrete depends
on the type of cement, curing conditions and maturity of concrete.
Maturity is measured as a sum of the product of time and mean
temperature of concrete, measured in appropriate units as given
below:
Maturity in day Celsius or hour Celsius = I time in days (or hours) x
(temperature in '»C+11°C).
Eq. 6.1
In normal applications instead of the exact strength-maturity
relationship simplified strength-time relationship is used, with limits
of validity as given
in Clasue 6.4.2.2. For special applications,
where temperature history deviates from the
limits given,
AnnexureA-2 may be referred.
Compressive strength and strength development with time

Relationship connecting age in days to strength given by Eq. 6.2
and
Eq.

relationship.which are valid for seasonal variation of temperature
between (-)20X to (+)40X.

is to be included by substituting

expression for equivalent time tj. is given in Annexure A-2.
(2)
Effect of sustained loading and gain of strength with time
Although concrete gains strength with age due to continued
chemical reactions,
it also exhibits reduction of strength under the
effect of sustained loading . This long term effect together with effect
of the size of the structural element is taken into account while
recommending design values of strength
in this Code e.g. long
term compressive strength in structure is taken as 0.67 times 28
days cube
strength.
(It
is
directly
incorporated
in formula
for
ultimate bending strength).
(3)
Verification of early age strength by testing
To avoid irreversible damage like local cracking (e.g. due to early
age prestressing), the achievement of early age strength shall be
verified by testing.
It is to be noted that the field testing results
based on small number of samples are a measure of the mean
value of early age strength and not of the characteristic value of
early age. The values thus obtained should be reduced by 1 .645 x
(standard deviation for the grade of concrete). The value of the
standard deviation to be used for early age
is required to be

established by testing at least 30 numbers of samples at site, unless
it is known from past experience. Refer Section 1 8 for details.
(4)
Use of strengths beyond 28 days strength
Gain of strength beyond 28 days should not be considered in new
designs except as per Note No.3 below Table 6.4. For evaluation
of strength/load carrying capacity of old existing bridges and for
retrofitting purposes, strength at ages other than 28 days can be
used after making allowance for age, sustained load effect, state
of cracking and fatigue effects, for which specialist literature may be
referred.
6.4.2.3
Tensile strength & strength development with time
(1)
Direct tensile strength
The tensile strength
is the highest tensile stress reached
under concentric loading. The tensile strength of concrete f^^^
is
difficult to measure directly and hence is measured either by splitting
cylinders/cubes under transverse strip loading, or by fiexural tensile
test of standardised beams obtained following standard test
procedures.

Flexural tensile strength for other sizes

mean axial tensile strength
and the depth of the cross-section.
The following relationship may be used.

(like bottom/top slabs of box girders) y^^^^,^,^ given in Table 6.5 may
be used.

is strongly
influenced by curing and drying conditions as well as by the
dimensions of the structural members. As a first approximation
it may be assumed that the tensile strength

is
important (e.g. for control of cracking)
it is recommended that
tests are earned out taking into account the exposure conditions
and the dimensions of the structural member.
6.4.2.4
Multhaxiaf state of stress
The multi-axial compressive strength of concrete is higher than the uni-axial compressive
strength. Normally, in bridge structures, this higher strength does not contribute significantly
to design of main elements. However, in design of local zones, the increased strength is
made use of (e.g. near concentrated loads, or in design of concrete hinges and anchorage
zones ofprestressing anchorages). AnnexureA-2 and specialist literature may be refenred
for the relevant design properties.

Stress-strain relationship and modulus of elasticity
(1)
The stress-strain relationship of concrete
in compression and
tension exhibits non-linearity and time-dependent changes.
It also
depends upon the rate of loading and loading history, creep and
shrinkage. The contribution of creep to total strain is different at
loading and unloading stages.
(2)
In general terms, the total strain of concrete at time t subjected to
sustained loading from initial loading at time t^ is given by:

The shrinkage & creep strains are to be estimated as given
in
Clauses 6.4.2.6 and 6.4.2.7.
However, for the purpose of analysis of overall structure under
normal temperature variations and its response to loads for static,
equivalent static or linear dynamic response to earthquake loads,
approximate simplified values given
in this Code are adequate.
Where greater accuracy is desired and for non-linear elastic analysis
Annexure-A2 and specialist literature should be referred.
The load-deformation characteristics of structure are dependent
on duration of load, age at loading and stress level up to which the
material of the structure is loaded. These are calculated by use of
appropriate modulus of elasticity as under:
(i)
For static and quasi-static loads acting for short duration, secant
modulus of elasticity of concrete
(slope of line connecting
the origin to stress/strain diagram to 0.33 f^J may be used.
Values of E^^ are given
in Table 6.5 for different grades of
concrete.
(ti) The Poisson's ratio for uncracked concrete may be taken as
0.2 and that for cracked concrete as zero.
(iii) In general, the effects of long term loading (due to creep) shall
be obtained separately and added to those obtained from short
temi analysis. As a simplification for the overall analysis of
structure (not for local analysis), the value of E_ can be modified
by a factor
accounting for long term creep effects where
^
is the creep co-efficient defined by Eq. 6.9 and Table 6.9.
(iv) For calculating creep effects of shorter duration, either separate
analysis should be done or
can be modified by factor
consistent with the creep of the same duration.
(v) The effect of shrinkage shall be separately calculated and
added.
It is taken as part of dead load analysis.
(vi) For calculating effects of seasonal temperature variation, value
of 0.5 times
may be used to account for temperature induced
stresses as modified by creep effects.

Shrinkage
(1)
The total shrinkage of concrete depends upon the constituents of
concrete, size of the member and environmental conditions. For a
given humidity and temperature, the total shrinkage of concrete is
most influenced by the total amount of water present in the concrete
at the time of mixing and to a lesser extent, by the cement content.
(2)
The total shrinkage strain
is composed of two components, the
autogenous shrinkage strain and the drying shrinkage strain.

is given by

The major part of the autogenous shrinkage strain develops during
hardening of the concrete in the early days after casting. Autogenous
shrinkage can be taken as a function of the concrete strength. It should
be considered
specifically when new concrete
is cast against
.
hardened concrete.
In absence of accurate field/laboratory data, the values given
in
Table 6.6 may be considered in design:

SECTION 7
ANALYSIS
7.1
General Provisions
7.1.1
Response of strucium to loads
The purpose of structural analysis is the verification of overall stability and establishment
of action effects on the whole or a part of the structure. These effects include the
distribution of internal forces and moments as well as the calculation of stresses, strains,
curvatures, rotations and displacements in static or dynamic modes. To carry out analysis,
the geometry, boundary conditions and behaviour of the stmcture will need to be idealized
both for global and local behaviour. The structure is idealised by considering it as made
up of elements which can be linear, two dimensional or three dimensional. Classical
methods of mechanics or modern techniques such as finite element can be used for
analysis depending upon the suitability of the mathematical model to evaluate the action
effects with sufficient accuracy.
Since concrete is a heterogeneous material, its properties are not independent of the
size of the member. These are also time dependent. For reinforced and prestressed
concrete elements the structural behaviour depends on the location and amount of
steel as well as the state of deformation and cracking of the element, which in turn, depends
upon the level of load.
In the analysis, appropriate simplified values of properties of
constituent materials and properties representing composite action (e.g. bond) are made
in order to represent the behaviour ofthese elements. The range of validity ofthese simplified
properties and the level of accuracy in predicting the structural behaviour by analytical
methods, has to be taken into account in the design process.
The in-service behaviour of structural elements as well as their ultimate strengths
and modes of failure are determined by the material properties, load resisting
mechanism of the structural elements and the combined effect of axial forces,
bending moments, transverse shears,
in-plane shears and torsions. The
interdependency of various strengths of a member; such as axial, bending, shear
and torsion, has been established both by theory and by experiments. However,
in most cases of practical design, bending combined with axial forces and sh0ar
combined with torsion are treated separately. In this approach, the design models
used
in different load
resisting mechanisms are not completely compatible.
Design of columns, beams and slabs are typically based on this approach. For
elements having complex geometry - such as shells - and for some local zones
of the elements (refer Clause 7.1.2.2) design has to be based on the net effect of
all forces acting together, ensuring compatibility of strains.
Suitable model
representing the element and appropriate method of analysis have to be used
in the design process.

7J .2
Methods of analyses
7.1.2.1
General
In terms of the behaviour of the structure, the following methods of analysis may be
used:
(1 )
Linear elastic analyses for both static and dynamic response
(2)
Linear elastic analyses with limited redistribution of forces for static
response
(3)
The 'Strut and Tie* method for achieving intemai equilibrium within
the elements
in conjunction with overall elastic analysis
of the stnjcture, where stiffness of the structural elements is based
on assumptions (a) or (b) as described in Clause 7.2(1).
(4)
Non-linear analyses, (material and/or geometric non-iinearity) for
both static and dynamic response
The solutions based on failure mechanisms of structure or plastic
behaviour of elements shall not be used in design of bridges; except
for the case of analysing response to earthquake. This shall be
done only after adequate investigation of all significant modes of
failure.
in addition to global analyses of structure or its components, local analyses may be
necessary, particularly where.
(1 )
Significant and rapid changes in stresses and strains in a particular
region of the structure/component are involved (e.g. regions around
openings, junctions of elements).
(2)
Local non-linear behaviour needs to be analysed, (e.g. locally near
supports/bearings, formation of hinges).
(3)
Assumption of linear strain distribution
is not valid,
(e.g. thick
sections, deep beams, corbels, anchorage zones).
Where local effects are calculated separately, independent of global effects, the effects
shall be combined.
(1 )
Second order effects are the additional effects caused by structural
defomnations, e.g. P-A effect for column.

Local analyses

Second order effects
51



======================================================================
PAGE 64 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
(2)
Second order effects shall be considered
in the analysis where
they are
likely to affect overall
stability or the attainment of the
ultimate
limit state at
critical sections,
(e.g. buckling of slender
members,
redistribution of forces due to creep of concrete,
settlement of supports in indeterminate structure).
7.1.4
Modelling of foundations
Structural elements transferring toads to the foundation strata can be treated as rigid or
flexible depending on their stiffness with appropriate end conditions. Settlement effects
are to be treated as independent loading conditions. Where soil-structure interaction is
considered as significantly influencing the behaviour of the structure, the foundation and
stratum shall be appropriately modelled (e g by use of appropriate springs)
7.1.5
Redistribution of moments
Redistribution of moments obtained by rigorous elastic analysis may be carried out
provided;
(1)
Reduction at one location
is accompanied by increase
in other
location
in such a way as to maintain equilibrium with applied
loads.
(2)
Reduction is restricted to not more than 1 5 percent of the maximum
moment in SLS and 20 percent of that in ULS.
Redistribution shall not be carried out in circumstances where the rotation capacity and
the section to which the redistributed moments are to be transferred, cannot be defined
(e.g. in curved bridges and skew bridges with more than 1 5° angle of skew).
7.1.6
Non-linear analyses
Non-linearity of material stress-strain relationship is taken into account for design of sections.
Non-linearity arising from member's response
(e.g. due to cracking, creep etc.)
is
considered in calculating the deflections.
Non-linearity due to formation of plastic hinges in linear members or yield lines in two
dimensional elements, is not permitted except for demonstrating non-collapse condition
in seismic event or impact loading.
7.1.7
Plastic analysis
(1)
Methods based on lower bound
plastic solutions may be used
provided appropriate measures are taken to ensure that ductility
conditions are satisfied.

Elements may be idealised as statically determinate trusses
consisting of straight notional struts (carrying the compressive forces
in the concrete) and ties (the reinforcement). The forces
in the
members of the truss are established from considerations of
equilibrium. Sufficient reinforcement is then provided to carry the
tension
in the ties and a check
is performed to ensure that the
compressive stresses
in the struts are not excessive.
Detailing
requirements should then be checked, with particular regard to
anchorage of all reinforcement and to local bearing stresses due to
concentrated forces.
(3)
The location and orientation of the struts and ties should reflect

In checking compressive stresses in the struts, consideration should
be given to a possible reduction in strength due to transverse tensile
stresses or cracking or the influence of shear. The average design
compressive stress
in the struts may be taken as

In the
absence of other data, v may be taken as 0.6, including an allowance
for sustained loading. Higher values for v (even v>A) may be justified
based on a triaxial state of compressive stress, provided
it can be
shown that the complementary transverse compression can be
realised in practice.

Analyses for Serviceability Limit States
(1)
Elastic methods of analysis should be used to determine internal
forces and deformations.
The stiffness constants of discrete
members or unit widths of slab elements may be based on any of
the following:
(a) Concrete Section: The entire cross-section of member, ignohng
the presence of reinforcement.
(b) Gross Transformed Section: The entire cross-section of member
including the reinforcement transformed on the basis of
effective modular ratio, —1—
eff
A consistent approach should be used to reflect the behaviour
of various parts of the structure.

(2)
For limit state checks of deformation, stresses and crack control of
beams having wide compression flanges, a constant effective width
should be used over the full span while working out the sectional
properties. (Refer Clause 7.6.1.2). Where greater accuracy
is
required variation in the effective width along the spans should be
considered.
(3)
Modulus of elasticity and shear modulus of concrete should be
appropriate for the type of action under consideration.
(4)
For verification of steel stresses and control of cracks in discontinuity
zones, strut-and-tie model as adopted in the ULS design may be
used.
Analyses for Ultimate Limit States
(1)
Elastic methods may be used to determine the distribution of forces
and deformations throughout the structure. Stiffness constants
based on the section properties as used for the analysis of the
structure at the serviceability limit state, may be used in the analysis.
(2)
In seismic analysis,
plastic method
of analysis may be used
provided
it
can
be shown
that
adequate
ductility
exists
at
sections/locations where successive hinges/yield lines form and
these
methods

global
effects

The application of elastic methods of analysis for factored loads
for the ultimate
limit state
in general leads to safe lower bound
solutions. These may be refined and made more accurate and less
conservative. For suitable methods, specialist literature may be
(4)
For longitudinal members effects due to temperature gradient may
be neglected.
(5)
Strut-and-tie model may be used
in the analysis of discontinuity
regions. Struts representing compressive stress field and ties
provided by reinforcement, meet at connecting nodes fonning
statically stable truss system. The reinforcement carries full design
force of the tie over
its
full length and hence
is required to be
adequately anchored beyond the node. Adoption of model
developed on the basis of stress trajectories in compression and

tensile regions established from linear elastic analysis or following
direct and simple load path method, should be preferred as
it will
help in achieving crack control at serviceability conditions. Specialist
literature may be referred for details.
7.4
Torsional Effects
7.4.1
Where static equilibrium of a structure depends on the torsional resistance
of its elements, full torsional design covering ULS shall be made.
7.4.2
In general, where the torsional resistance or stiffness of members has not
been taken into account in the analysis of the structure, no specific calculations for resisting
torsion will be necessary.
In such cases adequate control of any torsional cracking should
be achieved by providing nominal reinforcement to resist torsion. However, in applying
this clause it is essential that sound engineering judgement is exercised in deciding whether
torsion plays only a minor role in the behaviour of the structure; otherwise torsional stiffness
should be used in the analysis.
7.6
Combined Global and Local Effects
In addition to the design of individual elements to resist loading applied directly to them,
it
is also necessary to consider the loading effects due to global loading where these coexist
in an element.
Analysis of the structure may be accomplished either by one overall analysis or by separate
analyses for global and local effects. In the latter case, the forces and moments acting on
the element from global and local effects should be combined as appropriate. The design
of individual elements should take into account the combined effects.

Columns
7.6.3.1
Definitions
A reinforced concrete column is a compression member whose largest lateral cross-
sectional dimension is less than or equal to four times its lesser lateral dimension.
A column should be considered as short if the ratio 4 / i
in each plane of buckling is
such that the failure takes place without involving secondary effects. In practice, the
limits upto which the secondary effects can be neglected is given in Clause 11.2.
7.6.3.2
Moments and forces in columns
(1 )
The moments, shear forces and axial forces in a column should be
determined in accordance with Clauses 7.2 and 7.3. except that if
the column
Is slender the additional moments Induced by lateral
deflection should be considered. The bases and/or other members
connected to the ends of such columns should also be designed to
resist these additional moments.
(2)
In columns with moments
it is generally sufficient to consider the
maximum and minimum ratios of moment/axial load
in designing
reinforcement areas and concrete sections.

Definition
.
A wall is a vertical load bearing concrete member whose larger lateral dimension is more
than four times its lesser lateral dimension. A wall may be considered as short where the
ratio of its effective length (height) to its thickness does not exceed 12.
It should othenA^ise
be considered as slender. Retaining walls, wing walls, abutments and other similar wall-
like elements where ultimate axial load is less than 0.1^.^^^. may be designed as bending
elements, neglecting axial load.

Forces and moments in reinforced concrete walls
Forces and moments should be calculated in accordance with Clauses 7.2 and/or 7.3
except that
if the wail
is slender, the moments induced by deflection should also be
considered. The distribution of axial and horizontal forces along a wall from the loads on
the superstructure, should be determined by the type and location of the supports. For
walls integral with deck, the moments/forces should be detemnined by elastic analysis.
The design moment per unit length in the direction at right angles to a wall should be not
less than 0.06 nji, where
is the ultimate axial load per unit length, Q.OSh is the nominal
minimum eccentricity and h is the thickness of the wall. Moment in the plane of a wall can
be calculated from statical equilibrium required for the most severe positioning ofthe relevant
loads.
Where the concentrated load is acting on a wall, dispersal of loads within the length and
height of the wall shall be considered.
It will generally be sufficient to consider the maximum and minimum ratios of moment to
axial load in designing reinforcement areas and concrete sections.

General
.,
(1)
These recommendatiojis apply to flexural members consisting of
precast concrete units acting
In conjunction with cast-ln-situ
concrete, where provision has been made for the transfer of
horizontal shear at the contact surface. The precast units may be
of either reinforced or prestressed concrete.
(2)
Differential shrinkage and creep of the component concrete
members requires consideration in analysing composite members
for the serviceability limit states. Differentia! shrinkage and creep
need not be considered for the ultimate limit state.
(3)
In general, the analysis and design of composite concrete structures
and their component members should be in accordance with the
principle defined earlier except that effects of differential shrinkage
and creep should be treated as a primary action. Particular attention
should be given
in the design of the component parts and the
composite section to take into account the effect on stresses and
deflections arising out of the method of construction (e.g. whether
props are used or not used).

(4)
A check for adequacy of components/whole section should be made
for each stage of construction. The relative stiffness of members
should be based on the concrete or gross transformed section
properties as described in Clause 7.2.
If the -concrete strengths of
the two components of the composite member differ by more than
10N/mm^, allowance for the difference in modulus of elasticity should
be made in assessing stiffness and stresses.
(5)
When at least one of the components is a prestressed member,
the combined effect of shrinkage and creep movements of the
prestressed member(s) with respect to other member(s) create time-
dependent variation of stresses, which may be more severe at
intermediate
stages
leading
to
tensile
cracking.
The
time
dependent properties of shrinkage and creep given
in Section 6
should be used in this evaluation.
(6)
When only the shrinkage effects are involved,
it
is sufficient to
analyse for the maximum value of differential shrinkage.
7.7.2
Continuity of spans in composite construction
When continuity is obtained in composite construction by changing the statical system,
consideration should be given to the secondary effects of differential shrinkage and creep
on the moments in continuous beams and on the reactions at the supports.

Creep redistribution due to dead load and prestress in the precast
unit
When a concrete structure's statical system is changed during construction, creep ofthe
concrete will modify the as-built bending moments (and shear forces) towards the

PAGE 72 of 296

redistribution, M^,. should be taken as:

the composite section as a continuous structure had been
subjected to the dead load and prestress component, which
was actually applied in the precast unit.
^as-built
is the actual bending moment set up
in the structure as
constructed.
Note:
This will depend upon the time gap when composite action is established after casting
pre-cast portion and whether in-situ concrete is cast while pre-cast beam is supported
on props and decentred after achieving composite section or cast on the beam which
takes full self-weight and weight of shuttering without help of composite action.

Structural Effects of Time-Dependent Properties of Concrete
(1)
The inelastic strains due to creep and shrinkage of concrete may
cause appreciable changes in the long-term state of deformation
stresses in the structure and structural elements.
(2)
The perfomiance with respect to serviceability is of primary concern.
(3)
In slender or thin sections where second order deformations are
important, the increase of deflections due to creep reduces the long-
term safety margin with respect to buckling instability and may lead
to creep buckling. In such cases
it should be treated as a primary
effect.

Shrinkage and creep act in a complex interdependent way. The
creep of concrete reduces internal stresses induced by shrinkage.
Where great accuracy
is not required, this effect can be directly
.
evaluated by using reduced value of modulus of elasticity of concrete
[approx. E^^/ (1+^)
refer Section
6] which corresponds to
the stresses caused by the imposed strains.

temperatures are similarly reduced by creep and can be directly
evaluated by reduced E value of 0.5 times E

For purpose of analysis of creep and shrinkage treated as acting
independently, time-dependent properties of concrete and relaxation
of steel given in Section 6 can be used.
Prestressing force applied by pre-tensioned steel or by post-tensioned steel and transferred
to the structure througii bond between steel and concrete or through mechanical
anchorages, is covered in this Section.
(1)
Prestressing
is considered as an action and
its effect should be
included in the forces/moments and applied to the structure.
(2)
Prestressing force is time-dependent. Its magnitude also varies from
the intended value due to technological reasons. Both the effects
should be considered in selection of design prestressing force.

The contribution of prestressing tendons to the resistance developed
by the member shall be limited to the additional forces mobilised
by their further deformation, consistent with the ultimate deformation
of the member.

The maximum force applied
to tendon
at active end during
tensioning, shall not exceed 90 percent of 0.1 percent proof load

Prestress in most situations, is intended to be favourable. However,
under some

In case of bonded tendons, for ultimate limit state of strength, the
design value of prestressing force shall be based on the mean

value acting at that time, with partial factor

(3)
In case of unbonded tendons and external tendons, the stress
increase in ultimate limit state of strength may be calculated taking
into account the overall deformation of the member.
If no such
calculations are made, the increase in stress in prestressing tendon
shall be taken as nil, and partial factor /p = 1

Where external/unbonded tendons are used for achieving stability
and where decrease of force or increase of force becomes
unfavourable for stability, partial factors of 0.8 and 1.25 shall be
used to decrease or increase the force, as required.
Note:
These factors account for the possible adverse variation

prestressing force. This shall be over and above the overall safety
factors against overturning and sliding required for global stability
checks.

Design and Detailing for Curved Tendons in Thin Sections
7.10.1
Radial pressure from curved tendons
The curved tendons exert radial pressure on concrete. This introduces local compression
on inner side of the curvature and tension on outer side of curvature in the plane of the
tendon. When this pressure acts on thick sections with large cover to ducts or in plane of
the member, the normal reinforcement provided for shear or surface reinforcement is
adequate to control any cracking in this region.
For tendons provided in thin curved sections (like webs curved in plan or curved slabs of
box sections) pressure acting outwards from the plane of the member causes local out-of-
plane punching shear as well as overall bending and shear in the curved members. The
following additional checks shall be carried out in such situations.

Radial reinforcement
^
The local radial tensions set up in concrete behind radia! thrust of a group of ducts lying in
one plane, introduce de-laminating forces tending to separate concrete on two sides of
the plane of the duct. These tensions should be resisted by reinforcement forming full loops
or 180° hooks (Fig. 15.2(e) with 180* bend) placed in the concrete section connecting
concrete on two sides of plane of ducts. As a simplification, full radial thrust F^(Fig. 7.2)
can be resisted by HYSD reinforcement steel
limiting permissible tensile stress to
230 MPa.

Special Load Transferring Devices
7.11.1
General
Devices like bearings of various types, dislodgement preventing stoppers and shock
transmission units are used to transmit loads between parts of bridge elements. The global
analysis of the structure should include the overall behaviour of these elements In terms of
their load/deformation characteristics in a simplified way, by defining the released and
restrained movements of the structure to which they are connected. However, the design
of these elements themselves shall be based on the details of internal load transferring
mechanism and materials used in their fabrication.
'
7.11.2
Grade effect and positioning of bearings
For bridges built in grade or cross-fall, the bearings shall normally be set level by varying
the thickness of the plate situated between the upper face of the bearing and lower face of
the beam or by any other suitable arrangement. However, where the bearings are required
to be set parallel to the inclined grade or cross-fall of the superstructure, an allowance shall
be made for the longitudinal and transverse components of the vertical loads on
the bearings.

SECTION
8 ULTIMATE LllilT STATE OF LINEAR ELEMENTS FOR
BENDING AND AXIAL FORCES
8.1
Scope
(1 )
This Section covers structural members which can be idealised as
linear members having the following characteristics: (a) one of the
dimension (length or height)
is sufficiently large as compared to
other two dimensions of its cross-section (breadth, width, thickness),
(b) the cross-sections which were plane before loading remain
approximately plane after loading and loading
is such that the
distortion of the section by shear and torsional strains is not large
enough to
vitiate this assumption,
(c) the regions of geometric
.
•
'
discontinuity and heavy transverse loads where the assumption in
,
(b) does not hold good locally, form a small part of the total length.
'
,
'
(2)
Generally, members having length larger than 4 times the largest
linear dimension of cross-section, can be considered to belong to
.
this class.
Under certain conditions of loading members having
,
'
length between
1
to 4 times the cross-sectional dimensions will
'
•
%

qualify for being treated as linear members
(e.g. short columns
without bending created by transverse shear).

geometric imperfections, unintentional and small eccentricity of
external loads or effect of lateral deflection due to transverse loading

in general are included
in
Section 11.

the assumptions given below shall be used:
^
(a) Plane sections remain plane.
'
'
(b) The strain in bonded reinforcement and in bonded prestressing
steel beyond the initial pre4ension before bonding, whether in
tension or compression, is the same as that in the surrounding
concrete.
(c) The tensile strength of the concrete is ignored.
(d) The stresses in the concrete in compression are derived from
the design stress-strain diagram in Fig. 6.5, which is a parabolic-
rectangular diagram. For other shapes of stress-strain diagram,
referAnnexureA-2.
'
"

"
•
(e) The stresses in the reinforcement steel are derived from the
design curves in Fig. 6.2, and the stresses for prestressing steel
are derived from Fig.6.3 or Fig. 6.4 as appropriate, after dividing
stresses by partial factor for materials as shown.
(f) When upward sloping branch of stress-strain curve beyond the
linear elastic portion is used, the tensile stresses in reinforcing
and prestressing steel are limited to those corresponding to
strain of 0.9^,,^
. Where idealised plastic branch is used for this
part, of the curve,
it is not necessary to check strain limit.
(g) The initial p re-strain introduced in prestressing tendons is taken
into account when assessing the stresses in the tendons at the
ultimate limit state.
(h) For cross-sections subject to pure longitudinal compression,
the compressive strain in the concrete is limited to e^.
( j) For cross-sections subject to axial compressive force and bending
and where neutral axis lies outside the section, the strain at
most compressed face is restricted to z^^. The strain diagram
is defined by assuming that the compressive strain
is at a
level (1-8^2^ E^^g) of the height of the section from the most
compressed face.

If changes in the position of the reinforcement such as at a lap can
lead to a localised reduction
in the effective depth, the most
unfavourable value should be used in the cross-section analysis.
(5)
For prestressed members with permanently unbonded internal or
externally prestressed tendons,
It
is generally necessary to take
the deformation
of the whole member
into account. Refer
Clause 7.9 for the suitable method of analysis.

8.2.2
(6)
In the analysis of a cross-section which has to resist bending and
only a small longitudinal force, the effect of the design ultimate
longitudinal compressive force may be ignored,
if it does not exceed
0.08
times the cross-sectional area. The tensile force due to
bending and the axial tensile force on the member shall be entirely
carried by reinforcement.
(7)
The bending resistance calculated on the basis of above
assumptions,
is strictly valid for bending in the planes of principal
axes.
For bending at any other axis, the approximate solutions
given in Clause 8.3.2 may be used.
(8)
Based on the principles and assumptions given in this Section, exact
solutions for cross-sections of variable width/depth may be evolved.
Local large openings in cross-section should be accounted for (e.g.
those caused by transversely or obliquely running cable
ducts).
Further explanation of possible domains of strain diagrams
The adoption of the assumptions in Clause 8.2.1 leads to the range of possible strain
diagrams at ultimate limit states subjected to different combinations of moment and axial
tensile/compressive force, as shown in Fig. 8.2.

depends on the eccentricity of the tensile force. Reinforcing/prestressing steel at least on
one side yields (with strains limited as per either idealised or simplified diagrams) which
decide the ultimate tensile capacity.
Zone-2:
Compressive load with eccentricity, having neutral axis within
Section, and ultimate strength governed by tensile steel
The maximum strain
in the concrete
is less than the
limiting value of V^^^ thus the
strength of the concrete
is not exhausted. The tensile strain at steel
Is at the upper
design limit of s^^.
Zone-3
:
Compressive load with eccentricity, having neutral axis within

Zone-4
:
Compressive load with eccentricity, with ultimate strength governed

the maximum concrete strain
( ^^^2 ) and reinforcement strain at yield (^yd) are present
simultaneously.
Zone-5:
Compressive Ibad with eccentricity, having neutral axis outside the
section (i.e. full section in compression)
The entire section
(with exception
of possibly existing prestressing
steel)
is
in
compression. AH strain profiles pass through point 0. The maximum compressive strain
of concrete

is between

line BO (which

is taken as equal to (^-s^z^^cu^^ of the total
depth of the section.

Biaxial Bending

required in bridge design. Methods are available in specialist-literature for members having

IRC:112-2011
at least two orthogonal axes of symmetry, where loads can be split in components acting in
plane of bending of each of the axes and the shear centre coinciding with the eg of the
section. The restrictions on the ultimate strains on concrete and steel specified
in
Clause 8.2.1 shall be observed.
8.3.2
Simplified method for bi-^xial bending and axial force
(1)
The simplified method described below may be used for bi-axial
bending. Special care should be taken to identify the section along
the member with the critical combination of moments. Where more
accurate analysis is required, specialist literature may be referred.
(2)
Separate design in each principal direction, disregarding bi-axial
bending,
is done as a first step. Imperfections need to be taken
into account only in the direction where they will have the most
unfavourable effect.

No further check Is necessary if the slendemess ratios satisfy the
following two conditions expressed by Eq.8.1 and

SECTION 9 ULTIMATE LIMIT STATE OF TWO AND THREE
DIMENSIONAL ELEMENTS FOR OUT OF PLANE
AND IN PLANE LOADING EFFECTS
9.1
Scope
This Section deals with plate and shell type elements and sub-elements where out of
plane loading effects as well as in plane loading effects are present. The permissible
simplifications for separating in plane and out of plane effects and designing for the
same are given. A method of providing reinforcement for in plane effects is indicated.
For use of three dimensional elements as bridge elements (e.g. shell elements as in
case of fish-belly superstructure) apart from designing for sectional strength, overall
and local buckling checks may be required. Specialist literature may be referred for the
same.
9.2
One-Way and Two-Way Slabs and Walls
For predominantly transverse loads acting perpendicular to the plane of the slab, where
primary overall in plane tensile or compressive stress fields are absent, the slabs/walls
can be designed using conventional plate bending analysis and providing ultimate strength
in bending and shear in one and/or two orthogonal directions as required by such analysis.
Bridge deck slabs, retaining wails resisting lateral earth pressures etc., are the typical
examples.
Any rational method of analysis which does not permit more than 1 5 percent redistribution
of peak bending moments over supports can be used. The ultimate strength methods
based on local yielding (e.g. yield line method) are not permitted. However, for calculating
resistance to accidental impact loads (e.g. vehicular or barge impacts), use of such
methods is permitted for which specialist literature may be referred.
9.3
Sub-Elements of Box Structures
(1)
Where box type structure resists the overall longitudinal bending,
shear and torsional effects, significant in-plane longitudinal stresses
are present in its sub-elements, which coexist with the local out of
plane loading, e.g. effects due to self weight, live loads, intemnediate
prestressing anchorages etc.
(2)
Such elements can be designed primarily for in-plane effects arising
from overall bending, shear and torsion in longitudinal direction. In
76

transverse direction they are designed for out of plane loading
effects,
(3)
If effects of out-of-plane loading are present in the same direction
as of the overall in-plane tensions/compressions, these elements
should be locally checked for combined effect of in-plane forces,
and out of plane bending moments and shears.
9.4
General Solution for Two-Way Slabs, Walls and Shell Elements
For plate type elements having complex geometry and edge conditions and having in-
plane as well as out-of-plane (transverse) effects due to loading, the resultant stress
fields may be obtained by use of suitable finite elements
in the FEM analysis. The
analysis yields resultant stresses which represent combined effects of in-plane membrane
stresses and local bending effects. These stress resultants can be directly used to
design tensile reinforcement and for verifying safety in compression. A general method of
design using sandwich model given
in Informative Annexure B-1 may be referred.
Alternatively, the stresses can be converted to equivalent axial forces and bending effects
in orthogonal directions and used for designing the sections following conventional methods.
9.4.1
Simplified design for tensile reinforcement for orthogonal in-plane
effects
The following simplified method may be used for proportioning of tensHe reinforcement
based on the in-plane stresses cs-Edx > ^Edy and r^^y
.
(1)
Compressive stresses should be taken as positive, with cjEdx > ^Edy

and the direction of reinforcement should coincide with the x and y
axes.
(2)
The tensile strengths

ftdy provided by reinforcement
should be determined from:
ftdx = Pxfyd and ftdy = Pyfyd
Eq. 9.1
Where
and py are the geometric reinforcement ratios, along
the X and y axes respectively.

In order to avoid unacceptable cracks for the serviceability state,
and to ensure the required deformation capacity for the ultimate
limit state, the reinforcement derived from Eq.9.8 and Eq. 9.9 for
each direction should not be more than ^ice and not less than half
the reinforcement determined by Eq. 9.2 and Eq. 9.3 or, alternativeiy,
from Eq.9.5 aod 9.6.

Slffipiifled design for bending in orthogonal direction
The slab (wall) subjected to orthogonal bending effects is substituted by two half plates
usually representing the compression and tensile zones of the element.
The stresses in compressive portions are checked by verifying that the resultant principle
compressive stress is within the allowable limits.
The half plate carrying tensile stresses in orthogonal directions is converted to orthogonal
nnesh of steel following method described in Clause 9.4.1
.
The out of plane shear forces are similarly converted to principle bending directions and
the maximum shear checked using methods of Section 1 0.
9.4.3
Simplified design of combined in-piane forces and out of plane
bending and sliears
The plate Is substituted by a sandwiched plate of the same thickness consisting of three
layers of 1/3"* thickness. The central 1/3^ thickness is designed to carry in-piane forces
using methods of Clause 9.4.1.
The outer two layers are designed to resist tensile and compressive fields with appropriate
lever-arm to develop resistance to bending and shear
in two directions as per
Clause 9.4.2.

LIMIT STATE OF SHEAR, PUNCHING
SHEAR AND TORSION
10.1
Scope
This Section applies to design offlexural members for web shear, interface shear between
the web and flanges, and torsion. The punching shear due to transverse concentrated
loads/reactions acting over a small area is covered. Design verification for shear is canied
out at Ultimate Limit State of strength only. The design of members requiring shear
reinforcement is based on truss model. For members without shear reinforcement truss
model is not applicable.
For concrete of grades higher than M60, the shear strength shall be limited to that of
strength grade M60 for design purpose.
10.2
Design of Flexural Members for Shear
10.2.1
Shear design model of members without shear reinforcement
(1)
The design rules, given in Clauses below are based on extensive
experimentation and not on any specific design model. These rules
take into account the important parameters mentioned in (3) & (4)
below by empirical approach.
(2)
Minimum flexural reinforcement is required in this type of members
to avoid sudden brittle failure induced by cracking in shear tension
in webs. The minimum shear reinforcement may be omitted
in
members such as slabs where transverse redistribution of loads is
possible.
(3)
Thin structural members like slabs cracked in flexure carry -shear
forces using shear strength of the uncracked compression zone,
shear forces transferred across flexural cracks by mechanical
interlock and dowel action of reinforcing steel. Members of thickness
less than 200 mm develop higher shear strength than those having
over 200 mm thickness.
(4)
The shear strength of rectangular section , T- section and L-section
is mainly determined by:
-
Effective width of web
depth
d,
ratio of bjd, and
ratio of
shear span to depth ratio.
-
Properties of concrete such as tensile strength, and mechanical
interlock of cracked surfaces.

Ratio p ~ As lb^.d of flexural tensile reinforcement to area of
concrete.
-

Zones of shear design
These elements subjected to bending and significant shear forces exhibit three zones as
shown in Fig. 10.1 (a) namely uncracked zone (Zone A); Zonewith shear cracks in web
without any flexural cracks (Zone B); Zone with combined fiexural and shear cracks (Zone
C, comprising Zones

with only flexural cracks (Zone D).
The
compression fields in concrete in these zones together with the shear resistance provided
by concrete cracks and the reinforcement, provide mechanism to carry shear forces to
the supports.
In Zone-'A', the type of support affects the compression field in concrete near the support.

The shear transfer mechanism of truss model
(1)
Beams with Constant Depth
The design of shear resistance of members is based on a truss
model (Fig. 10.2) in which loads are transferred to the support by
truss type action within the member. The compression chord,
tension chord and web members comprising compression struts
and tensile steel elements are the members of the truss. Angles
6 and a are the inclinations of concrete compressive truss and
reinforcement with the axis of the element as defined
in
Fig. 1 0.2(a). The angles may be chosen within limits such that:
1.0<cot6>'<2.5 and 45°<a<90°

Beams of Variable Depth
A schematic truss model for beam with both tensile and compressive
chords inclined to the centra! axis as shown
in Fig. 10.3 may be
used for design of shear resistance. The forces in the chord and
web may be determined on the basis of this or other suitable truss
models.
As a simplification, local zones of short length of a beam with inclined
chords may be designed using method given for beam with parallel
chord. For this shear force to be carried by the web shall be
corrected by taking into account the components of chord forces
parallel to the shear force as shown in Fig. 10.4.

In case of direct support, shear force V^^ acting at section 'd

reinforcement. For checking crushing of concrete compression strut
V^5 shall be taken at the face of support.

In case of indirect support, shear force shall be taken at face of the
support both for design of reinforcement and checking compressive
stresses.

In the elements of variable depth, where
V^^, M^^ and N^^ are
concurrently acting forces, the design shear force V^^ from sectional
analysis shall be reduced by the favourable contribution from any

in Fig. 10.4, V^^ = V^^- V^^- V^- V^^
with appropriate signs.
(4)
in case of prestressed members the design prestressing force is
considered as external load in the analysis and is accounted for in
the analysis of the sectional shear V^^
. including its hyperstatic effects
in case of indeterminate members.
Further increase
in force
in bonded tendons due to cracking of
concrete under ULS load only is to be included in the analysis of shear
resistance of truss
in the same way as that of untensioned
reinforcement.
In case of pretensioned members the reduction
in the maximum
developable force under UTS
in prestressing tendons within

For cross-sections where the width varies over the height, the

In such a case the minimum value of the shear
capacity should be found by calculating V^^^ at various axes in the

The shear resistance of concrete flexural element in a truss model
is dependent on the longitudinal reinforcement provided
in the
tension zone.
For full effectiveness at the design section of shear,
the
longitudinal reinforcement shall extend not less than
AI = «icot^+4i/ beyond the section considered where
'cf
is the
effective depth and
^ the anchorage length (Fig. 10. 5). The area
of bonded prestressing steel may be included.

will be sudden and
hence shall be avoided.
(3)
The shear at the interface between concrete cast at different times
requires additional precautions as detailed in Clause 10.3.4.
(4)
To find the
least amount of shear reinforcement, for low and
intermediate shear stresses, the lower
limits of 0 given
in
Clause 10.2.2.2 will normally govern the design. For higher shear
stresses, the value of 9 may be found by equating the design shear
force
to V^^^^. The amount of shear reinforcement is then found
by equating the design shear force V^^ to U^^^ The value of 0 may
alternatively selected to optimize the design, forexample by minimizing
the total amount of reinforcement.

the force in the tension chord, provided by the unbonded tendons

the section where this reinforcement is required (Refer Fig. 10. 9).
The rules in this Section are complementary to those given in earlier Sections. This Section
covers shear due to punching force (penetrating force) on two dimensional structural
elements such as deck slabs, soffit slab, well caps and open foundations. The word 'slab'
represents all these in Clausel 0.4.
The punching nomnally happens when a concentrated force (load or reaction) acts over a
small area of the two dimensional structural element and causes local shear failure
surrounding the concentrated force in the element.

Punching shear is evaluated as shear stress at (a) face of the loaded
area, u^ib) along basic control perimeter u,and (c) other perimeters
as required in Clause 10.4.2(4).

The basic control perimeter

at the control
perimeter.

For a loaded area situated near an edge, on the edge or at a comer,
the control perimeter should be taken as shown in Fig. 10.11.
In
such cases special edge reinforcement shall be provided, as per
Clause 16.6.1.4.
(4)
Control perimeters at a distance less than 2d should be considered
for checking punching shear where the concentrated force of loaded
area is partly resisted by a high pressure such as soil pressure on
a base (e.g. foundation slab/raft) or by effects of a reaction or load
within a distance of 2d of the periphery of the area of application of
force such as pile caps. (Refer Clause 1 0.4.5).

Design of section for punching siiear
(1)
In bridges, punching should be avoided by providing adequate
concrete thickness with sufficient reinforcement for resisting bending
and shear, which should also be capable of resisting the worst local
punching shear stresses.
(2)
The design procedure for punching shear is based on checks at the
face of the column and at the basic control perimeter U]
. The following
design shear stresses (MPa) along the control sections, are defined:
^Rd.c
the design value of the punching shear resistance of a slab without
punching shear reinforcement along the control section considered.

maximum punching shear stress should not be exceeded:

Torsion
General
(1)
Torsional resistance in concrete elements, in which its longitudinal
fibres are free to deform in longitudinal direction, is categorized into
equilibrium torsion and compatibility torsion. Where the longitudinal
105



======================================================================
PAGE 118 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
fibres are restrained by external element, warping torsion results. For
example, when longitudinal restraint to the deformation of external
walls of hollow sections or surfaces of solid sections exists, warping
torsion results.
(2)
Equilibrium
torsion
is
that
which
is
essential
to
keep the element in equilibrium. Such elements shall be designed
to cater for
full torsional resistance
in the ultimate
limit state
[Fig. 10.14(a)].
(3)
If torsional resistance is not essential for stability or static equilibrium
of the element, but arises out of compatibility of displacement/
rotations of connected element,
it is termed as compatibility torsion.
It will not be necessary to consider torsion at ultimate limit state
[Fig. 10.14(b)]
Such elements will be subjected to torsional deformations in service
leading to cracking and deflection.
To
limit the crack width and deformations
in the
limit state of
serviceability, checks as given in Clause 12.3.5 shall be performed.
Suitable reinforcement as per detailing Sections shall be provided.
Fig. 10.14(a) Example of Equilibrium
Fig. 10.14(b) Examples of
Torsion
Compatibility Torsion
(4)
The torsional resistance of a closed section may be calculated on
the basis of a thin-walled closed section,
in which equilibrium
is
satisfied by a closed shear flow. Solid sections may be modelled
by equivalent thin-walled sections.
106



======================================================================
PAGE 119 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
Complex shapes, such as T-sections, may be divided into a series
of sub-sections, each of which is modelled as equivalent thin walled
hollow section. The total torsional resistance is taken as sum of the
individual sub-sections.
(5)
The distribution of the acting torsional moments over the sub-
sections should be
in proportion to their uncracked torsional
stiffnesses. For hollow sections such as box sections, the equivalent
wall thickness should not exceed the actual wall thickness.
(6)
Each sub-section may be designed separately. For conversion of
solid sub-section to equivalent hollow section procedure given in
Fig. 10. 16 defining the effective thickness of wall
t^j-j may be
followed.
(7)
In the analysis, torsional stiffness may be calculated on the following
basis:
(a) In case of equilibrium torsion, the stiffness should be based on
uncracked sectional resistance, i.e. gross-section.
(b) In case of compatibility torsion, the torsional stiffness may be
calculated on the basis of cracked section.
Torsional stiffness of cracked section may be assumed as
25 percent of that of the uncracked section (Refer Clause 7.4).
Design procedures
Hollow section and equivalent closed thin wall section
(1)
The shear stress in a wall of a section subject to a pure torsional
moment may be calculated from:
^t>i - JJTTT
Eq. 10.46
The design torsional shear force V^^
. in a wall T due to torsion is
given by V^j
, = T,j^f ,z, where T^^ is the applied design torsion (see
Fig. 10.15).
(2)
For resisting torsion, reinforcement has to be provided both
in
longitudinal and transverse direction.

For closed thin-walled sections and solid sections, warping torsion
may normally be ignored unless the longitudinal elongation of the
walls/surfaces of the section is restrained by other members.
(2)
In open thin walled members
it is necessary to consider warping
torsion.
For very slender cross-sections the calculation should be
carried out on the basis of a beam grid model and for other cases
on the basis of a truss model,
in all cases the design should be
canied out according to the design rules for bending and longitudinal
normal force, and for shear.

(1)
This Section deals with structures and
structural members
whose load deformation behaviour and ultimate capacity
are significantly affected by second order effects. Second order effects
are defined as the additional effects of actions caused by structural
defomiations. Second order effects can be global, involving structure
as a whole, and/or local, involving some of its members, such as
columns, walls, compression flanges of beams etc.
(2)
Classical buckling defined as sudden failure due to instability of
perfectly axially loaded members without horizontal load does not
usually occur in practical reinforced/prestressed concrete members.
However, long slender members at ultimate load exhibit large and
disproportionate increase of deflections due to combined effect of
geometric non-linearity (P-A effect) and non-linear structural
response due to material non-linearity, progressive cracking and
local plasticity. This reduces the ultimate load carrying capacity as
compared to the short members of identical cross-section and steel
ratio.
Therefore,
long members should be designed to have higher
moment resisting capacity as compared
to short members of
identical sectional details.
(3)
Second order linear elastic method of analysis shall be used for
calculating second order effects. Equilibrium and resistance shall
be verified
in the deformed state for the most unfavourable
combination of actions at ultimate limit state, taking into account
uncertainties in geometry and position of axial loads as additional
first order effects.
(4)
The distinction between treatment of long column and short column
for purpose of this Section 1 1
is based on 10 percent criteria given
in (5) below.
Structural behaviour shall be considered in all directions in which
significant second order effects can occur.
Biaxial bending shall
be taken into account when necessary.
(5)
Second order effects may be ignored if they are less than 10 percent
of the corresponding first order effects, calculated on the basis of
(3) above.

11.3
Non-linear Analysis of Structure and Elements
11.3.1
General
(1)
In case of members having varying sections and different types of
loading such as permanent and quasi-permanent loads leading to
creep effects and short term loads such as live loads, generalised
methods of non-linear analysis taking into account the geometric
non-linearity of structure need to be used.
(2)
Alternatively, a method based on nominal curvature (Clause 1 1 .3.2)
is suitable for isolated members.
(3)
Stress-strain relationships for concrete given
in Annexure (A2.7)
and for steel given
in Section 6 (Fig. 6. 2 and 6.4) may be used.
With stress-strain diagrams based on design values, a design value
of the ultimate load is obtained directly from the analysis. In equation
Eq. A2-26 and
in the calculation of /(-value, /
is then substituted
~
' •'cm
by the design compressive strengthy^^and E^^ is substituted by:
F
^cd -
, where y^i^
is taken as 1 .2
(4)
In the absence of more refined models, creep may be taken into
account by modifying all strain values in the concrete stress-strain
diagram using effective E value as per Clause 6.4.2. 5.4(iii).
11.3.2
Method based on nominal curvature
11.3.2.1
General
This method is primarily suitable for isolated members with constant normal force and a
defined effective length/^. The method gives a nominal second order moment based
on a deflection, which in turn is based on the effective length and an estimated maximum
curvature.
11.3.2.2
Design bending moments
(1)
The design moment is:
M,,= M^,,^M,
Eq.11.4
where

the nominal second order moment, defined in (3)
115



======================================================================
PAGE 128 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
The maximum value of M^^ is given by the distributions of M^^^ and M^, the
latter may be taken as parabolic or sinusoidal over the effective length.
For statically indeterminate members, M^^ is determined for the actual
boundary conditions, whereas
will depend on boundary conditions via
the effective length.
(2)
Differing first order end moments M^^ and M^^ may be replaced by
an equivalent first order end moment M^:
M^=0.6M,,+0.4Mo,>0.4M,,
,
'
Eq.11.5

same side, otherwise opposite signs. Furthermore,

top.

/.
is the effective length, see Clause 1 1 .2.2
c
is a factor depending on the curvature distribution.
(4)
For constant cross-section, c=10 {t^) is normally used.
If the first
order moment is constant, a lower value should be considered (8 is
a lower limit, corresponding to constant total moment).
Note:
The value
corresponds to a sinusoidal curvature distribution. The value for constant
curvature is 8. Note that c depends on the distribution of the total curvature.

12.3
Limit State of Cracking
12.3.1
General
Cracking takes place in tensile regions of concrete structures due to load effects, such as
bending, shear, torsion and direct tension. Cracks may also be caused due to internal
deformations such as shrinkage and temperature effects. The intent of the following
provisions is to ensure, with acceptable probability, that the cracks will not impair the proper
functioning or durability ofthe structure or cause its appearance to be unacceptable. Cracks
due to other effects such as expansive chemical reactions need to be controlled by
measures given under Section 14
-r
"
12.3.2
Limiting crack width
(1 )
Due to the random nature of the cracking phenomenon, actual crack
width cannot be predicted.
However, a reasonable estimation of
crack width can be made using the mathematical model given
in
Clause 12.3.4. The crack width, so calculated, shall be restricted
to the values given in Table 12.1 for various conditions of exposure.
The decompression
limit check requires that no tensile stresses
occur within 1 00mm of the surface of duct for bonded prestressing
tendons.
(2)
For the crack width checks under combinations which include
temperature distribution, the resulting member forces should be
calculated using gross section concrete properties. The effect of
self-equilibrating thermal stresses within a section may be ignored.
(3)
For members with only unbonded tendons, requirements for
reinforced concrete elements apply. For members with a
combination of bonded and unbonded tendons, requirements for
prestressed concrete members with bonded tendons apply.
(4)
Crack width may be calculated according
to Clause
12.3.4.
Alternatively,
limiting maximum bar size or spacing as per
Clause 12.3.6 may be deemed to satisfy crack control criteria for
reinforced concrete members.

Minimum reinforcement for crack control
(1)
A minimum amount of untensioned reinforcement is required to control
cracking in areas where tension due to external loadings or extemal
restraints is expected. The amount of such reinforcement may be
estimated from equilibrium between the tensile force in concrete just
before cracking and tensile force in steel at yielding.
(2)
Minimum area of reinforcement may be calculated as follows.
In
profiled cross sections
like T-beams and box girders, minimum
reinforcement should be determined for the individual parts of the
section (webs, flanges).

is to be controlled. Table 12. 3 gives the maximum spacing of bars in
mm for two crack widths for similar condition.
(3)
The values in the table are based on the following assumptions:
c=40mm;4^^ =2.8 MPa;
= 0.5; (h-d) = O.lh; A: =0.8; ^^=0.5; ^=0.5 and k=\.0
(4)
Where the minimum reinforcement given by Clause 12.3.3
is
provided, crack widths are unlikely to be excessive
if:
-
for cracking dominantly caused by restraint, the bar sizes given in
Table 12 .2 are not exceeded where the steel stress is the value
obtained immediately after cracking (i.e
in Eq. 12.1).
-
for cracks caused mainly by loading, either the provisions of Table
12.2 or Table 12.3 shall be complied with. The steel stress should
be calculated on the basis of a cracked section under the relevant
combination of actions.

Limit State of Deflection
12.4.1
General
Cable supported bridges are not in the purview of this Code, for which specialist literature
may be followed.
(1 )
The deflections/deformations of a member or structure shall not be
such that
it adversely affects its proper functioning or appearance.
In some cases, expected deflections may need to be adjusted in
the structural geometry by pre-cambering, so as to attain the
requisite profile at the time of placing expansion joints and wearing
course.
(2)
Appropriate
limiting values of deflection taking
into account the
nature of the structure, bridge deck furniture and functional needs
of the bridge, should be established. In the absence of other criteria,
the following deflection limits under Live Load may be considered
Vehicular

End Block Design and Detailing
Requirements given in this clause are in addition to those given in Clause 16.14 on detailing.
The overall design of the end block shall take into account the stress distribution based on
elastic distribution of forces in uncracked section and suitable reinforcement shall be
provided to take up the tensions respecting the crack width limitations. The bursting forces

Rectangular End Block (2
X 2 YJ
In the rectangular end blocks, the bursting tensile forces in the two
principal directions can be assessed on the similar basis as
in
Table 13.1. The shape of the loaded area of anchorage should be
taken as a concentric rectangular area having the same shape as
the end block and the same area as that of actual anchorage.
Alternatively the higher of the two reinforcements can be provided
in both directions
13.5.1.2
Internal (embedded) anchorages
Where the anchorages are embedded in concrete, the concrete behind anchorages is
subjected to complex tri-axial set offerees where the main compressive thrust is limited to
remain below the multi-axial compressive capacity and tensions in transverse directions
are taken up by suitable reinforcement. Although theoretical assessment may be possible,
the design and detailing is made as per recommendations of the manufacturers of the
anchorage system.
13.5.1.3
Group of anchorages
Where groups of anchorages or bearing plates occur, the end block should be divided into
a series of symmetrically loaded prisms and each prism treated in the same manner. In
detailing the reinforcement for the end block as a whole,
it is necessary to ensure that the
137



======================================================================
PAGE 150 of 296

IRC:112-2011
groups of anchorages are appropriately tied together. Special attention should be paid to
end blocks having a cross-section different in shape from that of the general cross-section
of the beam and reference should be made to specialist literature. Compliance with the
above requirements will generally ensure that bursting tensile forces along the loaded axis
are provided for.
In case where large concentrated tendon forces are involved alternative
methods of design based on specialist literature and manufacturer's data as per
Clause 13.5.3 may be more appropriate.
1 3.5.2
Spaiting reinforcement for post-tensioned tendons
Consideration should also be given to the spaliing tensile stresses that occur in end blocks.
Where the anchorage or bearing plates are highly eccentric, these stresses reach a
maximum at the loaded face. The end face of anchorage zone shall be continuously
reinforced to prevent edge spelling. Reinforcement shall be placed as close to the end
face as possible.
13.5.3
Bursting reinforcement for pre-tensioned members
The bursting resistance of pre-tensioned anchorage zone provided by vertical reinforcement
in the ends of pre-tensioned beams shall be taken as:
where
fs =
stress in steel not exceeding 140 MPa
Ag =
Total area of vertical reinforcement located within the distance hi 5
from the end of the beam (mm^).

The bursting resistance
Pf. shall not be less than 4 percent of the prestressing force at
transfer.
The end vertical reinforcement shall be as close to the end of the beam as practicable.
13.6
Protective Grouting
(1)
Post tensioned tendons shall be bonded to concrete of the
prestressed member as well as protected from corrosion by cement
grout which shall
fill the ducts fully, without leaving any entrapped
air or water pockets, voids created by evaporation of excess water
in the grout and bleeding.
(2)
Unbonded tendons placed either in ducts embedded in concrete
or externally located shall be protected from corrosion by suitable

are some of the options. For materials other than cement or such
long
life permanent materials, arrangements for inspection and
''
refilling or replacement of grouting materials shall be made. Factory
made coated wires/strands embedded in polyethylene ducts with
suitable fill are acceptable. Manufacturer's recommendations shall
be followed for the specialist materials and techniques.

Protection of Post Tensioned Tendons and Anchorages
'
In order to achieve a durable post-tensioning system, matching with the design service life
of the structure, suitable corrosion protection of the post-tensioning system, is necessary.
The con-osion protection system shall take into account:
•
(a)
Temporary protection of the tendons, ducts, anchorages and
all
accessories from manufacturer handling storage, transport
till
incorporation in the structure.
(b)
Semi-permanent protection of the system in situations where the
tendons and anchorages are exposed to atmosphere for an extended
period of time.
(c)
Permanent protection of prestressing system applied either at the
factory or at site shall be according to stressing of the surrounding.
Special care is warranted since most parts of the tendon or other
component are generally not accessible during service life.

DURABILITY
14.1
General
•
.
'
'
This Section covers design for durability and suggests provisions to ensure that adequate
durability is achieved.
The structure shall be designed such that deterioration over its design service life does
not impair the performance of the structure below that intended, having due regard to
the service environment and the anticipated level of maintenance.
One of the main characteristics influencing the durability of concrete is its permeability
to the ingress of water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, chloride, sulphate and other potentially
deleterious substances. Degree of permeability
is governed by the constituents, the
mix proportions and workmanship used in making concrete. A suitably low permeability
can be achieved by having adequate cement content, low water cement
ratio and
ensuring complete compaction of the concrete followed by adequate curing. Use of
blended cements will also help to achieve low permeability.
The factors influencing durability of concrete include:
(1)
The environment,
(2)
The cover to embedded steel,
(3)
The type and quality of constituent materials,
(4)
The cement content and water/cement ratio,
(6)
Workmanship
to obtain full compaction and efficient curing and
(6)
The shape and size of the member.
14.2
Common Mechanisms Leading to the Deterioration of Concrete
Structures
•
Common mechanisms of deterioration of concrete structures in service are:
(1)
Corrosion of reinforcement/prestressing tendons
(2)
Frost attack
(3)
Alkali-aggregate reactions
(4)
Attack from sulphates
(5)
Attack by aggressive chemicals
(6)
Acid attack and
(7)
Abrasion

14.3
Design for Durability
Basic steps in designing for durability are:
(1)
To establish the aggressiveness of the service environment
(exposure condition), with respect to the various mechanisms of
deterioration. Different components of the structure can be exposed
.
^
to different service environments.
(2)
To select the type of structure suitable for the service environment.
(3)
To select the appropriate materials, mix proportions, workmanship,
design and detailing, including minimum cover to steel.
14.3.1
Classification of exposure conditions
The general environment to which the concrete structure will be exposed during its service
life is classified into four levels of severity. In doing so,
it is possible that the classification
relates to specific mechanisms of deterioration The relative importance of the various
mechanisms will vary from region to region in a country and no generally applicable ordering
of the mechanisms can be made. However, there seems no doubt that the commonest
and most serious form of degradation worldwide is corrosion of reinforcement.
It can also
be stated that, of the two
initiating mechanisms for corrosion viz.
- carbonation and
chlorides; chlohdes have caused the greater amount of damage by far. The classification
in Table 14.1 caters essentially to corrosion of steel in concrete.

14.3.2
Durability provisions
14.3.2.1
Concrete mix proportions and cover
Presence of moisture is necessary for most of the deleterious actions to proceed and low
permeability of concrete is a prerequisite for durability. Greater impermeability is achieved
primarily by the control of water/cement ratio and seiection of the cement type.
The water/cement ratio governs the strength of concrete, and strength classes are
accordingly chosen, as an indirect control on these parameters.
Cover (or clear cover) is the distance from the concrete surface to the surface of the nearest
reinforrennent, including links, stirrups and surface reinforcement. Cover is more important
from the consideration of corrosion of steel in concrete. The cover should at least be equal
to the depth of likely chloride ingress by diffusion over a time period equal to the design
service life. Chloride diffusion coefficient in concrete depends upon the water/cement ratio
- and the cement type;
it is lower for blended cements, and lower water/cement ratios,
ft is
-
possible to select combinations of the water cement ratio and cover thickness to achieve
the objective. However, the selection of cover should also take into account other structural
aspects like safe transmission of bond forces and control of crack width.
Taking these considerations into account, the requirements of concrete mix properties
and cover for different exposure conditions considered
in Table 14.1, for 20 mm size
aggregate are given in Table 14.2,

Sulphate content
Sulphates are present in cements, in some aggregates and mix water. They can also be
imbibed from the service environment e.g. coastal environment. The total water-soluble
sulphate content of the concrete mix, expressed as SO3. shall not exceed 4 percent by
mass of cement in the mix.
14.3.2.5
Maximum cement content
Cement content (excluding fly ash, GGBS or Silica Fume) shall not exceed 450 kg/m^.
14.4
Additional Provisions for Specific Mechanisms of Deterioration
Some additional provisions for different mechanisms of deterioration are given below.
14.4.1
Corrosion of reinforcement
The normal way to design against corrosion is to ensure that there is an adequate cover to
the reinforcement and that the concrete in the cover region is of a high quality and is well
cured. In extreme environments, however, there are other measures which may have to be
adopted, such as:
(1)
Use of galvanized reinforcement or reinforcement with fusion-
bonded epoxy coating.
,
•
.
.
;
(2)
Use of surface coatings to the concrete to inhibit the ingress of
chlorides or carbon dioxide. Such coatings need periodic
renewal.
(3)
Use of waterproofing membrane over the bridge deck.
(4)
Use of controlled permeability formwork (CPF) liners, which effectively
reduce the water-cement ratio of cover concrete and reduce the
chloride diffusion into the concrete.
(5)
Application of cathodic protection to the structure.
(6)
Use of stainless steel reinforcement.
One major factor in the avoidance of corrosion problems is the form of the structure. Areas
of exposed concrete on which water can stand or can drain across, are particularly at risk.
14.4.2
Sulphate attack
Depending upon the concentration of SO3 ions in soil, subsoil or ground water, appropriate
protective measures comprise selection of proper type of cement, mix proportions and
protective coatings in severe cases. The details are given in Table 14.4.

Alkali -silica reaction
The alkali-silica reaction can be alleviated by the following methods:-
(1)
Use of aggregates which have been found to perform satisfactorily
in practice,
1
(2)
Use of non-reactive aggregate from alternate sources,
(3)
Use of iow-alkali OPC having total alkali content not more than
0.6 percent {Hafi equivalent).
Further advantage can be
obtained by use of fly ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag or
silica fume as part replacement of low alkali OPC. In such cases,
fly ash content should be at least 20 percent or slag content at
least 50 percent,
145



======================================================================

(4)
Measures to reduce the degree of saturation of concrete during
service such as use of impermeable membranes,
(5)
Limiting the cement content of the concrete mix and thereby limiting
total alkali content in the concrete mix,
For more guidance, specialist literature may be referred.
14.4.4
Frost attack
Frost damage can be avoided by the following methods:-
(1)
Protecting the concrete from saturation.
(2)
Using an air-entrained concrete mix. The small bubbles of entrained
air within the matrix can provide pressure
relief. The minimum
amount of entrained
air should be 3.5 percent for 20 mm size
aggregate, and greater for smaller sizes. Air-entraining admixture
should conform to IS 91 03.
(3)
Using high-strength concrete, with compressive strength of 45 MPa
or more.

basic coated electrodes with matching strength bars/wires
is
recommended.
(3)
Welding shall conform to IS 2751 and IS 9417 except as provided
herein.
(4)
Generally, shop welding in controlled conditions is to be preferred,
where feasible. Site welding where necessary shall, however, be
permitted when the facilities, equipment, process, consumables,
operators, welding procedure are adequate to produce and maintain
uniform quality at par with that attainable in shop welding to the
satisfaction of the engineer.

(5)
Welding may be carried out by metal arc welding process. Oxy-
acetylene welding shall not be permissible. Any other process may
be used subject to the approval of the engineer and necessary
additional requirements to ensure satisfactory joint performance.
Precautions on over heating, choice of electrode, selection of correct
current in arc welding etc., should be strictly observed.

(8)
Joint welding procedures which are to be employed shall invariably
be established by a procedure specification and shall be qualified
prior to use by tests as prescribed in IS 2751
. All welders and welding
operators to be employed shall have to be qualified by tests
prescribed in IS 2751

Bars may be spliced with mechanical devices, e.g. by special grade
steel sleeves swaged on to the bars in end to end contact or by
threaded couplers. A mechanical splice including
its connecting
elements shall develop in tension or compression at least 125 per
cent of the characteristic strength/^

Splicing by lapped joints shall not be used either for tension or
compression bars.
(3)
Bars of ^>32 mm shall be used only In elements whose minimum
depth is not less than 1 5 times, the diameter of the bar.
(4)
When large bars are used, adequate crack control shall be ensured
either by using surface reinforcement as per Clause 16.5.4 (4). or by
calculation as per Section 12.
(5)
Splitting forces are higher and dowel action is greater with the use
of large diameter bars. Such bars should be anchored with
mechanical devices. As an alternative they may be anchored as
straight bars, but
links should be provided as confining
reinforcement.
(6)
Generally large diameter bars should not be lapped. Exceptions
include sections with a minimum dimension 1.0 m or where the
stress in steel is not greater than 80 percent of the design ultimate
strength.
(7)
Transverse reinforcement, additional to that for shear, should be
provided in the anchorage zones where transverse compression is
not present.
(8)
For straight anchorage lengths (see
Fig. 15.6 for the notation
used) the additional reinforcement referred to In (7) above should
not be less than the following:
-
in the direction parallel to the tension face:
= 0.25 A^n,

-
in the direction perpendicular to the tension face:
A^^^026A^r}^

A^
is the cross sectional area of an anchored bar,
is the number of layers with bars anchored at the same point

The additional transverse reinforcement should be uniformly
distributed in the anchorage zone and the spacing of bars should
not exceed 150 mm.

_
If tendons are anchored at a construction joint or within a concrete
'
member (whether on an external rib, within a pocket or entirely inside
'
the member),
it should be checked that a minimum
residual
compressive stress of at least 3 MPa is present in the direction of the
anchored prestressing force, under the frequent load combination.
If
the minimum residual stress is not present, reinforcement should be
provided to cater for the local tension beyond terminated tendon near
the anchor. The check for residual stress is not required If the tendon
is coupled at the anchorage considered.

Where the direction of the longitudinal bar changes (e.g. at changes
in column size), the spacing of transverse reinforcement should be
calculated, taking account of the
lateral forces involved. These
effects may be ignored
if the change of direction
is less than or

element.
For the design and amount of reinforcement for the full section and for the local effects,
refer Section 13. This reinforcement should be detailed to meet requirements of Clause
13,5 as well as to satisfy the following rules. Extra reinforcement over and above the
calculated amount as per Clause 13.5 shall be provided,
if needed, to satisfy these rules.

to remain elastic under design seismic action and foundations shall
not be intentionally used as a means of energy dissipation through
phenomenon of hysteresis.

in such a manner
that plastic hinges can occur only at pre-determined locations and
not at any other locations.

When confinement
is required, the reinforcement specified
in
Clause 17 2.1.2 shall be provided over the entire length of the
plastic hinge. Outside the length of the hinge, the transverse
reinforcement may be gradually reduced to that required by other
criteria. The amount of transverse reinforcement provided over an
additional length
adjacent to the theoretical end of the plastic
hinge, shall not be less than 50 percent of the confining reinforcement
required in the region of plastic hinge.

The confinement shall extend at least upto the length where the
value of the compressive strain exceeds O.Se^^^
Buckitng of longitudinal compression reinforcement
(1)
Buckling of longitudinal reinforcement shall be avoided along the
length of the potential hinge areas, even after several hysterics
cycles in post-yield region of stress-strain diagram of steel.
To meet this requirement,
all main longitudinal bars should be
restrained against outward buckling by transverse reinforcement
(hoops or cross-ties) perpendicular to the longitudinal bars at a
(longitudinal) spacing
not exceeding five times
d^i
, the
diameter of the smallest longitudinal bars.
(2)
Along straight section boundaries, restraining of longitudinal bars
should be achieved in either one of the following ways:
(a) Through a perimeter tie engaged by intermediate cross-ties at
alternate locations of longitudinal bars, at transverse (horizontal)
spacing
not exceeding 200 mm. The cross-ties shall have
ISS** hooks at one end, and
1 35*^ or 90® bend at the other end.
Bends of QO^'arenotpemiitted if rj^is greater than 0.3. Cross ties
having 135° on both ends may consist of two lapped spliced
pieces. In sections of large dimensions the perimeter tie may
be spliced using appropriate lapping length combined with
hooks; or
(b) Through overlapping closed ties arranged so that every corner
bar and at least every alternate intemai longitudinal bar
is
engaged by a tie leg. The transverse (horizontal) spacing
of
the tie legs should not exceed 200 mm.

fy,
is the yield strength of the longitudinal reinforcement.
Other ryies
(1)
Due to the possibility of loss of concrete cover in the plastic hinge
region, the confining reinforcement shall be anchored by 135® hooks
around a longitudinal
bar. Where
90*^ bend
is used as per
Clasue 17.2.2(2), the bar shall extend by minimum 10 diameters
into the core concrete.
(2)
Similar anchoring or a full strength weld is required for the lapping
of spirals or hoops within potential plastic hinge regions.
In this
case laps of successive spirals or hoops, when located along the
perimeter of the member, should be staggered.

Splicing by lapping or welding of longitudinal reinforcement is not
allowed within the plastic hinge region.

The ratio of the clear width b to the thickness h of the walls, in the
plastic hinge region (length

Galvanised reinforcement
Galvanising of reinforcing steel
is achieved by hot dipping process
in which steel
reinforcement is dipped in a bath of molten zinc at about 450**C and cooled in a controlled
manner. The coating
is chromate treated to avoid reaction between zinc and fresh
cement paste. The requirements of coating are as per IS 12594-1988. In this process,
zinc is chemically bonded with steel surface in layers with varying percentage of zinc
contents, from maximum of 100 percent
(i.e. free) zinc as the outermost layer, to a
minimum 72-79 percent of zinc as the innermost layer above the base steel. These layers
increase the corrosion resistance of steel.
201



======================================================================
PAGE 214 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
The strength as well as elongation and bond properties are not adversely affected by
galvanising.
18.2.3.2
Epoxy-coated reinforcement
Reinforcing bars confonning to IS 1 786 can be coated by fusion bonded epoxy conforming
to IS 13620-1993.
The fusion-bonded epoxy coating forms a continuous layer (free of holidays) which has
high electrical resistance and prevents setting up of corrosion cells between steel and the
surrounding electrolytic micro-environment of moist concrete.
It also provides physical
barrier between steel and the harmful elements from environmental sources, controlling
their rate of penetration. On the other hand, the discontinuities in the barrier (holidays)
have the tendency to concentrate the corrosion currents in these areas, leading to faster
localised corrosion. The overall effect of coating is, however, beneficial in increasing the
corrosion resistance of the structure, provided the occurrence of holidays is controlled.
The bond between reinforcement and concrete is lowered by upto 20 percent of the bond
without such coating. In detailing of steel the lap lengths and anchorage lengths shall be
increased by 25 percent.
18.2.3.3
Stainless steel reinforcement
Properties of stainless steel reinforcement shall not be inferior to those of carbon steel
reinforcement of corresponding strength class. For bond properties, the relevant code
may be referred or they may be established on the basis of tests.
Note:
Till such time as the Indian Standard for stainless
steel
reinforcement
is
available, the British Standard 88:6744:2001
, may be referred.

IRC:112-2011
Additional trial mixes and tests shall be carried out during production
in case any changes
in the properties of fresh concrete and/or
strength of hardened concrete on the basis of early age tests, are
observed, so as to control and bring the quality of concrete within
acceptable limits. In case of any change in the source of materials,
or properties of materials, the design of mix shall be newly
established.
(2)
Procedure for Design of Mix
Procedures as per any national code or any procedure established
by practice for arriving at the suitable mix design, can be followed.
Where earlier experience of concrete made from the selected
materials is available, the same can provide the basis for the start
of the mix design.
The target mean strength of concrete shall exceed the specified
characteristic strength by at least the margin (called current margin)
taken as
1 .645 times the standard deviation of sample test results
taken from at least 30 separate batches of concrete of nominally
similar proportions produced at site by the same plant under similar
supervision, over a period exceeding 5 days, but not exceeding
one month.
Where sufficient data as above to establish the standard deviation
is not available, the current margin for the
initial mix design shall
be taken as 10 MPa, (i.e. standard deviation as 6 MPa) for normal
and uniform conditions of quality controls. This initial current margin
shall be used only until sufficient data are available to determine
the current margin as described above.
18.5.4
Sampling and testing
(1)
General
(a) Samples from fresh concrete shall be taken as per IS 1199
and samples shall be made, cured and tested at specified
number of days
in accordance with
IS 516. The strength
parameters are based to 28 days strength.
Tests at other age
shall be performed,
if specified.
(b) Where automated batching plant is located away from the place
of use or concrete is supplied from Ready Mixed Concrete (RMC)
Plant, and the time gap between production and placement is
more than the initial setting time or where any ingredients are
210



======================================================================
PAGE 223 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
added subsequent to mixing, separate sets of samples shall
be collected rnd tested at batching plant and
at location of
placement. The results shall be compared and used to make
suitable adjustments at batching plants so that properties of
concrete at placement are as per the requirements.
(c)
In order to get a relatively quicker idea of the quality of concrete,
optional tests on beams for modulus of rupture at 72 ± 2 h or at
7 days, or compressive strength tests at 7 days may be carried
out in addition to 28 days compressive strength test. For this
purpose, the acceptable values should be arhved at based on
actual testing. In ail the cases, the equivalent 28 days compressive
strength shall be the criterion for the acceptance/rejection of the
concrete.
(d) Additional samples may be required for various purposes such
as to determine the strength of concrete at 7 days or at the time
of transfer of prestress or striking the formwork, or to determine
the duration of curing, or to check the testing error. Additional
samples may also be required for testing samples cured by
accelerated methods as described
in IS 9013. The specimen
shall be tested as described in IS 516.
(2)
Test Specimen and Sample Strength
Three test specimens constitute one sample for any type of test at
specified age of testing. The average of these results of three
samples constitute the test result of sample provided that the
individual variation is within ±15 percent of average.
If variation is
larger, the sample shall be discarded.
(3)
Frequency of Sampling
The minimum frequency of sampling of concrete of each grade
shall be in accordance with Table 1 8.8.

At least one sample shall be taken from each batch of work. For the purpose of acceptance
as per Table 18.8, quantity of concrete represented by a group of four consecutive samples
shall include all batches and single sample shall represent the batch from which
It is taken.
Where concrete Is provided continuously at site from a batching plant or RMC plant, groups
of four consecutive samples, shall not have overlapping common samples. Irrespective of
other methods of controlling production used at the batching/RMC plant the requirements
of this Clause shall be met.
18.6
Acceptance Criteria
18.6.1
General
Acceptance or rejection of concrete is mostly based on compressive strength. However,
other properties of the concrete in fresh and hardened states including durability are also
important.
Apart from meeting the acceptance criteria given below, concrete is liable to be rejected if
it is porous or honey-combed, its placing has been interrupted without providing a proper
construction joint, the reinforcement has been displaced beyond the tolerances specified,
or construction tolerances have not been met. However, the hardened concrete may be
accepted after carrying out suitable remedial measures.
18.6.2
Compressive strength
When both the following conditions are met, the concrete shall be deemed to comply with
the specified compressive strength:
(a)
The mean
strength determined from any group
of four
consecutive non-overlapping samples shall exceed the specified
characteristic compressive strength by3 MPa.
(b)
Strength
of any sample
is
not
less than
the
specified
characteristic compressive strength minus 3 MPa.
Concrete of each grade shall be assessed separately.
If the concrete is deemed not to comply as per the above criteria, the structural adequacy
of the bridge elements affected shall be investigated and any consequential action as
needed, shall be taken.
212



======================================================================
PAGE 225 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
18.6.3
Flexural strength
When both the following conditions are met, the concrete complies with the specified flexural
strength:
(a)
The mean
strength determined from any group
of four
consecutive non-overlapping samples exceeds the specified
characteristic flexural strength by at least 0.3 MPa.
(b)
The strength determined from any sample
is not less than the
specified characteristic flexural strength minus 0.3 MPa.
Where minimum density of fresh concrete is specified, the mean of any four consecutive
non-overlapping samples shall not be less than the specified value and any individual
sample result shall not be less than 97.5 percent of the specified value.
Where minimum density of hardened concrete is specified, the mean of any four consecutive
non-overlapping samples shall not be less than the specified value and any individual
sample result shall not be less than 97.5 percent of the specified value.
18.6.6
Chloride content
The chloride content in the concrete can be measured as described
in
IS 14959 -
Part
I
(for fresh concrete) or Part
II
(for hardened concrete). Alternatively
it can be
calculated, in which case, the method of calculation shall be based upon the measured
chloride-ion contents of all constituents and the mix proportion of concrete. The chloride-
ion content so measured or calculated and expressed as the percentage of chloride-ion
by mass of cement, shall not exceed the value specified in Clause 14.3.2.3.
18.6.7
Durability of concrete
Unlike the tests on concrete described above, there is no specified test method for durability,
which can be completed within a reasonably short time. The requirement of long term
durability of concrete is 'deemed to be satisfied' by following the recommended provisions
in this Code for maximum water-cement ratio, minimum cement content, cover thickness,
type of cement and amounts of chlorides and sulphates
in concrete etc. All these
recommendations taken together tend resulting concrete being dense, workable, and
placeable and having as low permeability as possible under the given situation.
When durability of concrete is the main reason for adopting high perfonnance concrete, or

in other specific situations, Rapid Chloride Ion Permeability Test (RCPT) as per ASTM
C1202 shall be carried out. Suggested upper limits of values of RCPT for 56 days for
various exposure conditions (refer Table 14.1) are:
(1)
Extreme
800
Coulombs
(2)
Very Sever

Additional durability tests, such as Water Permeability test as per DIN 1 048 Part 5 or Initial
Surface Absorption test as per BS 1881 part 5 can also be specified. The permissible
values in such tests have to be specified taking into account the severity of the exposure
condition. The acceptance criteria shall be arrived at prior to testing.
18.7
Grouting
18.7.1
General
Grout is a homogenous mixture of cement and water.
It may contain chemical admixtures
which modify the properties of grout in its fluid state. These recommendations cover the
cement grouting of post tensioned tendons of prestressed concrete members of bridges.
The purpose of grouting is to provide permanent protection to the post tensioned steel
against corrosion and to develop bond between the prestressing steel and the sunrounding
structural concrete. The grout ensures encasement of steel in an alkaline environment for
corrosion protection and by filling the duct space
it prevents water collection and freezing.
A critical feature of grout is that
it should remain pumpable for the time required to fully
inject the tendon.
18.7.2
Materials
(1)
Water
"
.
.
Only clean potable water free from impurities confomiing to Clause
1 8.4.5 shall be used. No sea or creek water is to be used at all.
(2)
Cement
The same type of cement as used in construction of prestressed
elements, should be used for preparation of the grout.
It should be
as fresh as possible and free from any lumps.
(3)
Sand
It
is not recommended to use sand for grouting of prestressing
tendons.
214



======================================================================
PAGE 227 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
(4)
Admixtures
Acceptable admixtures conforming to IS 9103 may be used
if tests
have shown that their use improves the properties of grout,
i.e.
increasing fluidity, reducing bleeding, entraining air or expanding
the grout. Admixtures must not contain chlorides, nitrates, sulphides,
sulphites or any other products which are likely to damage the steel
or grout. When an expanding agent is used, the total unrestrained
expansion should not exceed 10 percent. Aluminium powder as
an expanding agent is not recommended as doubts exist about its
long term effects.
18.7.3
Use of grout colloidal mixer
It is essential that the grout is maintained in a homogenous state and of unifonn consistency
so that there is no separation of cement during the entire grouting process.
It is, therefore,
necessary that the grout be continuously mixed in a colloidal mixer with a minimum speed
of 1000 RPM and travel of discharge not exceeding 15 m per second.
18.7.4
Properties of the grout
Before grouting, the properties of the grout mix should be tested. Tests should be
conducted for each job periodically.
(1)
Water/cement Rratio
Water/cement ratio should be as low as possible, consistent with
workability. This ratio should not exceed 0.45.
(2)
Deleterious Materials
No chloride, sulphates shall be separately added to the grout. The
constituent may contain chlorides/sulphates. However, its net effect
should not exceed the following limits in the grout:
-
Chlorides (CI
) not more than 0. 1 percent by weight of cement.
-
Sulphate (SO3) not more than 4 percent by weight of cement.
-
Sulphide-ions
(S2") not more than 0.01
percent by weight of
cement.
(3)
Temperature
The temperature of the grout after accounting for the ambient
temperature of the structure, shall not exceed 25X.

IRC:112-2011
(4)
Compressive Strength
The compressive strength of
1 00 mm cube of the grout shall not
be less than 17 MPa at 7 days. Cubes shall be cured
in a moist
atmosphere for the first 24 hours and subsequently in water. These
tests shall be conducted in advance to ascertain the suitability of
the grout mix.
(5)
Setting Time
Initial setting time of grout shall be more than three hours and less
than 1 2 hours. The final setting time shall not be less than 24 hours.
(6)
Bleeding
Bleeding
is the separation
of free water from the grout
mix.
It includes the filtering effect of strands where the cavities
between the wires constituting the strand, block cement particles and
permit water under pressure to move ahead of the grout
in the
direction of general flow of grout. The bleeding shall be sufficiently
low to prevent excessive segregation and sediment of the grout
material. The bleeding shall not exceed 0.3 percent of volume of the
initial volume of grout after three hours kept at rest.
(7)
Volume Change
The volume change of grout kept at rest for 24 hours and tested as
per ASTM C1090 shall be within the range of -0.5 percent and
5 0 percent of the original volume.
(8)
Fluidity
Fluidity is tested as per ASTM 0939 standard using standard flow
;
cone.
Note:
The fluidity of grout changes from time of mixing to time of setting
in the ducts. The requirement
given above are for general
guidance and may be modified as per the specific application,
depending upon the total temperature, length of tendons, head of
pumping, requirement of simultaneous grouting of closely spaced
tendons etc. provided that other specifications and functions are
satisfied.
18.8
Quality Control and Workmanship
18.8.1
General
This Clause covers the requirements of properworkmanship in all operations of construction
of concrete structures and related quality assurance and quality control measures, so that
the structure is built as designed and the intended performance over the design service
216



======================================================================
PAGE 229 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
life is achieved. Concrete is made with ingredients with inherent variability. The operations
of production, placement, compaction and curing of concrete under site conditions can
also exhibit variability.
In order that concrete
is obtained with reasonable amount of
consistency in its characteristics, the properties of ingredients and the resultant concrete
should be monitored diligently as per an appropriate plan of testing and all site operations
should be carried out with adequate proficiency, as detailed in this Section. A Quality
Assurance (OA) Plan should be in position to ensure that the construction results in
satisfactory strength, serviceability and long term durability which will lower the overall life-
cycle cost of the structure.
18.8.2
Quality assurance measures
Quality assurance in construction activity relates to proper design, use of appropriate
materials and components to be supplied by the producers, proper workmanship in the
execution ofworks and proper care during the use ofstmcture, including periodic inspection
and timely maintenance and repair by the owner.
Quality assurance measures are both technical and organizational. The Quality
Assurance Plan shall identify the key elements necessary to provide fitness of the
structure and the means by which they are to be provided and measured with the
overall purpose to provide confidence that the realized project will work satisfactorily in
service, fulfilling intended needs. Quality control and quality assurance would also involve
ensuring quality of both the inputs as well as the outputs. Inputs are
in the form of
materials of construction: workmanship; and the related plant, machinery and equipment;
resulting in the output in the form of final structure.
Each party involved in the realization of a project should establish and implement a
QualityAssurance Plan for its role in the project. Suppliers and sub-contractors' activities
shall be covered in the plan. The individual Quality Assurance Plans shall
fit into the
overall QualityAssurance Plan of the project and shall define the tasks and responsibilities
of ail persons involved, adequate control and checking procedures, and the organization
and maintaining of adequate documentation of the construction process and its results.
Such documentation shall be
in accordance with IRC Publication IRC:SP:47-1988
"Guidelines on Quality Systems for Road Bridges' Plain, Reinforced Prestressed and
Composite Concrete".
18.8.3
Production of concrete
(1)
Storage of Materials
All efforts shall be made to store the materials in proper places to
prevent their deterioration and any intrusion of foreign matters, so
as to ensure their satisfactory quality and fitness for the wori^. The
217



======================================================================
PAGE 230 of 296
======================================================================
space shall permit easy storage,
inspection, remova! and
re-storage of materials. All such materials, even though stored in
approved manner, shall be subjected to inspection and acceptance
test prior to use, whenever considered necessary.
Batching
In batching concrete:
•
"
•
The quantity of cement, aggregate and mineral admixtures,
if
used, shall be determined by mass.
•
Chemical admixture,
if solid, shall be determined by mass.
•
Liquid admixture may be measured in volume or mass, and
•
Water shall be weighed or measured by volume in a calibrated
tank.
"
The concrete shall be sou reed from on-site or off-site batching and
mixing plants, or from approved ready-mixed concrete plants,
preferably having quality certification.
Except where supply of properly graded aggregate of uniform quality
can be maintained over a period of work, the grading of aggregate
should be controlled by obtaining the coarse aggregate in different
sizes and blending them
in the right proportions when required,
the different sizes being stocked
in separate stock piles. The
material should be stock piled several hours, preferably a day
before use. The grading of coarse and fine aggregate should be
checked as frequently as possible to ensure that the specified
grading is maintained.
The accuracy of the measuring equipment shall be within ±3 percent
of the quantity of cement, aggregate, admixtures and water being
measured. All measuring equipment shall be maintained In a clean
and serviceable condition. Their accuracy shall be checked over
the range in use, when set up at site and maintained thereafter.
It is important to maintain the water-cement ratio constant at its
correct value. To this end, determination of moisture contents In
both fine and coarse aggregates shall be made as frequently as
possible, being determined according to weather conditions. The
amount of the added water shall be adjusted to compensate for
any observed variations in the moisture contents. To allow for the
variation
in mass of aggregate due to variation in their moisture
218



======================================================================
PAGE 231 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
content, suitable adjustments in the masses of aggregates shall
also be made. Accurate control shall be kept on the quantity of
mixing water, which when specified, shall not be changed without
approval.
(3)
Mixing
All concrete shall be machine-mixed. In order to ensure uniformity
and good quality of concrete, the ingredients shall be mixed in a
power driven batch mixer with hopper and suitable weigh batching
arrangement or in a central mix plant. The concrete shall be mixed
until
it
is of even colour, cohesive and of uniform consistency
throughout. When mineral admixtures are added at the mixing
stage, their thorough and uniform blending with the cement shall
be ensured,
if necessary, by longer mixing time.
In general, the
mixing time shall be at least 2 minutes after all the ingredients are
in the mixer. For other types of more efficient mixers, manufacturer's
recommendations should be followed. The addition of water after
the completion of the initial mixing operation, shall not be pemnitted.
Transportation, placing, compaction and curing
(1)
Transporting Concrete
Mixed concrete shall be transported from the place of mixing to the
place of final placement as early as practicable, by methods which
will prevent the segregation or loss of the ingredients.
Concrete may be transported by transit mixers or properly designed
buckets or by pumping. Transit mixer or other hauling equipment
when used, should be equipped with means of discharging the
concrete without segregation. During hot or cold weather, concrete
shall be transported in deep containers. Other suitable methods to
reduce the loss ofwater by evaporation in hot weather, and heat loss
in cold weather, may also be adopted.
When concrete is conveyed by chute, the plant shall be of such
size and design as to ensure practically continuous flow in the chute.
The slope of the chute shall be such as to allow the concrete to
flow freely and without segregation of the ingredients. The delivery
end of the chute shall be as close as possible to the point of deposit.
The chute shall be thoroughly flushed with water before and after
each working period and the water used for this purpose shall be
discharged outside the formwork.
219



======================================================================
PAGE 232 of 296
======================================================================
In case of concrete
is to be transported by pumping, the fresh
concrete should have adequate fluidity and cohesiveness to be
pumpable. Proper concrete mix proportioning and initial trials should
be canied out to ensure this. The conduit shall be primed by pumping
abatch of mortar through the line to lubricate it. Once the pumping is
started,
it shall not be interrupted, as concrete standing idle in the
line is liable to cause a plug. The operator shall ensure that some
concrete
is always there
in the pump's receiving hopper during
operation. The lines shall always be maintained clean and free of
dents.
Placing and Compacting Concrete
Concrete
shall be placed as nearly as practicable
in
its
final
position to avoid rehandling.
Methods of placing should be such
as to preclude segregation. Care should be taken
to avoid
displacement of reinforcement or movement of formwork. To
achieve this, concrete should be lowered vertically into the fomns
and horizontal movement of concrete inside the fomis should, as
far as practicable, be minimised.
Concrete shall be placed and compacted before
its initial setting
so that
it is amenable to compaction by vibration. The workability
of concrete at the time of placement shall be adequate for the
compaction equipment to be used.
If there
is considerable time
gap between mixing and placing of concrete, as
in the case of
ready mixed concrete plants or off-site batching and mixing plants,
concrete mix shall be designed to have appropriately higher
workability at the time of discharge from the mixer,
in order to
compensate the loss of workability during transit. This is generally
achieved by use of suitable chemical admixtures. Keeping these
considerations
in view, the general requirement for ready mixed
concrete plants or off-site batching and mixing plants, is that concrete
shall be discharged from the truck mixer within two hours of the
time of loading. A longer period may be permitted if suitable retarding
admixtures are used. In case of on-site mixing, fresh concrete shall
preferably be placed and compacted within 30 minutes of mixing.
In wall forms, drop chutes attached to hoppers at the top should
preferably be used to lower concrete to the bottom of the form. As
a general guidance, the permissible free fall of concrete may not
exceed
1 .5 m and under no circumstances; shall
it be more than
2 m.
220



======================================================================
PAGE 233 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
When free fall of larger height is involved, self compacting concrete
having adequate fluidity, cohesiveness and viscosity shall be used.
Self compacting concrete completely
fills every corner
of the formwork by
its own weight without segregation, whilst
maintaining uniformity. No compaction by vibration is required.
When concrete is to be deposited by means of tremie, the lower
end of the vertical pipe shall always be inserted sufficiently deep
into the concrete which has been placed previously but has not
set. The top section of the tremie shall be a hopper large enough
to hold one entire batch of the mix or the entire contents of the
transporting bucket,
if any. The tremie pipe shall be large enough
to allow a free flow of concrete and strong enough to withstand the
external pressure of the water
in which
it
is suspended, when
concrete is deposited under water.
It will be necessary to raise the
tremie slowly in order to cause a uniform flow of the concrete, but
the tremie shall not be emptied allowing water to enter the pipe. At all
times after the placing of concrete is started and until all the concrete
is placed, the lower end of the tremie pipe shall be below the top
surface of the plastic concrete.
Concrete shall be thoroughly compacted during the operation of
placing and carefully worked around the reinforcement, around
embedded fixtures and into the corners of the forni work. To achieve
proper compaction vibrators may be used. The vibrator can be
internal or external type and depending upon the shape and size
of the member, both types may be used individually or together.
When internal vibrators are used, they shall be inserted vertically
to the
full depth of the layer being placed and ordinarily shall
penetrate the layer below for a few centimetres. The vibrator should
be kept in place until air bubbles cease escaping from the surface
and then withdrawn slowly to ensure that no hole
is
left
in the
concrete, care being taken to see that
it remains in continuous
operation while being withdrawn.
Internal vibrators shall be
inserted in an orderly manner and the distance between insertions
should be about VA times the radius of the area visibly affected by
vibration. Internal vibrators should not be used for spreading the
concrete.
Construction Joints
Concreting shall be carried out continuously up to construction joints,
the position and arrangement of which shall be pre-determined by
the designer. Joints should be positioned where they are readily
accessible for preparation and concreting. Construction joints should
221



======================================================================
PAGE 234 of 296
======================================================================
be positioned to minimise the effects of the discontinuity on the
durability, stmctural integrity and appearance of the structure. As
far as possible, joints should be provided in non-aggressive zones,
but if joints in aggressive zones can not be avoided, they should be
sealed. Joints should be located away from regions of maximum
stress caused by loading;
particularly where shear and bond
stresses are high.
^
Joints should be either vertical or horizontal. For a vertical
construction joint, the
lifts of concrete shall finish level or at right
angles to the axis of the member. Concreting shall be continued
right up to the joint.
Before resuming work at a construction joint when concrete has
not yet fully hardened,
all laitance shall be removed thoroughly.
The surface should be roughened, care being taken to avoid
dislodgement of coarse aggregates. Concrete may be brushed with
a stiff brush soon after casting, while the concrete has only slightly
stiffened.
If the concrete has partially hardened,
it may be treated
by wire brushing or with a high pressure water jet, followed by drying
with an air jet, immediately before the new concrete is placed. Fully
hardened concrete shall be treated with mechanical hand tools or
grit blasting, taking care not to split or crack the aggregates.
The practice of first placing a layer of mortar or grout when
concreting joints is not recommended. The old surface should be
soaked with water, without leaving puddles, just before
starting concreting. The new concrete shall be thoroughly
compacted against it.
Where there is likely to be a delay before placing the next concrete
lift, protruding reinforcement shall be protected. In all cases, where
construction joints are made, the joint surface shall not be
contaminated with release agents,
dust, or sprayed curing
membrane and reinforcement shall be fimrily fixed in position at the
correct cover.
The sequence of concreting, striking of forms and positioning of
construction joints for every individual stmcture shall be decided, well
in advance of the commencement of work.
Curing and Protection of Concrete
The concrete shall be kept constantly wet for a minimum period of
14 (fourteen) days by ponding or covering with a layer of
wet (but not dripping) sacking, canvas, hessian or similar
absorbent material. Water should be applied on unformed surfaces
222



======================================================================
PAGE 235 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
as soon as It can be done without marring the surface and on formed
surfaces immediately after the fomns are stripped.
Liquid membrane-forming curing compounds conforming to
ASTM C 309, may be used in lieu of moist curing after approval.
The curing efficiency shall be tested as per ASTM C 156. Such
compounds shall be applied to all exposed surfaces of the concrete
as soon as possible after the concrete has set, but not dried out.
The membrane formed
shall be stripped
off afterwards.
Impermeable membranes, such as sheet materials for curing
.
concrete conforming to ASTM C 171, or polyethylene sheeting
covering closely the concrete surface, may also be used to provide
effective barrier against evaporation.
Steam curing under atmospheric pressure is adopted to develop
high early strength of concrete, so that concrete members can be
removed from the formwork and handled as early as possible. This
is particuiariy suitable for precast concrete members. Steam curing
is applied in enclosures or tunnels through which concrete members
are transported on a conveyor system;
alternatively, portable
enclosures or plastic covers are placed over precast members.
Steam is supplied to the enclosures. Various elements of the steam
curing cycle,
e.g. the delay
in commencement of heating
(i.e.
extending pre-steaming period), the rate of increase of temperature,
the level and time of constant temperature, and the rate of decrease
of temperature, shall receive careful consideration. As a general
guidance, the pre-steaming period should be about one to three
hours, the rate of increase or decrease of temperature should not
exceed 10 to 20°C per hour and the maximum temperature of curing
can be about 70°C.The ideal steam curing cycle
in a particular
situation,
is govemed by the concrete mix proportions and type
of cementitious materials and the strength required at the end of
steam curing period, and shall be decided by prior trials. Steam
curing of concrete shall be followed by water curing for at least
seven days.
After placing and during the first stages of hardening, concrete
shall be protected from harmful effects of sunrays, drying winds,
cold, running water, shocks, vibrations, traffic including construction
traffic etc.
Concreting in extreme weather
(1 )
Concreting in Hot Weather
Special problems are encountered in the production, placement and
223



======================================================================
PAGE 236 of 296
======================================================================
curing of concrete
In hot weather. The climatic factors affecting
concrete in hot weather are high ambient temperature, reduced relative
humidity,
high wind velocity and combination thereof. High
temperatures result
in rapid hydration of cement, increased
evaporation of mixing water, greater mixing water demand, rapid loss
of workability and large volume changes resulting in cracks.
The temperature of concrete at the time of placement should be as
low as possible, but
in no case more than 30°C. For high
performance concrete, the temperature at the time of placement
shall not exceed 25°C.
If concreting has to be done in hot weather
at ambient temperatures exceeding these
limits of
concrete
temperature, steps shall be taken to sufficiently lower the temperature
of ingredients of the concrete below the ambient. The contribution of
each ingredient to the temperature of concrete is a function of the
temperature,
specific heat and quantity of that ingredient.
Aggregates and mixing water exert the most pronounced effects
on the temperature of concrete. Thus, in hot weather, all available
means shall be used for maintaining these materials at as low
temperature as practicable, such as;
•
Use of chilled mixing water
•
Use of crushed ice or flaked as a part of mixing water.
•
Shading stockpiles of aggregates from direct rays of Sun.
•
Sprinkling stockpiles of coarse aggregate with water and
keeping them moist.
•
Limiting temperature of cement to be preferably not in excess
of 30°C at the time of use.
Period between mixing of concrete and placing shall be as short as
possible. Immediately after compaction and surface finish, concrete
shall be protected from evaporation of moisture, without letting
ingress of external water, by means of wet (not dripping) gunny
bags, hessian etc. Once the concrete has attained some degree of
hardening (approximately 12 hours after mixing), moist curing shall
be commenced and satisfactorily continued throughout the requisite
period.
Concreting in Cold Weather
Effects of cold weather on concrete,
in absence of special
precautions, include;
®
Delayed setting and hardening, slower rate of gain of strength.
224



======================================================================
PAGE 237 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
•
irreparable loss of strength and durability,
if freezing of concrete
takes place at early ages, when
it is
still in plastic state. Even
one cycle of freezing of concrete during the prehardening period
may lower the compressive strength by 30 to 50 percent,
•
Disruptive effects of freezing of pore water make hardened
concrete vulnerable to repeated cycles of freezing and thawing
,
resulting
in loss of compressive strength and modulus of
elasticity.
•
Stresses due to temperature differential within the concrete
member at the time of removal of form insulations, may promote
cracking.
When depositing concrete at or near freezing temperature,
precautions shall be taken to ensure that the concrete shall have a
temperature of at least 5°C at the time of placing. When necessary,
concrete ingredients shall be heated before mixing, but cement
shall not be heated artificially other than by the heat transmitted to
it from other ingredients of the concrete. In general, heating of only
the mixing water to about 65°C may suffice for this purpose.
The temperature of the concrete shall be maintained above freezing
temperature (preferably above 2*C) until it has thoroughly hardened.
This may be achieved with the help of proper insulating methods
before the protection is removed.
Use of air-entraining admixtures conforming to IS 9103 increases
the resistance of hardened concrete to freezing and thawing. To
counter slower setting of concrete, non chloride-bearing
accelerators can be used after approval. However, accelerators
containing chloride shall not be used.
No frozen material or materials containing ice shall be used. Ail
concrete damaged by frost shall be removed.
Steel reinforcement
(1)
Bending
Reinforcement shall not be bent or straightened in a manner that
will injure the material. All reinforcement shall be bent cold:
Mechanised bending or prefabricated reinforcement shall be
preferred. Bar bending schedules shall be prepared
for
all
reinforcement work.
225



======================================================================
PAGE 238 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
(2)
Placing
All reinforcement shall be placed and maintained in positions shown
on the drawings by providing proper cover blocks, spacers,
supporting bars etc. High strength mortar or concrete of the same
grade with smaller size aggregate shall be used for cover blocks.
To ensure adequate cover, use of manufactured chairs
is
recommended.
(3)
Splicing and Lapping
Splicing and lapping shall be in positions conforming to the drawings
and for this purpose, all reinforcing bars shall be to the full lengths
indicated thereon. However, suitable adjustment in the locations of
the splices to accommodate the available lengths of bars, can be
made with prior approval.
In
all cases of such adjustment, the
requirements of lap length and other stipulations, as per
Sections 1 5 and 1 6 shall be compiled with.
(4)
Substitution of Bar Sizes
In order to accommodate the available size of bars, use of bar
sizes other than those shown on the drawings may be permitted
with prior approval. In case of such substitution, the reinforcement
actually used shall have an area equivalent to the original or slightly
in excess thereof, provided further that the various stipulations of
this Code are not violated by such substitution. The requirements
with regard to bond stress, limitations of bar sizes, spacing of bars,
cover, etc., shall be specially looked into.
18.8.7
Falsework
For design, fabrication, and erection offalsewori<, IRC:87 "Guidelines for the Design and
Erection of Falsework for Road Bridges" shall be followed.
The formwori^ should be robust and strong and the joints should be leak proof. Form release
agents of approved quality shall be used. The staging, scaffolding and shuttering are
required to be property designed so that their erection as well as striking can be conveniently
done. The design should also ensure that at the time of striking, the concrete does not get
disturbed and the forms are conveniently removed. Staging shall be of steel pipes or steel
sections.
Where centering trusses or launching trusses are adopted for casting of superstructure,
the joints of the centering or launching arrangement, whether welded, riveted or bolted,
shall be thoroughly checked and various members of the centering trusses shall be
examined for proper alignment and unintended deformation before proceeding with the
concreting. Launching trusses and travelling forms shall be load tested.
226



======================================================================
PAGE 239 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
The locations where fixing of reinforcement and placing of concrete are being done, shall
be accessible to the inspecting officers at all stages of construction.
Fomns shall not be released until the concrete has achieved strength of at least twice the
stress to which the concrete may be subjected at the time of removal of fonnwork.
1n absence
of tests, generally, the striking period may be as specified in !RC:87.
18.8.8
Inspection and testing of structures
(1)
Inspection
To ensure proper performance,
it is necessary that each step in
concreting which will be covered by the next step is inspected as
the work proceeds. Immediately after stripping the formwork,
all
concrete shall be carefully inspected and any defective work or
small defects shall be either removed or made good before concrete
has thoroughly hardened. Concrete members shall be inspected
within 15 days for occurrence of cracks due to shrinkage,
temperature, local restraint, undue deflection and deformation.
(2)
Testing of Concrete in Structures
In case of doubt regarding the grade of concrete in the structure, either
due to poor workmanship or based on results of cube strength tests,
compressive strength tests of concrete shall be carried out by core
tests and/or non-destructive tests.
(3)
Core Test
The points from which core samples are to be taken and the number
of core samples required shall be decided so as to be representative
of the whole of concrete concerned, in no case, however, shall
fewer than three cores be tested. Cores shall be prepared and
tested as described in IS 516.
Concrete
in the member represented by a core test shall be
considered acceptable,
if the average equivalent cube strength of
the cores is equal to at least 85 percent of the characteristic strength
of the grade of concrete specified for the corresponding age and
no individual core has strength less than 75 percent.
Core tests may also be required for other purposes
like repair,
retrofitting and strengthening of structure where requirement of
strength could differ.
(4)
Non-Destructive Tests
Nondestructive tests are used to obtain estimation of the properties
of concrete in the structure.
227



======================================================================
PAGE 240 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
The methods adopted
include
ultrasonic pulse
velocity
|!S:13311(Part 1)| and rebound hammer [IS 13311 (Part 2)], probe
penetration (ASTM C 803), pullout (ASTM C 900) and maturity
(ASTM C 1074). Non-destructive tests provide alternatives to
core tests for estimating the strength of concrete in a structure, or
can supplement the data obtained from a limited number of core
specimens tested. These methods are based on measuring a
concrete property that bears some relationship to strength. The
accuracy of these methods
is determined by the degree of
correlation between strength and quality of the concrete and the
parameter measured by the non-destructive tests.
Any of these methods may be adopted,
in which case the
acceptance criteria shall be agreed upon prior to testing.
18.8.9
Load tests of structures
(1)
Load Test for Flexural Member
In case the core test results do not satisfy the requirement in
Clause 18.8.8 (4) or where such tests have not been done, load
test may be carried out
if specifically desired. Load test should be
carried out as soon as possible after expiry of 28 days from time of
placing of concrete. Procedure as per IRC publication SP:51
'Guidelines for Load Testing of Bridges' may be adopted
.
(2)
Members Other than Flexural Members
Members other than
flexural members should be preferably
investigated by analysis.

ANNEXURE A-1
ACTIONS, DESIGN SITUATIONS AND
COMBINATION OF ACTIONS
A1-1
General
Section 5.0 "Basis of Design" describes the approach adopted for taking into consideration
various limit states, which shall not be exceeded by the bridge structure and its elements,
when subjected to combined effect of actions in various design situations. The values of
actions and partial factors to be used in different combinations for verification of design by
Limit State Method are given in IRC:6. Annexure-B, Table-1 of IRC:6 gives loads and load
combinations for verification of design by working load/allowable stress (WUAS) method.
The description of actions, their classification, nomenclature of design situations and
combination for verifying different limit states as applicable to concrete bridges, are
explained in thisAnnexure. The terms loads and force (arising out of friction, buoyancy etc)
are also used to represent 'Actions' in IRC:6, and in the description below.
A1-2
Classification of Action
The description of actions and their notations given as per IRC:6, unless othen/vise stated.
(1)
Permanent Actions - G
(a) Permanent Action
(i)
Self Weight/Dead Load
Self-weight of structure due to gravity.
(ii) Backfiil Weight
To be treated as D.L. when present. (Not separately defined
in IRC:6 for WL/AS method).
(iii) Earth Pressure:
( F^p )
In IRC:6, the increased earth pressure due to
live load
surcharge considered is included by convention in F^p
, For
Limit State Method the surcharge due to live load needs to be
taken as a variable load together with other live loads. (For
WL/AS method
of design,
its effect
is evaluated
in
combination with earth pressure F^p .)
229

======================================================================
(iv) Prestressing Force: (P)
In analysis of structure P
is considered as a force acting on
concrete elements which has time dependant variation, and also
superior
(i.e.
higher estimate) and
inferior
(i.e.
lower
estimate) values.
(v) Secondary Effects (F )
Such as creep, shrinkage and settlemefst
'
Note:
Second order effects arising from the deformed geometry are not
considered as secondary effects. These are considered for
verification of Ultimate Limit State of Deformation only.
(b) Variable Gravity Loads Treated as Permanent Loads
(1) Super Imposed Dead Load
Loads from hand rail, crash barrier, road furniture, footpath and
actual or provisional loads from services, etc.
(ii) Surfacing and Wearing Coat
In Limit State Method superior and inferior values may be used,
which should account for re-surfacing, with or without removing
existing coat, and possibility of change in type of surfacing.
(iii) Snow Load
Snow loads,
if present, are treated
in the same way as Dead
Load depending on the depth of snow on superstructure. The
design value of live load is modified depending on the restrictions
on operation of vehicular loads which give rise to different design
situations.
Quasi-Permanent Loads
There are variable loads which act for a major part of the structures
design life. By convention, loads acting for more than 50% of the
design life are called quasi-pemianent. In load combinations, they
are treated as variable loads with different values depending on
the action effects under evaluation. Temperature load
is an
example, where
it has a permanent component (casting
temperature), semi-permanent component (seasonal variation
from casting temperature) and varying component (daily variation
from seasonal temperature).

Load due to gravity
(ii) Impact factor due to vehicular gravity load (QJ
A factor for converting dynamic increment of gravity load, due

deformation {FJ (excluding
restraints due to frictional
resistance at bearings).
(ii) Effect of thennal gradient in the structure.
(iii) Wind Load (W)
Normally used as static load acting on bridge elements. For
wind sensitive structure or elements of structure dynamic
analysis and dynamic wind force is stipulated.

Accidental Actions
Accidentai loads are those loads whose occurrence or frequency
cannot be predicted, and originate from unintended or undesirable
situations.
(a) impact of external bodies
(i)
Vehicle collision on eiements of bridge structure (F).
(ii) Barge impact or impact due to floating bodies in water current.
(iii) Vehicular Impact on Crash Barriers.
/
(b) Seismic IHazards
Seismic situations considered in the design are rare events [even
more rare than type 3(a)] having return period of the order of few
hundred years. They produce following types of loads.
(i)
Inertial loads due to self-mass generated in bridge structure
by ground acceleration.
(ii)
Inertial loads due to mass of vehicular live load.
(ill) Hydrodynamic forces generated on parts of bridge submerged
underwater.
(iv) Increased earth pressures.
(v) Effects of liquefaction of soils.
A1-3
Design Situation and Load Combination
Various actions defined in Clause A1 -2, act on the bridge structure at different time and in
different combinations. The magnitudes of the loads also differ from time to time. Thus the
loading conditions to which bridge structure is exposed are extremely large. In practice the
verification that the limit states are not exceeded is carried out for a limited number of
combinations, each of which represents likely condition of bridge loading during its design
service life. The load combinations and the partial factors of loads to be considered in that
combination are defined in IRC:6-201 0. Basically, the following four design situations are
considered, depending on the duration of the load and the frequency of occurrence of load
combinations.
Persistent Design Situation (Basic Load Combinations)
It is the design situation that is relevant during a period of the same order as the design
working life of the structure. Generally it refers to conditions of normal use.
This includes permanent and quasi-permanent loads as well as variable loads like live
load, wind, hydraulic loads like water current buoyancy etc.
232



======================================================================
PAGE 245 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
Transient Design Situation
It is the design situation that is relevant during a pericxj much shorter than the design working
life of the structure but which has a high probability of occurrence
A transient design situation refers to temporary conditions of the structure, of use, or
exposure, such as those arising during construction or when restrictions are put on its use.
Accidental Design Situation
It is the design situation involving exceptional conditions of the structure or its exposure,
including fire, explosion, impact or local failure.
For concrete bridge structures, vehicle impact load is usually considered. The fire hazard
or explosion pressures, if specified, (e.g. as in case of material storage or human occupancy
below city flyovers) shall be based on the Indian Standards specifying fire resistance (as
per IS 456, IS 1641 and IS 1642) and blast resistance (as per IS 4991).
Seismic Design Situation
'
'
/.
It is the design situation involving exceptional conditions of the structure when subjected to
a seismic event.
Generally,
it is not economical to design bridge structure to remain within elastic limits
when subjected to 'Design Basis Earthquake' which is defined in IRC:6-2010. Parts of the
bridge structure are permitted to suffer damage during the design event. At higher level of
seismic event, the bridge elements are expected to suffer large but repairable damage
without failure or collapse.
Presently, IRC-6 is specifying force-based design methods,
which are deemed to achieve the aim of satisfactory performance.
Since the structural behaviour of the bridge under seismic conditions is completely different
(i.e. non-elastic response is considered) from the response to other loads (which are
essentially in elastic range), the seismic situations are separately treated.
A1-4
Limit States to be Considered
(1)
Limit States of Strength (ULS)
Three limit states are checked:
(i)
Stability of overall structure or its elements,
(ii) Failure of members or the whole structure by buckling of its
elements,
233



======================================================================
PAGE 246 of 296
======================================================================
(iii) Failure of member at its critically loaded section under action of
axial force, bending moment, shear, and torsion.
Limit States of Serviceability (SLS)
•
.
.
Following limit states of serviceability are covered in this Code:
(i) Limit state of stresses
(ii) Limit state of deformation (deflection)
(iii) Limit state of crack width
Other limit states such as limit state of vibration and limit state of
fatigue may be important for some bridge structures. Specialist
literature or international standards may be referred for the same.
Different serviceability limit states are governed by different sets of
load combinations. The following sets of load combinations are
defined in Section 12.
(a) Rare combinations (also called Characteristic Combination
or Infrequent Combination)
in these situations bridge element, are subjected to maximum
design
loads
leading
to
maximum
stress
levels.
These basic combinations are used for checking 'limit state of
maximum stress levels' in bridge elements.
(b) Frequent Combinations
•
These represents design situation that occurs repeatedly
in
service.
The maximum allowable deflections, crack width in prestressed
elements with bonded tendons (and vibration where specified)
are checked for the frequently occuning situation.
(c) Quasi-Permanent Combinations
These combinations are used to consider long temn action effects.
Crack
widths
in
reinforced
concrete
elements
and
prestressed elements with unbonded tendons where durability is
affected and effects of settlement, creep
etc., caused by
permanent or more or less pemnanent actions listed in A-1 .2(1 ),
are evaluated with quasi-permanent combinations.

ANNEXURE A-2
ADDITIONAL INFORR^ATION AND DATA ABOUT PROPERTIES OF
CONCRETE AND STEEL
A2J
General
Section 6 gives values of various design properties. The co-relations on which these are
based are given
in the following Sub-sections. Also, the expressions for creep and
shrinkage for different types of cements and in different conditions of relative humidity, are
given. Effect of high temperature curing, and multi-axial stresses
is indicated.
High
temperature curing also increases the rate of relaxation loss of steel in pre-tensioned pre-
cast members. Method of calculating the same is given.
An informative Sub-section is added about partial material factor for concrete, and use of
cores taken for measuring in-situ strength of concrete structures. The test results of cores
taken from existing structure are also used for retrofitting of old bridges by using probable
equivalent design cube strength j^.^, few observations on the co-relation between the two
are given for guidance of designers.
.
For more detailed information on these and various other properties of concrete which
may be needed for special applications, while stilt using the general principles of this Code
specialist literature may be refen-ed.
A2.2
Co-relation between Compressive Cube Strength and Other
Concrete Properties
Table 6.5 gives directly the design properties of concrete
in terms of
its 28 days
compressive (cube) strength. The values are based on the following co-reiationships,
which are experimentally established. However, the scatter in values is larger than the
scatter in cube strengths, since co-relationship is not exact,
but
is a best fit to actual
data.

Partial Safety Factor
for Concrete
The material partial factor
of concrete includes consideration of various factors as
described below.
Partial material safety factor y^. which is considered to have a value of 1.5, consists of two
parts.
The first part is the factor y„ =
yy2"1.3, which considers unfavourable deviation of
concrete strength from
its characteristic value
f^^, model uncertainties, variation of
geometrical properties and overall safety level.
It is based on log-normal distribution:

coefficient of variation of geometricai properties.
Consequently the part of
which represents the variability of material properties is:
The part

The second part of
is a conversion factor /^^„y=1
. 1 5, used with cylindrical strength which
takes into account the decrease of in-place strength versus the characteristic strength^^.
In the literature the inverse value of 0.85 often is used. (This factor for use with cube strength
becomes 0.67). The mean values of concrete compressive strength controlled at plant
and the mean value of in-situ concrete compressive strength are approximately of the
same magnitude for the concrete age at 28 days. But due to other effects, such as
transportation temperature changes, placing, compaction and curing, the variation of in-
situ concrete strength is essentially larger (coefficient of variation is about 0.23) than the
variation of strength of concrete at plant (coefficient of variation is about 0.13). Therefore,
the safety factor y ^ =1.3 is not adequate to cover this increase of variation and additional
factor should be used fcom To find this additional factor the in-situ strength, or a ratio

~f~ was evaluated. The ratio
in place strength of concrete was considered as a
Jck
Jck
'
random variable (log-normally distributed). Based on the German and Canadian data the
5 percent fractile of this ratio was found as a value of 0.90 for columns and walls and as a
value of 0.83 for slabs and beams. These results corroborate the use of
/^o„v=1.15,
increasing
from 1.3 to 1 .5 which correspond to the factor 0.85 used with the cylinder
strength (or 0.67 used with cube strength).
A2.11
Relaxation of Steel
The relaxation loss shall be obtained from the manufacturers test certificates, and verified
by independent tests,
if required. Relaxation characteristics are dependent on the
manufacturing process. In the absence of specific data, for steels conforming to BIS codes,
the following relationships may be used for calculation of relaxation loss up to 30 years.
The long term loss after 50 years may be taken as three times the 1 000 hour loss.
Eq. A2-38 is a general equation describing relationship between relaxation loss at time t
in hours ( p, ) and that at 1 000 hours ( pi qqq ). The exponent k in the equation is approximately
given by log (p,ooo/Pioo)-

Wires/strands of normal relaxation for which IS 1785 - Part 1
, IS 6003, and IS 6006 specify
1 000 hour relaxation loss value at not more than 5 percent and 1 00 hour relaxation loss as
not more than 3.5 percent, k is 0.1 55.
Wires/strands of low relaxation for which IS 14268 specifies 1000 hour relaxation value at
not less than 2.5 percent and 1 00 hour value at not less than 1 .8 percent, k is 0.143.
For bars/rods IS 2090 does not specify 100 hour relaxation loss value. Also 1000 hour
relaxation loss value is not expressed as % value. For this reason the applicable strength,
Aooo' Pirn 'OSS values will have to be obtained from the manufacturer's data.
For steels conforming to other national standards reference shall be made to the respective
standards.
A2.12
Effect of High Temperature Curing on Relaxation of Steel
For pre-tensloned members, the effect on the relaxation losses of increasing the
temperature while curing the concrete, shall be considered
.
The relaxation is accelerated during the application ofthemnal curing when thermal strain
is introduced at the same time. Finally, the relaxation rate is reduced at the end of the
treatment.
An equivalent time
should be added to the time after tensioning t in the relaxation time
functions to cater for the effects of the heat treatment on the prestress loss due to the
relaxation of the prestressing steel.
This equivalent time can be estimated from the
expression:
Eq.A2.39
where
t
is the equivalent time (in hours)
T(AJ
is the temperature (in "C) during the time interval
T
is the maximum temperature (in X) during the heat treatment.

ANNEXUREA^
STRUCTURAL DESIGN
BY ^WORKING LOADS/ALLOWABLE STRESSES METHOD"
A4.1
Applicability ofAnnexureA-4
On publication of this Code based on "Limit State Methods", the following IRC Codes
based on 'Working Loads/Allowable Stresses' method (WL/AS) stand withdrawn:
1RC:1 8
Design Criteria for Prestressed Concrete Road Bridges (Post
Tensioned Concrete) (Third Revision).
IRC:21
Standard Specification and Code of Practice for Road Bridge
- Section m Cement Concrete (Plain and Reinforced) (Third
Revision).
The designs based on WL/AS method described in this Annexure can be followed as
an alternative to following verification of limit state of ultimate strength for reinforced
concrete members. For prestressed concrete members, in addition to WL/AS checks,
ultimate strength check is also required.
The design of plain and reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete covered in the
Annexure are limited to those grades of concrete and steel given in Section A4.3.
For
use of higher grades of these materials, the use of WL/AS method is not permitted. The
option of using Annexure A-4 to be exercised by the owner, will be available only for
such period till
it is withdrawn by IRC.
Various aspects of WL/AS method covered in Annexure A-4 are:
A4.2:
Load and Load Combinations.
A4.3:
Materials.
A4.4:
General Design Requirements
A4.5
Basic Permissible Stresses

General
Stresses that are likely to occur in plain and reinforced concrete structure, under the worst
combination of loads and forces, specified in IRC:6 shall be provided for in accordance
with accepted procedures of design and construction and in conformity with the fundamental
principles of mechanics without exceeding the limits of stresses specified in Clause A4.5.
A4.4.2
Basis of design
The strength of a reinforced concrete structural member may be assessed by commonly
employed elastic theory and it may be assumed that
:
(1)
the modulus of elasticity of steel
is 200 GPa unless othenwise
determined by tests.
(2)
the modular ratio has the values given in Table A4.2 (note-1)
(3)
unless otherwise permitted, the tensile strength of concrete
is
Ignored.
In plain concrete staictures, tension upto limits specified in TableA4.3 may be pennitted.

Members with Shear Reinforcement
When
T exceeds given
in Table A4.6, shear reinforcement shall
be provided in any of the following forms:
(a) Vertical stirrups
(b) Bent-up bars along with stirrups, and
(c) inclined stirrups
Where bent up bars are provided, their contribution towards shear
resistance shall not be more than
half that of the total shear
reinforcement.
Shear reinforcement shall be provided

Maximum spacing of stirrups shall be limited to one-half times the
depth of the beam subject to a maximum of 300 mm. Stirrups shall
pass round, or othenvise be secured to be appropriate longitudinal
tensile reinforcement. The ends of stirrups shall be adequately
anchored in the compression zone. Where for practical purposes it is
found necessary to anchor the ends of the stimjps in the tensile zone,
full anchorage length shall be provided.

Bent-up bars shall be carried through a depth at least equal to
the lever arm of the resisting moment and adequately anchored in
accordance with Section 6 and Clause 16.5. The spacing of the bent-
up bar measured at the level of neutral axis and in the direction of
longitudinal axis of the beam, shall not exceed three-quarter the
effective depth of the beam.
A4.6.2
Torsion
(1)
General
in structures where torsion
is required to maintain equilibrium,
members shall be designed
for torsion. However,
for such
indeterminate structures where torsion can be eliminated by
releasing redundant restraints, no specific design for torsion
is
necessary provided torsional stiffness is neglected in the calculation
of internal forces. Adequate control of any torsional cracking
is
provided by the shear reinforcement as per Clause A4. 6.1.
Torsional reinforcement
is not calculated separately for torsion
alone. Instead the total longitudinal reinforcement
is determined
for a fictitious bending moment which is a function of actual bending
moment and torsion; similarly web reinforcement is determined for
a fictitious shear which is a function of actual shear and torsion.
.
The design rules shall apply to beams of solid rectangular cross-
section. However, these clauses may also be applied to flanged
beams by substituting bw for b, in which case they are generally
conservative.

Critical Section
Sections located less than a distance d. from the face of the support
may be designed for the same torsion as computed at a distance
d, where d is the effective depth.

Requirement for Prestressed Concrete Members
A4.8.1
General
This covers prestressed concrete members (post-tensioned determinate structures),
wherein adequate magnitude of prestressing force is applied to member in order to improve
the effective resistance of concrete to tensile forces arising from the loading effects at
working load levels. The working loads shall be as per IRC:6 (Table 1). For the purpose of
analysis, effective prestressing force is considered as load. For calculation of effective
prestressing force, the losses in prestressing force at various stages shall be calculated
as per Section 7 of this Code. While calculating the ultimate resistance of member, the
remaining capacity of bonded prestressing steel is considered to contribute to the ultimate
resistance. For unbonded tendons, the additional increase
in forces
if any shall be
neglected.
A4.8.2
Loads and forces
(1)
The loads and forces and load combinations as per IRC:6 and as
applicable for the given structure shall be duly accounted for.
(2)
All critical loading stages shall be investigated. The stages stated
below may normally be investigated:
(a) Stage Prestressing
Stage prestressing
is permissible. The number of stages of
prestressing and grouting shall be reduced to the minimum,
preferably not more than two. However, concrete shall have
attained strength
of not less than 20 MPa before any
prestressing is applied.
265

PAGE 278 of 296
======================================================================
(b) Construction stages including temporary loading, transport,
handling and erection or any occasional loads that may occur
during launching of girders, etc., including impact,
if any;
(c) The design loads are as per load combination given in (1 ) above
including the following discrete stages:
(i)
Service Dead Load + Prestress with full losses.
(ii) Service Dead Load + Live Load + Prestress with full losses.
(d) For the combination of loads with
differential temperature
gradient effects, maximum 50 percent
live load
shall be
considered and any tensile stresses shall be taken care of by
providing adequately designed untensioned steel subject to the
crack width limitations stipulated in Clause 12.3.2 of the Code.
This shall apply notwithstanding the provision contained
in
Clause A4.8.3(2). However,
in the case of precast segmental
construction no tension shall be permitted under this load
combination.
(e) Ultimate load, as per Section 8 of this Code.
Permissible stresses in concrete
(1)
Permissible temporary stresses in concrete
(a) These stresses are calculated after accounting for all appropriate
losses, pertaining to the stage of construction.
(b) The compressive stress produced due to loading mentioned in
Clause A 4.8.2
(b) shall not exceed 0.5

is the
concrete strength at that time subject to a maximum of 30 MPa.

than
0.8 y^.^

in the extreme
fibre of concrete (including stage prestressing), shall not exceed
0.5^^ subject to maximum of 30 MPa.

shall not exceed 1/1 0*^ of the permissible temporary compressive
stress in the concrete.
(2)
Permissible stress in concrete during service
(a) The compressive stress in concrete under service loads shall
not exceed 0.33/^.
(b) No tensile stress shall be permitted
in the concrete during
service.
266



======================================================================
PAGE 279 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
(c)
If precast segmental elements are joined by prestressing, the
stresses in the extreme fibres of concrete during service shall
always be compressive and the minimum compressive stress
in an extreme fibre shall not be less than five per cent of
maximum permanent compressive stress that may be developed
in the same section. This provision shall not, however, apply to
cross prestressed deck slabs.
,
;
(3)
Permissible stresses in prestressing steel
Maximum jack pressure shay hot exceed 90 percent of 0. 1 percent
proof stress. For the purpose of this Clause, 0.1* percent proof stress
shall be taken as equal to 85 percent of minimum Ultimate Tensile
Strength (UTS).
Section properties
(1)
For members consisting of precast as well as cast-in-situ units,
due consideration shall be given to the different moduli of elasticity
of concrete in the precast and cast-in-situ portions.
(2)
For the purpose of determining the flexural stresses both prior to
and after grouting of the cables or tendons, the properties of the
section such as area, position of centroid and moment of inertia
may be based upon the full section of the concrete without deducting
the area of longitudinal openings
left
in the concrete for
prestressing tendons, cable ducts or sheaths. No allowance for the
transformed area of the prestressing tendons shall, however, be
made.
Deduction shall be made for the holes of transverse prestressing
tendons at sections where they occur, for determining the stresses
before grouting of these holes.
Ultimate strength
Prestressed Concrete Structural members shall be checked for
failure conditions at an ultimate load combination as specified by
IRC:6, Annexure-B,
using methods given
in Section 8 to
Section 11 of this Code.
Requirements of Minimum Dimensions of Members and Minimum
Reinforcement
The limits prescribed elsewhere in this code (detailing Sections)
shall be observed for design based on WL/AS method also.

CONCRETE SHELL ELEMENTS
B1 .1
This section applies to shell elements, in which there are generally eight
components of internal forces. The eight components of internal forces are listed below
and shown in Fig. B1-1.1 for an element of unit dimensions:
3 plate components rj^^

3 slab components m^dx, ^Edy, ^Edxy, = ^Edyx,
2 transverse shear forces VEdx, ^Edy,
Fig. B1-1
Shell Element
B1 .2
, The first stage in the verification procedure is to establish if the shell element
is uncracked or cracked.
B1 .3
In uncracked elements the only verification required is to check that the
minimum principal stress is smallerthan the design compressive strength f^^
.
It may be
appropriate to take
into account the multiaxial compression state
in the definition
o^fcd-
B1.4
In cracked elements a sandwich model should be used for design or
verification of the shell element.
B1.6
in the sandwich model three layers are identified (Fig.B1.2): The two
outer layers resist the membrane actions arising form ^^atc, ^Edy, ^Edxy, ^Edx, ^Edy,
^Edxy, and the inner layer carries the shear forces V£^^ ^Edy. The thickness of
the different layers should be established by means of an iterative procedure
(B1.13 and B1.15)(Fig. B1-2.15).

INFORMATIVE ANNEXURE B-2
MECHANISMS OF DETERIORATION OF CONCRETE
STRUCTURES
This Annexure gives description of the main deterioration mechanisms which may need to
be considered in design.
B2.1
"
Corrosion of Reinforcement/Prestressing Tendons
In normal circumstances, the highly alkaline nature of concrete protects steel embedded
within
it. The pH value of the pore solution in concrete is generally in the region of 1 2 to
14. The protection is afforded by the formation of a very thin, coherent layer of iron oxide
over the surface of the steel bar under such alkaline conditions. Steel protected in this way
is described as being in a passive state. Steel will not generally corrode in uncontaminated
concrete until the pH drops below 10. Two mechanisms, v\lhich can lead to the destruction
of this passive state, are:-
(1)
Carbonation of Concrete
This
is a reaction between carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and
the calcium hydroxide in the hyd rated cement matrix. This process
starts at the surface and
wit-h time, penetrates slowly
into the
concrete. The rate of penetration of carbonation into the concrete,
is the highest, where the relative humidity is in the range 50 to 70
percent.
It
is lower at higher humidities, being effectively zero at
100 percent. The rate
is also lower at lower humidities, being
effectively zero
at 0 percent humidity, because carbonation
can not take place without presence of water. The rate of carbonation
will be lower in good quality concrete as compared to that in poor
quality concerete. The rate of carbonation depends on the rate at
which carbon dioxide can diffuse into the concrete. This will decrease
with a decrease in the water/cement ratio. The effect of carbonation
is to reduce the alkalinity of the concrete surrounding the reinforcement
to a level where the natural protection is lost.
(2)
The presence of Chlorides in Concrete
Chlorides have the capacity to destroy the passivity of steel locally,
even where the
alkalinity remains
high,
giving
rise to
'pitting
corrosion'.
Chlorides may get
into the concrete from various
sources, but the commonest are seawater in marine environments;
275



======================================================================
PAGE 288 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
chloride ions,
if any, contained
in the ingredients of concrete,
particularly the mix water; and de-icing chemicals on bridge decks
as used in colder climates. The rate of ingress of chloride into the
concrete depends upon the amount of chloride
in the service
environment in contact with the concrete surface and on the quality
of the concrete.
Once the passivity of the steel has been destroyed, occurrence of
corrosion of steel requires only two things; sufficient moisture and
sufficient oxygen.
It is found that these two requirements can act
against each other since,
if the concrete
is wet, oxygen cannot
penetrate and if it is dry, there is insufficient moisture for the reaction
to progress. As a result, the greatest risk of corrosion is in members
subjected to alternate wetting and drying.
B2.2
Frost Attack
If saturated concrete is subjected to frequent freezing and thawing, the expansive effects
of ice formation will disrupt the concrete. The usual manifestations of frost damage are
surface spalling or the formation of closely spaced surface cracks.
Concrete, which is
not close to being saturated,
is not at risk from frost as the expansion that occurs on
freezing can be accommodated in the pores not filled with water. Except in a few areas in
colder regions of the country, frost attack may not pose a significant problem.
B2.3
Alkali-aggregate Reactions
There are two basic forms of reaction which occasionally occur and can damage concrete:
viz. - the alkali-silica reaction and the alkali-carbonate reaction. The alkali-silica reaction
is the more common in India.
It is a reaction between the alkalis (sodium and potassium
salts) in the cement and certain forms of glassy or crypto-crystalline silica in the aggregate,
which results in the formation of a hygroscopic 'silica gel'. This gel expands when in contact
with water, resulting in the formation of cracks, which may be large (several millimeters
wide are not uncommon). In relatively unstressed and un reinforced concrete, these cracks
can fomn a random map' pattern. In other cases, the cracks will tend to form parallel to the
direction of compressive stress or reinforcement. The cracks are usually not deep, only
extending 50-70 mm into the section. Their effect on structural performance is not as great
as might be imagined from looking at the cracks. A reduction in the compressive and
tensile strengths and modulus of elasticity of the concrete occurs, but this is commonly not
more than about 20-30 percent.
In India, siliceous rocks like granite, granite gneiss and schist, quartzite and sandstone,
containing 'strained quartz' have been found to be reactive. The methods of evaluation are
276



======================================================================
PAGE 289 of 296
======================================================================
IRC:112-2011
given in IS 2386. More refined methods of detection of reactivity of aggregates are being
evolved, for which, specialist literature may be consulted.
B2A
Attack from Sulphates
In the presence of water, sulphate ions can react with the tricalcium aluminate component
of the cement. This reaction causes expansion, leading to cracking and eventual
disintegration of the concrete. The commonest source of sulphates
is
in the earth
surrounding foundations but other sources are sometimes significant. Seawater contains
significant amounts of sulphates in addition to chlorides. The severity of attack depends
on the concentration of sulphate ions in the soil and subsoil water and in the environment.
B2.5
Attack by Aggressive Chemicals
Effluents, vapours, fumes etc. from chemical and fertilizer industries can attack concrete,
leading to its disintegration. In case of a bridge structure being exposed to such harmful
chemicals due to proximity to such industries, the structure should be designed for
'extreme' exposure condition (Table 14.1). Protective coatings may be required. For further
guidance, specialist literature may be referred.
B2.6
Acid Attack
No concrete
is acid
resistant. Even mild acids (pH 4 to 5) can attack the calcium
compounds in concrete, converting them to soluble salts, which can then leach away. The
effect of acids is therefore to eat away, or render the surface of the concrete weak and
permeable. Acid rain, for example, will do no more than etch the surface of the concrete
over any reasonable design life.
If the concrete is likely to be exposed to major amounts of
acid, for example from some industrial process, the only way to avoid damage is to provide
an impermeable coating to the concrete.
B2.7
Abrasion
Abrasion of concrete surfaces may occur due to movement of boulders, sand or gravel
suspended in turbulent water, or air borne sand particles. Resistance to abrasion can be
obtained by using higher strength concrete and abrasion resistant aggregates. Resistance
is also markedly improved by good curing of surfaces likely to be exposed to abrasive
action.

INFORMATIVE ANNEXURE B-3
EFFECT OF LIVE LOADS ON DECK SLABS
B3.1
Scope
The effect of concentrated loads on slabs spanning in one or two directions or on cantilever
slabs may be calculated from the influence fields of such loads or by any other rational
method. A value of 0.2 may be assumed for Poisson's ratio. A simplified method for
estimating the action of concentrated loads on slab, based on effective width method for
cantilever and simply supported slab, is described below, which may be used where more
detailed calculations are not performed.
B3.2
Effective Width
The bending moment per unit width of slab caused by concentrated loads on solid slabs
spanning in one direction or on cantilever slabs, may also be calculated by assessing the
width of slab that may be taken as effective in resisting the bending moment due to the
concentrated loads. For precast slabs, the term 'actual width of slab' used in this Clause
shall indicate the actual width of each individual precast unit.
Slabs designed on the above basis need not be checked for shear.
