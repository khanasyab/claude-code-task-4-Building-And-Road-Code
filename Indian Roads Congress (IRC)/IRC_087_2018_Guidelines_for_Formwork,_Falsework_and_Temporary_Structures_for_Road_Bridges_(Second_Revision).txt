GUIDELINES FOR FORMWORK, FALSEWORK AND  
TEMPORARY STRUCTURES for Road Bridges
INTRODUCTION
The “Guidelines for Formwork, Falsework and Temporary Structures” was first published by IRC 
in year 1984 and thereafter it was first revised in 2011. The Formwork, Falsework and Temporary 
Structures Committee (B-7) during its tenure 2015-17 felt the necessity to revise this document 
again in order to keep pace with latest changes in technologies, machineries, workmanship 
etc. The initial draft was discussed in number of meetings of B-7 Committee and finally it was 
approved in its meeting held on 09.10.2017 for placing before the Bridges Specifications & 
Standards Committee (BSS). The BSS Committee in its meeting held on 23.10.2017 approved 
this document. The document was discussed in the 213th meeting of IRC Council held on 
03.11.2017 during the 78th Annual Session of IRC held at Bengaluru and approved the document 
for publication.
The Formwork, Falsework and Temporary Structures Committee (B-7) of the Indian Roads 
Congress was re-constituted in 2015 for the tenure 2015-17 with the following personnel:

1 SCOPE
These guidelines apply to the design, fabrication, erection, and stripping of Formwork, Falsework 
and Temporary Structures built mostly from structural materials and used for supporting different 
types of permanent concrete bridge structures during construction till they become self supporting 
or built to provide access for doing concrete work or to support a plant/equipment or to support 
side slope of an excavation, etc.
Mechanised enabling structures (like launching girders, trolleys, etc.) used in bridge construction 
are excluded from the scope these guidelines. Working stress design, which was earlier a part 
of IRC:24, has now been added as Annexure G to this code.
The guidelines prescribe only the minimum requirements and are to be supplemented by design, 
engineering judgement and experience.
2 OBJECTIVES
The objective is to design and construct safe and economical formwork and falsework system 
that will support all loads imposed and provide the necessary rigidity to achieve the lines, grades 
and shapes shown in the working drawings. The basic parameters to be considered as under:
2.1	
Quality
2.1.1	
The forms and other structures are designed and built accurately so that the desired 
shape, size, alignment and finish of the cast-concrete is achieved in terms of dimension and 
strength as per approved working drawings.
The forms must be built to correct dimensions, must be sufficiently rigid under the construction 
loads to maintain the designed shape of the concrete within permissible deflections and tolerance 
limits, must be sturdy and strong enough to maintain large members in alignment, and must be 
constructed so they can withstand handling and reuse, without losing their dimensional integrity. 
The formwork must remain in place until the concrete is strong enough to carry its own weight.
2.1.2	
The correct material should be chosen. The quality of surface finish of the concrete 
is affected by the material of the form. A correct combination of form material and oil or other 
parting compound can contribute in eliminating air holes or other surface imperfections in the 
cast concrete.
2.2	
Safety
Safety should be included in the planning and management of the project and procedures that 
will assure safety for workmen and structure should be adopted. The following be ensured that:



======================================================================
PAGE 11 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:87-2018
3
2.2.1	
Formworks, Falseworks and Temporary Structures are correctly designed after 
collection of required data and making sufficient investigations, by rational analysis with adequate 
safety margins and strong enough for the expected load.
These are supervised during erection and concreting by competent Supervisors who should see 
that these are constructed exactly as designed, following a safe erection procedure so that no 
members are temporarily overloaded.
2.2.2	
No other loads are ever imposed on them if these have been designed with no 
allowance for unusual construction loads or eccentric loads due to placing sequence or any such 
load.
2.2.3	
Adequate work area or work platforms with proper method of access have been 
provided.
2.2.4	
Safety signs and barricades have been erected to keep unauthorized personnel clear 
of areas in which erection or stripping is underway.
2.3 
Efficiency
The formwork, falsework and temporary works should be so planned and designed that these 
can be handled, erected and dismantled easily and used repeatedly to optimal limits.
2.4	
Economy
Economy is one of the main concerns, since formwork cost may be more than 20-30 percent of 
the cost of concrete structure. No attempt, however, should be made to achieve economy at the 
cost of quality or safety.
2.4.1	
The formwork falsework and temporary structures should be meticulously planned 
and designed to cater for all the parameters of quality, safety and efficiency and the provisions 
of codes and specifications such that these are time and cost effective.
2.4.2	
Shortcut in design or construction of formwork may endanger quality and safety and 
should not be attempted.
2.4.3	
The design and erection of formwork/falsework should, whereever possible, form an 
item of contract so that the cost of this item is correctly assessed, executed and supervised.
2.4.4	
Coordinated efforts between Engineer/Designer and Contractor can also result in 
savings in the cost.
2.5	
General Relationship and Responsibility
2.5.1	
The responsibility of the designer, contractor, and the clients should be decided 
without ambiguity and the interests and views of all the three should be considered while deciding 
various parameters for design, specifications and erection with optimum utilization of the skills, 
knowledge and resources available at the site.
2.5.2	
The system of designing, checking and approval of designs, erection systems and 
construction methodology should be clearly defined and agreed by all the involved parties.



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:87-2018
4
2.5.3	
The various parameters for design, its limitations and permissible tolerances should 
be finalized after mutual consultation between the involved parties and described in a design 
brief to be prepared and agreed before taking up the work.

International codes, but the use of which has been permitted elsewhere, it would be necessary 
to produce certification from the concerned authorities regarding the successful performance of 
such materials for 5 repeated uses. Such a certificate shall be supported with details of critical 
performance parameters and test results.

4.4.1	
Form ties : A form tie is a tensile unit adopted for holding concrete forms against 
the active pressure of freshly placed plastic concrete. Form ties, are also manufactured part of 
proprietary system.
4.4.2	
Form anchors : Form anchors are devices used in the securing of formwork to 
previously placed concrete of adequate strength. The devices normally are embedded in the 
concrete during placement. Actual load carrying capacity of the anchors depends on the strength 
of concrete in which they are embedded, the area of contact between the concrete and anchor 
and the depth of embedment. Manufacturers also publish design data and test information to 
assist in the selection of proper form anchor devices.
4.4.3	
Form hangers : Form hangers are often used to suspend formwork from a supporting 
structure.
4.5	
Form Coatings or Release Agents and Sealants for Formwork
4.5.1	
Form coatings : Form coatings or sealants are usually applied to contact surface 
either during manufacture or in the field to serve one or more of the following purposes:
	
a)	
To seal the contact surface and joints from intrusion of moisture or loss of 
moisture and cement slurry.
	
b)	
To alter the texture of the contact surface.
	
c)	
To improve the durability of the contact surface.
	
d)	
To facilitate release of form from concrete during stripping.
4.5.2	
Release agents : Form release agents are applied to form contact surfaces to prevent 
bond and thus facilitate stripping. They may be applied permanently to form materials during 
manufacture or in the field or may be applied to the form before each use. The release agents 
shall be checked for compatibility with form surfaces, plastic concrete including admixtures and 
requirements for the application of further materials to the hardened concrete. They shall be 
kept off construction joints surfaces and reinforcing steel by applying before the reinforcement 
is laid. Care shall be taken to ensure that excessive application of release agent does not cause 
staining of concrete surface or retard curing. Where exposed aggregate work or other type of 
concrete surface finish is desired, release agents may be designed suitably.
4.5.3	
Form insulation : These are usually used for protection of concrete in cold weather. 
These shall be used as per manufacturer's recommendations.
4.5.4	
Sealants : In order to get smooth concrete surface finish and prevent escape of 
cement slurry, use of laminated tar paper or similar sealant can be permitted.
4.5.5	
Manufacturer's recommendations : Manufacturer's recommendations shall be 
followed in the use of coatings, sealants and release agents, but independent investigation of 
their performance is recommended before use.
5 INVESTIGATIONS
The following investigations should be done before starting the design and all other data as 
made available should be verified with the site conditions.



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:87-2018
11
5.1	
All Topographical, Geographical and Climatic conditions should be investigated as 
relevant to design.
5.2	
Sufficient Hydraulic and Hydrological investigations should be done to cover the river 
flow conditions, velocity of flow and discharge and water levels during different periods, any 
abnormal or sudden discharge which may be released from any Irrigation works in the upstream 
of construction site, any back flow conditions, tides or wave action, scour pattern during different 
seasons and flood conditions, any debris or trees flowing in the river.
This needs to be monitored regularly and whereever there are irrigation works upstream there 
should be continuous communication and alert system with them.
5.3	
Adequate Geotechnical/sub soil investigations should be done at the locations of 
ground support to ascertain the allowable bearing capacity and to decide the type of foundation 
or support system after due consideration of the scours at those locations and the permissible 
settlements. Depth of sub-soil water should also be determined.
5.4	
Adequate investigations should be done to locate any underground or overhead 
utility services which may foul with the foundation of the falsework/Temporary structures or the 
erection/launching or casting systems.
5.5	
Detailed investigations should be done to find out the limitations at site because of 
space and movement restraints, headroom or clearances required, traffic regulation or diversion 
proposals, lighting and warning signs, regulations for noise control, vibrations or impact effects 
or environmental issues-pollution of air, soil or water etc.
5.6	
Detailed investigations need to be done whenever there are any changes in any of the 
conditions which will affect the design or the systems of erection etc. being used. The designs/
systems could be reviewed and revised, if necessary, adopting the changed data/informations.
5.7	
Falsework foundations in general are at a shallow depth. The subsoil investigations 
should be done keeping this factor in mind.
5.8	
Necessary investigation should be done to assess the severity of the seismic effects 
to assess its implications on the design.
6 DESIGN
6.1	
Procedural Control at Design Stage, Design Brief
The design, construction and supervision is needed to be ensured in respect of all aspects of 
formwork, falsework or temporary structures at site. These activities requires the same skill 
and attention to details as that of the permanent structure. These shall always be regarded as 
a structure in their own right, the stability of which at all stages of construction is paramount for 
safety of the permanent structure as well as for the personnel working at site.
Proper implementation of temporary works is largely dependent on management of various 
activities from concept to erection/dismantling as well as maintenance & storage. The procedures 
can be considered for controlling the three phases:



======================================================================
PAGE 20 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:87-2018
12
	
i)

of temporary works for the project. This includes drawings & specifications for 
permanent work, codes & contractual specifications as per which design of 
temporary works is to be carried out, soil investigation & environmental data, 
construction schedule & sequence of work, proposed methods of construction, 
access requirements, equipment & material available for temporary works and 
any other relevant data. If any deviations are proposed from the assumptions 
related to sequence or method of construction, loading or strength restrictions, 
etc. then the same have to be reviewed and approved by the designer of 
permanent works.
	
	
It is to be ensured that a satisfactory design of temporary works is carried out. 
Depending on the complexity, the design & drawings are to be reviewed to check 
the concept, structural adequacy & compliance with the design brief.

construction methodology etc. It is important that it is prepared early to allow sufficient time for 
all subsequent activities i.e. design, design check, procurement of equipment, construction and 
erection scheme etc.
6.1.3	
The preparation of the brief might involve a large amount of information needed to 
be collected from various sources before design work can commence or a program for the 
construction or the temporary works can be drawn up.

6.1.7	
When the design is completed the design brief should be provided to the organization/
individual who is to carry out the design check and also to the construction agency.
6.2	
General Considerations
6.2.1	
Formworks, Falsework and Temporary Structures shall be designed to meet the 
requirements of the permanent structure, taking into account the actual condition of materials, 
environment and site conditions in such a manner to facilitate easy erection and dismantling.
6.2.3	
These may be designed in accordance with relevant IRC Codes for design of 
permanent structures except for loads, load combinations, allowable stresses and deflections 
which are dealt in this code. If, in case any item is not covered in this or other IRC codes, design 
may alternatively be based on other acceptable references or national/international codes.
6.2.4	
Careful attention shall be paid to the detailing of the support/connections and their 
function so as to reflect and accommodate the behaviour of the structure. Wherever possible, the 
structure shall be designed in such a manner that any local failures will not lead to progressive 
failure of false work/temporary structure.
6.3	
Loads
6.3.1	
These structures shall be designed to cater for the vertical, horizontal and other loads 
as specified in the subsequent clauses.
6.3.2	
Vertical loads : Vertical loads shall comprise of dead load, superimposed load, 
applicable live load and other loads as detailed below.
6.3.2.1	
Dead loads
6.3.2.1.1	 Dead load, generally static in nature, occur during the service life of these structures 
such as, Self-weight of the formwork and falsework, any ancillary temporary work connected 
to and supported by the falsework structure and permanent structure supported by the 
falsework.



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:87-2018
14
6.3.2.1.2	 Self-weight shall be determined according to IRC:6 except for the following items for 
which the unit weights given in the following clause shall apply.
6.3.2.1.3	 The following unit weights shall be adopted in the absence of actual measurements:
a)
Wet concrete including reinforcement
26 kN/m3
b)
Timber-soft wood
6 kN/ m3
c)
Timber-hardwood
7 to 10 kN/ m3
d)
Steel formwork, Aluminium formwork, Combination of 
steel and ply (sheeting, main and secondary bearers) 
and other materials.
Actual weight
e)
Scaffold tube (40 NB).
45 N/m
6.3.2.1.4	 For falsework composed of scaffold tube fittings, the additional weight of fittings, in 
absence of actual data may be accounted for by increasing the self-weight of the vertical and 
horizontal members by 15 percent. Similarly, in the case of falsework built with fabricated frames, 
the additional weight of fittings may be estimated at 5 percent of the total weight of the frames 
and bracings.
6.3.2.2	
Impact : In absence of data, to cater for impact in precast construction the dead load 
should be increased by minimum of 10 percent due to weight of precast concrete member. For 
cast-in-place concrete construction, impact forces are covered under superimposed loads.
6.3.2.3	
Up lift forces : Reduction in self-weight due to submerged portions of structure should 
be considered in the calculations wherever applicable.
6.3.2.4	
Superimposed loads
6.3.2.4.1	 Superimposed loads shall include the following :
	
a)	
Construction personnel
	
b)	
Plant and equipment including the impact and surge - Special consideration 
shall be given to items of plant which cause vibration to formwork such as form 
vibrators and prestressing equipment.
	
c)	
The static load of the moving item should be increased by 25 percent for 
mechanically operated equipment, and by 10 percent when using manually 
operated equipment.
	
d)	
Stacking of materials - This normally occurs from storage of materials such as 
shutter plates, reinforcement and concrete making materials on the falsework 
prior to concreting. Stacking materials on falsework should be avoided. If it is 
unavoidable, then the maximum permissible load should be accounted for in the 
design and clearly indicated in the drawings.
	
e)	
Prestressing loads - The forces and deformation thereof, of the structure 
associated with prestressing are often transferred to the supporting falsework. 
Allowance shall be made in the falsework design to accommodate the force and/
or the movement involved as per the load transfer mechanism.
6.3.2.4.2	 Depending upon seasonal, geographic and construction factors, snow can accumulate 
and form into drifts on the permanent and temporary works causing additional loading, this 



======================================================================
PAGE 23 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:87-2018
15
loading shall generally be within 0.75 kN/m2 and only in exceptional case will this loading be 
exceeded.
6.3.2.4.3	 Impact due to deposition of Concrete - This can be due to the deposition of concrete 
of forms and secondary girders supporting the forms a design DDL of 3.6 KN/m3 shall be 
considered.
6.3.3	
Lateral loads : The lateral loads shall comprise of:

Earthquake forces
	
e)	
Any other load not covered in above
6.3.3.1	
Lateral pressure of fresh concrete
6.3.3.1.1	 The factors affecting lateral pressure on forms are:
	
a)	
Density of concrete
	
b)	
Rate of placing
	
c)	
Vibrating
	
d)	
Temperature of concrete
	
e)	
Concrete Slump
	
f)	
Method of discharge and compaction
	
g)	
Width, depth & shape of section
	
h)	
Vertical form height
	
i)	
Constituent material of concrete like admixtures, aggregate, cementitious 
material
6.3.3.1.2	 The design pressures may be calculated on the basis of standard literature such as 
CIRIA report/ACI Manual SP-4 
6.3.3.1.3	 The design pressure for Self Compacting concrete will be different than for the other 
concretes. Special literature should be referred to for calculating the pressure from such concrete 
on the formworks.
6.3.3.1.4	 In general a minimum value of 20 kN/m2/m height shall be adopted in the design. 
This value is valid for the rate of rise of concrete of 1.0 m/h at 25 °C and slump 40 mm without 
admixtures.
6.3.3.2	
Environmental loads
6.3.3.2.1	 Wind- In view of temporary nature of falsework it may be designed for wind loads as 
per IS 875 (Part-3) but with a return period of 5 years.
6.3.3.2.2	 Water- Where it is necessary for falsework supports to be placed in flowing water, the 
effect of the forces caused by the flow shall be considered. These will includes –
	
a)	
Water current forces with due consideration for scour, turbulent flow during the 
construction period



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:87-2018
16
	
b)	
Flood level occurring during the period of erection and dismantling of temporary 
work 2 times the calculated scour will be considered.
	
c)	
Increased frontal area, and head of water due to trapped debris-
Where there are successive rows of falsework members exposed to flowing water it is possible 
that some shielding protection is provided to the downstream members by the upstream. The 
following factors will contribute to the total force being applied to the falsework in the water:
	
i)	
The area of obstruction to the water flow presented by the first line of falsework 
members.
	
ii)	
Any further decrease in the width available for the passage of the water as it 
passes through the falsework.
	
iii)	
The increase in obstruction to the flow that would result from the trapping of 
debris on the faces of the falsework.
6.3.3.2.3	 Trapped debris effect
The accumulation of debris will produce a force on the falsework that may be calculated as for 
that on a rectangular cofferdam. This force is given by the expression :
	
Fd = 666 AdVw
2
where,
Ad =	
Area of obstruction presented by the trapped debris and falsework (in m2)
Vw =	
velocity of water flow (m/s)
Fd =	
force in N
This effect will be dependent up on the rate of flow, the amount and nature of the floating debris, 
the nature of the obstruction and the depth of water.
6.3.3.2.4	 Wave action - When falsework is erected in or adjacent to water, it may be subjected 
to wave forces. In marine locations this is a probability, but elsewhere it is a possibility that 
should considered. For further information specialist literature may be referred to.
6.3.3.2.5	 Earth pressure - Earth pressure shall be calculated as per IRC:6.
6.3.3.2.6	 Earthquake forces
Earthquake forces shall be considered for structures in Zones IV and V Load combinations and 
permissible stresses shall be as per IRC:6. Response reduction factor R shall be as per IS:1893 
(Part 1) and Importance factor (I) shall be taken as 1.0.
6.3.3.2.7	 Any other load not covered in above. Other horizontal forces may result in from the 
following cases and shall be catered for wherever appropriate.
	
a)	
Movements of the permanent structures imposed on the falsework due to effects 
like prestressing operations.
	
b)	
External ties and anchorages.
	
c)	
Plant and equipment - Horizontal forces may result due to acceleration of plant 
moving on falsework. The design should allow for a horizontal force in any of the 
possible directions of movement equivalent to 10 percent of the static load of the 
moving item.

d)	
Horizontal forces may develop if the pumped concrete pipe is supported by 
falsework though surcharge will usually be smaller. The pipes shall be adequately 
anchored, specially at bends and the effect of blowing out the line pipe shall also 
be considered.
The additional force due to the concrete pipeline, Fx (in N), applied to the falsework shall be 
calculated from the expression:
	
F= 0.25 p Ax
	
where,
	
p is the maximum pressure in the pipeline (in N/mm2).
	
Ax is the cross sectional area of the pipeline (in mm2)
The maximum pressure in the pipeline, P, is dependent up on a number of factors but the 
following pressures are not likely to be exceeded.
5 N/mm2, for mechanical pumps
0.7 N/mm2, for pneumatic placers
6.3.3.2.8	 Design values of total lateral load : Certain horizontal forces are identifiable and can 
be calculated but there may be others which may not either be foreseen or estimated. As such, 
an amount equal to 1 percent of the total design vertical load of falsework in any direction shall 
be added to the calculated lateral loads to arrive at the design load.
The design value of the total lateral load however shall not be less than 3.0 percent of the total 
design vertical load. The point of application of the loading may be assumed at the soffit of the 
formwork.
6.3.4	
Load combinations
Various combinations of forces which are likely to be applied on the falsework should be taken 
into account. An indicative typical arrangement of forces is illustrated in Figure below:

6.3.7	
Deflection limits
In general, the deflection of members in formwork is limited by the tolerances specified for 
permanent works. In general, the calculated deflection of unsupported areas of form faces shall 
not exceed 3 mm.
The total deflection shall be such that the maximum dimensional tolerances specified for 
permanent works in specifications are not exceeded. Where the deflection of the falsework 
members is greater than permissible tolerances, suitable pre-camber arrangement shall be 
provided.
6.4	
Analysis
6.4.1	
Load transfer systems: The system which transfers the loads to the falsework shall be 
examined to ensure that all possible changes in the conditions of load transfer are provided for. 
Relative deflections between the permanent structure and the falsework including settlement of 
the foundations may cause high local concentrations of load.
Adjustable or non-adjustable distance pieces, including jacks and similar devices are often used 
to transfer loads. Capacity of such members shall be checked for a minimum of 3 percent of the 
vertical load acting horizontally at the load point.
6.4.2	
Special loading conditions: The design or sequence of construction of the permanent 
structure may give rise to special or unusual loading conditions on the falsework. Where this is 
so, it shall be indicated clearly by the designer/user of such permanent works, so that it may be 
taken into account in the design of the falsework.
6.4.3	
Reversal of loading: Reversal of moments and stresses may occur during erection 
and dismantling of the falsework and shall be accounted for in the design.
6.5	
Lateral and Diagonal Bracings
6.5.1	
Diagonal bracings in both the longitudinal and lateral directions shall connect the 
shores or props of the upper and lower bays of the scaffolding tubes at splice or joint as the case 
may be.
	
i)	
The bottom horizontal bracing shall be within 600 mm of the bottom.
	
ii)	
Top horizontal bracing shall be within 600 mm from top.
	
iii)	
The intermediate horizontal bracings shall be designed to suit the design 
requirements.
	
iv)	
The diagonal bracings shall be at slope between 30° and 60° to the horizontal.
6.5.2 	
The falsework system shall be designed to transfer all lateral loads to the ground or to 
completed construction of adequate strength and stiffness in such a manner as to ensure safety 
at all times. Diagonal bracing must be provided in vertical and horizontal planes for falsework 
tubes not designed as self standing to provide stiffness and to prevent buckling of individual 
members. A laterally braced system shall be anchored to ensure stability. Diagonal bracing must 
be capable of resisting the overturning moment.

6.6	
Shores
6.6.1	
All shores shall have a firm bearing. Inclined shores shall be braced securely against 
slipping or sliding. The bearing ends of shores shall be cut square and have a tight fit end 
splices. Splices shall be secure against bending and buckling. Connections of shore heads to 
other framing shall be adequate to prevent the shores from falling out when reverse bending 
causes upward deflection of the forms.
6.6.2	
Timber shores, where used, shall meet the following requirements :
	
a)	
The number of splicing in any shore shall be kept to the minimum. The matching 
ends of shores to be spliced shall be cut square, for proper seating. Locations 
of splices should be staggered. The splicing members shall ensure concentric 
force transfer.
	
b)	
All splice fastening shall be adequate.
	
c)	
Metal splice pieces of adequate size may be used in place of timber.
	
d)	
Lap splice shall be prohibited.
6.7	
Proprietary Items
When proprietary forms, shoring or components are used, the manufacturers recommendations 
for safe working loads shall be supported by data sheets and test reports for components by an 
approved testing organization. Necessary details required to be furnished by the manufacturer 
are given in Appendix-1.
6.8	
Foundation of Falsework
6.8.1	
Where the falsework rests directly on ground, or on permanent structure, it shall 
be ensured that load is transferred and distributed so as to ensure that total or differential 
settlements are within acceptable limits. The details of the actual site conditions and the safe 
bearing pressures for use in the design shall from part of design briefs. Safe bearing capacity of 
soil shall be arrived based on available data/sound engineering practices.
6.8.2	
Falsework supported on permanent structure - Where it is intended to support the 
falsework on permanent construction, it is essential to determine limitations, if any, which the 
design of permanent works imposes on the incidence and distribution of load from the falsework. 
It is essential to determine the strength of the permanent works to receive loading based on 
the rate of gain of strength and maturity of concrete in the structure. Necessary checks shall be 
made to ensure the safety of the permanent structure.
6.8.3	
Falsework supported on the ground - The loads from the falsework shall be applied 
to the ground through, distribution members which may be of timber, steel base plate or precast 
sleepers to ensure proper contact with the ground. Shores of the falsework system shall be 
centrally placed on the member. These distribution members shall be properly designed for all 
possible load combinations.
6.8.4	
Foundation supports comprising piles or other deep ground insertions shall be 
designed and installed to specific designs and drawings. Where there is a likelihood of the 
foundation becoming flooded, foundations shall be designed to safely withstand the direct and 
indirect consequences of such flooding including scour, undermining or weakening of ground 
strata.

6.8.5	
The slope of the ground can cause stability problems and it is recommended that the 
slope of the surface on which the falsework rests should not exceed 1 in 6 unless approved by 
a suitably qualified engineer specializing in geotechnics. The stability of the ground above and 
below the falsework site should also be considered.
6.8.6	
Falsework foundations in general are set at a very shallow depth, compared with 
those of permanent structures, which brings them within the zone affected by seasonal moisture 
content changes, frost action, scour, etc. These effects should be duly considered in making 
investigations as well as in the design.
6.9	
Special Requirements for Prestressed Concrete
6.9.1	
The structural designer shall indicate special requirements, if any, for prestressed 
construction. Where required, it may be necessary to provide appropriate means of lowering 
or removing the formwork before full prestress is applied to prevent damage due to upward 
deflection of resilient formwork and possible redistribution of loads to falsework supports nearer 
the permanent supports.
6.9.2	
The restraint to shrinkage of concrete shall be kept to a minimum and the hogging of 
members due to prestressing force and the elastic deformation of formwork or falsework shall be 
considered in the design and removal of the formwork.
6.10 
Common Deficiencies in Design
Some avoidable common design deficiencies leading or contributing to failure, are
	
a)	
Lack of sufficient allowance in design for special loads as mentioned above.
	
b)	
Inadequate/improper shoring.
	
c)	
Improper positioning of shores at different levels where high/tall falsework is 
involved. This may create reversal of stresses.
	
d)	
Inadequate provisions (especially where beam hangers are used) to prevent 
rotation or twisting of beam forms, particularly when slabs frame into them on 
only one side or slabs of unequal spans frame into beams.
	
e)	
Inadequate provision against uplift.
	
f)	
Insufficient allowance for unsymmetrical or eccentric loading due to placement 
sequence.
	
g)	
Inadequate design of form ties or clamps.
	
h)	
Inadequate protection against scour and effect of Buoyancy where applicable.
	
i)	
Poor foundation conditions of sites not accounted for in design.
	
j)	
Lack of proper adjustment of shims and wedges during concreting.
	
k)	
Neglecting horizontal and inclined pressures of concrete on inclined formwork.
	
l)	
Neglecting concrete buoyancy.
	
m)	
Not accounting the continuity of the members.
	
n)	
Omitting dead weight of void forms and Buoyancy effect.
	
o)	
incorrectly assessing the effective length of support towers or struts, or neglecting 
the possibility of torsion failure.
	
p)	
Deformation/extensions of tension components such as ropes, strands, etc. to 
enable adequate load transfer.

8 SITE OPERATIONS, PROCEDURAL CONTROLS,  
PRECAUTIONS AND INSPECTIONS
8.1	
Procedural Controls – Site Operations
Multiplicity of actions normally is required when Temporary Works are being erected and put into 
service. Such activities may be widely separated in time and place and it is, therefore, essential 
that lines of communication and responsibility are explicit and clearly defined and known to all 
those involved in the activity. A methodical approach should be adopted and adequate records 
should be maintained. Care should be taken that latest versions of approved drawings are 
available at site with all concerned.
Before being put to use for every construction cycle, the erected temporary structure is to be 
inspected to ensure that it is as per the final drawings. If any change in specifications or detail are 
noticed at any stage, the same are to be got approved from the designer. After the permanent 
structure gains required strength, the temporary structure can be permitted to be dismantled as 
per the specified sequence.
When not in use, components of the temporary structure are to be stored properly after necessary 
repairs and maintenance.
8.2

8.3	
Site Operations
The site operations are broadly divided into the operations of erection of falsework & formwork/
other temporary work, concreting/applications of loads and dismantling of formwork & falsework/
other temporary work.
Work on site should be subject to the careful direction, supervision and checks to ensure that 
the temporary structures are erected safely in accordance with the agreed design with materials 
of agreed quality, and the structure is first loaded only when all checks have proved satisfactory 
and then dismantled in accordance with an agreed sequence and procedure.
The required standards of workmanship shall be explained to all involved and specifically to the 
less experienced workmen who should also be made to realize the importance of this activity to 
achieve the required Quality. To ensure appropriate safety standards, an assessment of the risks 
Job Safety Analysis (JSA) shall be carried out by the contractor in conjunction with health and 
safety representatives of and/or workers of all agencies involved in the work.
Before starting any activity a comprehensive method statement should invariably be prepared 
and got approved. The entire team should be briefed about this statement. Constant emphasis 
should be laid upon attention to details.
8.3.1	
Erection of falsework/formwork/other temporary work
Following points require particular attention during erection and before loading:
	
i)	
Whether the assumed design loads and sequences are compatible with the 
actual conditions at site.
	
ii)	
The field practice follows the working drawings/instructions from the designer. 
Any changes found necessary shall be effected in consultation with all 
concerned.

bearing capacity and settlement characteristics.
	
v)	
Suitable precautions as necessary to guard against excessive storage of materials 
on a recently formed deck before it starts acting as self-supporting structure.
	
vi)	
Partially erected formwork is not left in place without proper support.
	
vii)	
Whether the wedges are of sufficient height to allow raising the forms to the 
required position. Wedges shall be used only at one end of a prop.
	
viii)	 For night construction, adequate, lighting facilities shall be provided. If electric 
wires are used these should be duly protected and insulated.
	
ix)	
All Construction equipments like cranes, hoists etc. shall only be operated by 
trained and experienced staff.

xii)	
Any rock outcrops, buried rocks or obstructions which are uncovered and not 
indicated on the drawings shall be reported to the designer as they can result in 
differential settlements.
Fig. 2 Foundation for falsework: Dos & Donts
	
xiii)	 All foundation members shall be set level.
	
xiv)	 Splicing of timber shall be done with the help of MS bolts and nuts.
	
xv)	 In respect of proprietary components, the manufacturer's recommendations 
shall be rigidly adhered to.
	
xvi)	 All the minor details, even of the smallest connections have been examined to 
be properly fastened. The thorough checking of work has been done and all 
precaution to achieve desired workmanship have been taken. It is possible that 
the omission of a bolt or ineffective fixing of securing devices or the failure to 
tighten up an item properly, may lead to local instability which might place the 
whole structure in jeopardy.
	
xvii)	 All bearing points and lifting points are identified.
	
xviii)	Inserts, void formers and cast-in fixings are properly positioned and secured. 
Props supporting formwork having out of plumb alignment and runners located 
eccentrically in prop heads seriously reduce their load carrying capacity even in 
proprietary systems.
	
	
Props shall be checked for verticality.
	
xix)	 Proprietary formwork support system shall specify safe working loads and factors 
of safety at specified tolerances. They shall indicate whether the information 
given is based on the yield or on the collapse value of the unit and whether the 
values given are based on calculations or actual tests. The recommended safe 
working loads shall not apply to any prop in defective condition or to any prop 
erected outside the specified tolerances. Factor of safety for the first use shall 
not be less than 2 (with capacity calculated based on yield stress) and may be 
increased suitably for subsequent use.
	
xx)	 Normal tolerances shall be such that no runner shall be placed with its centerline 
more than 25 mm eccentric to the center of the prop head or no prop shall be 
erected more than (1 in 40) out of plumb. In case any of the following defects, 
prop may be set aside, discarded or returned to workshops or deport for attention 
or scrap.

d)	
An incorrect or damaged connecting pin.
	
xxii)	 Where a shutter vibrator is used, a step down transformer shall be provided to 
lower the voltage for the safety of the workers.
8.3.2	
Placement of concrete/application of load
Points to be seen before and during concreting operations and the application of loads are as 
follows :
	
i)	
Whether proper permission to commence the placement of concrete has been 
accorded?
	
ii)	
Whether the reinforcement and falsework have been checked?
	
iii)	
Whether the forms are clean and free from wood-shavings, grit etc.?
	
iv)	
Whether release agent to form surface has been applied? This should be 
avoided for concrete surfaces to be plastered. On such surfaces whitewash 
is desirable. If release agent is applied it should be checked that this is not 
applied or splashed carelessly on the reinforcement or pre stressing tendon and 
anchorages.
	
v)	
Where camber has been provided, the free (top) surface of the concrete should 
never be finished flat but should also be cambered to the same extent as the 
form i.e. the thickness for any element shall be maintained.
	
vi)	
Whether all forms are water/slurry tight?
	
vii)	
Whether the sequence and rate of concreting, that is of placement is as per the 
design brief?
	
viii)	 Whether all precautions have been taken to prevent accidental impact and 
possibility of scouring/flooding of falsework foundations in case of river bridges?
	
ix)	
Whether adequate precautions have been taken to keep unnecessary materials 
away from the falsework?
	
x)	
Whether adequate access ramps etc. in the correct positions have been provided 
for the smooth flow of men, materials and machines?
	
xi)	
Whether the forms are in the correct position in space and adequately braced 
to remain there and the forms are dimensionally accurate to produce finished 
concrete of the required dimensions?
	
xii)	
The props and bracing shall be watched during the placement of concrete and 
the vibrations. Any members which may tend to get loose or wedges which get 
shifted should be attended to.
	
xiii)	 System of communication between the man in charge of formwork and the man 
in charge of concreting operations should be established so that concreting can 
be stopped instantly if at all it becomes necessary to do so.
	
xiv)	 Platforms for the movement of workers and mechanized concrete buggies (used 
in large works) shall be separated. It should not place load upon the reinforcing

IRC:87-2018
27
steel. If this is unavoidable, steel chairs shall be placed under the reinforcement 
at adequate spacing to prevent deformation of the reinforcement.
	
xv)	 Arrangements for field adjustments and constant inspections of forms, shores 
and foundations during placing of concrete both by supervising as well as 
construction agency to be ensured (to stop leaks, tightening wedges and clamps, 
to adjust shores and for timely action against disturbances,etc).
	
xvi)	 Adequate stand by equipment should be available.
	
xvii)	 During concreting operation some skilled/trained worker or supervisor should 
watch and observe centering to notice if there is any warning or indication of 
likely failures. In the event of such signs of distress prompt action should be 
taken to bring to the notice of Temporary Works Coordinator or Supervisor to 
address and rectify the causes immediately to prevent collapse.
8.3.3	
Removal/dismantling of formwork/falsework/other temporary work
	
i)	
The timing of formwork removal is a very important. For efficient use of formwork, 
it is important to have options that allow them to be removed as soon as possible 
without jeopardizing the structure's safety or damaging the edge of concrete 
surfaces. But not before the concrete has reached strength at least twice the 
strength to which the concrete may be subjected at the time of removal of 
formwork or as decided from design considerations. The strength referred to 
shall be that of concrete using the same cement and aggregates with the same 
proportions and cured under conditions of temperature and moisture similar to 
those existing on the work where possible. Proper precautions shall be taken to 
allow for the decrease in the rate of hardening of concrete occurring during cold 
weather.
	
ii)	
The dismantling plan prepared at the time of design or before the start of 
construction should be strictly followed.
	
iii)	
The procedure for Formwork removal for concrete wall, sides of beams and 
columns will also be controlled by the possibility of damaging the concrete while 
removing the forms and not simply by the concrete's capacity to withstands its 
own weight.
	
iv)	
All the factors, like temperature, age and admixtures used, that can affect concrete 
strength shall be considered for calculation of stripping time. For the formwork 
removal the stripping time can be determined by the use of any reasonable 
method. The number of props to be left under, their sizes and disposition shall 
be such as to be able to safely carry the full dead load of the slab, beam or arch, 
as the case may be, together with any live load likely to occur during curing or 
further construction.
	
v)	
Falsework shall be gradually and uniformly lowered in such a manner so as to 
avoid any shock or vibration or injurious stresses in any part of the structure.
	
vi)	
Immediately after removal of the formwork, the concrete shall be carefully 
inspected. Defects if any, shall be made good as soon as practicable.
	
vii)	
Where the side shutter also support the flange of the T-Beam, such shutter shall 
be removed only after the flange concrete attains sufficient maturity.
	
viii)	 For pre-stressed units, the vertical side forms shall be released as early as 



======================================================================
PAGE 36 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:87-2018
28
possible and the soffit forms shall permit without restraint deformation/ shortening 
of the member when pre-stress is applied. Form supports and soffit forms for 
cast-in-situ members shall not be removed until sufficient pre-stress has been 
applied to carry the dead load, any formwork supported by the member and 
anticipated construction loads.
8.4	
Inspections/Checks
All the activities related to the Formworks, Falsework or Temporary structures shall be properly 
inspected by the Temporary Works Coordinator or supervisory staff authorized by him, at different 
stages of work to insure that the work is being done properly and safely with all due precautions 
as enumerated above after checking the compliances with the help of Checklists.
The Temporary Works Coordinator should establish a plan to carry out inspection & checks of 
the temporary works from the drawings & information given by the designer. Generally formal 
inspections are required at following stages :
	
a)	
Before the start of work to check or confirm the site conditions, hydraulic and 
geotechnical conditions and other data related to erection of formwork.
	
b)	
Preparation of founding level for falsework.
	
c)	
When Falsework attains a height of 10 m or height equal to 1.5 times the 
minimum of plan dimensions.
	
d)	
When Falsework reaches its highest level.
	
e)	
At Intermediate stages, when the strength or stability of the falsework may have 
adverse effects by environmental or other loading conditions.
	
f)	
Immediately prior to loads being transferred.
	
g)	
After the concreting is completed.
	
h)	
During dismantling and immediately after removal of formworks.
	
i)	
Before storing and before reuse.
	
j)	
Immediately after any failure is reported.
Check list shall be prepared for different stages and operations as described above, in a tabular 
form and adopted for verification of erected/assembled temporary structures in the field. Typical 
format for a sample checklist is given in Appendix-2.
8.5

9 CAUSES OF FORMWORK FAILURES AND POST FAILURE INVESTIGATIONS
Some of the causes for failures have been observed as follows:
9.1	
Inadequate Bracing Leading to Instability
	
a)	
The more frequent causes of formwork failure are the effects that induce lateral 
force components or displacement of supporting members.
	
	
Inadequate cross bracing/diagonal bracing and horizontal bracing of shores is 
one of the factors most frequently involved in formwork accidents.
	
b)	
High shoring with heavy load at the top is vulnerable to eccentric or lateral 
loading. Diagonal bracing improves the stability of such a structure.
	
c)	
When a failure occurs at one part, inadequate bracing may permit the collapse 
to extend to a large portion of the structure and multiply the damage.Adequate 
bracing will prevent a minor accident or failure from becoming a disaster.
9.2	
Vibrations
Forms sometimes collapse when their supporting shores, wedges or jacks are displaced by 
vibration caused by:
	
•	
Passing traffic
	
•	
Movement of workers and equipment on the formwork
	
•	
The effect of vibrating concrete to consolidate it
	
•	
Diagonal bracing can help prevent failure due to vibration
9.3	
Vertical Members Not in Plumb
Vertical members must be set plumb to avoid eccentric loading which may lead to failure.
9.4	
Unstable Soil Under Mudsills, Undermining or Scouring Under Supports
Formwork should be safe if it is adequately braced and constructed so that all loads are carried 
to solid ground through vertical members. The ground must be able to carry the load without 
permissible settlements.



======================================================================
PAGE 40 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:87-2018

Shores and mudsills must not rest on uncompacted ground; moisture and heat from the concreting 
operations, or changing air temperatures, may thaw the soil and allow settlement that overloads 
or shifts the formwork.
Site drainage must be adequate to prevent a washout of soil supporting the mudsills.
9.5	
Inadequate Control of Concrete Placement
The temperature and rate of increase in height of concrete are factors influencing the development 
of lateral pressures that act on the forms.
If temperature drops during construction operations, rate of concreting often has to be slowed 
down to prevent a build up of lateral pressure overloading the forms. If this is not done, formwork 
failure may result.
Failure to regulate properly the rate and order of placing concrete on horizontal surfaces may 
produce unbalanced loadings and consequent failures of formwork.
9.6	
Lack of Attention to Formwork Details
9.7	
Improper Stripping and Shore Removal
Premature stripping of forms, premature removal of shores, and careless practices in 
re-shoring can cause failures.
9.8	
There are some other Causes which can Cause Failure :
	
i)	
External causes like earthquake tremor, untimely floods and hailstorm etc.
	
ii)	
Defective centering structures and joints
	
iii)	
Unsuitable foundation support like earthen embankment
	
iv)	
Subsoil flow in sandy bed
	
v)	
Wrong sequence of construction or unbalanced horizontal forces as in arches
9.9	
Post-Failure Investigations
The purpose of the false work failure investigation is to determine the reasons for failure and 
to collect data and carryout analysis to provide suggestions on preventing its recurrence. The 
following steps may be followed :
i)	
The failure site should be inspected immediately by the Temporary Works 
Coordinator or his authorized representative to ascertain by visual methods the 
probable cause of failure, such as, hydraulic, geotechnical, improper materials, 
design deficiency, erection or construction faults or supervision negligence etc.
ii)	
The area should be cordoned off and all safety precautions be taken immediately, so 
that, no further damage is done.
iii)	
An investigating team should be constituted to look into the matter which should 
preferably consist of a representative from design, supervision staff for the work and 
from the overall project management staff.

iv)	
The team should collect all the relevant data, consult records and drawings etc., 
take photographs, collect samples, test and investigate as may be necessary for 
the purpose and prepare the report giving detailed findings, lessons learnt, further 
precautions to be taken and preventive or remedial measures to be adopted.
10 SPECIAL FORMWORKS
10.1	
Slipforms
10.1.1	
General
Slipforms can be used for vertical structures, such as tall piers and wells etc. These forms are 
usually moved by jacks riding on steel rods or pipes embedded in or attached to the hardened 
concrete. The movement of forms may be continuous process until the structure is completed or 
in a phased sequence of finite placements. 
Slipforms shall be designed, constructed and the sliding operations carried out under the 
supervision of persons experienced in slipform work.
Jacking rods or pipes may be left in place or withdrawn as conditions permit.
The design of the yokes must provide for adequate clearance to install horizontal reinforcing 
bars and embedments.
Forms shall be of about one meter height and may be of timber, plywood or steel. Special care must 
be taken in building the forms and arranging the jacks so that the forms will draw straight without twist.
Forms shall be constructed with a slight batter so that they will be self-clearing as they slide. A 
range of 6 mm to 8 mm in a height of 1 m of form is indicative of current practice.
10.1.2	
Sliding operations
The sliding speed is determined by the rate of setting and hardening of the freshly placed 
concrete, the rate at which the concrete can be supplied, placed and compacted, and the rate at 
which reinforcement steel can be supplied and fixed. When using ordinary Portland cement, the 
average sliding speed is in the range of 150 mm - 300 mm per hour.
Alignment and plumbness of the structure shall be checked at the beginning and at least once 
in eight hours of operation.
10.2	
Travelling Forms
10.2.1	
Travelling forms consist of formwork mounted on moveable frames or scaffolding 
called travellers. After the purpose of the formwork is served at one section of the structure, the 
forms are released and moved along the structure to the next section to be concreted.
10.2.2	
Travelling forms are suitable for many types of bridges particularly where a number of 
repetitions are involved. These forms can be used both for members of constant cross-section 
and variable cross-section.
10.2.3	
Each set of forms and travellers shall be designed for the particular job. Forms are 
attached to the traveller mounted on wheels, skids, etc. Jacks are generally used for deshuttering 
and for adjustment to profile at the next section.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:87-2018
34
10.2.4	
Travelling cantilever formwork for cantilever bridges is a particular example of use of 
travelling forms for bridge deck construction. Such formworks, because of their importance and 
large loads involved, are designed with the same care as that for a permanent structure.
10.2.5	
Cantilever formwork eliminates falsework all together. The deck is constructed as a 
series of segments progressively cantilevering out of the pier. The forms are suspended from a 
structural frame anchored to the already concreted segment of the deck and cantilevering out to 
sustain the forms for the next segment.
10.2.6	
The cantilever forms shall be so arranged as to facilitate continuous concreting of the 
entire segment in one operation. Necessary provision shall be made to enable adjustments in 
profile to cater to the camber requirements of the bridge deck.
10.3	
Caissons
10.3.1	
General
The terminology “Caisson” used here is purely for the temporary enabling structure required for 
constructing the permanent foundation.
Caisson is a hollow structure generally fabricated of structural steel but can also be constructed 
in concrete or a combination of both. It has dimensions of the permanent foundation like well and 
it remains in position. The dimensions may be suitably increased for open foundation. Though, 
it often forms part of permanent structure but is not accounted for in strength evaluation of the 
structure. It is a hollow watertight retaining structure used for under water construction work. It 
also facilitates construction of foundations in or near a body of water. Use of caisson facilitates 
construction at sites with either site constraints or poor soil conditions. 
It is generally circular but may be rectangular, elliptical or any other shape. Large caissons are 
generally cellular. Sketch of typical circular cellular caisson is shown in Fig. 1.

======================================================================
IRC:87-2018
35
The purpose of using a caisson in construction is to provide a temporary structure from which 
earth, water and other materials can be removed and into which concrete or some other fill 
material can be placed as per the design requirements.
It is fabricated on the shore or bank or on floating barge, and then lowered in water either by sliding 
(see typical details in Fig. 2) or by lifting (Fig. 3). It is then towed to the location of foundation and 
sunk with ballast added at its final location. Ballast can be part of permanent concrete in part or 
full depending on requirements of final stability. For temporary ballasting, water can also be used.

10.3.2	
Types of Caisson:
There are three types of caissons such as: a) Open Caisson b) Pneumatic or Compressed-air 
Caisson c) Box Caisson. For bridges only type `a’ and type `b’ are used. Description of the said 
types of Caisson is given below:
	
a)	
Open Caisson:
	
	
It is open both at top and bottom, of size and shape to suit the foundation and 
fitted with a cutting edge around the bottom which facilitates sinking through 
soil while excavation is carried out inside the caisson by excavators or grab 
buckets or water jet pumps. As excavation proceeds, the caisson sinks and 
additional sections are added to the shaft above. This process is continued until 
the caisson has sunk to the required depth. Then bottom is plugged by generally 
pouring concrete below the water by using `tremie’/skip buckets. After plugging 
the bottom, further construction work inside can be carried out in conventional 
manner as per requirement.
	
b)	
Pneumatic or Compressed-air Caisson:
	
	
It is similar to an open caisson except that it is provided with airtight bulkhead 
so that the inner cavity formed can be made dry by filling it with compressed air. 
Pneumatic caisson is usually employed in riverbed work to aid sinking in rocky 
stratum or removing obstructions or where quicksand condition is present. The 
steining joints shall be airtight and steel liners on inner face may be provided to 
make Caisson airtight. 
	
	
The air in the space beneath the bulkhead called the working chamber is kept 
under pressure to the extent necessary to control the inflow of soil and water 
and keep the bed dry. The shafts/openings through the bulkhead permit the 
passage of men, equipment and excavated material between the bottom and 
the surface. Thus, the excavation can be performed by workmen operating in 
the working chamber at the bottom of the caisson under water-free condition.
	
c)	
Box Caisson: It is similar to Open Caisson except that it is closed at bottom.
10.3.3	
Potential Difficulties:
	
Potential difficulties include:
	
a)	
Keeping the structure vertical as it sinks into place. In case of deviations from 
verticality, corrective measures are taken such as removing the soil from 
underneath on one side or applying extra loading from top eccentrically.
	
b)	
The ability to advance the structure to its desired elevation and stop it once the 
correct elevation is achieved
	
c)	
Ability to provide a watertight structure
	
d)	
In case of Pneumatic Caisson, `decompression sickness’ (also called bends or 
caisson disease) which is a physiological effect of the formation of gas bubbles 
in the body because of rapid transition from a high-pressure environment to one 
of lower pressure. Generally the workers work in shifts of one hour. Services of 
a doctor shall be always available at site when pneumatic sinking is done.
	
	
Relief from `decompression sickness’ can usually be achieved only by 
recompression in a hyperbaric chamber followed by gradual decompression. 
But this process is not always able to reverse damage to tissues.



======================================================================
PAGE 45 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:87-2018
37
	
	
Caisson workers are highly susceptible to the sickness because their activities 
subject them to pressures different from the normal atmospheric pressure 
experienced on land. At atmospheric pressure, the body tissues contain, in 
solution, small amounts of gases that are present in the air. In case of pneumatic 
caisson the workers in working chamber are subject to breathing compressed air 
with the possibility of problems similar to sudden decompression. (see Note *1)
10.3.4	
Design Considerations:
	
a)	
While designing the caissons a detailed study for the various stages of 
construction shall be carried out (see details of stages in Fig. 4 & Table 1).
	
	
The height of caisson and concrete inside the caisson at any given time shall be 
such that the metacenter (M) is above the centre of gravity (G) by about 1 meter.
	
b)	
The first stage construction for open caisson is very critical as the triangular 
shaped curb reduces the stability as CG is at a higher level and hence this stage 
shall be planned for required height with appropriate stability measures till the 
time the centre of gravity is lowered by concreting of the structure. additional 
safety measures for maintaining stability against overturning shall be provided 
during initial stages.
	
c)	
Height of caisson shall also be planned to ensure that at any given time, at least 
one meter of the shell shall be above water level/high tide level while floating as 
well as after initial grounding. 
	
d)	
In sandy/soft stratum especially with strong water current, the bed is likely to 
scour locally when the caisson nears the bed and even after grounding has taken 
place. Proper investigation shall be made before design to assess appropriate 
additional height of caissons necessary for this condition.
	
	
Simultaneous sinking and concreting may be required to keep the centre of 
gravity close to the bed to prevent caisson from tilting.
	
e)	
The caisson shell shall be designed for water pressure from differential 
head, water current forces, wet concrete pressure etc. to which it is likely to 
be subjected to (see Fig. 5). The minimum thickness of plate used shall be 4 
mm for external face and 3 mm for internal face. The plates shall be stiffened 
using suitable structural elements. Bracings both in transverse and vertical 
directions shall be provided between outer and inner shells. Diagonal bracings 
shall be provided as necessary. Adequate rigidity of the framing structure shall 
be ensured by providing bracings with due consideration to slenderness ratio. 
Generally slenderness ratio shall not be more than 100. For framing, a minimum 
element of 50 x 50 x 6 mm angle or equivalent is recommended. In case of 
severe corrosion, the adequacy of structure shall be rechecked.
	
f)	
Anchorage points and any other locations where concentrated loads are 
expected, shall be locally strengthened suitably by providing a thicker plate or 
increased bearing area or like measures.
	
g)	
All joints shall be continuously welded and shall be leak proof. The joints of shell shall 
preferably be located at the face of stiffeners so that proper welding is achieved. In 
critical locations where no stiffener support is available, providing and welding of 75 
mm wide, 3 mm thick cover plate along the length of joint is recommended.

h)	
The anchorage of caisson shall be designed for the maximum water current 
and wave effects expected with minimum factor of safety of 3. Minimum water 
current of 1m/sec shall be considered. In rivers where water flow is unidirectional, 
designed anchorage shall be provided on upstream side and lower capacity 
anchors to keep the caisson just in position can be provided on downstream side. 
In tidal rivers/creeks, anchors in both directions shall be of designed capacity.

Table 3 Typical format for calculation of Water Head on Caisson at various stages
10.3.5	
Precautions:
	
a)	
The fabricated caisson structure shall be checked against leakage at joint 
locations before floating.
	
b)	
Stability of caissons shall be ensured for all operational conditions such as during 
sliding into water, in floating condition, transportation and lowering in position. 
The centre of gravity shall always be close to the bed after grounding.
	
c)	
The structure shall be held in position against untoward movement by wire 
ropes/chains etc, using winches mounted on stationary suitable platforms/buoys 
or similar anchoring systems. Anchoring in minimum three directions shall be 
provided to prevent non-acceptable longitudinal and lateral movement.
	
d)	
The system shall permit a small movement until the stage when the foundation is 
just getting grounded. Special care is necessary where variation in water level is 
frequent such as in tidal zones to prevent re-floatation of the grounded caisson 
during subsequent high tide.
	
e)	
A dewatering pump of adequate capacity shall be provided at caisson location 
for dewatering due to any leakage.
	
f)	
The anchorage ropes shall have adequate slackness to allow vertical movement 
of shell in tidal zones till grounding operations.

g)	
Delay in grounding when very close to bed can lead to heavy local scour. This 
will require additional heights of caisson shell to be added.
NOTE *1:
	
It is generally said that the air compression limit permissible for man’s safe operation is at around 
0.392 MPa or 4kgf/cm2. Physical disorders like nitrogen narcosis, oxygen toxics, respiratory 
distress etc. appear as air compression increases. The bends or caisson disease tends to occur 
at the stage when human body undergoes change from decompression to atmospheric pressure. 
In an effort to prevent occurrence of such a physical disorder, a helium gas mixed air respiratory 
system has been developed. This system provides the worker with safe working environment 
even in higher compressed air when Caisson is sunk to deeper position. In this system, excessive 
amount of nitrogen and oxygen causing physical disorder are replaced as much with helium gas. 
This theory was adopted in the Pneumatic Caisson for the first time in Japan.
10.4	
Construction Barges
10.4.1	
General
This clause is limited to dumb barges used in construction of bridges. Barge is a flat bottom 
single deck floating vessel rectangular in plan with generally vertical sides and its bow and stern 
may or may not be raked. Its flat bottom shape permits its use in low water depth conditions. 
Construction barges are generally dumb barges and towed by tugboats for their movement. 
Barges may also be formed by assembling modular barge units which can be transported by 
road from one site to another. 
10.4.2	
Barge Types and Applications
	
a)	
Deck Barge
	
	
Deck barges carry cargo on their deck. They differ in size and structural design 
depending on their intending use. They are generally used for construction 
activities in rivers, lakes, inland water bodies, shallow sea-bed etc. and used 
for transporting men, materials and equipment to work sites in water. Cargos 
can be pipes, piles, fabricated structures, construction materials, construction 
equipment, cranes, transit mixers, batching plants, welding machines, DG sets, 
compressors etc.
	
b)	
Spud Barge
	
	
Spud barge is a deck barge which can be moored by providing through-deck pilings 
known as spuds to anchor it in place to provide a stable and fixed work platform 
in water. Spud barges are used for specific applications like pile driving, drilling for 
geotechnical investigations, mounting cranes to enhance their lifting capacity etc.
	
c)	
Other Types of Barges
	
	
Other types of barges are crane barges which carry floating cranes, clamshells 
or draglines, hopper barges with openable bottom for transporting and dumping 
dredged material, pontoon barges for supporting temporary floating bridges, etc. 
Catamaran barges having two or more connected hulls to increase its base 
width are generally used to support heavy lift floating cranes.
10.4.3	
Barges Supporting Cranes/Lifting Devices
Barges used for mounting crane/derrick etc. should have structurally sound deck members 
designed to withstand the static and dynamic loads of the crane operating at its maximum rated 



======================================================================
PAGE 49 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:87-2018
41
capacity with all other co-existent loads. It should be ensured that the rated capacity of the crane 
including load charts etc. applicable for use on land is reduced to account for actions when using 
the same under floating conditions and that the entire deck surface of barge remains above 
water and entire bottom area of the barge remains submerged. For cranes secured to barge 
deck and having rated capacity up to 50 tons, angle of list (longitudinal tilt) and trim (transverse 
tilt) should generally be not more than 5 degrees or as specified by the crane manufacturer or 
by a qualified Naval Architect. When using load charts designed or corrected for barge mounted 
cranes, assumed dynamic and environmental parameters considered in their design shall be 
specified for use by crane operator. The rated capacity of such cranes shall be decided by a 
qualified person having expertise with respect to crane/derrick capacity operating on land and 
the stability of floating vessels. Permitted area for positioning, travel, and operation of the crane 
should be marked on barge deck for identification by the user and crane should be secured by 
suitable means to prevent its movement during operation.
10.4.4	
Barge Registration
Construction barges used in channels where inland transporartion takes place and those used 
in open sea are required to be certified by Indian Register of Shipping (IRS).
10.4.5	
Safety Requirements
Barges, whether newly constructed or used shall be inspected for any leakage or structural 
soundness before they are put to use. Barges shall be fitted with lights, sound signaling appliances, 
signage etc. in accordance with the regulations for preventing collisions in navigation waterways. 
They shall be equipped with life-saving appliances such as fire extinguishers, ring life-buoys, life-
jackets for the crew, rescue boats, walkie-talkie etc. To prevent fall from the barge deck, railing 
shall be installed along the edge of the barge if it does not affect its functioning. Alternately, edge 
of the barge along perimeter should be painted with contrasting color. All walkways, gangways 
and access ladders should be kept clean, dry, free of equipment and obstructing materials. Any 
oil spills must be cleaned immediately. Access ramps should be secured during loading and 
offloading operations.
For barges having winches operating at deck level, winch drum may be enclosed in a cage if 
possible. Workmen should be instructed not to stand over, on or in line with winch cables when 
they are under tension. The danger zone lies within 15 degrees of either side of a cable under 
tension. Winch system should be inspected regularly for general deterioration and structural, 
mechanical, or electrical deficiencies. 
Barges shall have a main towing arrangement and a spare towing arrangement of sufficient 
strength ready for use at all times. The spare towing arrangement shall be such that it is possible 
to establish a new towing connection quickly.
10.5	
Precasting Arrangements for Precast Segmental Construction
10.5.1	
Casting Yards:
The main requirements for a casting yard set up for precast segmental construction include:
	
i)	
Storage and handling arrangements for materials like cement, aggregates, 
sand, reinforcement, inserts for post-tensioning systems, etc.



======================================================================
PAGE 50 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:87-2018
42
	
ii)	
Batching plant for concrete production.
	
iii)	
Reinforcement cage assembly areas, jigs and templates.
	
iv)	
Shortline/longline casting beds for various types of segments.
	
v)	
Inspection/repair bay for precast segments.
	
vi)	
Control stations for survey towers for geometry control.
	
vii)	
Curing arrangements (steam /sprinklers, etc.).
	
viii)	 Segment lifting and handling equipment like goliath gantries/straddle carriers, etc.
	
ix)	
Stacking arrangements for precast segments including loading arrangements 
on to trailers for transporting to actual site.
	
x)	
Quality control laboratory, offices, etc.
The size and layout of casting yard largely depends on access/egress points, number and types 
of casting beds, number of segments required to be stacked as per construction plan, etc.
10.5.2	
Types of casting beds
Casting beds for segments are basically of two types: Shortline & longline.
10.5.2.1	
Longline casting bed
In this method all the segments in a span are cast on a fixed bed in their correct relative position 
as per design geometrical alignment with formwork moving along the bed for successive casting 
operations. The profile of the bed replicates the final bridge deck profile with allowance for 
camber. (Figs. 8 & 10).
Fig. 9 shows formwork positions for successive operations. Pier segments can be cast in a 
separate bed and brought to the bed for remaining span.
The main advantage of this method is that the entire span is set out in the bed and it is easy 
to control the deck geometry. Disadvantage is that it takes large space. For a curved deck with 
super-elevation, the soffit formwork must have necessary arrangements to adjust the geometry. 
(Fig. 10).

Fig. 10 Schematic Cross-Section of a Longline Bed (Curved Span with Superelevation)
10.5.2.2	
Shortline casting bed
In this method, all segments in a span are cast in the same place using stationary formwork. The 
previously cast segment is positioned so as to obtain a match-cast joint. After initial curing, the 
previously cast segment is moved to stacking area and the freshly cast segment is moved in its 
place for casting the next segment.
The main advantage of this method is that it requires relatively small space. The formwork and 
mobility of equipment associated with casting is limited to a smaller area. The main disadvantage 



======================================================================
PAGE 52 of 100
======================================================================
IRC:87-2018
44
is that achieving the correct deck geometry depends on accurate adjustment of the match-casting 
segment. This requires precise survey and control procedure. A geometry control software is 
used for computing the position of match-casting segment required based on the survey data for 
previous segments.

Fig. 12 Schematic Longitudinal Section of a Shortline Bed
10.5.2.3	
Requirements for formwork & casting bed
	
i)	
Foundation for the casting bed should be designed to carry all the expected 
loads safely without undesirable settlement. Soil stabilization may be necessary 
in case of weak soils.
	
ii)	
Formwork for the casting bed should be rigid enough to achieve the close 
dimensional tolerances necessary for precast segmental construction as 
specified in IRC:SP 65 “Guidelines for Design & Construction of segmental 
bridges”. There should be no undesirable deformations of the formwork during 
various operations. The dimensional tolerances directly affect the alignment and 
shape of deck and any deviations can lead to serious problems during erection 
at site.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:87-2018
45
	
iii)	
As the forms are expected to reuse multiple times, the should be sturdy, easy to 
strip and handle.
	
iv)	
Formwork joints, particularly junctions of sheathing, should be properly sealed 
using a flexible sealing material to prevent cement slurry leakage.
	
v)	
Forms should be designed so as accommodate slight differences in dimensions 
due to camber, curvature and rotation for super-elevation, etc.
	
vi)	
It should be possible to fix inserts like anchorages, sheathing, block-outs so that 
their position is not disturbed during concreting. The fixing arrangements used 
for inserts should not interfere with stripping of forms.
	
vii)	
If external vibrators are expected to be used, their positions should be finalized 
and provisions made in the form for attachment & replacement.
	
viii)	 If flexible sheathing is being used, it is necessary to use suitable arrangement 
like inflatable rubber tubes placed inside the sheathing during concreting 
operations.
11 SAFETY, HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION
11.1	
A comprehensive Safety, Health and Environment Management Guide/Manual should 
be prepared at all construction sites and be a part of the Contract Documents.
This should define the principal requirements of the Safety, Health and Environment.
Management associated with the Employer, Contractor/Sub-Contractor and any other agency to 
be practiced at construction worksites at all time to ensure that adequate precautions are taken 
to avoid accidents, occupational illness and harmful effects on environment during construction.
11.2	
The document should cover all the requirements and compliance of the Local and 
National Acts and Regulations on these aspects and ensure conformity to the guidelines 
given in OHSAS1 8001 - Occupational Health and Safety Management System and 
ISO 14001 - Environmental Management Systems.
11.3	
Major part of safety concerns at any construction site is related to the preparation, 
erection, dismantling, launching, lifting, floating equipments etc. for formwork, false work and also 
the temporary structures. The Safety, Health and Environment Guide/Manual should adequately 
address all the issues related to them.
11.4	
All and adequate measures should be taken for safe and sound construction. To 
ensure safety sufficient precautions should be taken, all investigations be done thoroughly, 
design and erection and dismantling should be as per design brief, all systems and procedures 
should be tested and calibrated, and all regulations should be strictly followed.
11.5	
A system of conducting Safety, Health and Environment inspections and other risk 
management analysis on a periodical basis will be evolved and administered. All required Safety 
Inspection Check lists for all activities, operations and equipment conforming to Indian Standards, 
Rules and Regulations and Employer's requirements, shall be prepared and implemented.
11.6	
In India Safety and Health aspects at work or during construction are not adequately 
regulated by any Rules or Acts as in some other Countries. There is need to identify the scope of 
such acts to cover all the Safety and Health aspects by regulatory Acts through legislation so that

Annexure – G
Working Stress Design 
(Based on IRC:24-2010)
G1 General
In this method structural members are designed so that the unit stress caused by the design 
loads does not exceed a pre-defined permissible stress. The permissible stress is defined as 
the yield stress multiplied by a factor of safety. This factor of safety caters for the uncertainties in 
loads, material strength, behaviour of the structure, corrosion, fatigue etc.
In the working stress method, apart from structural strength, serviceability requirements such as 
deflection, etc. also need to be considered and properly checked.

refer to Clause 202.1 of IRC:6.
G2.1.2	
Other effects
G2.1..2.1	 Secondary Effects (Fs) shall include, where applicable, the effects due to creep and 
shrinkage of concrete for composite deck and warping for box girder sections.
G2.1.2.2	 Erection effects shall include the loads and forces arising out of construction equipment 
and the effects of wind/seismic.
G2.2	
Permissible Increase in Stress

stress σ e,cal calculated in Clause G2.6.4.1 above shall not exceed 92 percent of yield stress fy.
G2.7	
Stress Analysis
G2.7.1	
General
The global analysis of the structure should be done using an elastic method. For structures 
in which the load effects are not proportional to the loads and/or the secondary effects due 
to deformation are significant, the method of analysis should be suitable for treatment of 
non-linear behaviour.
G2.7.2	
Sectional Properties
The sectional properties to be used in global analysis should generally be calculated for the 
gross section assuming the specified sizes. For beams or trusses on flexible supports, account 
should however be taken of its influence of shear lag on their stiffenesses. The effect of shear lag 
should also be taken into account in analysis of conditions during erection of continuous girders 
of box construction or with integral decks.
G2.7.3	
Longitudinal Stresses in beams
The distribution of longitudinal stress between the flanges and web or webs of a beam may 
be calculated on the assumption that plane section remains plane, but using effective widths 
of the flanges and the effective thickness of a deep web in accordance with the provisions of 
Clause G4, no further account need be taken of deformation of the plate out of its plane.
G2.7.4	
Shear Stress
The design values of shear stress in webs of rolled or fabricated I, box or channel sections may 
be calculated in accordance with the provisions of Clause G4. Shear stresses in other sections 
should be computed from the whole cross-section having regard to the distribution of flexural 
stress across the section.
G2.8	
Stresses
G2.8.1	
Primary Stresses
In the design of triangulated structures, axial stresses in members are usually calculated on the 
assumption that: 
	
-	
all members are straight and free to rotate at the joints;
	
-	
all joints lie at the intersection of the centroidal axes of the members
	
-	
all loads, including the weight of the members, are applied at the joints.
These stresses are defined as primary stresses.

======================================================================
IRC:87-2018
58
G2.8.2	
Secondery Stresses
In practice these assumptions are not realised and consequently members are subjected not 
only to axial stress but also to bending and shear stresses. These stresses are defined as 
secondary stresses and fall into two groups:
	
i)	
Stresses which are the result of eccentricity of connections and off-joint loading 
generally (i.e. loads rolling directly on chords, self weight of member and wind 
loads on member).
	
ii)	
Stresses which are the result of the elastic deformation of the structure and the 
rigidity of the joints. These are known as deformation stresses.
G2.8.2.1	 Structures shall be designed, fabricated and erected in such a manner as to minimize, 
as far as possible, secondary stresses.
G2.8.2.2	 Secondary stresses which are the result of eccentricity of connections and of off-joint 
loading [under Clause G2.8.2 (i) above], shall be computed and combined with the coexistent 
axial stresses in accordance with appropriate clause, but secondary stress due to the self weight 
and wind on the member shall be ignored in this case.
NOTE: In computing the secondary stress due to loads being carried direct by a chord, the chord may be 
assumed to be a continuous girder supported at the panel points, the resulting bending moments, 
both at the centre and at the supports being taken as equal to 3/4 of the maximum bending moment 
in a simply supported beam of span equal to the panel length. Where desired, calculations may be 
made and the calculated bending moments may be taken. In computing such bending moments,

section with the neutral axis taken at the centroid of that section. In computing the maximum 
stresses, the stresses calculated on this basis shall be increased in the ratio of the gross to 
the effective area of the flange section. For this purpose the flange sectional area in riveted or 
bolted construction shall be taken-to be that of the flange plates, flange angles and the portion 
of the web and side plates, if any, between the flange angles. In welded construction, the flange 
sectional area shall be taken to be that of flange plates and of the tongue plates (i.e. the thick 
vertical plates connecting flange to web) if any, upto a depth of the tongue plate equal to eight 
times its thickness, which shall not be less than twice that of the web.

G4.3.3	
In riveted or bolted construction, flange angles shall form as large a part of the area of 
the flange as practicable (preferably not less than 1/3) and the number of flange plates shall be 
kept to a minimum. Where flange plates are used, they shall preferably of equal thickness and 
at least one plate of the top flange shall extend the full length of the girder, unless the top edge 
of the web is finished flush with the flange angles.

G4.7.2	
Average Shear Stress
The average shear stress in a member calculated on the cross section of the web shall not 
exceed the maximum permissible average shear stress τva as follows:-
	
a)	
For unstiffened webs: appropriate permissible stress in Table G.2
	
b)	
For stiffened webs: the values given in Tables G.9, G.10 and G.11 as appropriate 
yield stress values 250, 340 and 400 MPa respectively.
NOTE :The allowable stresses given in Tables G.9, G.10 and G.11 apply provided any reduction of the 
web cross-section is due only to rivet/bolt holes etc. where large apertures are cut in the web, a 
special analysis shall be made to ensure that the maximum permissible average shear stresses 
laid down in this standard are not exceeded.
G4.8	
Curtailment of Flange Plates
Each flange plate shall be extended beyond its theoretical cut-off point adequately. The extension 
shall contain sufficient rivets, bolts and welds to withstand the forces developed at the theoretical 
cut off point.
In welded construction, the use of curtailed flange plates shall be avoided as far as possible, 
local strengthening being provided by other means such as inserting by butt welding a thicker 
and or wider plate. The heavier section plate shall be suitably tapered to the lighter plate. If, in 
welded construction the use of curtailed flange plates cannot be avoided, the end of the plate 
shall be tapered in plan to a rounded end and all welds shall be continuous round the ends.
G4.9	
Connection of Flanges to Web
The flanges of plate girders shall be connected to the web by sufficient rivets, bolts or welds to 
transmit the horizontal shear force combined with any vertical loads which are directly applied 
to the flange. In welded construction, where the web is in close contact with the flange before 
welding, vertical loads causing compression may be deemed to be resisted by the bearing 
between the flange and the web.
G4.10	
Dispersion of Load through Flange to Web
Where a load is directly applied to a flange, it shall be considered as dispersed uniformly through 
the flange and the web at an angle of 45º.

g)	
The load bearing stiffeners shall be provided with sufficient rivets, bolts or welds 
to transmit to the web the whole of the load in the stiffeners.

transverse stiffeners shall be provided throughout the length of the girder. When the thickness 
of the web is less than the limits specified in Clause 509.6(b) of IRC:24, longitudinal stiffeners 
shall be provided in addition to the transverse stiffeners.
In no case shall the greater unsupported clear dimension of a web panel exceed 270 t nor the 
lesser unsupported clear dimension of the same panel exceed 180 t where t is the thickness of

them or connected to them.
G4.11.2.4	External forces on intermediate stiffeners
When vertical intermediate stiffeners are subject to bending moments and shears due to the 
eccentricity of vertical loads, or the action of transverse forces, the moment of inertia I of the 
stiffeners specified in Clause G4.11.2.2 shall be increased as follows :
	
a)	
Bending moment on stiffener due to eccentricity of vertical loading with respect 
to the vertical axis of the web :
	
	
Increase of I = (1.5 M D2)/(E t)

G5.2.2.4.1 Secondary stiffeners (considering cantilever) are designed for load equal to qs2= PF 
* l2 and checked for bending and shear stress.
G5.2.2.5	 Welded and riveted connections are designed to transfer the loads coming on 
stiffeners to main member and also to connect base plate with stiffeners.
G5.2.2.6	 In case of heavy load transfer from member to the base plate, machining of contact 
surface between base plate and member is recommended and the area of the base plate shall 
be sufficient to limit the stress in bearing for whole of the load. In such cases the weld or rivet 
connecting base plate with stiffeners and main member should be designed for 25 percent of 
total load coming on base plate (for resisting the unforeseen bending and shear) which should 
be resisted by total weld length or all rivets.
G5.2.2.7	 Base plate for eccentrically loaded members - Action due to bending moment in base 
plate along with compression causes non uniform pressure on the foundation and value of max. 
and min. pressure can be computed as under:
Where B&L are width and length of base plate. Mx and My are moments in the length and width 
direction of base plate respectively.
G5.2.2.8	 Thickness of base plate is computed as per Clauses G5.2.2.3.1 to G5.2.2.3.4 and 
bending moment is calculated based on maximum pressure acting on each area in which base 
plate is divided, neglecting non-uniform pressure from foundation on base plate on conservative 
side.
G5.2.2.9	 Elements of base plate main and secondary stiffeners are designed as per Clauses 
G5.2.2.4 and G5.2.2.4.1.

uniformly to the member/stanchion.
G5.3.1	
The thickness of cap plate should be preferably 16-25 mm and stiffener’s thickness 
should not be less than
G5.3.1.2	 When the load from beam is transferred to stanchion member through bearing 
stiffeners extended beyond the beam, the cap plate serves as media to transmit this load to the 
stiffeners connected to web of stanchion/member, or to tie beam for lattice member by rivet or

radius of gyration.
G7.2.4.3	 For single angle discontinuous struts intersected by, and effectively connected to 
another angle in cross bracing, the effective length in the plane of bracings shall be taken as 
in Table G.13 and normal to the plane of bracing the effective lengths shall be taken as the 
distance along the bracing members between the points of intersection and the centroids of the

span of the truss, taken as the horizontal deflection. This deflection shall be computed 
assuming that the cross member is free to deflect vertically and that the tangent to 
the deflection curve at the centre of its span remains parallel to the neutral axis of the 
unrestrained cross member
When δ is not greater than a3/(40EI)
