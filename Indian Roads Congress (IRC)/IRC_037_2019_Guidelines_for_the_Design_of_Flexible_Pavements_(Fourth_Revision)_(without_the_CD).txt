GUIDELINES FOR THE DESIGN OF FLEXIBLE PAVEMENTS
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1	
The first guidelines for the design of flexible pavements, published in 1970, were 
based on (i) subgrade (foundation) strength (California Bearing Ratio) and (ii) traffic, in terms 
of number of commercial vehicles (having a laden weight of 3 tonnes or more) per day. These 
guidelines were revised in 1984 considering the design traffic in terms of cumulative number 
of equivalent standard axle load of 80 kN and design charts were provided for design traffic 
volumes up to 30 million standard axle (msa) repetitions. The 1970 and 1984 versions of the 
guidelines were based on empirical (experience based) approach.
1.2	
The second revision was carried out in 2001 [1] using semi-mechanistic (or mechanistic-
empirical) approach based on the results available from R-6[2], R-56[3] and other research 
schemes of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH). The mechanistic-empirical 
performance models for subgrade rutting and bottom-up cracking in the bottom bituminous 
layer, developed using the results of these research schemes, were used for the design of 
flexible pavements. FPAVE software, developed for R-56 research scheme for the analysis of 
linear elastic layered pavement systems, was used for the analysis of pavements and for the 
development of thickness design charts. Thickness charts were provided for design traffic levels 
up to 150 msa. 
1.3	
The third revision of the guidelines was carried out in 2012[4] to facilitate (i) design 
of bituminous pavements for traffic volumes more than 150 msa (ii) utilization of new types of 
pavement materials such as bituminous mixes with modified binders, foam/emulsion treated 
granular or Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) material bases and sub-bases and cement 
treated sub-bases and bases and stabilized subgrades and (iii) utilization of new construction 
techniques/practices. Recommendations were made for the use of harder grade binders to resist 
rutting and top-down cracking in the upper bituminous layer and for fatigue resistant bituminous 
mixes for the bottom bituminous layer. Mechanistic-empirical performance models were given 
for rutting in subgrade and bottom-up cracking in bituminous layers for two different levels (80% 
and 90%) of reliability. Fatigue criteria were included for cement treated bases also.
1.4	
The fourth (current) revision has been done based on the feedback received on the 
performance of bituminous pavements in general and that of bituminous layers in particular. 
Different provisions made in the third revision of the guidelines have been fine-tuned based 
on the feedback. Some of the salient features of the fourth revision are: (a) recommendation 
of better performing bituminous mixes and binders for surface and base/binder courses (b) 
guidelines for selection of appropriate elastic moduli for bituminous mixes used in the surface 
and other courses (c) recommendation of minimum thicknesses of granular and cement treated 
sub-bases and bases and bituminous layers from functional requirements (d) generalization of 
the procedure for the estimation of the effective resilient modulus/CBR of subgrade (e) provision 
for the use of geo-synthetics and (f) rationalization of the design approach for stage construction. 
1.5	
The draft of the basic document was prepared by Late Prof. B.B. Pandey of IIT Kharagpur 
based on the feedback received during the open house discussion on IRC:37-2012 held at the

National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) headquarters on 9th April, 2016 and subsequent 
comments received from different practicing professionals, experts and the members of the H-2 
committee on the field performance of bituminous pavements and on other design and practical 
issues. The draft was further edited and modified by a sub-committee consisting of Shri A.V. 
Sinha, Shri R.K. Pandey and Shri Bidur Kant Jha. The draft was deliberated in various meetings 
of Flexible Pavement, Airfield & Runways Committee (H-2) and was approved in its meeting 
held on 29th September, 2018. The Highways Specifications and Standards Committee (HSS) 
in its meeting held on 23rd October, 2018 approved the document and authorized the Convenor 
to modify the document subject to written comments received and comments offered during 
the meeting. Executive Committee of IRC approved the document in its meeting held on 27th 
October, 2018. Thereafter, meeting was convened by the Convenor, H-2 Committee along with 
members of drafting Sub-group on 17th November, 2018 at New Delhi to incorporate compliance 
of the comments in the document. This modified draft was further deliberated and approved 
in a meeting convened by HSS Convenor & DG (RD) & SS, MoRTH  on 19th November, 2018 
wherein Secretary General, IRC and member of Sub-group were also present.  The Council in 
its meeting held on 22nd November, 2018 at Nagpur considered and approved the document for 
printing and releasing.

2. SCOPE
2.1	
The Guidelines shall apply to the design of new flexible pavements and reconstruction 
of damaged pavements for roads with a design traffic of two million standard axle (msa) load 
repetitions or more. For the roads with a design traffic of less than 2 msa, IRC:SP:72[5] shall be 
adopted for pavement design. For rehabilitation of in-service pavements, overlay design shall 
be done as per Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) method (IRC:115)[6] or Benkelman Beam 
Deflection (BBD) test method (IRC:81)[7].
2.2	
Users of the guidelines are expected to use their skills, experience and engineering 
judgment and take into consideration the local climatic conditions, cost and availability of 
materials, their durability and past pavement performance in their respective regions for selecting 
a suitable pavement composition.
2.3	
The guidelines may require revision from time to time in the light of future performance 
data and technological developments. Towards this end, it is suggested that all the organizations 
intending to use the guidelines should keep a detailed record of the year of construction, 
subgrade CBR, soil characteristics, pavement composition and specifications, traffic, pavement 
performance, overlay history, climatic conditions, etc., and provide feedback to the Indian Roads 
Congress for further revision.
3. DESIGN PRINCIPLES
3.1	
While various sections of these guidelines describe the design procedures in detail, 
these are supplemented by a discussion on the ‘principle and approach to design’ given in 
the Appendix-A to this document, which needs to be considered as an integral part of the 
Guidelines. The Annexes (I to III) given to this document intend to elaborate the finer points of 
design and support the recommendations by different worked out design examples to help the 
users in familiarizing themselves with different provisions of the guidelines and for arriving at a 
safe, economical and performing design.
The philosophy of pavement design involves designing pavements for satisfactory functional 
and structural performance of the pavement during its intended service life period. Roughness 
caused by variation in surface profile, cracking of layers bound by bituminous or cementitious

materials, rutting (permanent or plastic deformation) of unbound/unmodified or partially modified 
subgrade, granular layers and bituminous layers are the primary indicators of the functional 
and structural performance of pavements. Performance of the pavement is explained by 
performance models which are either (a) purely empirical (only based on past experience) or (b) 
mechanistic-empirical, in which the distresses/performance are explained in terms of mechanistic 
parameters such as stresses, strains and deflections calculated using a specific theory and as 
per a specified procedure. Most of the current pavement design methods follow the mechanistic-
empirical approach for the design of bituminous pavements. In these methods, for each of the 
selected structural distresses, a critical mechanistic parameter is identified and controlled to an 
acceptable (limiting) value in the design process. The limiting values of these critical mechanistic 
parameters are obtained from the performance models. 
3.2	
The mechanistic-empirical design approach, which was used in the second and 
third revisions of IRC:37, is retained in the current revision as well for the design of flexible 
pavements. The theory selected for the analysis of pavements is ‘linear elastic layered theory’ in 
which the pavement is modeled as a multi-layer system. The bottom most layer (foundation or 
subgrade) is considered to be semi-infinite, and all the upper layers are assumed to be infinite 
in the horizontal extent and finite in thickness. Elastic modulus, Poisson’s ratio and thickness of 
each layer are the pavement inputs required for calculation of stresses, strains and deflections 
produced by a load applied at the surface of the pavement. IITPAVE software, which is an 
updated version of FPAVE developed for MoRTH Research Scheme R-56 “Analytical design of 
Flexible Pavement”[3], has been used for the analysis of pavements. 
3.3	
The vertical compressive strain on top of the subgrade is considered in these 
guidelines to be the critical mechanistic parameter for controlling subgrade rutting. Horizontal 
tensile strain at the bottom of the bottom bituminous layer is taken as the causative mechanistic 
parameter which has to be limited to control bottom-up cracking in bituminous layers. Similarly, 
to ensure that the Cement Treated Bases (CTB) do not fail by fatigue cracking, tensile strain and 
tensile stress at the bottom of the CTB are considered to be the critical parameters to control. 
3.4	
Rutting within bituminous layers caused by accumulated plastic (permanent) 
deformation in these layers due to repeated application of traffic loads is another major distress 
which occurs in bituminous pavements. High pavement temperatures and heavy loads can cause 
early development of unacceptable levels of rut depth in bituminous mixes as the stiffness of 
the bituminous mix reduces at higher temperatures and the proportion of plastic (irrecoverable) 
deformation out of the total deformation will be larger under higher temperature and heavier 
loading conditions. Moisture damage of mixes and brittle cracking resulting from excessive 
age hardening of bitumen in the upper layers are the other major concerns to be taken into 
consideration. These distresses are considered by integrating the mix design into the structural 
design by incorporating the mix volumetric parameters into the performance models and by 
making suitable recommendations about the choice of binder and mix to be used in different 
layers.
3.5	
For the satisfactory performance of bituminous pavements and to ensure that 
the magnitudes of distresses are within acceptable levels during the service life period, the 
guidelines recommend that the pavement sections be selected in such a way that they satisfy 
the limiting stresses and strains prescribed by the performance models adopted in the guidelines

for subgrade rutting, bottom-up cracking of bituminous layer and fatigue cracking of cement 
treated bases. Additional measures have been suggested in the guidelines by way of integrating 
the mix design parameters that have a significant bearing on the performance of pavements into 
the design process. It may be noted that the design of the bituminous mix was integrated into 
the structural design process even in the second revision (2001 version) of IRC:37 as the strain 
values used in the fatigue and rutting performance models are computed using the elastic moduli 
of bituminous mixes and other layer materials. Also, the elastic modulus of the bituminous layer 
appears in the fatigue performance criterion. Suitable recommendations have also been made in 
the guidelines for (i) fatigue cracking and moisture damage resistant mixes for the bottom (base) 
bituminous layer (ii) rut and moisture damage resistant bituminous mixes for the intermediate 
(binder) bituminous layer (if provided) and (iii) rut, moisture damage, fatigue cracking and age 
resistant surface course and (iv) drainage layer for removal of excess moisture from the interior 
of the pavement.
3.6 	
Performance Criteria
The following performance criteria are used in these guidelines for the design of bituminous 
pavements.
3.6.1	
Subgrade rutting criteria
An average rut depth of 20 mm or more, measured along the wheel paths, is considered in these 
guidelines as critical or failure rutting condition. The equivalent number of standard axle load (80 
kN) repetitions that can be served by the pavement, before the critical average rut depth of 20 
mm or more occurs, is given by equations 3.1 and 3.2 respectively for 80 % and 90 % reliability 
levels. The rutting performance model developed initially based on the MoRTH R-6 Research 
Scheme[2] performance data was subsequently developed into two separate models for two 
different reliability levels based on the additional performance data collected for MoRTH R-56 
Research Scheme[3].
	
NR = 4.1656 x 10-08 [1/εv]4.5337	 	
(for 80 % reliability)
(3.1)
	
NR = 1.4100 x 10-08 [1/εv]4.5337	 	
(for 90 % reliability)
(3.2)
	
Where,
	
NR=	 subgrade rutting life (cumulative equivalent number of 80 kN standard axle 
loads that can be served by the pavement before the critical rut depth of 20 mm 
or more occurs)
	
εv =	 vertical compressive strain at the top of the subgrade calculated using linear 
elastic layered theory by applying standard axle load at the surface of the 
selected pavement system
IITPAVE software is used in these guidelines for the analysis of pavements. For the computation 
of stresses, strains and deflections in the pavement, thicknesses and elastic properties (elastic 
modulus and Poisson’s ratio) of different layers are the main inputs. Detailed instructions for 
installation and use of IITPAVE software, which is provided along with these guidelines, are 
given in Annex I. Guidelines for the selection of the elastic modulus and Poisson’s ratio values 
of different pavement layers are given in different sections of the guidelines. For the calculation

of vertical compressive strain on top of the subgrade, horizontal tensile strain at the bottom of the 
bottom bituminous layer and the horizontal tensile strain at the bottom of cement treated base 
(CTB) layer, the analysis is done for a standard axle load of 80 kN (single axle with dual wheels). 
Only one set of dual wheels, each wheel carrying 20 kN load with the centre to centre spacing 
of 310 mm between the two wheels, applied at the pavement surface shall be considered for the 
analysis. The shape of the contact area of the tyre is assumed in the analysis to be circular. The 
uniform vertical contact stress shall be considered as 0.56 MPa. However, when fatigue damage 
analysis of Cement Treated Bases (CTB) is carried out, (using Equations 3.5 to 3.7) the contact 
pressure used for analysis shall be 0.80 MPa. The layer interface condition was assumed to be 
fully bound. The materials are assumed to be isotropic.
3.6.2	
Fatigue cracking criteria for bituminous layer
The occurrence of fatigue cracking (appearing as inter connected cracks), whose total area 
in the section of the road under consideration is 20 % or more than the paved surface area 
of the section, is considered to be the critical or failure condition. The equivalent number of 
standard axle (80 kN) load repetitions that can be served by the pavement, before the critical 
condition of the cracked surface area of 20 % or more occurs, is given by equations 3.3 and 
3.4 respectively for 80 % and 90 % reliability levels. The fatigue performance models given by 
equations 3.3 and 3.4 were developed under MoRTH R-56 scheme[3] utilizing primarily the R-6 
scheme (Benkelman Beam Studies) performance data[2] supplemented by the data available 
from R-19 (Pavement Performance Studies)[8] and R-56 schemes[3].

[9] and was incorporated in the fatigue models to integrate the mix design considerations into the 
fatigue performance model.

A popular approach used for enhancing the fatigue life of bituminous layers is to make the bottom 
most bituminous mixes richer in bitumen[10]. Larger binder volume in the mix means an increased 
thickness of the binder film in the mix and an increase in the proportion of bitumen over any 
cross-section of the layer normal to the direction of tensile strain. Besides having longer fatigue 
lives, larger binder volumes will also be beneficial in making the mix more moisture damage 
resistant due to thicker binder films which also reduce the ageing of the binder. Considering that 
the bottom bituminous layer will be subjected to significantly lower stresses and lower summer 
temperatures compared to the upper layers, the chance of rutting of the lower layer will be less.
The recent version of the Asphalt Institute manual for mix design[10] recommends design of the 
bitumen rich mixes (or rich bottom mixes) at 2 to 2.5 per cent air voids and to compact the rich 
bottom layer to less than 4 per cent in-place air voids. The recommendations made in these 
guidelines about the volumetric parameters and the in-place air voids to be achieved are given 
in para 9.2.
3.6.3	
Fatigue performance models for Cement Treated Base (CTB)
3.6.3.1	
In the case of pavements with CTB layer, fatigue performance check for the CTB layer 
should be carried out as per equation 3.5 (based on cumulative standard axle load repetitions 
estimated using vehicle damage factors), and as per equations 3.6 and 3.7 (cumulative 
fatigue damage analysis) using axle load spectrum data. It may be noted that ‘cement treated’ 
refers to stabilization by different types of cementitious materials such as cement, lime, fly-
ash, or a combination thereof. The terms, ‘cement treated’ and ‘cementitious’, have been used 
interchangeably in these guidelines. Equation 3.5 is based on the Australian experience[11] 
whereas equation 3.6 is as per the recommendations of the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement 
Design Guide[12]. Pavement analysis shall be carried out using IITPAVE with a contact stress 
of 0.8 MPa on the pavement surface to determine the tensile strain (εt) value at the bottom of 
the CTB layer. The number of standard axle loads derived from equation 3.5 by substituting the 
computed tensile strain value along with other inputs shall not be less than the design traffic.

The CTB layer is subjected to cumulative fatigue damage by the application of axle loads of 
different categories and different magnitudes applied over the design life period. The fatigue life

Nfi of the CTB material when subjected to a specific number of applications (ni) of axle load of 
class ‘i’ during the design period, is given by equation 3.6. Details of different types of axles, axle 
load spectrum, repetitions of each load group expected during the design life period, shall be 
obtained from the analysis of the axle load survey data. 
For the purpose of analysis, each tandem axle repetition may be considered as two repetitions of 
a single axle carrying 50 % of the tandem axle weight as axles separated by a distance of 1.30 
m or more do not have a significant overlapping of stresses. Similarly, one application of a tridem 
axle may be considered as three single axles, each weighing one third the weight of the tridem 
axle. For example, if a tridem axle carries a load of 45 tonnes, it may be taken to be equivalent 
to three passes of a 15 tonne single axle.
For analyzing the pavement for cumulative fatigue damage of the CTB layer, contact stress shall 
be taken as 0.80 MPa instead of 0.56 MPa.

If the estimated CFD is less than 1.0, the design is considered to be acceptable. If the value of

Reliability
These Guidelines recommend 90% reliability performance equations for subgrade rutting 
(equation 3.2) and fatigue cracking of bottom bituminous layer (equation 3.4) for all important 
roads such as Expressways, National Highways, State Highways and Urban Roads. For other 
categories of roads, 90 % reliability is recommended for design traffic of 20 msa or more and 80 
per cent reliability for design traffic less than 20 msa.

3.8	
Analysis of Flexible Pavements
For computing the stresses, strains and deflections, the pavement has been considered in these 
guidelines as a linear elastic layered system. IITPAVE software, developed for analysis of linear 
elastic layered systems, has been used in these guidelines for analysis and design of pavements. 
Details of the IITPAVE software, which is supplied with this document, are given in Annex-I. As 
mentioned previously in these guidelines, the vertical compressive strain on top of subgrade and 
the horizontal tensile strain at the bottom of the bituminous layer are considered to be the critical 
mechanistic parameters which need to be controlled for ensuring satisfactory performance of 
flexible pavements in terms of subgrade rutting and bottom-up cracking of bituminous layers. 
Similarly, the horizontal tensile stress and horizontal tensile strain at the bottom of the CTB layer 
are considered to be critical for the performance of the CTB bases. Figs. 3.1 to 3.6 show different 
flexible pavement compositions for which the locations at which different critical mechanistic 
parameters should be calculated are shown. The critical locations are indicated as dots in the 
figure. Table 3.1 presents the standard conditions recommended in these guidelines for the 
pavement analysis. 
Theoretical calculations suggest that the tensile strain near the surface close to the edge of the 
wheel can be sufficiently large to initiate longitudinal surface cracking followed by transverse 
cracking much before the flexural cracking of the bottom layer occurs, if the mix tensile strength 
is not adequate at higher temperatures[13] [14].

4. TRAFFIC
4.1	
General
This section covers the guidelines for the estimation of design traffic for new roads. The guidelines 
consider that the structural damage to the pavement i.e., fatigue cracking in the bound layers 
and rutting in the subgrade is caused by the applied traffic loads. The relative structural damage 
caused to the pavement by different types of axles carrying different axle loads is considered 
using Vehicle Damage Factors (VDFs) in the estimation of design traffic.
4.1.1	
The design traffic is estimated in these guidelines in terms of equivalent number 
of cumulative standard axles (80 kN single axle with dual wheels). For estimating the factors 
required to convert the commercial traffic volumes into equivalent repetitions of the standard 
axle, it is necessary to measure the axle load spectrum relevant for the stretch of road under 
consideration. Axle load spectrum data are especially required for the design of pavements 
having layers treated/stabilised using cementitious materials such as cement, lime, fly ash, etc., 
for estimating the cumulative fatigue damage expected to be caused to the cement treated base 
by different axle load groups. The following inputs are required for estimating the design traffic 
(in terms of cumulative standard axle load repetitions) for the selected road for a given design 
period.
	
(i)	
initial traffic (two-way) on the road after construction in terms of the number 
of commercial vehicles (having the laden weight of 3 tonnes or more) per day 
(cvpd)
	
(ii)	
average traffic growth rate(s) during the design life period
	
(iii)	 design life in number of years
	
(iv)	 spectrum of axle loads
	
(v)	
factors for estimation of the lateral distribution of commercial traffic over the 
carriageway
4.1.2	
Only the commercial vehicles having gross vehicle weight of 3 tonnes or more are 
considered for the structural design of pavements.
4.1.3	
Estimation of the present day average traffic should be based on the seven-day 
24-hour traffic volume count made in accordance with IRC:9[15].
4.2 
Traffic Growth Rate
4.2.1	
For estimating the cumulative traffic expected to use the pavement over the design 
period, it is necessary to estimate the rate(s) at which the commercial traffic will grow over the 
design period. The growth rates may be estimated as per IRC:108[16]. Typical data required for 
estimation of the growth rates(r) are:
	
(i)	
past trends of traffic growth and
	
(ii)	
demand elasticity of traffic with respect to macro-economic parameters (like the 
gross domestic product and state domestic product) and the demand expected 
due to specific developments and land use changes likely to take place during 
the design life period.



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:37-2018
14
4.2.2	
Traffic growth rates shall be established for each category of commercial vehicles. In 
the absence of data for estimation of the annual growth rate of commercial vehicles or when the 
estimated growth rate is less than 5 per cent, a minimum annual growth rate of 5 per cent should 
be used for commercial vehicles for estimating the design traffic.
4.3	
Design Period
4.3.1	
The design period to be adopted for pavement design is the time span considered 
appropriate for the road pavement to function without major rehabilitation. It is recommended 
that a design period of 20 years may be adopted for the structural design of pavements for 
National Highways, State Highways and Urban Roads. For other categories of roads, a design 
period of 15 years is recommended. Pavements for very high density corridors (more than 300 
msa) and expressways shall preferably be designed as long-life pavements. Otherwise, for such 
corridors, the pavement shall be designed for a minimum period of 30 years. The commercial 
traffic, converted into equivalent repetitions of the standard axle, and adjusted for directional 
distribution, lateral distribution over the carriageway width, etc., is the design traffic.
4.3.2	
Design traffic considerations for stage construction
Stage construction of pavement may be adopted in projects where the growth of traffic is uncertain 
or future traffic volumes are expected to increase substantially due to future developments. Stage 
construction may also be adopted in projects for which subsequent maintenance is mandated 
on ‘performance basis’. For projects in which stage construction is adopted, the base and sub-
base layers shall be designed for the full design period. Stage construction is not allowed for 
pavements with cement treated bases and sub-bases.
Stage-1 bituminous layer(s) of the pavement should be designed for more traffic than estimated 
for the initial (first) stage design period (or traffic) so that the pavement will have at least 40 % 
life remaining after stage-1 period (traffic). Assuming that the pavement life consumed increases 
linearly with traffic, the design traffic for stage-1 shall be taken as 1.67 times the design traffic 
estimated for stage-1 period. If designed and constructed for only the stage-1 design traffic, the 
pavement, especially the bituminous layer, may not have adequate the structural condition and 
is lightly to develop full depth cracking and thus may not be suitable for periodical maintenance 
measures such as patching, crack sealing and micro-surfacing. The requirement of the second 
stage pavement shall be determined after evaluation of the structural condition of the pavement 
by Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) method as per IRC:115[6] or by Benkelman Beam 
Deflection (BBD) method as per IRC:81[7]. An example of the design carried out following the 
concept of stage construction is given in Annex-II.
4.4	
Vehicle Damage Factor
4.4.1	
The guidelines use Vehicle Damage Factor (VDF) for the estimation of cumulative 
repetitions of standard axle load for the thickness design of pavements. In the case of pavements 
with CTB layer, in addition to the fatigue performance check carried out as per equation 3.5 
based on cumulative standard axle load repetitions (estimated using VDF), CFD analysis also 
should be carried out following the approach given by equations 3.6 and 3.7 using axle load 
spectrum data.

4.4.2	
Vehicle Damage Factor (VDF) is a multiplier to convert the given number of commercial 
vehicles having different axle configurations and different axle weights into an equivalent number 
of standard axle load (80 kN single axle with dual wheels) repetitions. 
4.4.3	
For converting one repetition of a particular type of axle carrying a specific axle load 
into equivalent repetitions of 80 kN single axle with dual wheel, equations 4.1 to 4.4 may be used. 
Since the axle load equivalence factors reported from the AASHO Road Test for flexible as well 
as rigid pavements are not significantly different for heavy duty pavements, it is assumed that 
the VDF values estimated for checking subgrade rutting and bituminous layer fatigue cracking 
can be used for checking the fatigue damage of cemented bases also.

Some tandem axles have only one (single) wheel on each side of the axle. In such cases, each 
axle of the tandem axle set may be considered as two separate single axles (with single wheels) 
and Equation 4.1 may be used for estimation of the equivalent axle load repetitions. Similarly, if 
the axle spectrum has a tridem axle with single wheels, it may be considered as three separate 
single axles having single wheels.
4.4.4	
Multi-axle vehicles may consist of different combinations of axle classes considered 
in equations 4.1 to 4.4. The VDF should be arrived at by carrying out axle load surveys on the 
existing roads for a minimum period of 24 hours in each direction. The minimum sample size 
of commercial vehicles to be considered for the axle load survey is given in Table 4.1. Care 
should be taken to ensure that there is no bias in the selection of the vehicles for the survey. The 
vehicles to be surveyed should be selected randomly irrespective of whether they are loaded or 
empty. On some sections of roads, there may be a significant difference between the axle loads 
of commercial vehicles plying in the two directions of traffic. In such situations, the VDF should 
be evaluated separately for each direction.

4.4.5	
Axle load spectrum
For the analysis of the axle load spectrum and for calculation of VDFs, the axle load data may be 
classified into multiple classes with class intervals of 10 kN, 20 kN and 30 kN for single, tandem 
and tridem axles respectively.
4.4.6	
For small projects, in the absence of weigh pad, the axle loads of typical commercial 
vehicles plying on the road may be estimated approximately from the type of goods carried. 
Where information on the axle loads is not available and the proportion of heavy vehicles using 
the road is small, the indicative values of Vehicle Damage Factor given in Table 4.2 can be 
used. These indicative VDF values have been worked out based on typical axle load spectrums 
and taking into consideration the legal axle load limits notified in the Gazette of India dated 
16th July, 2018.

Lateral Distribution of Commercial Traffic over the Carriageway
4.5.1	
Lateral distribution
Lateral distribution of commercial traffic on the carriageway is required for estimating the design 
traffic (equivalent standard axle load applications) to be considered for the structural design of 
pavement. The following lateral distribution factors may be considered for roads with different 
types of the carriageway:
4.5.1.1	
Single-lane roads
Traffic tends to be more channelized on single-lane roads than on two-lane roads and to allow 
for this concentration of wheel load repetitions, the design should be based on the total number 
(sum) of commercial vehicles in both directions.
4.5.1.2	
Intermediate lane roads of width 5.50 m
The design traffic should be based on 75 per cent of the two-way commercial traffic.
4.5.1.3	
Two-lane two-way roads
The design should be based on 50 per cent of the total number of commercial vehicles in both 
the directions. 
4.5.1.4	
Four-lane single carriageway roads
40 per cent of the total number (sum) of commercial vehicles in both directions should be 
considered for design.

4.5.1.5	
Dual carriageway roads
The design of dual two-lane carriageway roads should be based on 75 per cent of the number 
of commercial vehicles in each direction. For dual three-lane carriageway and dual four-lane 
carriageway, the distribution factors shall be 60 per cent and 45 per cent respectively.
4.6 
Computation of Design Traffic
4.6.1	
The design traffic, in terms of the cumulative number of standard axles to be carried 
during the design period of the road, should be estimated using equation 4.5.
	
          (   )    
 
       
(4.5)
	
Where,
	
NDes	 = cumulative number of standard axles to be catered for during the design 
period of ‘n’ years
	
A	
= initial traffic (commercial vehicles per day) in the year of completion 
of construction (directional traffic volume to be considered for divided 
carriageways where as for other categories of the carriageway, two-way 
traffic volume may be considered for applying the lateral distribution factors)
	
D

F

n

r	
= annual growth rate of commercial vehicles in decimal (e.g., for 6 per cent 
annual growth rate, r = 0.06). Variation of the rate of growth over different 
periods of the design period, if available, may be considered for estimating 
the design traffic
The traffic in the year of completion of construction may be estimated using equation 4.6.
	
A = P(1 + r)x
(4.6)
	
Where,
	
P	
= number of commercial vehicles per day as per last count.
	
x	
= number of years between the last count and the year of completion of 
construction.
4.6.2	
For single carriageway (undivided) roads, the pavement may be designed for design 
traffic estimated based on the larger of the two VDF values obtained for the two directions. For 
divided carriageways, different pavement designs can be adopted for the two directions of traffic 
depending on the directional distribution of traffic and the corresponding directional VDF values 
in the two directions.
5. PAVEMENT COMPOSITIONS
A flexible pavement considered in these guidelines essentially consists of three functional layers 
above the subgrade. These are: sub-base, base and bituminous layers. Detailed discussion 
on subgrade and each of the pavement layers is presented in the subsequent sections of the 



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:37-2018
18
guidelines. The sub-base and base layers may be (a) granular, (b) cement treated or (c) a 
combination of granular and cement treated materials. Base layer can also be a foam bitumen 
or emulsion treated granular/Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) material/combination of RAP 
and aggregate layer. When CTB is used, a crack relief layer is to be mandatorily provided, 
either as an aggregate interlayer or as a stress absorbing membrane inter-layer (SAMI). The 
bituminous layer comprises two different types of materials, categorized as bituminous base and 
surfacing. If the base bituminous layer is constructed in two layers, these are generally termed 
as binder and base bituminous layers. Unless specified otherwise, each functional layer can be 
constructed in one or more layers. The same elastic properties (elastic/resilient modulus and 
Poisson’s ratio) may be considered for all the sub-layers of a functional layer for the analysis of 
the pavement using linear elastic layered theory (IITPAVE software). Granular sub-base layers 
(filter and drainage layers) and granular base layer are considered (unless specified otherwise) 
as a single layer in the analysis of the pavement. Similarly, bituminous base (binder and base) 
and surfacing course are considered as a single layer. Aggregate (granular) crack relief layer 
shall be considered as a separate layer in the analysis. The SAMI crack relief treatment (if used) 
over the CTB layer shall not be considered in the structural analysis.
6. SUBGRADE
6.1	
General
On new roads, the aim should be to construct the pavement as far above the water table as 
economically practicable. The difference between the bottom of subgrade level and the level of 
water table/high flood level should, generally, not be less than 1.0 m or 0.6 m in case of existing 
roads which have no history of being overtopped. In water logged areas, where the subgrade 
is within the zone of capillary saturation, consideration should be given to the installation of 
suitable capillary cut-off as per IRC:34 at appropriate level underneath the pavement.
The top 500 mm of the prepared foundation layer immediately below the pavement, designated 
as subgrade, can be made up of in-situ material, select soil, or stabilized soil forming the 
foundation for the pavement. It should be well compacted to derive optimal strength and to limit 
the rutting caused due to additional densification of the layer during the service life. It shall be 
compacted to attain a minimum of 97 per cent of the laboratory maximum dry density obtained 
corresponding to heavy compaction as per IS:2720 Part-8[17] for Expressways, National 
Highways, State Highways, Major District Roads and other heavily trafficked roads. When the 
subgrade is formed using a material which is stronger than the upper 500 mm of embankment 
soil or when the subgrade itself is prepared in two separate layers with significantly different 
strengths, the effective combined contribution of the subgrade and the embankment layers has 
to be considered for design. The principle to be used for the estimation of the effective strength 
or mechanical property is discussed in para 6.4. As previously mentioned in these guidelines, 
the elastic/resilient moduli of different pavement layers are the main inputs for the analysis and 
design of pavements. Since the measurement of resilient modulus of soil requires sophisticated 
equipment, the same is generally estimated from the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) value of the 
material. The following sections present the details of the compaction effort and moisture content 
to be used for preparing the specimens in the laboratory for evaluating the CBR value or resilient 
modulus value of the soil.

IRC:37-2018

6.2	
Selection of Dry Density and Moisture Content for Laboratory Testing of 
Subgrade Material
6.2.1	
The laboratory test conditions should represent the field conditions as closely as 
possible. Compaction in the field is done at a minimum of 97 per cent of the laboratory maximum 
density obtained at optimum moisture content. In the field, the subgrade undergoes moisture 
variation depending on different local conditions such as water table depth, precipitation, soil 
permeability, drainage conditions and the extent to which the pavement is impermeable to 
moisture. In high rainfall areas, lateral infiltration through the unpaved shoulder, median, porous 
and cracked surface may have a significant effect on the subgrade moisture condition. The 
California Bearing Ratio (CBR) of the subgrade soil, for the design of new pavements and 
reconstruction, should be determined as per IS:2720 Part-16[18] at the most critical moisture 
condition likely to occur at the site. The test should be performed on remoulded samples of soils in 
the laboratory. The pavement thickness should be based on 4-day soaked CBR value of the soil, 
remoulded at placement density (minimum 97 % of maximum Proctor compaction test density) 
and optimum moisture content ascertained from the compaction curve. In areas with less than 
1000 mm rainfall, four-day soaking may be too severe a condition for a subgrade well protected 
with thick bituminous layer and the strength of the subgrade soil may be underestimated. If data 
is available about the seasonal variation of moisture, the moulding moisture content for the CBR 
test can be selected based on the field data. The test specimens should be prepared by static 
compaction to obtain the target density.
6.2.2	
Frequency of tests and design value
If the type of soil used in different stretches of the subgrade varies along the length of the 
pavement, the CBR value of each type of soil should be the average of at least three specimens 
prepared using that soil. 90th percentile subgrade CBR value should be adopted for the design 
of high volume roads such as Expressways, National Highways, State Highways and Urban 
Roads. For other categories of roads, the design can be done based on the 80th percentile CBR 
value if the design traffic is less than 20 msa and based on 90th percentile CBR if the design 
traffic is 20 msa or more.
6.3	
Resilient Modulus of the Subgrade
Resilient modulus, which is measured taking into account only the elastic (or resilient) component 
of the deformation (or strain) of the specimen in a repeated load test is considered to be the 
appropriate input for linear elastic theory selected in these guidelines for the analysis of flexible 
pavements. The resilient modulus of soils can be determined in the laboratory by conducting 
the repeated tri-axial test as per the procedure detailed in AASHTO T307-99[19]. Since these 
equipment are usually expensive, the following relationships may be used to estimate the resilient 
modulus of subgrade soil (MRS) from its CBR value[20, 21].
	
MRS	 		
= 10.0 * CBR

(6.1)
	
MRS

Where,
	
MRS

CBR

Poisson’s ratio value or subgrade soil may be taken as 0.35.

6.4	
Effective Modulus/CBR for Design
6.4.1	
Sometimes, there can be a significant difference between the CBR values of the soils 
used in the subgrade and in the embankment layer below the subgrade. Alternatively, the 500 
mm thick subgrade may be laid in two layers, each layer material having different CBR value. In 
such cases, the design should be based on the effective modulus/CBR value of a single layer 
subgrade which is equivalent to the combination of the subgrade layer(s) and embankment layer. 
The effective modulus/CBR value may be determined as per the following procedure which is a 
generalization of the approach presented earlier in an Indian Roads Congress publication[22].
	
(i)	
Using IITPAVE software, determine the maximum surface deflection 
(δ) due to a single wheel load of 40,000 N and a contact pressure of 
0.56 MPa for a two or three layer elastic system comprising of a single (or 
two sub-layers) of the 500 mm thick subgrade layer over the semi-infinite 
embankment layer. The elastic moduli of subgrade and embankment soils/
layers may be estimated from equations 6.1 and 6.2 using their laboratory 
CBR values. Poisson’s ratio (μ) value may be taken as 0.35 for all the 
layers.
	
(ii)	
Using the maximum surface deflection (δ) computed in step (i) above, 
estimate the resilient modulus MRS of the equivalent single layer using 
equation 6.3.
	
MRS	
= 
 (    )  
    
 
(6.3)
	
Where,
	
p	
= contact pressure = 0.56 MPa
	
a	
= radius of circular contact area, which can be calculated using the load 
applied (40,000 N) and the contact pressure ‘p’ (0.56 MPa) = 150.8 mm
	
μ	
= Poisson’s ratio
It is the effective resilient modulus (MRS) value and not the CBR that is used in the design. 
However, if required, the CBR value can be reported using equations 6.2 and 6.3. A worked out 
example for the estimation of the effective resilient modulus/CBR is given in Annex-II.
In case the borrow material is placed over a rocky foundation, the effective CBR may be larger 
than the CBR of the borrow material. However, only the CBR of the borrow material shall be 
adopted for the pavement design. Additionally, proper safeguards should be taken against the 
development of pore water pressure between the rocky foundation and the borrow material.
If the embankment consists of multiple layers of materials having different CBR values, multi-
layer analysis can be carried out using IITPAVE software and the effective resilient modulus can 
be estimated using the concept discussed above.
6.4.2	
For the purpose of design, the resilient modulus (MRS), thus estimated, shall be limited 
to a maximum value of 100 MPa. 
6.4.3	
The effective subgrade CBR should be more than 5 % for roads estimated to carry 
more than 450 Commercial Vehicles Per Day (cvpd) (two-way) in the year of construction.

7. SUB-BASES
7.1	
General
The sub-base layer serves three functions: (i) to provide a strong support for the compaction of 
the granular base (WMM/WBM) layer (ii) to protect the subgrade from overstressing and (iii) to 
serve as drainage and filter layers. The sub-base layers can be made of granular material which 
can be unbound or chemically stabilized with additives such as cement, lime, flyash and other 
cementitious stabilizers. The thickness of the sub-base, whether bound or unbound, should meet 
these functional requirements. To meet these requirements, minimum sub-base thicknesses 
have been specified in the following paragraphs.
7.2	
Granular (Unbound) Sub-Base Layer
7.2.1	
Sub-base materials may consist of natural sand, moorum, gravel, laterite, kankar, 
brick metal, crushed stone, crushed slag, reclaimed crushed concrete/reclaimed asphalt 
pavement, river bed material or combinations thereof meeting the prescribed grading and 
physical requirements. When the granular sub-base material consists of a combination of different 
materials, mixing should be done mechanically by either using a suitable mixer or adopting the 
mix-in-place method. Granular sub-base (GSB) should conform to the MoRTH Specifications for 
Road and Bridge Works[23].
If the thickness of the sub-base layer provided in the design permits, the sub-base layer shall have 
two sub layers; drainage layer and the filter layer. The upper layer of the sub-base functions as a 
drainage layer to drain away the water that enters through surface cracks. The lower layer of the 
sub-base should function as the filter/separation layer to prevent intrusion of subgrade soil into 
the pavement. The aggregate gradations recommended for the drainage layer are granular sub-
base gradations III and IV of MoRTH Specifications[23]. The gradations I, II, V and VI specified 
for GSB by MoRTH[23] are recommended for filter/separation layer. 
If the design thickness of the granular sub-base is less than or equal to 200 mm, both drainage 
and filter layers cannot be provided separately (considering the minimum thickness requirements 
given in 7.2.2). For such cases, a single drainage-cum-filter layer with GSB gradation V or VI of 
MoRTH Specifications may be provided. 
The filter and drainage layers should be designed as per IRC:SP:42[24] and IRC:SP:50[25]. 
It is necessary to extend both drainage and filter layers to full width up to the slope of the 
embankment to have efficient drainage. Commercially available synthetic geo-composite, grid 
lock geo-cell with perforated vertical faces filled with aggregates meeting the requirement as 
specified in IRC:SP:59[26] can also be used to function as both filter/separation and drainage 
layers. Its strengthening effect can be considered in the pavement design in accordance with 
the provisions of IRC:SP:59. 
When GSB layer is also provided below the median in continuation with that of the pavement, 
a non-woven geo-synthetic may be provided over the GSB in the median part so that the fines 
percolating through the median do not enter into the GSB and choke it.
7.2.2	
Minimum thicknesses of granular sub-base layers
Irrespective of the design traffic volume, the following minimum thicknesses of granular sub-



======================================================================
PAGE 32 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:37-2018
22
base layers may be provided.
	
(i)	
The minimum thickness of drainage as well as filter layer shall be 100 mm (i.e., 
minimum thickness of each of these two layers is 100 mm).
	
(ii)	
The minimum thickness of the single filter-cum-drainage layer shall be 150 mm 
from functional requirement.
	
(iii)	 The minimum thickness of any compacted granular layer should preferably be at 
least 2.5 times the nominal maximum size of aggregates subject to a minimum 
of 100 mm.
	
(iv)	 The total thickness of the granular sub-base layer should be adequate to carry 
the construction traffic that may ply on the GSB. This thickness requirement 
may be worked out to satisfy the subgrade rutting limiting strain criterion given 
by equation 3.1 or 3.2 (as applicable for the classification of highway and design 
traffic). The design traffic for this purpose can be worked out based on the 
expected number of operations of dumpers and other construction vehicles on 
the GSB layer to carry material for the construction of granular or cement treated 
base layer. The indicative values of construction traffic loading and the procedure 
given in the worked out example in Annex-II can be used for the estimation of 
the construction traffic operating over the granular sub-base if more accurate 
and practical estimation cannot be done.
	
(v)	
The sub-base thickness should be checked for the design traffic worked out 
as per the above mentioned procedure or 10,000 standard axle repetitions, 
whichever is more.
	
(vi)	 The two-layer system (subgrade and GSB) should be analyzed by placing a 
standard load over it (dual wheel set of 20,000 N each acting at 0.56 MPa contact 
pressure) and computing (using IITPAVE) the maximum subgrade vertical 
compressive strain. The GSB thickness should be varied until the computed 
strain is less than or equal to the limiting subgrade vertical compressive strain, 
given by equations 3.1 or 3.2 (as applicable).
The worked out example given in Annex-II illustrates the estimation of GSB thickness from 
construction traffic consideration. 
7.2.3	
Resilient modulus of GSB layer
The elastic/resilient modulus value of the granular layer is dependent on the resilient modulus 
value of the foundation or supporting layer on which it rests and the thickness of the granular 
layer. A weaker support does not permit higher modulus of the upper granular layer because of 
the larger deflections caused by loads result in de-compaction in the lower part of the granular 
layer. Equation 7.1[20] may be used for the estimation of the modulus of the granular layer from 
its thickness and the modulus value of the supporting layer. 
	
MRGRAN = 0.2(h)0.45* MRSUPPORT
(7.1)
	
Where,
	
h	
		
= thickness of granular layer in mm
	
MRGRAN

IRC:37-2018
23
As stated previously in these guidelines, the granular base and granular sub-base are considered 
as a single layer for the purpose of analysis and a single modulus value is assigned to the 
combined layer. Thus, when the pavement has the combination of granular base and granular sub-
base, the modulus of the single (combined) granular layer may be estimated using equation 7.1 
taking the MRGRAN as the modulus of the combined granular layer and MRSUPPORT as the effective 
modulus of the subgrade. However, when a cement treated or emulsion/foam bitumen treated 
base layer is used over the granular sub-base, both the layers have to be considered separately 
in the analysis and separate modulus values have to be assigned for the GSB and the treated 
base layers. Equation 7.1 can be used to estimate the modulus of the granular sub-base taking 
MRGRAN as the modulus of the granular sub-base layer and MRSUPPORT as the effective modulus of 
the subgrade.
For the granular layers reinforced using geo-synthetic materials, IRC:SP:59[26] suggests Layer 
Coefficient Ratios (LCR) and Modulus Improvement Factors (MIF) which can be used to estimate 
the improvement in the modulus value of the granular layer due to geo-synthetic reinforcement. 
These values are to be obtained from detailed field and laboratory investigations as discussed 
in IRC:SP:59. IRC:SP:59 suggests the estimation of the moduli values of the un-reinforced 
granular base and sub-base layers separately and to obtain the moduli of the reinforced granular 
(sub-base and base) layers by applying suitable modification factors. The un-reinforced GSB 
modulus value estimated from equation 7.1 can be adjusted using appropriate LCR and MIF 
factors for obtaining the modulus value of the reinforced GSB.
Poisson’s ratio of the granular sub-base may be taken as 0.35.
7.3	
Cementitious (Cement Treated) Sub-base (CTSB) Layer
7.3.1	
General
The material used for cementitious (cement treated) sub-base may consist of soil, river bed 
materials, natural gravel aggregates, reclaimed concrete aggregates, crushed aggregates or 
soil aggregate mixture modified with different cementitious materials such as cement, lime, lime-
flyash, commercially available stabilizers, etc. The recommended aggregate gradation[27] for 
the CTSB material is Grading IV of Table 400-1 of MoRTH Specifications. 
The terms, ‘cementitious’ and ‘cement treated’, are used interchangeably in these guidelines. 
If the CTSB material, which typically is a coarse/open graded material, is disturbed and shows 
signs of instability before the next layer is laid, the same may be restored by treating it with 
cement or bitumen emulsion. If soil stabilized with cementitious material is used as a sub-base, 
commercially available geo-composites can be used to serve as a drainage cum filter/separation 
layer. 
The recommended minimum thickness for CTSB layer is 200 mm.
7.3.2	
Mechanical properties of CTSB material
The Elastic Modulus (E) of the CTSB material may be estimated from the Unconfined Compressive 
Strength (UCS) of the material. The cementitious sub-base (CTSB) should have a 7-day UCS of 
1.5 to 3.0 MPa as per IRC:SP:89[28]. Third point loading test flexural modulus ECGSB of 28-day 
cured CTSB material can be estimated using equation 7.2[11].



======================================================================
PAGE 34 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:37-2018
24
	
ECTSB	
= 1000 * UCS
(7.2)
	
Where, 
	
UCS	= 28-day unconfined compressive strength (MPa) of the cementitious granular 
material. It should be ensured that the average laboratory strength value should 
be more than 1.5 times the required (design) field strength.
	
ECTSB	= Elastic modulus (MPa) of 28-day cured CTSB material
For typical cement treated granular sub-base materials, the ECGSB can vary from 2000 to 6000 
MPa. Since the sub-base acts as a platform for the construction vehicles carrying 30 to 35 
tonnes of construction material, low strength cemented sub-base would crack under the heavy 
construction traffic and a design value of 600 MPa is recommended for the analysis and design 
of pavements with CTSB layers. CTSB with grading IV of IRC:SP:89[28] having strength in the 
range 0.75-1.5 MPa is not recommended for major highways but it can be used for roads with 
design traffic less than 10 msa. When the CTSB with UCS in the range of 0.75 to 1.5 MPa is 
used its modulus value may be taken as 400 MPa as specified in IRC:SP:89 (Part II)[27].
Poisson’s ratio value of CTSB layer may be taken as 0.25. 
The cemented sub-base shall be cured for a minimum of three days before the construction of 
the next layer. In case sufficient strength of cementitious sub-base is not achieved as per the 
requirement of IRC:SP:89[28] in 3 days of curing, 7 days curing shall be done for sub-base 
before the construction of the upper layer can be started.
8. BASES
8.1	
Unbound Base Layer
The unbound base layer consists of wet mix macadam, water bound macadam, crusher 
run macadam, reclaimed concrete, etc., conforming to MoRTH Specifications[23]. Wet mix 
macadam may also consist of blast furnace slag mixed with crushed stone meeting the MoRTH 
Specifications. The thickness of the unbound granular layer shall not be less than 150 mm 
except for the crack relief layer placed over cement treated base for which the thickness shall 
be 100 mm. 
When both sub-base and the base layers are made up of unbound granular layers, the composite 
resilient modulus of the granular base can be estimated using equation 7.1 taking MRGRAN as the 
modulus of the combined (GSB + Granular base) granular layer in MPa, ‘h’ as the combined 
thickness (mm) of the granular sub-base and base and MRSUPPORT as the effective modulus (MPa) 
of the subgrade.
For the granular base placed on CTSB layer, the resilient modulus may be taken as 300 MPa 
and 350 MPa for natural gravel and crushed rock respectively.
Poisson’s ratio of granular bases and sub-bases may be taken as 0.35.
As done in the case of granular sub-base, IRC:SP:59 recommends the adjustment of the un-
reinforced granular base modulus using LCR or MIF factors. The modulus value of the un-


IRC:37-2018
25
reinforced granular base (which can then be adjusted using LCR or MIF factors for analyzing the 
pavement) may be estimated using equation 7.1 taking MRGRAN as the modulus of the granular 
base and MRSUPPORT as the ‘effective modulus of the un-reinforced GSB’. The effective modulus of 
the un-reinforced sub-base can be estimated in the same manner in which the effective subgrade 
modulus is estimated. In this case, the two-layer system of (a) granular sub-base of selected 
thickness (whose modulus is estimated using equation 7.1) and (b) the subgrade with ‘effective’ 
modulus, is converted into an equivalent granular sub-base of infinite thickness whose effective 
modulus is to be determined by multiple trials.
When both granular base and granular sub-base are reinforced, the modulus of the un-reinforced 
granular base can be estimated using Equation 7.1 taking MRGRAN as the modulus of the granular 
base and MRSUPPORT as the ‘effective modulus of the reinforced granular sub-base’ calculated as 
discussed in the previous section. In this case, the two-layer system of (a) reinforced granular 
sub-base of selected thickness (whose modulus value has been estimated by adjusting the 
unreinforced granular sub-base using LCR or MIF factors) and (b) effective subgrade is converted 
into an equivalent reinforced granular sub-base layer of infinite thickness whose modulus can be 
determined by multiple trials.
8.2	
Cementitious Bases (CTB)
8.2.1	
Cemented base layers consist of aggregates, reclaimed asphalt material, crushed 
slag, crushed concrete aggregates or soil-aggregate mixture stabilized with chemical stabilizers 
such as cement, lime, lime-fly ash or other commercially available stabilizers which can produce 
mix of requisite strength. Flexural strength of the cemented base is critical to the satisfactory 
performance of a bituminous pavement. Cementitious bases shall be prepared by plant mixing 
or by a mechanized in-situ mixing process. The aggregate gradation for CTB shall be as 
given in table 400-4 of MoRTH Specifications[23]. The CTB material shall have a minimum 
Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) of 4.5 to 7 MPa as per IRC:SP:89 in 7/28 days. While 
the conventional cement stabilized material should attain this strength in seven days, granular 
materials and soil-aggregate mixture stabilized with lime, pozzolanic stabilizers, lime-fly ash 
etc., should meet the above strength requirement in 28 days since the strength gain in such 
materials is a slow process. As considered in the case of sub-bases, average laboratory strength 
values should be 1.5 times the required minimum (design) field strength. The cementitious base 
material must also meet the durability criteria given in Para 8.2.4. 
For the functional requirement, the thickness of cement treated bases shall not be less than 
100 mm. The procedure to be followed for the estimation of the thickness of the CTB layer 
required to cater to the construction traffic has been illustrated in Annex-II.
The elastic modulus of cementitious bases depends upon the quality of materials. Low grade 
aggregates such as moorum and kankar may give lower modulus at lower cement contents. 
Fine grained soil may require larger quantity of cementitious additive for higher strength and may 
develop wider cracks upon curing. Equation 7.2 may be used for estimating the elastic modulus 
of ECTB from the 28-day Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) of CTB material.
Poisson’s ratio value of CTB material may be taken as 0.25. 
Strength of cementitious layers keeps on rising with time and an elastic modulus of 5000 MPa 
may be considered for analysis of pavements with CTB layers having 7/28 day unconfined

compression strength values ranging between 4.5 to 7 MPa. While the conventional cement 
treated layer should attain the above strength in 7 days, lime and lime-flyash stabilised granular 
materials and soils should achieve the strength in 28 days since the strength gain in such 
materials is slow (IRC:SP:89).
Curing of cemented bases shall be done for a minimum period of seven days before the 
commencement of the construction of the next upper layer for achieving the required strength 
as described in IRC:SP:89[27] and curing should start immediately by spraying bitumen emulsion/ 
wet jute mat or periodical mist spray of water without flooding or other methods. 
8.2.2	
Flexural strength (modulus of rupture) of CTB material
The modulus of rupture (MRUP) or flexural strength of the CTB material is required for carrying out 
fatigue damage analysis of the cement treated base. The values of modulus of rupture (MPa) for 
cementitious bases may be taken as 20 per cent of the 28-day UCS value (MPa)[12] subject to 
the following limiting (maximum) values:
	
Cementitious stabilized aggregates 	 - 1.40 MPa 
	
Lime-flyash-soil 	 	
	
	
- 1.05 MPa 
	
Soil-cement 	
	
	
	
- 0.70 MPa
A relationship between UCS, Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS) and Flexural Strength, if developed 
for the materials being used in a project, will be useful for quality control since ITS is easy to 
determine on the cores taken from the field. Flexural Strength is approximately 1.5 times the ITS 
value for cement bound aggregates. 
8.2.3	
While the minimum size of the sample of the beam for cement stabilized aggregate 
for flexure test should be 100 mm x 100 mm x 500 mm, the beam size for flexural tests for 
stabilized soil with hydraulic binders (cement, lime, lime-flyash and other commercially available 
cementitious binders) can be 50 mm x 50 mm x 250 mm to 75 mm x75 mm x 375 mm. Third point 
loading shall be applied at a rate of 1.25 mm per minute, which is the same as that used in the 
CBR test. 
8.2.4	
Durability criteria
The minimum quantity of cementitious material in the bound base layer should be such that in a 
wetting and drying test (BIS: 4332 Part-IV[29], the loss of weight of the stabilized material does 
not exceed 14 per cent after 12 cycles of wetting and drying. In cold and snow bound regions like 
Arunachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh etc., durability should also 
be evaluated by freezing and thawing test and the loss of weight should be less than 14 per cent 
after 12 cycles as per BIS:4332 Part-IV.
8.3	
Crack Relief Layer
In case of pavements with CTB, a crack relief layer, provided between the bituminous layer and 
the cementitious base, delays the reflection of crack from the CTB layer in to the bituminous 
layer. The crack relief layer may consist of dense graded crushed aggregates of 100 mm 
thickness conforming to MoRTH[23] Specifications for Wet Mix Macadam (WMM) or the Stress 
Absorbing Membrane Interlayer (SAMI) of elastomeric modified binder applied at the rate of 
10 – 12 kg/10 m2 covered with 0.1 m3 of 11.2 mm aggregates. For the pavement analysis, the


IRC:37-2018
27
SAMI layer is not considered as a structural layer, i.e., it shall not be included in the pavement 
composition for pavement analysis. 
The resilient modulus of a well-graded granular layer depends upon the gradation and the 
confinement pressure to which it is subjected to under the application of wheel load. A typical 
value of 450 MPa[30, 31] is used for the sandwiched aggregate layer for the analysis of pavement. 
The granular crack relief layer shall be compacted to 100% of the modified Proctor compaction 
maximum density. 
Poisson’s ratio of the granular crack relief layer may be taken as 0.35. 
8.4	
Bitumen Emulsion/Foamed Bitumen Treated Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement 
(RAP) Base
Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) material with or without virgin aggregates, treated with 
foamed bitumen or bitumen emulsion can be used as the base layer. The minimum thickness of 
the emulsion/foam bitumen stabilised RAP layer shall be 100 mm.
The resilient modulus of the material with bitumen emulsion (SS2)/foamed bitumen shall be 
taken as 800 MPa though values as high as 3000 MPa have also been achieved on tests 
conducted on 150 mm diameter specimens. VG30 bitumen is recommended for preparation of 
the foamed bitumen used for stabilizing the RAP/RAP-aggregate material. 
Indirect Tensile Strength of 102 mm diameter Marshall specimen of the bitumen emulsion/
foamed bitumen treated material determined as per ASTM:D 6931[32] should have a minimum 
value of 100 kPa after soaking and 225 kPa in dry condition at a deformation rate of 50 mm/
minute at 25°C[33].
The recommended Poisson’s ratio is 0.35.
9. BITUMINOUS LAYERS
9.1	
General
A bituminous pavement generally consists of bituminous surfacing course and a bituminous 
base/binder course. For high traffic volume roads with a design traffic of more than 50 msa, (a) 
Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA)[34], (b) Gap Graded Mix with Rubberized Bitumen (GGRB) [35] 
and (c) Bituminous Concrete (BC) with modified binders, are recommended for surfacing 
course for durable, ageing resistant and crack resistant surface courses. For the Stone Matrix 
Asphalt (SMA) mix (recommended for high traffic volume roads) also, use of modified binders is 
preferred as it is expected that mixes with modified binders will result in longer service life and 
will be more resistant to ageing. For roads (national highways as well as non-national highways) 
with design traffic in the range of 20 to 50 msa, and for national highways with less than 20 
msa design traffic, BC with VG40 bitumen can be used for the surface course in addition to the 
aforementioned mixes. For highly stressed areas or roads in high rainfall areas and junction 
locations, mastic asphalt mix can be used as an alternative surface course. 
For non-National Highway roads with less than 20 msa design traffic, besides SMA, GGRB 
and BC (with modified binders), the mixes recommended for surface course are Bituminous 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:37-2018
28
Concrete, Semi Dense Bituminous Concrete (SDBC), Pre-Mix Carpet (PMC), Mix Seal Surfacing 
(MSS) and Surface Dressing (SD) with unmodified binders. The thin bituminous layers such as 
PC, MSS and SD shall not be considered as part of the bituminous layer for analysis of the 
pavement.
Dense Bituminous Macadam (DBM) mix with VG40 binder and confirming to IRC and MoRTH 
Specifications, shall be the material used for base/binder courses for roads with 20 msa or more 
design traffic. Dense Bituminous Macadam (DBM)/Bituminous Macadam (BM) can be used as 
base/binder courses for roads with design traffic less than 20 msa. These guidelines recommend 
VG30/VG40 bitumen for design traffic less than 20 msa and VG40 bitumen for the DBM layers 
for design traffic of 20 msa or more. For expressways and national highways, even if the design 
traffic is less than 20 msa, VG40 or modified bitumen shall be used for surface course and VG40 
bitumen shall be used for the DBM.
In view of the overlap in the viscosity ranges specified in IS:73[36] for VG30 and VG40 bitumen, 
it is recommended that the VG40 bitumen used in the surface, binder and base bituminous 
courses shall have a minimum viscosity of 3600 Poise at 60°C temperature to safeguard against 
rutting. For snow bound locations, softer binders such as VG10 may be used to limit thermal 
transverse cracking (especially if the maximum pavement temperature is less than 30°C).
If the total thickness of the bituminous layers is less than 40 mm, VG30 bitumen may be used for 
the BC/SDBC layers even if VG40 bitumen may be more appropriate from pavement temperature 
consideration. Thin pavements will deflect more under the traffic loads and stiffer VG40 mixes 
may not have adequate flexibility to undergo such large deflections. The summary of bituminous 
mixes and binders recommended in the present guidelines is presented in Table 9.1.

9.2	
Resilient Modulus of Bituminous Mixes
Resilient modulus of bituminous mixes depends upon the grade of binder, frequency/load 
application time, air voids, shape of aggregate, aggregate gradation, maximum size of the 
aggregate, bitumen content, etc. Indicative maximum values of the resilient moduli of different 
bituminous mixes with different binders are given in Table 9.2 for reference. 
The modulus values given in Table 9.2 are based on a number of laboratory tests conducted on 
bituminous mix specimens as per ASTM:4123[37] upgraded now to ASTM: D7369-09[38]. ASTM: 
D7369-09 essentially retains most of the features of ASTM 4123 but recommends that Poisson’s 
ratio also be measured. ASTM:4123 permits the use of assumed Poisson’s ratio values. These 
guidelines recommend measurement of the resilient modulus at a temperature of 35°C as per 
ASTM:4123[37] with an assumed Poisson’s ratio value of 0.35. A loading pulse of 0.1 second 
duration followed by a rest period of 0.9 second is adopted. Bituminous mixes undergo reduction 
in air void content, harden with time and the modulus value will increase due to ageing effect and 
the actual modulus values could be more than those given in Table 9.2. For the measurement 
of the resilient modulus of DBM, 150 mm diameter specimens should be used because of the 
larger size of aggregates used in the DBM mixes. 
The modulus value of bituminous mixes prepared with modified bitumen varies widely depending 
upon the modifier, duration of blending, quantity of admixtures and the extent of air blowing of 
the base bitumen. These mixes may have lower resilient modulus value than those of the mixes 
prepared with unmodified bitumen. The lower resilient modulus values of mixes with modified 
binders are due to the larger proportion of elastic/resilient deformation/strain possible with 
modified mixes. The smaller resilient modulus values do not necessarily indicate that modified 
binder mixes will have inferior performance compared to unmodified mixes. In fact, mixes with 
modified binders are, in general, expected to have better fatigue and rutting performance and 
durability compared to conventional mixes.
As mentioned previously in these guidelines, all the bituminous layers in the pavement shall be 
considered as one layer in the analysis of the pavement and will be assigned the same elastic 
properties (elastic/resilient modulus and Poisson’s ratio). Considering the possibility that the 
resilient moduli of Stone Matrix Asphalt[34], GGRB[35] and BC mixes with modified binders will 
be less than those obtained for dense graded mixes (BC and DBM) prepared with unmodified 
binders such as VG40, and taking into consideration that these surface mixes are expected 
to give much better performance than the conventional dense graded mixes with unmodified 
binders, these guidelines recommend that the bituminous layer (combination of all the bituminous 
layers) shall be assigned the modulus value of the DBM mix (bottom DBM mix if two DBM layers 
are used) for analysis and design.

The design of pavement shall be carried out based on the actual values obtained with field 
designed DBM/BM mix subject to the maximum values indicated in Table 9.2 for the selected mix 
(DBM/BM mixes with selected unmodified binder) for an average annual pavement temperature 
of 35°C. For the climatic conditions prevailing in the plains of India, the Average Annual Pavement 
Temperature is expected to be close to 35°C. If the resilient modulus value of the specimens 
prepared using the field bottom (base) bituminous mix is more than the corresponding maximum 
value indicated in Table 9.2 for 35°C, the value given in the table shall be used for the analysis 
and design.
Modified binders are not recommended for the DBM layers due to the concern about the 
recyclability of DBM layers with modified binders.

a)	
Resilient modulus shall be measured at 35°C temperature as per ASTM 4123.
	
	
For snowbound areas resilient modulus shall be measured at 20°C. The design

a reasonable estimation of the resilient modulus value. The user agencies are encouraged to 
provide feedback for their further refinement. Also refer to Clause 14.

A Poisson’s ratio value of 0.35 is recommended for the bituminous layer for analysis of the 
pavement.
The DBM layer may be constructed in a single layer or in two layers depending upon the design 
thickness requirement. When only one layer of DBM is used, DBM-1/DBM-2 (selected depending 
on the thickness of the layer) may be constructed with a suitable surface course. When the DBM 
is laid in two layers, the sequence of bituminous layers from the bottom to top is: DBM-1, DBM-2 
and a suitable surface course. 
For longer life of bituminous pavements, to avoid moisture induced distresses and for better 
bottom-up fatigue resistance, bitumen rich DBM bottom layer is recommended in these guidelines. 
The rich bottom mixes are typically designed to have more binder volume by selecting lower 
design air void content which yields more design binder content than normal. It is also a common 
practice to compact the rich bottom bituminous mixes to smaller in-place air voids. The increased 
compaction adopted for these mixes will result in mixes with good aggregate interlocking and 
will make the mixes stiffer. The increased compaction will also reduce the mix rutting that might 
be produced in the mix by secondary compaction under traffic load stresses. In view of the 
increased binder requirement, the upper limit of the voids filled with the bitumen (VFB) criterion 
for such bottom rich mixes designed as per the following criteria, shall be 80%.
For the single layer DBM, the recommended target air void content for mix design is 3.5%. The 
3.5% air void content and the corresponding volume of effective binder content shall be used for 
calculating the fatigue life using equations 3.3 and 3.4. It shall be compacted to 4.5% or lower 
air void content in the field.
For the bottom DBM layer of two-layer DBM construction, the recommended target air void 
content for mix design of the bottom DBM layer is 3.0%. The 3.0% air void content and the 
corresponding volume of effective binder content shall be used for calculating the fatigue life 
using equations 3.3 and 3.4. The mix shall be compacted to an air void content of 4% or lower 
in the field.
In case the parameters indicated above for rich bottom mixes are not achievable for any reason, 
the actual air void content achieved and the corresponding effective binder volume are to be 
used for estimation of fatigue life.
The recommendations for mix design and field compaction of the other bituminous layers (upper 
DBM layer of a two-layer DBM system and surface layer) shall be as per the prevailing applicable 
guidelines.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:37-2018
32
While it is easy to achieve a target air void content (Va) during mix design, the corresponding 
effective binder content at which the Va is achieved (for a given laboratory compaction effort) may 
vary widely depending on the variations in aggregate gradation, specific gravity of aggregates 
and the absorption of bitumen by aggregates. If water absorption of aggregates is 2.0 %, 
percentage of bitumen absorption into the surface pores of aggregates can vary from 0.8% to 
1.6% (by weight of aggregates). Hence Va and Vbe must be correctly estimated as per Asphalt 
Institute Mix Design, MS-2[10].
The minimum thicknesses of different bituminous layers shall be as per relevant MoRTH and IRC 
specifications. In the case of pavements with Cement Treated Bases (CTB) for traffic exceeding 
20 msa, the combined total thickness of surface course and base/binder course shall not be 
less than 100 mm irrespective of the actual thickness requirement obtained from structural 
consideration.
10. LONG-LIFE PAVEMENTS
A pavement having a life of fifty years or longer is generally termed as a long-life pavement or 
perpetual pavement. In the Indian context, pavements with a design traffic of 300 msa or more 
may be designed as long-life pavements. As per Asphalt Institute, MS-4, 7th edition[39], if the 
tensile strain caused by the traffic in the bituminous layer is less than 70 microstrain (considered 
to be the endurance limit of the material), the bituminous layer will never crack. Similarly, if the 
vertical subgrade strain is less than 200 microstrain, there will be practically very little rutting in 
the subgrade. For the climatic conditions prevailing in the plains of India, where the Average 
Annual Pavement Temperature may be close to 35°C, the corresponding limiting strains may 
be taken as 80 and 200 microstrains respectively. Thus, long-life pavement design involves 
selecting a suitable pavement layer combination which can keep the horizontal tensile strain and 
vertical compressive strain limited to the afore-mentioned limiting strain values corresponding 
to endurance condition. Different layers of the long life pavement have to be designed and 
constructed in such a way that only the surface course would need replacement from time to 
time. A design example is given in Annex-II.
11. PAVEMENT DESIGN PROCEDURE
11.1	
Steps involved in the Pavement Design
11.1.1	
Selecting a trial composition 
In selecting the pavement composition, the designer should be guided by the expected functional 
requirements of the layers in a high performing pavement, such as a strong subgrade, a well-
drained sub-base strong enough to withstand the construction traffic loads, a strong crack, rutting 
and moisture damage resistant bituminous base and a bituminous surfacing that is resistant to 
rutting, top-down cracking and to damages caused by exposure to environment. 
11.1.2	
Bituminous mix design and the mix resilient modulus
Sourcing of the material ingredients for the mix has to be decided and the physical requirements 
and properties of the sourced materials should be checked for their conformity with the provisions 



======================================================================
PAGE 43 of 96
======================================================================

IRC:37-2018
33
of applicable Specifications and these Guidelines. The right proportioning of the mix ingredients 
or the design mix should be arrived at by trials and testing. Where the resilient modulus is required 
to be tested in accordance with the procedures recommended in these Guidelines, the samples 
of the design mix should be appropriately tested as specified. Where the resilient modulus is 
required to be derived indirectly by using empirical equations given in these Guidelines or are to 
be adopted as per a certain recommended value, the modulus should be selected/determined 
accordingly and used for design subject to the compliance with the conditions specified in these 
Guidelines. In case the resilient modulus determined in this manner exceeds the limiting values 
specified in these Guidelines, the latter value has to be adopted. In case, it is less than the 
limiting value, the actual value should be adopted in the design. 
11.1.3	
Selecting layer thickness
The selection of trial thicknesses of various layers constituting the pavement should be based 
on the designers’ experience and subject to the minimum thicknesses recommended in these 
Guidelines and in other relevant Specifications (when there is no specific recommendation in 
these guidelines) from functional and constructability considerations. 
11.1.4	
Structural analysis of the selected pavement structure 
This is to be done by running the IITPAVE software or any other linear elastic layer programme 
using as inputs the layer thicknesses, the layer moduli, the layer Poisson’s ratio values, the 
standard axle load of 80 kN distributed on four wheels (20 kN on each wheel), and a tyre pressure 
as 0.56 MPa. For carrying out fatigue damage analysis of cement treated bases, the axle load 
under consideration and a contact pressure of 0.80 MPa will be considered. The program will 
output the stresses, strains and deflections at selected critical locations in the pavement from 
which the values of critical mechanistic parameters can be identified for design. A soft copy of the 
IITPAVE software is attached as part of this document. Details about IITPAVE and instructions 
for its installation and use are given in Annex-I. Table 11.1 gives the details of different inputs to 
be considered for the analysis.
11.1.5	
Computing the allowable strains/stresses
The allowable strains in the bituminous layer and subgrade for the selected design traffic are to 
be estimated using the fatigue and rutting performance (limiting strain) models given in these 
guidelines. The inputs to the models are the design period of pavement in terms of cumulative 
standard axles, the resilient modulus value of the bottom layer bituminous mix, and the volumetric 
proportions (air voids and effective binder) of the mix. For estimating the limiting tensile strain in 
the CTB layer, the elastic modulus of the CTB material is an input.
11.1.6	
Doing the iterations
A few iterations may be required by changing the layer thicknesses until the strains computed by 
IITPAVE are less than the allowable strains derived from performance models.
11.1.7	
Check for cumulative fatigue damage
Where cementitious bases are used in the pavement, the cumulative fatigue damage analysis 
is required to be done as done in the case of rigid pavement design to make sure that the 
cumulative damage caused by the expected axle load spectrum does not exceed unity.

11.1.8	
The minimum thicknesses, as specified in the guidelines, shall be provided to ensure 
intended functional requirement of the layer.
11.2	
The design procedures are explained through illustrative worked out design examples 
given in Annex-II of this document.
11.3	
In the case of relatively low traffic volume roads, with design traffic not exceeding 
50 msa, and in situations where investigations prior to design are not feasible on account of 
exigencies, a thickness design catalogue is provided in these Guidelines to help the highway 
authorities in expeditious project approval and procurement. It needs to be borne in mind that 
the design assumptions made in the preparation of the catalogues need to be fulfilled in actual 
execution. In case there are deviations from these assumptions, the design should be revisited 
following the procedure explained in para 11.1 above.
11.4	
For design traffic lower than 2 msa, the recommendations of IRC:SP:72[5] may be 
used.
11.5	
The designer is expected to apply his/her judgment and experience in the choice of 
pavement materials and layer thickness as a number of options of pavements are suggested in 
the guidelines.

12 PAVEMENT STRUCTURAL DESIGN CATALOUGES
12.1	
The pavement structural catalogues presented in these guidelines for design traffic 
levels up to 50 msa are intended for initial cost estimation and for guidance only. For all roads 
with more than 2 msa design traffic, the design shall be carried out using site specific inputs 
to satisfy the mechanistic-empirical performance models given in these guidelines which may 
require analysis of different trial pavement sections using IITPAVE software. The individual layer 
thicknesses shown in the catalogues are only for illustration and the actual optimal requirement

of layer thicknesses shall be evolved based on detailed analysis. Practical considerations and 
durability of the selected layers should always be kept in mind.
12.2	
Catalogues have been given for the following six categories of pavements: (a) 
bituminous surface course with granular base and sub-base (b) bituminous surface course with 
CTSB, CTB and granular crack relief layer (c) bituminous surface course with CTSB, CTB and 
SAMI (d) bituminous surface course with CTSB and emulsion/foam bitumen stabilised RAP/
virgin aggregate (e) bituminous surface course with GSB, CTB and granular crack relief layer 
and (f) bituminous surface course with CTSB and granular base course.
12.3	
The catalogues have been developed considering 80% reliability subgrade rutting 
and fatigue cracking performance models for design traffic up to 20 msa, and using 90% models 
for higher traffic levels. It may be noted that for expressways, national highways, state highways 
and urban roads, 90% reliability should be adopted irrespective of the design traffic.
Resilient moduli of 2000 MPa (VG30 binder mix for BC as well as DBM) and 3000 MPa (VG40 
binder mix for BC as well as DBM) were considered for less than 20 msa and 20 to 50 msa 
categories respectively. It may be noted that, for expressways and national highways, even if 
the design traffic is less than 20 msa, VG40 bitumen shall be used for surface as well as DBM 
layers.
In the absence of axle load spectrum data, in the development of the design catalogues, the CTB 
layer was checked only for one fatigue criterion given by equation 3.5. However, it is essential 
to check the CTB thickness with project specific axle load spectrum as mentioned in these 
guidelines.
The values of RF factor used in Equation 3.5 are taken as 2 for design traffic less than 10 msa 
and as 1 for design traffic of 10 msa or more.
The mix volumetric parameters used are: Va of 3.5% and Vbe of 11.5% and fatigue equation ‘C’ 
factor of 2.35 for pavement cases (2), (3) and (5) mentioned in 12.2. For (1), (4) and (6) pavement 
cases, for design traffic of 5, 10 and 20 msa, the Va, Vbe and ‘C” factor values considered are 
4.5%, 10.5% and 1.12 and for 20, 30, 40 and 50 msa, the values are 3.5%, 11.5% and 2.35 
respectively. 
Figs. 12.1 to 12.48 present the design catalogues developed for the six pavement composition 
types mentioned in section 12.2. The catalogues were developed based on the assumptions 
discussed in the above section. Example calculations for 10% effective subgrade CBR case are 
presented in Annex-III. Some of the thicknesses (especially those of bituminous layers) given 
in the thickness templates have been selected based on the minimum thickness requirement of 
bituminous layer for pavements with CTB base.
A large number of pavement design options are possible for less than 50 msa design traffic with 
varying values of (a) design traffic (b) effective subgrade CBR (c) reliability (d) mix volumetric 
parameters and the corresponding ‘C’ factor (e) pavement composition (f) classification of highway 
and (g) binder used with the base (DBM/BM) mix. It must be noted that the catalogues are for the 
specific inputs considered for developing them. The designers or the user agencies are advised 
to get familiarized with the use of IITPAVE software (for which very detailed guidelines are given 
in Annex-I) so that pavements can be designed with any selected combination of inputs.

13 DESIGN IN FROST AFFECTED AREAS
13.1	
In areas susceptible to frost action, the design will have to be related to the actual 
depth of penetration and severity of the frost. At the subgrade level, fine grained clayey and silty 
soils are more susceptible to ice formation, but freezing conditions could also develop within the 
pavement structure if water has a chance of ingress from above.
13.2	
One remedy against frost attack is to increase the depth of construction to correspond 
to the depth of frost penetration, but this may not always be economically practicable. As a 
general rule, it would not be advisable to provide total pavement thickness less than 450 mm 
even when the CBR value of the subgrade warrants a smaller thickness. In addition, the materials 
used for building up the crust should be frost resistant.
13.3	
Another precaution against frost attack is that water should not be allowed to collect at 
the subgrade level which may happen on account of infiltration through the pavement surface or 
verges or due to capillary rise from a high water table. Whereas capillary rise can be prevented 
by subsoil drainage measures and cut-offs, infiltrating surface water can be checked only by 
providing a suitable surfacing course and a subsurface drainage system.
14 QUALITY CONTROL TESTS DURING CONSTRUCTION
The recommendations contained in Clause 903 of Specifications of the Ministry of Road Transport 
and Highways for Road and Bridge Works[23], IRC:120[33], IRC:SP:89[28], IRC:SP:59[26] 
about different tests along with their frequencies for different types of specifications to ensure 
quality in the construction are to be followed. In addition, the following tests are also required for 
addressing the specifications/aspects not covered in the documents referred to above.

APPENDIX-A
The principles and approach followed in these guidelines
A.1	
An Overview
Highway pavements should be safe and serviceable. They should be capable of carrying the 
loads coming on it during their life period without unacceptable levels of failures. Unlike structures 
where the failure is usually followed by complete collapse, failure in pavements is not sudden 
but usually by gradual deterioration over time. At some stage in its life, when the deterioration 
renders it unserviceable to the users, the pavement is assumed as failed. Thus, safety criteria 
in pavement design are defined by serviceability thresholds (such as acceptable cracking 
and rutting), which, if breached, the design should be considered as unsafe and pavement 
unserviceable.
A.2	
Cracking in Bituminous Layers
Cracking in pavement can occur in three primary modes: (a) bottom up cracking, (b) top down 
cracking, and (c) low temperature cracking.
A.2.1	
Bottom up cracking 
A.2.1.1	
Cracks may initiate at the bottom of any bound layer due to fatigue phenomenon 
reducing the effective layer thickness causing the cracks to progress and move upwards with 
repeated application of traffic loads. When the whole layer cracks, the crack progresses into the 
upper layer and will eventually appear on the surface of the pavement as alligator cracks. Mixes 
should have adequate flexural tensile strength and should be sufficiently flexible at intermediate 
temperatures at which the traffic loads (except the very small proportion of traffic which is 
applied when the pavement has peak summer or peak winter temperatures) to resist fatigue 
cracking caused by repeated flexure under traffic loads. Stiffer mixes usually have larger flexural 
tensile strength compared to the softer ones. However, the higher stiffness is usually associated 
with more brittleness. The fatigue cracking in bituminous layers has been addressed in these 
guidelines using a performance model which gives limiting tensile strain value for a given design 
traffic level and for a selected mix.
A.2.1.2	
The fatigue cracking susceptibility of the bituminous layer can be reduced by controlling 
the flexural tensile strains at the bottom of the bituminous layer. This can be done by (i) providing 
a strong support from the underlying layers which reduces the deflection in the bituminous layer 
(ii) using stiffer bituminous mix which reduces the tensile strain in the material and (iii) using a 
mix that is adequately elastic to recover from damage. 
A.2.1.3	
A strong subgrade is essential for giving firm support to the upper pavement layers. 
The elastic modulus of the subgrade (required as input for analysis using linear elastic layered 
theory) is recommended to be estimated from its CBR value using the empirical equations 
given in the guidelines. When there is significant difference in the mechanical properties of the 
material used in the prepared subgrade compared to the material used in the embankment, it

IRC:37-2018
57
is proposed to estimate an equivalent subgrade property (effective modulus) for use in design. 
These guidelines recommend the use of subgrades with a minimum effective CBR of 5% for 
roads with more than 450 commercial vehicles per day. These Guidelines also restricts the value 
of the effective modulus of the subgrade that can be used for design to a maximum value of 
100 MPa.
A.2.1.4	
Since determining the resilient (elastic) modulus of the granular material used in 
the sub-base and base layers requires sophisticated equipment and skill, it is proposed to 
estimate the modulus value of the granular layer from a widely used empirical equation for 
which the elastic modulus value of the supporting layer and the thickness of the granular 
layer are inputs. 
A.2.1.5	
In situations where granular materials are placed over cementitious materials, e.g. 
granular base over cementitious sub-base and granular crack relief layer over cemented bases, 
the layer Mr cannot be estimated directly using the same empirical equation as mentioned 
above. Though models are available in literature for estimating the modulus of granular layer 
based on the state of stress prevailing in the material, no such rigorous analysis is proposed 
in these guidelines for estimating the resilient modulus of the granular materials. A resilient 
modulus value of 450 MPa is proposed for the crack relief layer of WMM placed over CTB. In 
case of a granular base placed over cementitious sub-base (CTSB), the recommended values 
are 300 MPa and 350 MPa for natural gravel and crushed rock respectively. 
A.2.1.6	
The modulus values of cemented materials are usually estimated from their 
Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) values (if the flexural modulus cannot be determined 
directly). The values estimated from the laboratory measured UCS are not adopted directly 
for analysis and design for two reasons, (i) these are laboratory values of the UCS tested 
on ‘un-cracked’ material samples while in the field, the material, if used in the sub-base, will 
start cracking immediately on application of the construction traffic and progressively loses 
its strength during construction as well as ‘in-service’ stages till it reaches the fully cracked 
terminal condition when it will behave more like a granular material rather than a rigid layer, 
(ii) higher the UCS wider will be the cracks, which have the chance of reflection into the 
overlying layer leading to an undesirable situation for pavement performance. Therefore, 
lower UCS materials are targeted to use in pavement layers. 
A.2.1.7	
The design elastic modulus of cemented sub-base materials is capped at a relatively 
low value of 600 MPa because of the possibility of the layer getting cracked right from the 
start. As far as the cementitious bases are concerned, the design modulus is recommended as 
5000 MPa. These recommended values of modulus values are subject to the condition that the 
laboratory values of the UCS are within the ranges specified in these guidelines.
A.2.1.8	
Testing the durability of the cementitious base materials is compulsory. This is because 
the low UCS materials have small quantity of cement binder and there may be the likelihood of 
inadequate binding of the materials, especially if the proportion of fines in the materials is high. 
The loss of weight in the ‘wetting- drying’ or ‘freeze-thaw’ test as relevant will reveal whether the 
cemented material will be durable when subjected to moisture cycles and other adverse climatic 
conditions.



======================================================================
PAGE 68 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:37-2018
58
A.2.1.9	
The cementitious bases have to be analysed for cumulative fatigue damage as 
recommended in these Guidelines. Fatigue performance models have been recommended in 
these guidelines for cemented bases. Flexural strength (modulus of rupture) of the CTB material 
is necessary for carrying out the cumulative fatigue damage analysis. The guidelines recommend 
that the flexural strength of the cement treated materials may be taken as 20 per cent of the UCS 
value.
A.2.1.10	 Where Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) material (with or without addition of virgin 
aggregate), stabilised with foamed bitumen or emulsion is used as base, a conservative value 
of 800 MPa is recommended as the modulus value of the material for design provided the RAP 
mixes are designed and tested as per the procedure recommended in these Guidelines.
A.2.1.11	 The resilient moduli of bituminous mixes used in the surface and base/binder layers 
are important inputs affecting the distribution of stresses and strains in different layers of the 
pavement, rutting and top-down cracking resistance of the upper layers and bottom-up cracking 
of the lower bituminous layer. The resilient modulus of bituminous mix varies over a wide range 
depending upon the aggregate gradation selected and the grade of bitumen used besides other 
influencing conditions. The temperature for which the Mr value should be considered for design 
is 35°C and the recommended test procedure is as in ASTM D4123.
A.2.2	
Top down cracking
A.2.2.1	
At the instance when the tyres come in contact with the road surface, they expand 
laterally and push the pavement surface at their edges. At the next instance when the tyre moves 
over, the laterally pushed surface should be elastic enough to pull itself back. If it is not, the 
surface will crack at the wheel edges along the longitudinal direction and the crack will propagate 
downwards from the surface. Another reason for top down cracking is the age hardening of 
bitumen. With age and exposure to sun light and Ultra Violet rays, the volatiles in bitumen 
are lost and the binder becomes hard and brittle, which significantly increases the cracking 
susceptibility of the material.
A.2.2.2	
The objective of design for controlling top down cracking should be to use mixes 
that can accommodate more bitumen to have thicker films which reduce the rate of ageing, 
to minimize the effect of ageing by using ageing resistant modified binders in the surfacing 
course, to improve the visco-elastic properties of the binder by using binders that have better 
elastic recovery. These Guidelines recommend Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA) and Gap Graded 
Rubberised Bitumen (GGRB) and Bituminous Concrete (BC) with modified binders, for high 
traffic (more than 50 msa) roads. In other cases, stiff grade binders or modified binders are 
considered suitable for surface course mixes.
A.3	
Rutting in Bituminous Pavements
A.3.1	
Rutting in pavement occurs in two ways: (a) Due to deformation in subgrade and 
other unbound layers (granular sub-base and base and (b) due to rutting in bituminous layer. 
The guidelines provide limiting strain criteria for controlling rutting in subgrade. Even through 
no separate criteria are included in the guidelines for rutting in the granular layers, controlling 
the vertical compressive strain on top of subgrade indirectly results in the control of strains in 



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:37-2018
59
the upper granular layers. Larger elastic strains in the subgrade and unbound granular layers 
(which are calculated by linear elastic layered theory) are generally expected to produce larger 
plastic strains. Thicker bituminous layers and stronger sub-bases/bases (such as CTSB and 
CTB) reduce the subgrade strains significantly. 
A.3.2	
Even if the subgrade or unbound granular layers do not undergo rutting, the bituminous 
layers may do. This happens in various situations such as when the bituminous layers are not 
initially properly compacted and undergo large secondary compaction during their service life, 
the binder used is of a softer grade, has less elasticity, high pavement temperatures and high 
wheel load stresses. It is necessary to use sufficiently stiffer mixes with binders that will have 
less plastic deformation at high temperatures and high stresses, especially in the upper layers. 
At lower depths, the stresses as well as the temperatures will be less compared to the surface 
layers and thus the lower bituminous layers are less susceptible to rutting.
A.4	
Structural Analysis of Pavement
A.4.1	
These Guidelines continue to follow the Mechanistic-Empirical approach for pavement 
analysis as in its previous two versions. The stresses and strains in the pavement layers are 
analysed by the software IITPAVE, which requires inputs from users in terms of number of layers, 
their thicknesses and elastic moduli. Standard loading of 80 kN acting over four wheels (two dual 
wheel sets on each side of the axle) at 0.56 MPa uniform contact pressure is considered for the 
analysis. For evaluating the CTB bases, a contact pressure of 0.80 MPa shall be considered.
A.4.2	
The trial pavement composition and layer thicknesses are selected and the stresses 
and strains at the critical locations are computed by running the IITPAVE software. The 
permissible strains are obtained from the fatigue and rutting models, for a given design traffic 
(csa). If the computed strains are larger than those derived from the model (limiting strains), the 
trial composition and layer thicknesses are changed until the values come within the permissible 
limits.
A.5	
Effect of Climate and Environment on Pavement Performance
A.5.1	
The discussion so far has been on the response of the pavement to load repetitions 
and on the design of pavement to limit the cracking and rutting. Climate and environment are 
other factors, which can affect the performance of pavements. 
A.5.2	
Water entering the cracks from bottom (bottom up cracks), top (top down cracks) or 
sides (shoulders or medians) may strip the bitumen leading to loss of bond between aggregates 
and bitumen, and may reduce the strength of granular and subgrade layers.
A.5.3	
Binders age when exposed to environment and lose volatiles, harden, become brittle 
and then crack. Thus, it is necessary to use an appropriate grade of bitumen, with modifications 
if required, in the surfacing layer to make it resistant to the oxidation of bitumen.
A.5.4	
At high temperatures, the binder and hence the mix becomes softer and is susceptible 
to rutting. At low temperatures, the mix is likely to become brittle and is susceptible to cracking. 
Hence, binders that are less temperature susceptible and have adequate properties at high as 
well low service temperatures are expected to yield better performance.

A.5.5	
The resilient modulus of bituminous layers is quite sensitive to temperature. At high 
temperatures, the modulus is low and at low temperatures it is high. The maximum pavement 
temperature is important for understanding which grade of binder would be the most suitable 
for designing bituminous mixes. One model, based on research carried elsewhere, has the 
potential to predict the average seven day maximum surface temperature of the pavement from 
the corresponding air temperatures. 
T20 mm	
= [(Tair - 0.00618Lat2 + 0.2289Lat + 42.2) * (0.9545)] – 17.78
(A-1)
Where,	
T20mm	=	
Pavement temperature (°C) at a depth of 20 mm
	
Lat 	 =	
Latitude of the place
	
Tair	
=	
Average of maximum temperatures (°C) of seven days
Based on this equation and for the maximum temperatures prevailing in different parts of the 
country, it is reasonable to consider that in most parts of the country, the maximum pavement 
temperature may reach around 70°C. 
A.5.6	
The appropriate grade of binder for a given project site should ideally be the one that 
is suitable for the range of variation in the pavement temperature. Even though there appears 
to be some gap in the existing standards with regard to the suitability of binders in extreme 
temperature conditions that are likely to prevail in the country, it is recommended that the grade 
suitable for temperatures nearest to the specified maximum could be adopted. Very broadly, the 
stiffest grade of available bitumen should be used where the pavement temperature is expected 
to rise above 60°C and the softer grades under low temperature conditions. 
A.6	
Mix Design
A.6.1	
Bituminous binder/base courses and the surfacing courses have different requirements. 
The base is subjected to flexural tension and, therefore, needs to have sufficiently large stiffness 
(modulus) to reduce strains. Larger stiffness is usually achieved with dense aggregate grading 
as in DBM. Fatigue cracking starts at the bottom of the base. The mix also has to be sufficiently 
flexible to be more compliant with the deflections to which the layer will be subjected to under 
traffic loads. The fatigue life of the layer/mix can be increased by increasing the per cent of bitumen 
in the mix, but the dense grading of DBM does not allow enough void space to accommodate 
more bitumen without reducing the air voids. More bitumen and less air voids in the DBM would 
increase the fatigue life. Top down cracking starts at the surfacing at the edges of the wheel 
because the inflation pressure of the tyres at the contact surface deforms it across the wheel 
path and the mix should be elastic enough to recover this deformation after the passage of the 
wheels. The binder in the surfacing layer should, therefore, have high elastic recovery. Surfacing 
is also exposed to atmosphere and thereby to ageing. Therefore, the surfacing material should 
be age resistant. The surfacing is also exposed to water damage by stripping or displacement of 
the bitumen film by water, and therefore, it should be resistant to water damage.
A.6.2	
Some considerations for design of bituminous mix for base layer
A high resilient modulus of DBM (typical base/binder course mix) should be targeted in the 
design, which in comparison to mixes having low or moderate resilient modulus values, will 



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:37-2018
61
result in smaller tensile strain and less plastic strain under the same set of loading and hence 
will result in smaller DBM layer thicknesses. Thus, a higher resilient modulus mix will be more 
appropriate to resist both cracking (unless the mix becomes too brittle) and rutting. 
A high resilient modulus mix can be achieved by a strong granular skeleton of aggregates 
represented by their grading. DBM grading-I having higher maximum nominal size of 
aggregates will have a stronger aggregate structure compared to DBM Grading-II of MoRTH. 
The choice between the two aggregate gradings, however, is also dependent upon the 
layer thickness, which should not be less than 2.5 times the maximum nominal size of the 
aggregate.
The lower layer DBM mix has to be rich in bitumen and low in air voids. The lower layer DBM, 
subject to the thickness and nominal size limitations, should be in Grading-I. The larger size 
fractions of aggregates and lower surface area would enable more void space to accommodate 
additional quantity of bitumen and thicker coating of aggregate particles by bitumen. The 
likelihood of rutting of the layer is minimal for two reasons, first because the lower layer is 
subject to lower stresses as the intensity of the load decreases with depth, and secondly the 
maximum temperatures of the bottom bituminous layer will be significantly smaller compared 
to the maximum temperatures applicable for the surface layer. Also, the degree of secondary 
compaction in the bottom layer will be less due to the fact that the bottom layer will have more 
confining stresses than the upper layers.
A part of the quantity of bitumen used in the mix is lost in the aggregate pores where the 
aggregates have porosity even though it is within permissible limits. This will reduce the effective 
quantity of bitumen in the mix, which might make the mix deficient in bitumen. It is necessary that 
the binder quantity lost due to absorption by aggregates should be carefully estimated during the 
mix design process. 
Ingress of water into the DBM layer from shoulder and median needs to be prevented by taking 
adequate measures so that stripping and loss of bond between aggregates and Bitumen does 
not happen.
A.6.3 	
Some considerations for design of bituminous mixes for surfacing layer
Surfacing layer should have good elastic recovery property, which means that the binder should 
have less plastic deformation at higher temperatures. The surfacing layer should have adequate 
binder to make it durable. Selecting surface mixes in which more binder can be used has three 
main advantages; first, it will provide better bonding of aggregate and binder; second, on exposure 
to atmosphere it will resist the effects of oxidation and ageing, (with the resulting reduction in the 
top-down cracking susceptibility) and third, resistance to moisture damage.
For accommodating more binder, the aggregates should have more void space to accommodate 
the additional binder. This is somewhat difficult if the grading is a dense one as used in BC. The 
grading has to be opened up while retaining the granular load bearing skeleton that gives strength. 
Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA) and Gap-Graded Rubberised Bitumen (GGRB) are examples of 
such mixes. These Guidelines strongly recommend SMA and GGRB as surfacing layers and BC 
with modified binders on all important roads having design traffic more than 50 msa.

A.7	
Tests and Design Documentation
A.7.1	
Design has to be based on a number of tests conducted in accordance with the 
procedures indicated in the main document at the appropriate places. The tests on works 
and their frequencies are enumerated in Section 14. The designer has to plan all the required 
tests at different points of time such as when selecting material sources, at the time of delivery 
of materials, before using the material for preparation of specimens, at the time of testing of 
specimens; and at different places such as at the supplier’s premises, in the laboratory, in the 
stock yards/storage tanks, in the mixing plants, in the field, etc.
A.7.2	
After material sources are selected, the designer needs to make sure that the 
supply from the source will be available for the entire project, otherwise the design has to be 
changed with change in material source. Conformity of all the material ingredients to the relevant 
specifications and the procedures to these Guidelines need to be ensured.
A.7.3	
A design documentation comprising the complete design including the drawings, 
sketches, plans, assumptions made, if any, time and location referenced test results that the 
design is based on has to be prepared and made available to the Project Authority for monitoring 
the performance of the designed pavement over time.
A.8	
Performance Monitoring
These Guidelines strongly recommend that the Project Authorities monitor over time the 
performance of the designed pavement as laid in the field to validate the adopted design and to 
further refine the models and the procedures used in the design. This should be done by 
	
i)	
Measuring a set of pavement performance parameters: surface irregularity, 
rutting, alligator cracking, top down cracking. 
	
ii)	
Observing other kinds of distresses: age hardening, raveling, potholes, bleeding, 
etc.
	
iii)	
Investigating the distresses observed, if any; core samples of distressed portions. 
	
iv)	
Gathering the air and pavement temperature data.

Annex-I
Installation and Use of IITPAVE Software
I.1	
Salient Features of IITPAVE
IITPAVE software has been developed for the analysis of linear elastic layered pavement 
system. The stresses, strains and deflections caused at different locations in a pavement 
by a uniformly distributed single load applied over a circular contact area at the surface of 
the pavement can be computed using this software. The effect of additional loads (which 
should also be uniformly distributed loads over circular contact areas) was considered using 
superposition principle. The single vertical load applied at the surface is described in terms 
of (a) contact pressure and radius of contact area OR (b) Wheel load and contact pressure 
OR (c) Wheel load and radius of contact area. For IITPAVE, wheel load and contact pressure 
are the load inputs. The pavement inputs required are the elastic properties (elastic/resilient 
moduli and Poisson’s ratio values of all the pavement layers) and the thicknesses of all the 
layers (excluding subgrade). IITPAVE software, in its current version, can be used to analyze 
pavements with a maximum of ten layers including the subgrade. If the number of layers in 
the pavement is more than ten, different layers of similar nature (eg. granular, bituminous) 
can be combined and considered as one layer. Cylindrical co-ordinate system is followed in 
the program. Thus, the location of any element in the pavement is defined by (a) depth of the 
location of the element from the surface of the pavement and (b) the radial distance of the 
element measured from the vertical axis of symmetry (along the centre of the circular contact 
area of one wheel load).
I.2	
Installation of IITPAVE
For installing the software, copy the IRC_37_IITPAVE folder supplied along with these guidelines 
into your system and install Java (if not already installed in your computer) by clicking on 
jre-7u2-windows-i586.exe file. Your system needs to be connected to the internet for 
doing this.

Click on Design New Pavement Section to give inputs for the analysis of the 
selected pavement section.
	
(d)	
The inputs to be entered are:
	
(i)	
Number of pavement layers including subgrade (if all the bituminous 
layers are taken as one bituminous layer and all the granular layers are 
taken as one layer, then the number of layers is 3 (bituminous layer, 
granular layer and subgrade).
	
(ii)	
Resilient modulus/Elastic modulus values of all the layers in MPa
	
(iii)	 Poisson’s ratio values of all the layers

(e)	
Single wheel load: For the purpose of calculation of critical strains such as 
vertical compressive strain on top of subgrade, horizontal tensile strain at the 
bottom of bituminous layer and horizontal tensile strain at the bottom of cement 
treated layers, since the analysis is done for a standard axle of 80 kN, a single 
wheel load of 20000 (N) is given as input. For carrying out cumulative fatigue 
damage analysis of CTB layers, the tensile stress/strain at the bottom of the CTB 
layer has to be calculated for different axle loads. For this, the IITPAVE will be 
run with different single wheel loads corresponding to the axle load considered, 
For example, if tensile stress due to a single axle load (with dual wheels) of 
100 kN is to be calculated, a single wheel load of 25,000 (N) is given as input. 
For estimating the effective subgrade strength as per para 6.4 of the guidelines, 
select a single wheel load of 40,000 (N).

(f)	
Tyre (contact) pressure: For calculation of the vertical compressive strain on 
top of the subgrade and the horizontal tensile strain at the bottom of bituminous 
layer, a contact pressure of 0.56 MPa is considered. For analyzing the tensile 
strain or tensile stress at the bottom of the CTB base for carrying out fatigue 
damage analysis of CTB bases using equations 3.5 to 3.7, the contact pressure 
suggested is 0.80 MPa. The bituminous layer bottom-up fatigue cracking and 
subgrade rutting performance models have been developed/calibrated with the 
strains calculated with standard axle (80 kN) loading and a contact pressure of 
0.56 MPa and hence, these inputs should not be changed.

The output screen displays options for the mode of output to be viewed either through “Open 
file editor” or “view here”. Once either of the options is chosen the output page reports all the 
input data and gives the computed values of identified stresses, strains and deflections for the 
locations (represented by the depth (Z) of the location measured from pavement surface, and 
the radial distance (R) of the location measured from the centre of the circular contact area of 
the load) selected. The mechanistic parameters reported in the output page are: vertical stress 
(SigmaZ), tangential stress (SigmaT), radial stress (SigmaR), shear stress (TaoRZ), vertical 
deflection (DispZ), vertical strain (epz), horizontal tangential strain (epT), and horizontal radial 
strain (epR)
For locations on the interface of two layers, the analysis will be done twice: (a) assuming the

For the results of pavement analysis presented in the screen shot of the output page, the critical 
mechanistic parameter, horizontal tensile strain (εt), will be the largest of the tangential and radial 
strains at the bottom of the bituminous layer (layer above the interface between bituminous 
layer and granular layer) computed at two radial distances of ‘0’ and ‘155’. Thus, horizontal 
tensile strain (εt) will be taken as 0.0001283 (0.1283*10-3) which is the maximum out of the 
four strain values (tangential and radial at ‘0’ and ‘155’ mm radial distances), i.e., 0.0001283, 
0.0001249, 0.00008320 and 0.00006056 (shown in rectangular boxes). Note that the values 
have been taken from the upper line of the two sets of results reported for the interface between 
the bituminous layer and granular layer (at a depth of 140 mm). Similarly, for this pavement, 
vertical compressive strain (εv) will be taken from the results corresponding to the lower line (with 
“L”) of the two sets of results available for the interface between granular layer and subgrade. 
Thus, the vertical compressive strain (εv) value of 0.0002053 (0.2053*10-3) which is the larger 
of the two strain values obtained for the interface between the subgrade and the granular layer 
(at radial distances of ‘0’ and ‘155’ mm), i.e., 0.0002053 and 0.000193 (shown in rectangular 
boxes).
Positive stresses and strains are “tensile” whereas Negative stresses and strains are 
“Compressive”. Only the absolute values without the (+) or (-) sign will be used in the performance 
models given by equations 3.1 to 3.6.

Worked out Examples for Pavement Design
II.1	
Estimation of Effective Subgrade Modulus/CBR
Problem: If the CBR of the soil used in the upper 500 mm of embankment is 8% and the CBR of 
the borrow soil used for preparing the 500 mm thick compacted subgrade above embankment is 
20%, what is the effective subgrade Modulus/CBR for design of flexible pavement?
Solution:
Elastic modulus of the prepared (upper 500 mm) embankment soil	 = 17.6*(8)0.64 = 66.6 MPa
Elastic modulus of the select borrow material	
	
	
	
= 17.6*(20)0.64 = 119.7 MPa
Consider a two-layer elastic system consisting of 500 mm of select borrow soil of modulus 
119.7 MPa and the semi-infinite embankment soil of modulus 66.6 MPa as shown in Fig. II.1. 
Fig. II.1 Two-Layer Pavement System with Subgrade and Embankment
Consider the Poisson’s ratio value of both the layers to be 0.35. Apply a single load of 40,000 N 
at a contact pressure of 0.56 MPa. Radius of circular contact area for this load and contact 
pressure = 150.8 mm. Calculate surface deflection at the centre of the load (Point A in Fig. II.1) 
using IIPAVE (no of layers = 2; elastic moduli of 119.7 MPa and 66.6 MPa; Poisson’s ratio of 0.35 
for both the layers; thickness of 500 mm for upper layer; single wheel load of 40000 N, analysis 
points = 1; Depth = 0 mm; Radial distance = 0 mm. For this input data, surface deflection = 1.41 
mm from IITPAVE.
For an equivalent single layer system, the modulus value of the single layer which will produce 
the same surface deflection of 1.41 mm for the same load and for a Poisson’s ratio of 0.35
	
=	
[2(1−μ2)pα]/δ
	
=	
[2(1-0.352)*0.56*150.8]/1.41=105.10 MPa
As per these design guidelines, the effective modulus value will be limited to 100 MPa for design 
purpose. The corresponding CBR (using equation 6.3) is 15.82 % for 105.1 MPa. For a restricted 
modulus value of 100 MPa, the corresponding effective CBR can be reported as 15.1 %. The 
equivalent single layer subgrade which gave the same surface deflection as that given by the 
two-layer system is shown in Fig. II.2.

Design Example to check the Adequacy of Granular Sub-base Thickness
Problem: Determine the thickness of the GSB layer required over a foundation having an 
effective CBR of 5 % to carry construction material required for construction of WMM layer over 
GSB.
Solution: 
	
•	
Effective Subgrade CBR = 5 %. Hence, resilient modulus of subgrade may be 
taken as 50 MPa (10X5 = 50 MPa)
	
•	
Select a trial thickness of 150 mm for the granular sub-base
	
•	
Assume that 200 repetitions of dumpers will be required for laying 250 mm thick 
WMM layer over a single lane of length 2.0 km stretch 
	
•	
Assume that the load on the rear tandem axle of the dumper is 240 kN and that 
on the front axle is 80 kN.
	
•	
Consider the 240 kN tandem axle as two 120 kN single axles
	
•	
Thus, the VDF of a dumper = 2x(120/80)4 + (80/65)4 =12.41
	
•	
Total standard axle load repetitions = 200 x 12.41 = 2483. Design construction 
traffic to be considered is the traffic thus estimated or 10,000 standard axles, 
whichever is more
	
•	
Allowable vertical subgrade strain for 10000 repetitions of SA = 2433 x 10-6 
(=0.002433)
	
•	
Computed (using IITPAVE) vertical subgrade strain for a standard axle for the 
two-layer system (subgrade and granular sub-base) with Subgrade modulus = 
50 MPa, granular sub-base modulus = 0.2*((150)0.45)*50 = 95 MPa and Poisson’s 
ratio of 0.35 for both layers, is 4324 x 10-6 > 2433 x 10-6
	
•	
Hence, the thickness of 150 mm GSB is deficient. Increase the thickness to 
250 mm
	
•	
Mr of the GSB = 119 MPa (using Equation 7.1)
	
•	
The computed vertical subgrade strain= 2179 x 10-6 (shown in the box in 
Fig. II.3) < 2433 x 10-6 hence safe (Fig. II.3 shows the IITPAVE output for this 
analysis).

(vii)	 Marshall mix design carried out on the bituminous mix to be used in the bottom 
bituminous layer (DBM) for an air void content of 3 % resulted in an effective 
bitumen content (by volume) of 11.5 %
Solution:
	
(i)	
Lateral Distribution factor 	
= 0.75 (for each direction)
	
(ii)	
Initial directional traffic	 	
= 2500 CVPD (assuming 50 per cent in each 
direction)
	
(iii)	 Vehicle Damage Factor (VDF) 	= 5.2
	
(iv)	 Cumulative number of standard axles to be catered for in the design
	
	
N =

(vi)	 Effective resilient modulus of Subgrade = 17.6(7.0)0.64 = 62 MPa (less than 
100 MPa, the upper limit)
	
(vii)	 Since the design traffic is more than 50 msa, provide a SMA/GGRB or BC with 
modified bitumen surface course and DBM binder/base layer with VG40 with

(viii)	 Select a trial section with 190 mm total bituminous layer (provide 40 mm thick 
surface layer, 70 mm thick DBM-II, 80 mm thick bottom rich DBM-I); 250 mm 
thick granular base (WMM) and 230 mm thick granular sub-base (GSB). Total 
thickness of granular layer = 480 mm
	
(ix)	 Resilient modulus of the granular layer = 0.2 x (480)0.45 x 62 = 200 MPa
	
(x)	
Use 90 % reliability performance models for subgrade rutting and bituminous 
layer cracking (design traffic > 20 msa)
	
(xi)	 Allowable vertical compressive strain on subgrade for a design traffic of 131 msa 
and for 90 % reliability (using equation 3.2) = 0.000301 (0.301 X 10-03)
	
(xii)	 Allowable horizontal tensile strain at the bottom of bituminous layer for a design 
traffic of 131 msa, 90 % reliability, air void content of 3 % and effective binder 
volume of 11.5 %, and a resilient modulus of 3000 MPa for bottom rich bottom 
DBM layer (DBM-I) (using Equation 3.4) = 0.000150 (0.150 X 10-03)
	
(xiii)	 Analyse the pavement using IITPAVE with the following inputs (elastic moduli: 
3000 MPa, 200 MPa, 62 MPa, Poisson’s ratio values of 0.35 for all the three 
layers, layer thicknesses of 190 mm and 480 mm). Computed Horizontal tensile 
strain = 0.000146 < 0.000150. Hence OK
	
(xiv)	 Computed vertical compressive strain = 0.000243 < allowable strain of 0.000301. 
Hence OK

Solution:
	
(i)	
Elastic Moduli values: Bituminous layer = 3000 MPa; granular crack relief layer 
= 450 MPa; CTB layer = 5000 MPa; CTSB = 600 MPa; subgrade = 62 MPa 
(effective CBR of 7 %)
	
(ii)	
Poisson’s ratio values: Bituminous, crack relief layer and subgrade = 0.35; CTSB 
and CTB = 0.25
Note:	 This example has been given only to illustrate the procedure for computation of Cumulative 
fatigue damage in Cement treated base. For complete design, the pavement has to be checked 
for limiting strains for subgrade rutting, bituminous layer fatigue cracking and CTB cracking as 
per the methodology given in example II.2. The bottom tensile strain CTB layer also shall be 
calculated for a standard axle load of 80 kN and tyre contact pressure of 0.80 MPa.

The tensile stress at the bottom of bituminous layer is computed using IITPAVE using the 
following inputs: 5 layers, Elastic moduli of 3000, 450, 5000, 600 and 62 MPa; Poisson’s ratio 
values of 0.35, 0.35, 0.25, 0.25 and 0.35; layer thicknesses of 100, 100, 120 and 250 mm; Wheel 
load of 47500 (N) for the first axle load group (single axle with four wheels) of 190 kN (wheel 
load = 190000/4); Tyre (contact) pressure = 0.80 MPa; Analysis points = 2; Coordinates for the 
first point (depth of 320 mm at the interface between CTB layer and CTSB at the bottom of CTB) 
and radial distance of ‘0’ mm (at the centre of one wheel load); Coordinates for the second point 
(depth of 320 mm and radial distance of ‘155’ mm (on the axis of symmetry of the dual wheel set 
(the two wheels are at a centre to centre spacing of 310 mm from each other) at the centre of 
one wheel load); and wheel load set of 2 (dual wheel). The largest tensile stress at the bottom of 
CTB layer obtained from the radial and tangential stresses calculated at two radial distances ‘0’ 
and ‘155’ mm is taken for estimating the cumulative fatigue damage. For example, for a single 
axle of 190 kN, for the radial distance of ‘0’ mm, tangential stress and radial stresses are 0.6436 
MPa and 0.4986 MPa respectively. The corresponding stresses for 155 mm radial distance are 
0.6995 MPa and 0.5561 MPa respectively. Hence, a value of 0.6995 MPa (0.70 MPa) has been 
considered as shown in the table above.

It can be seen that the total fatigue damage due to single, tandem and tridem axles is 0.48 + 3.79 
+ 1.02 = 5.29 > 1.0. Hence, the pavement is unsafe and cemented layer will crack prematurely. 
It can also be noticed that the Tandem axle weighing 400 kN causes maximum fatigue damage 
followed by Tandem axle of 380 kN. This highlights the importance of controlling overloading. It 
can be verified that the CFD will be less than 1.0 if the thickness of the CTB layer is increased 
from 120 to 160 mm.

Checking the CTB for construction traffic
	
(i)	
Assume that the gross weight of a three-axle dumper (rear tandem and front 
single) is 320 kN
	
(ii)	
Assume that the load on the rear tandem axle is 240 kN and that on the front 
steering axle is 80 kN.
	
(iii)	 Assume the 7-day flexural strength of CTB material to be 1.0 MPa (about 70 % 
of the flexural strength of 1.4 MPa) 
	
(iv)	 Assume that there will be 70 dumper trips for laying 2.0 km of 100 mm thick one 
lane wide granular crack relief layer.
	
(v)	
Allowable flexural stress for 70 X 2 = 140 repetitions of a single axle of 120 kN 
(240/2) from Equation 3.6 = 0.795 MPa. 
	
(vi)	 It can be verified that a CTB layer thickness of 160 mm (for the other pavement 
data given in this example) will be required. Analysing this as a Three-layer 
system with CTB (160 mm), CTSB (250 mm) and subgrade, the maximum 
tensile stress at the bottom of CTB layer due to 120 kN single axle works out to 
0.767 MPa

Design of Bituminous Pavement with Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) 
material treated with Foamed Bitumen/Bitumen Emulsion and Cemented Sub-base
Problem: Design a bituminous pavement with RAP material stabilised using foam bitumen as 
base material and a CTSB for the subgrade and traffic data given example II.2.
Solution:
	
(i)	
Design traffic = 131 msa
	
(ii)	
Consider a trial pavement combination of 100 mm thick bituminous layer, 
foam bitumen stabilised RAP base of 180 mm thickness and CTSB of 250 mm 
thickness
	
(iii)	 Elastic moduli: 3000 MPa for bituminous layer, 800 MPa for stabilised Rap layer, 
600 MPa for CTSB, 62 MPa for subgrade (from example II.2)
	
(iv)	 Poisson’s ratio for all the layers except CTSB = 0.35, For CTSB it is 0.25. 
	
(v)	
Allowable subgrade vertical compressive strain (for 90 % reliability, 131 msa 
traffic) = 0.000301
	
(vi)	 Allowable horizontal tensile strain (90 % reliability, 3000 MPa mix modulus, mix 
design parameters of 3 % air void content and 11.5 % effective bitumen volume) 
= 0.000150
	
(vii)	 Computed vertical subgrade strain = 0.000148 < 0.000301. Hence, OK

Worked out Design Example: Long-life Pavement
For design traffic of 300 msa or more, a long-life pavement, also termed as perpetual pavement, 
is recommended. If the tensile strain caused by the traffic in the bituminous layer is less than 70 
microstrains (80 µε at 35°C) as per tests conducted in laboratories at 20°C in US, the endurance 
limit of the material, the bituminous layer never cracks (Asphalt Institute, MS-4, 7th edition 2007). 
Similarly, if the vertical subgrade strain is less than 200 microstrain, rutting in subgrade will be 
negligible. For a pavement temperature of 35ε, the endurance limit is about 80µε Design of such 
a pavement is illustrated here.
Problem: Design a long-life pavement for the following data for a 7% effective subgrade 
CBR
Solution 1: Consider a conventional pavement option with granular base and sub-base with 
200 mm GSB and 250 mm granular base (WMM). Consider a trial bituminous layer of 310 mm 
thickness
Allowable subgrade strain	
= 200 µε.
Allowable tensile strain in the bituminous layer	 = 80 µε (for 35°C).
Modulus of the Bituminous layer	
= 3000 MPa (VG40 Bitumen).
Elastic Modulus of subgrade	
= 62 MPa (corresponding to CBR of 7 %). 
Granular layer modulus	
= 0.2(450)0.45*62 = 194 MPa
The computed strain in the bituminous layer is 80 µε = 80 µε and the vertical subgrade strain is 
obtained as 0.000153 < 200 µε. (The analysis is done by IITPAVE software).
Solution 2: Consider a CTSB layer of 300 mm thickness, WMM layer of 150 mm and a bituminous 
layer thickness of 250 mm
Elastic moduli of layers are: 3000 MPa for bituminous layer, 350 MPa for granular layer (crushed 
aggregate) over (CTSB), 600 MPa for CTSB and 62 MPa for subgrade
The computed strain in the bituminous layer is 80 µε = 80 µε and the vertical subgrade strain is 
obtained as 0.000157 < 200 µε.
Solution 3: Use of high Modulus binder
Consider a thickness of 190 mm for the high modulus mix
Modulus of Bituminous layer = 5500 MPa, WMM = 150 mm of modulus 350 MPa (crushed rock), 
CTSB of 300 mm thickness of modulus 600 MPa
The computed strain in the bituminous layer is 78 µε < 80 µε and the vertical subgrade strain is 
obtained as 0.000172 < 200 µε.

Comparison with a Conventional design for 150 msa
Consider the same CBR = 7 %
WMM = 250 mm. GSB=250 mm
Consider a Bituminous layer of 200 mm with VG40 and modulus 3000 MPa, Granular layer 
modulus = 203 MPa
Computed tensile strain in Bituminous layer = 136 µε < 145 µε
Vertical subgrade strain is 224 µε < 292 µε
Table below shows the comparison of long-life pavement designs with conventional pavement 
design
Solution 1 Long life 
pavement
Solution 2 Long life

Solution 3 Long life 
pavement
Conventional For a 
design life of 150 msa
Bituminous layer = 
310 mm with VG40
Bituminous layer = 
250 mm with VG40
Bituminous layer = 
190 mm with hard 
bitumen
Bituminous layer = 
200 mm with VG40
WMM = 250 mm
WMM = 150 mm
WMM = 150 mm
WMM = 250 mm
GSB = 200 mm
CTSB = 300 mm
CTSB = 300 mm
GSB = 250 mm
A long life pavement with WMM and GSB needs 310 mm of bituminous layer with VG40 
binder while that with Cement Treated sub-base needs 250 mm of bituminous layer. 190 mm 
thickness is needed for the high modulus mix while 200 mm of bituminous layer is needed 
for 150 msa which may be attained in 15 to 20 years of life or even earlier. It can be seen 
that solution 3 can be most economical. Practitioners of pavement design should examine 
various options for pavement design discussed above for the efficient use of materials for 
a long life pavement. Low strength cementitious GSB permits use of marginal aggregates 
such as natural river gravels.
II.7	
Stage Construction
In this type of construction, thickness of the WMM and GSB is provided for the full design 
period and the thickness of the bituminous layer is then determined for a shorter design period. 
Consider a design period of ten years for the example -1 
Design traffic = 46.9 msa for ten years (131 msa for 20 years). The pavement shall not be allowed 
to be damaged to an extent of 60% only so that overlay will be effective in extending the life till 
the design period. Cumulative Fatigue Damage = 0.60, hence the pavement shall be designed 
for 46.9/0.60=78 msa If only 46.9 msa is selected for the pavement design, the pavement may 
suffer structural damage in the form of full depth cracking and periodical maintenance such as 
patching, crack sealing and micro-surfacing will not prevent bottom up crack because of short

79
design period. Rehabilitation may be needed after ten years followed by application of wearing 
course. This is avoided if the design is done for the traffic mentioned above and FWD tests done 
after ten years is to be used for determination of overlay thickness.
II.8	
Design options for Diversions
Pavement for temporary diversion
During the construction of culverts, widening of roads and construction of other structures, 
temporary diversion of highways is needed to allow smooth and safe movement of traffic. Poor 
quality of pavement of diversion leads to serious accidents. IRC:SP:84 recommends a design 
traffic of 10 msa for diversion road for four-lane highways. For other categories of single lane 
or two lane roads, design traffic may be computed from the traffic count for the likely duration 
of the diversion and minimum design traffic of 2 msa may be adopted for pavement design. 
Cement treated soil or aggregates with thin bituminous surfacing such as BC/SDBC using the 
subgrade strain criterion can be used for pavement design. Surface cracks should be sealed 
with hot bitumen as and when they arise. Heavily loaded commercial vehicles, construction 
vehicles carrying aggregates and dumpers carrying hot bituminous mixes and dry lean concrete 
mix, cause maximum distresses to any diversion. Another pavement composition can be cement 
treated aggregates (minimum 7-day UCS of 1.5 to 3 MPa), a 30 mm sand layer, precast concrete 
blocks 100 mm thick (IRC:SP:63). Joints between precast concrete blocks should be densely 
filled with sand and SS-2 bitumen emulsion with 50:50 dilution with water should be poured in 
the joints to prevent erosion by water. It will also prevent sucking away of jointing sand due to 
pneumatic wheels. Concrete blocks with bedding sand of 30 mm may be considered to have 
a modulus of 1000 MPa and the cement treated sub-base may be assigned a modulus of 600 
MPa for pavement design. Concrete blocks can be reused for other works after the diversion is 
no more in use.

Annex-III
Example calculations for selected pavement compositions
This section presents examples of the calculations and design outputs of IITPAVE in a tabular 
form. The examples are presented for 10% effective subgrade CBR case for the all the six 
pavement composition types and for six levels of design traffic for which thickness catalogues 
are given in section 12 of the guidelines.
The following design inputs are considered for the pavement analysis. It may be noted that 
these calculations are presented only to illustrate the design procedure. The designers are 
encouraged to select appropriate inputs depending on the type of highway, design traffic and 
other considerations.
	
1.	
Reliability: 80% for 5, 10, 20 msa and 90% for 30, 40, 50 msa
	
2.	
Bitumen type: VG30 for 5, 10, 20 msa and VG40 for 30, 40, 50 msa
	
3.	
Resilient modulus of bituminous layer: 2000 MPa for VG30 mix and 3000 MPa 
for VG40 mix
	
4.	
Elastic modulus of CTB: 5000 MPa
	
5.	
Elastic modulus of CTSB: 600 MPa
	
6.	
Elastic modulus of RAP/aggregate stabilised with emulsion or foam bitumen: 
800 MPa
	
7.	
Elastic modulus of granular layer (WMM) over CTSB: 350 MPa (crushed rock)
	
8.	
Effective Elastic modulus of subgrade (using Equation 6.2): 77 MPa
	
9.	
Poisson’s ratio: 0.25 for CTB and CTSB and 0.35 for all other layers
	
10.	 The mix volumetric parameters assumed for estimation of the fatigue life are 
given in the tables
	
11.	 The values of RF factor used in Equation 3.5 are taken as 2 for design traffic 
less than 10 msa and as 1 for design traffic of 10 msa or more.
Some of the thicknesses (especially those of bituminous layers) given in the thickness templates 
in Section 12 of the guidelines and in the following tables have been selected based on the 
minimum thickness requirement of bituminous layer for pavements with CTB base. If only one 
bituminous layer is provided, the minimum thickness of the bituminous layer has been provided 
as 40 mm. 
The *** appearing under the bituminous layer fatigue life column indicates that the computed 
horizontal strain at the bottom of the bituminous layer is ‘compressive’ and thus fatigue 
performance need not be checked.
