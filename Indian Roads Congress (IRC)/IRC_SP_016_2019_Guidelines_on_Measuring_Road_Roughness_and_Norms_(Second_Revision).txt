GUIDELINES ON MEASURING ROAD ROUGHNESS AND NORMS
1. INTRODUCTION
Surface evenness of highway pavements refers to the regularity of surface finish both in 
longitudinal and transverse directions. Almost in all major highway works executed, control 
of surface evenness has been introduced as mandatory requirement. Based on 1975 report 
of IRC Sub-Committee of Surface Characteristics of Pavements under Convenorship of 
Shri Mahabir Prasad, IRC has brought out Special Publication No. 16 in 1977. The document 
was used widely by highway professionals as it describes existing standards and tolerances of 
surface evenness. These guidelines were revised in the year 2004 to incorporate improved and 
observed values of surface evenness and roughness of wearing surface of highway pavements 
due to introduction of high level of sophistication and mechanization in road construction.
The second (current) revision has been done based on the feedback received from the industry 
as well as advancement in the technology, machinery and material. The initial draft was 
prepared by the subgroup comprising Shri Ashok Wasson, Shri K. Sitaramanjaneyulu, Shri M.N. 
Nagabhushana, Dr. Pradeep Kumar and Shri Neeraj Chadha members of Road Maintenance 
and Asset Management Committee. The draft was deliberated in several meetings of H-6 
Committee and was finalized in its meeting held on 6th October, 2018. The revised draft was 
placed before the Highways Specifications and Standards Committee (HSS) in its meeting held 
on 23rd October, 2018. The HSS Committee approved the draft subject to the consideration of the 
observations of members. The Executive Committee in its meeting held on 27th October, 2018 
approved the draft for placing before the Council of IRC. The Council in its 216th meeting held on 
22nd November, 2018 at Nagpur (Maharashtra) considered and approved the same for printing.

1.1	
Background
Surface evenness/roughness of a road is an important parameter for the evaluation of surface 
condition of road and hence forms an important input into any Pavement Maintenance 
Management System (PMMS) towards deciding upon the optimal maintenance strategies to 
be applied within the given budget. An increase in road roughness results in higher road user 
costs and uncomfortable ride inviting criticism from the traveling public.
As has been well established, the economic impact of road roughness is significant. Even 
a small improvement in the surface evenness or in other words the reduced roughness can 
yield high economic returns as the total operating cost of all vehicles outweigh the agency 
cost and maintenance cost for a given road. These returns are not immediately apparent to a 
highway agency since most of these benefits accrue to the road users. On the other hand, the 
consequences of neglected maintenance are immediately experienced by the users in terms 
of high operating cost, increased travel time and high accident rate etc. However, it needs to be 
borne in mind that if through assured maintenance, road roughness can be contained to lower 
levels, the road agencies would also benefit through deferred reconstruction investments.

The relationships between vehicle operating cost and road roughness are well established 
through several studies conducted both in India and abroad. These studies have quantified 
the impact of road geometrics and roughness on the components of operating costs such as 
fuel (energy efficiency), tyres, spare parts, depreciation, travel time and vehicle speed. Road 
roughness, therefore emerges as a key characteristic of the road condition which should be 
duly considered in developing maintenance standards and for fixing the level of serviceability 
required for the purpose of economic evaluation and energy efficiency.
The PIARC Technical Committee on surface characteristics has specified frequency domains 
for various surface characteristics as given in Table-1.1 (Descornet, 1990). The frequency 
range for roughness is that which induces relative motion in road vehicle suspension systems 
over a reasonable range of operating speeds.
Road users can identify different types of roughness, such as the various forms of unwanted 
vehicle vibration. It is reasonable to compute more than one roughness index from a profile, if 
the different indices provide independent information about the state of the road. All types of 
roughness are not unique.

Road Surface Characteristics (Descornet, 1990)

Different types of roughness are associated with different wavelengths. For example, vehicle 
manufacturers are concerned with different aspects of ride, ranging from the heaving motions 
that mainly involve suspension movement, to audible noise involving acoustics of the body. 
These are caused by widely different wavelength ranges. (The vehicle body motions are due 
to wavelengths of the order of 15 meters, whereas the noise involves wavelengths shorter than 
1 meter.) Roughness analyses can be compared on the basis of how they process a sinusoid. 
Most of the analyses filter out very long wavelengths and very short wavelengths (Sayers et 
al, 1998).
Roughness involves at least two dimensions in a complex way, as it involves variation of profile 
height along its length. There are two systems for measuring road roughness. A system that 
measures or bases the measurements on the profiles of the road is termed as profilometric 
systems. Systems that rely on the movement of a suspension system in response to the 
unevenness of the road surface travelled by a vehicle are termed as Response Type Road 
Roughness Measuring System (RTRRMS).

1.2	
Importance of Road Roughness
1.2.1	 Effect on Road Safety
For many years, the ride experienced by the occupant of a vehicle has been used as a criterion 
of pavement roughness. A person travelling on a vehicle at a selected speed subjectively 
evaluates the riding experience. The vibration of the vehicle induced by road roughness 
affects driver performance. It has been reported by human factors researchers that continuous 
exposure to vibration may induce fatigue, which may in turn be a factor that contributes to 
accidents. It is mentioned that vehicle suspension also plays a role in the effect of roughness on 
safety. Frequency has a major effect on automobile and trucks that can cause safety problems. 
When roughness occurs at a repeated amplitude and frequency, it can have two effects. First, 
if the frequency is in phase with the vehicle, a rough road can seem to be smooth. Second, if 
the roughness is out of phase with the natural frequency, the roughness can be magnified. This 
phenomenon causes a problem when repeated upward forces continually reinforce already 
existing upward forces of the vehicle. When this occurs, the vehicle starts to move up and 
down with the roadway in ever increasing movements until the car or truck tyres actually leave 
the roadway and become airborne. The roughness of the pavement causes change in the 
normal forces that act at the tyre-pavement interface and affects the lateral forces needed 
to control a vehicle, thereby influencing the steering capabilities of the vehicle. On relatively 
smooth pavements, the variation in normal force is very small. However, on rough pavements, 
these variations can be very large and reduce significantly the lateral force available to control 
the vehicle. In situations where high lateral forces are necessary or where a vehicle requires 
a particular lateral friction level to make a manoeuvre, this loss of force could lead to loss of 
control of the vehicle.
Roughness can cause significant loss of braking force or slip resistance on a vehicle. In 
addition to this, problems can arise due to variation of roughness in each of the wheel tracks 
of a lane. These differences of roughness in each wheel path cause differences in the braking 
and sliding forces that act on the vehicle. This will cause the exposure of vehicle to different 
levels of friction on each side, which can result in a significant safety problem.
1.2.2	 Effect on Vehicle Operating Cost
The Vehicle Operating Cost (VOC) components consist of fuel consumption, oil consumption, 
tyre wear, maintenance and repair, and depreciation. Road surface roughness is one of the 
factors determining Vehicle Operating Cost (VOC). Roughness affects the amount of fuel 
consumed in vehicles. While increasing roughness increases fuel consumption at any given 
speed and reduces travel speed. 
In Highway Development and Management Model, HDM-4, effect of International Roughness 
Index (IRI) on Vehicle Operating Cost (VOC) was studied, by a set of notional 1km road lengths 
with IRI ranging from 2 to 2.5 in increments of IRI 0.5. The result of the study is shown in 
Fig. 1.1.

(Source: Parkman et al, 2012)
Fig. 1.1 Variation of Vehicle Operating Cost with IRI (HDM 4)
It is important to analyse the relationship between roughness and speed, as well as speed 
and fuel to determine the relationship between fuel consumption and roughness at variable 
speed. Various studies examining the roughness-speed relation have established a negative 
correlation between the two as roughness serves to decrease ride comfort and drivers reduce 
their speed accordingly. HDM models shows that at low speed, increasing speed serves to 
decrease distance-related fuel consumption because a greater distance is covered during 
each unit of time-related fuel consumption. Repair and maintenance cost also gets affected by 
road roughness.
1.2.3	 Effect on Vehicle Riding Comfort
Vehicle’s ride quality varies with travel speed, the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle, and 
the spectral characteristics of the roughness of the road. Assessment of ride quality and road 
roughness by measuring the response of a vehicle is dependent on travelling speed and 
dynamic characteristics of the vehicle. To obtain repeatable and reproducible measurements 
of ride quality, the measuring speed required to be controlled. Depending on the type of 
instrument and application, the measurement speed ranges from 20 to 80 km/h.
1.2.4	 Effect on Vehicle Speed
The effect of road roughness on traffic speed has been statistically quantified in a generalized 
speed prediction model under free-flow conditions.

Derived on the basis of probabilistic limiting velocities, the model may be expressed in the 
following form:

mainly on the road gradient and engine power; V2 is the maximum allowable downhill speed 
before the speed increases beyond control and is dependent mainly on the road gradient and 
vehicle braking capability; V3 is the maximum allowable curve speed, dependent mainly on 
the radius of horizontal curvature, the super elevation, and the surface type; V4 is the desired 
speed, in the absence of other constraints and limited by subjective factors such as safety, 
speed limit etc.; and V5 is the maximum allowable ride comfort speed.

2. ROAD ROUGHNESS: DEFINITION, CLASSIFICATION AND METHODS
2.1	
Definition of Road Roughness
Road roughness is the result of either the built-in-irregularities due to construction defects/
deficiencies or it may also appear on the road surface due to the consolidation or displacement 
of different materials placed within the pavement structure due to traffic movement. Road 
roughness is the deviations of the pavement surface from a true planar surface with characteristic 
dimensions that affect vehicle dynamics, ride quality, dynamic loads, and drainage, for example, 
longitudinal profile, transverse profile, and cross slope (ASTM E867).
2.2	
Roughness Measurement Methods
2.2.1	 Profilometric Systems
Systems that measure or base their measurements on the profiles of road are, generally termed 
as profilometric system. When profile is measured, the continuous representation of the road 
can be inspected to identify local defects, or processed to yield roughness numeric adapted to 
specific applications. The details of some of these equipment are given in Appendix-1.
2.2.2	 Response Type Road Roughness Measuring System (RTRRMS)
As early as the 1920s, highway engineers installed devices in cars to record suspension stroke 
as a measure of roughness. These were called road meters and had several generic names, 
including: Response-Type Road Roughness Measuring Systems (RTRRMS), response-type 
systems, and road meter systems. In these systems, the vehicle is a passenger car, a van, 
a light truck, or a special trailer. A road meter is a transducer that accumulates suspension 
motions. Nearly the entire road meter designs follow the concept of the Bureau of Public Roads 
(BPR) Roughometer, and accumulate deflections of the vehicle suspension as it travels down 
the road. The BPR Roughometer is a single-wheel trailer with a one-way clutch mechanism 
that accumulates the suspension stroke in one direction. The roughness measure that is 
obtained is “inches” of accumulated suspension stroke, normalized by the distance travelled. 
The measure is usually reported with engineering units such as inches per mile (in/mi) or meter 
per kilometre (m/km), although sometimes other units are used based on the instrumentation 
hardware, e.g., “counts/mi.” The various equipment such as Fifth Wheel Bump Integrator or 
Automatic Road Unevenness Recorder (indigenously developed by CRRI, India), Car Axle 
Mounted Bump Integrator and Accelerometer based systems falls under this category. Refer 
Appendix-1 for details.
2.3	
Classification of Road Roughness Measuring Systems
Instruments used for the collection of roughness data are characterised into four classes as 
defined by Sayers et al.
2.3.1	 Class 1: Precision Profilers
Precision profilers are the instruments that provide the highest standard of accuracy for 
calculating IRI and are a series of accurately measured elevation points, closely spaced along 



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 32
======================================================================
IRC:SP:16-2019
8
the section (i.e. with a short sampling interval). The elevations are measured at sampling 
intervals not more than 250 mm with a precision of less than 0.5 mm on very smooth pavements 
using walking speed profilometers. However, for high speed road profilers such as Laser 
Profilometer (ASTM E950 Class-1 Compliance) the longitudinal sampling interval is ≤ 25 mm 
with a vertical measurement resolution of ≤ 0.1 mm. 
2.3.2	 Class 2: Other Profilometer Methods
An instrument not capable of meeting the Class 1 requirements for precision, or sampling 
interval, may meet the criteria for Class 2. The Class 2 sampling intervals are set at a 
maximum of 500 mm with a precision on smooth roads of below 1 mm for using walking speed 
profilometers. However, for high speed road profilers the longitudinal sampling interval is 
> 25 mm to 150 mm with a vertical measurement resolution of > 0.1 mm to 0.2 mm.
2.3.3	 Class 3: Response Type Measurements
All Response Type Road Roughness Measuring System (RTRRMS) belongs to this category 
of roughness measurement. RTRRMSs measure the dynamic response of vehicles to the road 
surface by using either mechanical or accelerometer devices. The estimation of roughness 
index for RTRRMS is made using correlation equation after calibration with Class-1 road 
profiler.
2.3.4	 Class 4: Subjective Ratings
In subjective evaluations of roughness, the investigator physically drives along the road or 
makes a visual survey.

3 ROUGHNESS STANDARDS: UNITS AND NORMS
3.1	
Units for Measuring Roughness
Different measuring systems/practices have different units for representing the measured 
roughness, as discussed below.
3.1.1	 Roughness Index (RI)
The pavement surface roughness is expressed as Unevenness or Roughness Index (in mm/
km) measured through Fifth Wheel Bump Integrator or Car Axle Mounted Bump Integrator.
3.1.2	 International Roughness Index (IRI)
It is the reference average rectified slope, which expresses the ratio of the accumulated 
suspension motion of a vehicle, divided by the distance travelled during the test. The 
recommended unit of IRI is m/km.
3.1.3	 Correlation between IRI and RI
For correlation with RI values obtained from RTRRMS equipment such as Fifth Wheel Bump 
Integrator and Car Axle Mounted Bump Integrator, the following Eqn. (2.1) may be used for IRI 
< 17 (Paterson, 1990):
	
RI = 630 (IRI)^1.12
(2.1)
Where, RI = Roughness Index in mm/km and IRI = International Roughness Index in m/km
3.2	
Roughness Norms
In all major road works executed, control of surface evenness during construction phase 
has been stipulated as a mandatory requirement. The standard recommended for surface 
evenness enables the engineer-in-charge to exercise control over the quality of construction. 
The longitudinal profile shall be checked with a 3-metre straight edge at the middle of each 
traffic lane along a line parallel to the central line of the road and shall comply with maximum 
permitted number of surface irregularities as per “Specifications for Roads and Bridge Works”, 
Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (Section 902, Table 900-2).
The recommended maximum permissible surface unevenness values in terms of Roughness 
Index in mm/km and International Roughness Index in m/km are given in Table 3.1, 3.2 and 
3.3 for various categories of roads. It is recommended that all the newly constructed roads 
shall meet the criteria of roughness values as per “Good” surface condition. The roughness 
values under “Fair” and “Poor” surface condition of roads has been indicated for purposes of 
timely maintenance planning and interventions.

4. ROUGHNESS MEASUREMENTS, ANALYSIS AND REPORTING
4.1	
Selection of Appropriate Equipment
The use of FWBI/ARUR or CAMBI or any other new technology equipment for measuring 
road roughness mainly depends upon the road network/area to be covered for the survey. For 
selection of appropriate roughness measuring device, the following points may be considered.
	
•	
For roughness measurements in plain terrain areas, where the condition of 
roads is average to poor and average traffic speed is about 30 to 40 kmph (like 
on MDRs, ODRs and Village Roads), then under such conditions FWBI/ARUR, 
CAMBI can serve the purpose for roughness measurements, as in these 
areas, the standard survey speed of 32 kmph can be conveniently maintained. 
In such situations, the high speed and sophisticated survey equipment such as 
laser Profilometer may not be insisted.
	
•	
On high speed road corridors (Expressways, National Highways and State 
Highways) where the average traffic speed is more (say >= 60 kmph), the use 
of slow speed equipment shall be avoided, due to safety reasons. The Laser 
Profilometer (LP) and Ultrasonic Sensor Based Profilometer are recommended 
for roughness measurements on these high-speed road corridors.
	
•	
For rolling and hilly terrain areas, it is difficult to maintain the constant 
survey speed of 32 kmph which is essential for response type roughness 
measuring systems, Also, due to high gradients and frequent sharp curves 
in these areas, the use of FWBI/ARUR (which is a towing type device) is not 
recommended. In such conditions, CAMBI are preferred types of equipment 
and are recommended for use with a range of calibration curves at different 
survey speeds, say from 10 to 32 kmph.
	
•	
Laser Profilometer, Ultrasonic Sensor Based Profilometer, Car Axle Mounted 
Bump Integrator and Accelerometer Based equipment are recommended to 
be used for the roads where average traffic speed is 40 to 60 kmph.
	
	
Based on the above considerations, recommendations for selection of 
appropriate roughness measuring equipment in different operating conditions 
are given in Table 4.1.
4.2	
Field Measurement of Roughness
Measurement of roughness shall be conducted using a suitable roughness measuring 
equipment as per Table 4.1. The equipment shall be calibrated/validated, and the survey shall 
be conducted under standard operating conditions of the respective equipment. The guidelines 
to carry out the survey based on pavement width are presented in Table 4.2.

using CAMBI, it should be ensured that the outer vehicle wheel travels on the 
wheel path.

2)	
Walking speed type Class-1 equipment (which are not included in Table 4.1) 
are normally used for calibration of RTRRMS equipment and validation of 
Roughness data. However, the measurement using these equipment can only 
be recommended under no traffic conditions/closed road conditions in case of 
very small road stretches (<1 km length) for calibration of Class-3 equipment 
and research and development activities.

5. DATA QUALITY: CALIBRATION OF EQUIPMENT
5.1	
Calibration of Road Roughness Measuring Equipment
5.1.1	 Guidelines for Calibration of RTRRMS Equipment
It is necessary to ensure that the roughness measurements are accurate and reliable. In 
response type devices such as FWBI/ARUR/CAMBI/AB etc., significant variations may 
often be encountered in roughness measurement. Thus, in order to ensure repeatability 
and reproducibility of measurement by the same machine and consistency in measurement 
from different machines, it is essential that the response of the device to the road surface 
roughness should be correct. Initial standardization and subsequent recalibration of response 
type devices are essential. The new measurements obtained from the response type devices 
must be correct to the standard roughness scale by calibration.
Calibration is achieved by obtaining "raw" measures of Average Rectified Slope (the "counts/
km" or other similar number produced as output by the instrument) on special calibration sites. 
These sites are sections of road that have known IRI roughness values as determined with 
Class 1 methods. The RTRRMS is periodically run over the calibration sites 3 - 5 times at 
the standard speed after suitable warm-up. The "raw" values from the RTRRMS are plotted 
against the IRI values, with the RTRRMS values on the x-axis and the IRI values on the y-axis 
line is fitted to the data points and used to estimate IRI from RTRRMS measurements taken in 
the field. The accuracy of the calibrated measures can be seen approximately as the scatter of 
the points about the fitted line: the smaller the scatter, the better the accuracy. Table 5.1 shows 
the requirements for RTRRMS calibration sites.
A number of test sites, minimum 8 to 10 of straight sections of length 100 m to 200 m, of 
different roughness level covering a wide range of spectrum of surface roughness ranging 
from very smooth to very rough (say IRI 2.0 m/km to 12.0 m/km) are selected. Care is taken 
to ensure that sufficient approach length on either side is available to attain vehicle test speed 
before entering the starting point of the test section. The entire length of all selected sites 
should have uniform riding quality and free of surface defects. For better visibility, wheel paths 
are marked with a road marking paint along with starting and the ending point of the section 
for data recording. Section roughness and the corresponding reference values of each section 
are recorded through any of the above mentioned calibration devices for developing the 
calibration. At each test site, a number of runs are made till at least three sets of consistent 
data are obtained. Average of the three values is taken as the representative roughness values 
of the section.

1.	
For FWBI/ARUR, the validity of calibration certificate is for two years from the 
date of calibration or 5000 kms of field measurements, whichever is earlier. If 
at any stage during the validity period there is any major changes made, the 
certificate shall be automatically stand invalid and the unit should then be got 
re-calibrated.
	
2.	
For CAMBI and AB equipment, the calibration certificate is valid only along 
with the survey vehicle used at the time of calibration. The calibration 
certificate is valid for two years from the date of calibration or 5000 kms of field 
measurements, whichever is earlier. If at any stage during the validity period 
there is any major changes made in the equipment or the survey vehicle, the 
certificate shall be automatically stand invalid and the unit should then be got 
re-calibrated. 
5.2	
Calibration of Profile Based Roughness Measuring Equipment
All profile-based roughness measuring equipment have their own in-built calibration procedure. 
These equipment shall be strictly calibrated as per their standard calibration mechanism and 
frequency.

EQUIPMENTS FOR ROAD ROUGHNESS MEASUREMENT
1.	
Fifth Wheel Bump Integrator (FWBI)/Automated Road Unevenness Recorder 
(ARUR)
Fifth Wheel Bump Integrator (Fig. A.1) is a response type road roughness measuring system. 
The equipment consists of a trailer towed by a vehicle. A standard pneumatic tyre wheel inflated 
to a tyre pressure of 2.1 kg/sqm is mounted within the trailer chassis, with a single leaf spring 
on either side of the wheel supporting the chassis. Two dashpots provide viscous damping 
between chassis and axle. The frame is provided with a counter weight at the front to make 
the device practically free from the effects of the vertical motion of the vehicle. A mechanical 
integrator makes cumulative measurements of the unidirectional vertical movement of the 
wheel relative to the chassis. The distance travelled is measured by a distance-measuring unit. 
The test is conducted at a speed of 32±1 km/hour. Roughness Index is defined as the ratio of 
the cumulative vertical displacement to the distance travelled and is expressed in mm/km.
The equipment is driven over the road surface at a speed of 32±1 km/hour, keeping steady 
motion and avoiding swerving. The readings of the revolution counter and integrating counters 
are noted or automatically recorded in the data sheet/logger.
Fig. A.1 Sketch of Fifth Wheel Bump Integrator
The bump integrator values are recorded at preset distance or when the wheel revolution 
counter records 1000 units which correspond to 1 km. The brief description of the road surface 
is also noted as the observer travels over the surface. The fifth wheel should preferably travel on 
wheel path. For measurement of roughness, one measurement in each lane is recommended 
for riding comforts evaluation. This equipment need to be calibrated and validated with respect 
to some Class-1 equipment as per the standard procedure.

Car Axle Mounted Bump Integrator (CAMBI)
The Car Axle Mounted Integrator (Fig. A.2) consists of an bump integrating unit as provided in 
the Fifth Wheel Bump Integrator. The integrating unit is fitted with the rear axle and mounted 
in the rear portion of the car or rear floor of a jeep.
Fig. A.2 Sketch of Car Axle Mounted Bump Integrator
The differential movement between the rear axle and the body of the vehicle due to road 
unevenness is measured by the upward vertical motion of a wire which is transmitted into 
unidirectional rotator movement of the pulley of the integrator unit. There is an arrangement 
in the integrating unit for converting the rotational movement into electric pulses, which is 
recorded by the counters/loggers. One count corresponds to 1 cm relative movement between 
axle and floor of the vehicle. One count in distance counter corresponds to 1 m length of 
distance travelled.
The road roughness is affected by the vehicle speed. A bump gets magnified if the speed is 
not maintained. Vehicle load is another factor that influences the roughness measurement. For 
getting the realistic values, the constant vehicle speed must be maintained (calibration speed) 
or equipment shall be calibrated for multiple survey speeds. The laden weight of the vehicle 
is also standardized. While taking measurements, the vehicle should carry maximum three 
passengers. It should be ensured that the outer vehicle wheel travels on the wheel path. This 
equipment need to be calibrated and validated with respect to some Class-1 equipment as per 
the standard procedure.

Laser Profilometer (LP)
Laser based road profiling is a high-speed road roughness measuring system as per ASTM 
E950 (Class-1 category). The Laser Profilometer beam is installed in the front or back of the 
survey vehicle. This system is based on the measurement of vertical displacements using 
Laser Rays. Laser Profilometer Bar comprises of two laser sensors used for the measurement 
of longitudinal profile of two wheel paths of the pavement surface as shown in Fig. A.3. The 
system directly gives International Roughness Index (IRI) for both wheel paths viz. Left IRI and 
Right IRI in terms of m/km. This equipment has self-calibration mechanism.
Fig. A.3 Sketch of Laser Profilometer
4.	
Accelerometer Based (AB) Equipment
Equipment based on the principle of measurement of vertical acceleration of the survey vehicle 
may also be used for the measurement of road roughness index after due calibration and 
validation with respect to Class-1 equipment.
Some portable type of roughness measuring equipment are available which consists of a 
small accelerometer (sensor) device (one or two) installed at the rear axle of the survey 
vehicle, a distance measuring instrument, interface module and a controller. The pavement 
roughness measurements using these equipment are required to be done preferably near to 
50 ± 10 km/hr, in order to obtain most reliable and accurate data. The output is in the units 
of International Roughness Index (IRI). Another device in this category is measurement of 
international roughness index using mobile app-based system, this system is based on the 
use of in-built accelerometer and GPS sensors of the mobile phone and accumulates the 
vertical displacement, which occurs due to response (Vertical Movement) of the survey vehicle 
on the test road depending upon road evenness.
Although these equipment claim to have self calibration mechanism for their accelerometer 
sensor, but being a response type equipment, it is recommended that such equipment shall 
be calibrated/validated for different roughness level covering a wide range of spectrum of

surface roughness ranging from very smooth to very rough (say IRI 2.0 m/km to 12.0 m/km) 
with respect to some Class-1 equipment as per the standard procedure. 
5.	
Equipment for Calibration of RTRRMS and Validation of Roughness Data
These devices are “Walked” along the line being profiled. Normally a precision inclinometer 
measures the difference in height between the two supports, normally spaced not more than 
250 mm apart for Class-1 category. With such equipment, the reference elevation is the value 
calculated for the previous point. The elevations are measured at sampling intervals not more 
than 250 mm with a precision of less than 0.5 mm on very smooth pavements using such 
walking speed profilometers. 
Fig. A.4 Principal of Class-1 Road Profiler
Road profile data measured using such equipment is processed to give International Roughness 
Index (IRI) in m/km. Such equipment have self-calibration mechanism. With the highest level 
of accuracy in road profile measurement, the equipment are used for calibration of Response 
Type Road Roughness Measuring System and Validation of Roughness Data. The principle of 
road profiling using such equipment is shown in Fig. A.4.
