GUIDELINES ON LOW-COST TRAFFIC
MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES
FOR URBAN AREAS
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1.
Impact of Urbanisation
Rapid industrialisation and the consequent urbanisation has brought
about an unprecedented revolution in the growth of motor vehicles
all
over the world;
India
is no exception. Today, man and his
transport
vehicles occupy a large share of the urban space. Traffic congestion, Air
and Noise Pollution and the resultant
ill-effects and frustrations have
become the order of the day. Urban transportation systems are wilting
under the pressure of ever growing demands on inadequate street network.
Serpentine
bus
queues,
pathetically packed
suburban
u-ains
and
the
scarcity of taxis during rush hours underscore the pressure on mass transit
system. The traffic problem itself is not new; what is new about it is its
growing magnitude and complexity.
1.1.1. The
Traffic Engineering Committee of the Indian Roads
Congress had
constituted
a Sub-group
in May,
1989
to prepare
the
Guidelines on Low
- Cost Traffic Management Techniques for Urban
Areas under the Chairmanship of
Dr. P.S. Pasricha with Dr. A.C. Sama,
Prof. N. Ranganathan, Shri M.K. Bhalla, Dr. S. Raghava Chari, Shri Dilip
Bhattacharya, Dr. P.K. Sikdar and Shri S. Vishwanath, as members. The
Sub-group held several meetings and the draft guidelines were prepared
and finalised by Dr P.S. Pasricha. The Traffic Engg. Committee (personnel
as on 18.10.93 given below) during its meeting held on 18-10-93 approved
the draft guidelines subject to certain modifications to be carried out by
an editorial committee consisting of Dr. L.^. Kadiyali, S/Shri Maxwell
Pereira, T.S. Reddy and A.P. Bahadur:

1.1.2.
Subsequently,
the guidelines were approved by Highways
Specifications & Standards Committee in
its meeting held on 8.11.93.
The
approval from
the
Executive Committee was
obtained
through
circulation. The document, thereafter, was considered by the Council in
its meeting held on 20.1 1.93 at Bangalore, wherein Convenor & Member-
Secretary
of Highways
Specifications &
Standards Committee were
authorised to carry out the editing and minor modifications,
if required
on the basis of die comments of members before getting the same printed.
2.1.
Traffic is generally defined as the movement of people, goods
or
vehicles
between
spatially
separated
points,
and
thus
includes
pedestrians and
all
types of vehicles
mechanised, motorised or non-
motorised
. Traffic planning must, therefore, look beyond the expansion
of the highway system, and deliberate on the principles of demand and
supply
so
as
to
use
the
available
infrastructure
optimally.
Traffic
management
is
the
application of sound management
principles
and
practices to optimise the use of the existing road network with a view to
improving traffic flow and road safety wiUiout impairing environmental
quality.
2. GROWING IMPORTANCE OF
TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 84
======================================================================

2.2.
It has been the experience of many traffic planners that most
transportation plans rarely progress beyond the drawing board for lack
of financial resources and other related constraints. In many urban areas,
socio-economic constraints hutments, ribbon developments etc. are serious
impediments
to further development, even
if the problem of funds
is
overcome. Provision of new urban transport infrastructure
is both long
term and capital intensive; resources are simply not available at a scale
that matches the escalating demand.
2.3. The only recourse open to the u*affic manager, therefore is the
option of optimising existing facilities to provide improved accessibility
and mobility at a satisfactory level of safety and comfort to most of the
road
users. This can be achieved
after studying and
evaluating
the
problems in the light of sound and tested traffic management techniques
which are essentially low cost, easily implementable and flexible. Tliese
are
short term solutions, primarily intended to reduce
the intensity of
inconvenience caused by congestion and the multiplicity of the modes of
transport conflictingly trying for the same space. They may not offer a
permanent solution, yet they lend themselves to some time earning relief
upto a point where the adminisU'ation may launch a long term solution.
It is, of course, absolutely imperative to integrate the long term and short
term planning. The objectives of the short term solutions should be within
the perspective, and be compatible with the goals set out in the long term
plans.

3. NEED FOR SYSTEMS APPROACH
Though the identification of the problems and the correct diagnosis
may automatically suggest the usefulness of a particular management
technique, the application of a single technique, in isolation,
is rarely
sufficient in bringing about a significant improvement in the
level of
service and transportation mobility of an area. More often than not, the
problems
shift to the adjacent
locality, or an entirely new problem
is
spawned as a consequence of th
very technique used as a solution,
if
applied
in
isolation.
It
is,
therefore,
essential
to
seek
solutions
in
a
combination
of
techniques, even
in
a
relatively
local
situation,
for
effective management. A solution must be observed as a part of the total
scenario and
Jie systems approach used
to prepare a Traffic System
Management (TSM) Plan for the entire network.
3.1.
Selection of Correct Technique(s)
Every city has a
ti affic complexion of its own, nurtured by its own
characteristics. Therefore,
it is not wise to import a technique and apply
it blindly
in a town, merely because
it was
a success elsewhere.
It
is
necessary to study
tlie areas and sub-areas, and accord correct priorities
depending upon
the
objectives
to be
achieved.
Different
sub-areas/
corridors
require
different treatments depending on
the nature of the
problems and priority objectives. After examining
tlie funding position
and the constraints, in situ, various sub-areas plans can be prepared and
mutually integrated to form the programme package. This process pre-
supposes a thorough knowledge of the independent impacts of the TSM
actions as well as their interactions. A number of TSM actions can have
the desired effect when applied in many similar locations, while there are
others
that
call
for related and coordinated
actions for each separate
application.
Certain TSM
actions may have
a
positive impact in one
corridor, but may adversely affect another. Therefore, the selection of
TSM tools and the study of their combinatory effect is very important,
and should never be under emphasised.
3.2.
Community Involvement
It must be also imderstood that public participation and cooperation
are the most essential pre-requisites for the success of TSM programmes,



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 84
======================================================================
7
especially in a developing country
like India where diversity of social
customs and prejudices abounds.
Traffic management and community
involvement
are two
sides
of
the same
coin
and
are
not
mutually
exclusive.
Any
attempt
to
bypass
the
community
would
prove
counter
productive in the long run and no major scheme will be able to survive
for a long time. The traffic management plan should be administratively
sound, politically tolerated and socially acceptable. All efforts should be
made to involve the people. They should be given prior details of the
proposal(s) through print/audio/video media and their comments/opinion
invited.
4. REGULATORY TECHNIQUES
Regulatory techniques are the most common and straight forward
techniques. The following techniques may be adopted:
*
One-way
street
*
Reversible
street
*
Reversible lane
*
Turning movement restrictions
*
Closing
streets
4.1.
One-Way Street
One-way streets are those where the vehicle movement is permitted
in only one
direction. They help
in optimising
the road capacity and
minimising conflicts, which ultimately result in better traffic flow and
safety.
It also simplifies
traffic operations
at intersections, and reduces
delays to moving traffic. A typical layout of one-^ay street operation is
shown in Fig
1.
The
following
points
need
careful
consideration
before
implementation of one-way street system:
(i)
The one-way system
is best suited for the network that has a grid pattern
i.e.
availability of parallel roads with evenly spaced cross roads connecting them.

======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 84
======================================================================
9
The distance between such complementary streets should not normally exceed
300 metres. In the absence of parallel streets the travel distances may increase
substantially.
(ii)
Unless complementary roads with reasonably parallel alignment are available,
one-way system should not be normally resorted to. As a rule of thumb,
it is
desirable to ensure that the extra travel distance resulting from one-way system
does not normally exceed 30 per cent of the original.
(iii)
The complementary
streets so chosen should not have mixed land use.
(iv)
Proper care should be taken to study the pattern of the displaced traffic (as a
result of the one-way system) as
it would have a tendency to resort to rat-runs
through
residential areas
in order to aviod longer detour.
In such
situations
sufficient speed breakers/barriers should be installed in the residential area to
discourage such short cuts.
(v)
Abrupt ending of one-way street should be avoided. If necessary, the one-way
system can be extended beyond the earlier intended point. The adjacent areas,
where the displaced traffic is likely to have implications, should also be studied
in conjunction with the area under consideration.
(vi)
As far as possible, a particular street should be continued one-way in the same
direction, end to end, except under special circumstances.
(vii)
Good signage and lane markings are the main pre-requisites of any one-way
system. "No entry", "One-Way" and "No Right/Left Turn" boards should be
conspicuously displayed at all strategic points, especially at the ends of the one-
way
street and
at the meeting points of she cross roads.
(viii)
It
is always
desirable
to consider one-way
system
with
other management
techniques such
as
parking
restrictions, loading
and
unloading
restrictions,
progressive signal system, k
.aons of the bus stops, contra-flow bus lane, etc.
(ix)
It
is very essential to give adequate publicity well before the introduction of
the one-way system by distributing leaflets, publicity through press, posters at
strategic places, etc. giving clear cut details of the proposed circulation system.
During the experimental stage, a number of police personnel should be detailed
at strategic places to politely guide the users who might get conliised in the
initial
stage.
(x)
As
far as
possible,
the one-way
system
should always be experimented on
Fridays so that whatever confusion is witnessed on the first day can be corrected
during the next two days which are lean
traffic days.
4.2.
Reversible Street
This technique
is useful
in situations having uni-directional peak
traffic pattern so that an important street
is made one-way in the peak



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 84
======================================================================
10
direction in the morning and vice-versa in the evening with a view to
optimising the flow of traffic during peak-time.
(i)
This technique
is, however, useful only
if there
is another parallel
street
available in close proximity to accommodate the opposite
traffic.
(ii)
The reversible one-way system is advantageous only if the volume of traffic
in the peak direction is nearly twice the one moving in the lean direction.
(iii)
It is preferable to control the operation of reversible street with the help of
a traffic signal. The Green signal indicates the direction of flow, as per the
time plan and prevents accidents. The direction change over time is the most
crucial period.
It would be, therefore, advisable to post a traffic constable
during the transition period.
(iv)
Adequate number of signs should be conspicuously displayed indicating the
correct direction and time.
(v)
The reversible
street should be retained one-way even during the night in
the same direction as in the evening. Too many directional changes are not
desirable.
(vi)
Adt quate publicity is essential to make the public aware of the direction and
time of operation.
4,3.
Reversible Lane
This technique ensures apportioning of the carriageway between
two directions of travel in a manner that matches the volume of U-affic.
Additional lane(s) can be allotted to the peak flow direction by squeezing
width of the carriageway meant for the opposite traffic so as to optimise
the utilisation of road space.
A typical reversible lane
is shown in the Photograph
1 and Fig.
2.
(i)
This technique should normally not be implemented unless the total width
of the road is more than 4 lanes; since on smaller roads, snatching of a lane
would leave
very
little
space
for the lean
direction flow
that can cause
serious bottlenecks in case of an accident, or breakdown, or halting of a bus
at a stop.
(ii)
Traffic cones should be used to delineate boundary of the additional area
taken away from the opposite carriageway.
(iii)
Signs showing the direction should be conspicuously displayed at both ends
of the lane.
(iv)
Traffic constables must be deployed at both ends of the street so as to ensure
that a new driver to the city does not enter the wrong lanes.

(v)
At pedestrian crossings along the section of the operative lane, policemen
should be deployed so as to prevent accidents and help safe crossing. The
reversible lane should be painted continuous white with arrows showing both
directions.
(vi)
Proper care should be taken for bus stops and cross movements and traffic
from side
streets.
4.4.
Turning Movement Restrictions
Ban on turning movements minimises conflicts at intersections, thus
enhancing their capacity as well as safety.
It also simplifies the U-affic
signal phases to minimise delays at the crowded intersections.
It is very
essential to consider alternative routes for diverting
tlie affected traffic
before banning any turn.
(i)
Left turns
are
rarely banned unless an intersection has multiple arms or
pedestrian flow across the street
is very heavy.
(ii)
As
far as
possible,
free
left
turn
at
a
signalised
intersection
should be
avoided.
If,
at
all,
it
has
to be
given,
'blinking amber'
aspect must be
incorporated to caution motorists to slow down. Cautionary sign indicating
**free left turn" should also be conspicuously displayed for warning both
the drivers and the pedestrians.

(iii)
If there are two similar intersections at close distance on a major corridor,
it shall be prudent to ban complementary turns at adjacent intersections so
as to stagger the
traffic load uniformly and minimising inconvenience to
motorists.
(iv)
There are three commonly used procedures through which the right turning



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 84
======================================================================
13
traffic can be re-routed:
(a)
Diversion
of
the
right
turning movement
to
the
left,
before
the
congested intersection
is what
is known as G-turn and illustrated in
Fig.
3(a).
(b)
Diversion further along the road, so that the difficult
right turnings
from
a
minor
road
onto
a
major
road
takes
place
at
a
minor-
intersection, as indicated in Fig.
3(b).
(c)
Diversion
to
the
left beyond
the
intersection,
requiring
three
left
turns. This
is known as Q-turn and illustrated in Fig.
3(c).
(v)
It
is always desirable
to ban U-turn, wherever possible, particularly on a
major artery, a busy street, or a narrow road where geometries and the road
width do not permit U-turn in one manoeuvre.
4.5.
Closing Side-Street
Tliis
technique
envisages
closure
of
side-street
with
a view
to
improving flow on the main street by minimising conflicts.
It naturally
enhances
safety
level
as
well.
It helps
ui
staggering
the
load
at
die
complicated intersection, besides, reducing enforcement burden and even
need for a signal. If Uiere
is a parking demand in such an area, the side
lanes can be gainfully used; however, in that case, parking on the major
street must be banned to improve its capacity. In tlie shopping areas, such
cul-de-sac streets can be converted into pedestrian plazas.
However, if a side street is to be closed in an area where easy access
is not available nearby,
it would be better to close the streets with a chain
instead of using permanent physical barrier so tliat access to emergency
vehicles
is available during any exigency, Fig. 4.
5. TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES
Traffic Control Devices are all signs, signals, markings, and devices
placed on or adjacent to a street or highway (by authority of a public body
or official having
jurisdiction)
to regulate, warn, or guide
traffic.
(a)
Important Recjuirements of Traffic Control Devices
To be
effective,
traffic control devices must meet
the following

requirements.
*
Catch the eye
*
Command respect
*
Convey the meaning/message
These requirements
are achieved by ensuring
the following
five
basic factors:
(i)
Design: The combination of physical features such as size, colours, and shape
should be such as to stand out and attract attention and convey the message
clearly.
(ii)
Placement: The installation of devices should be within the cones of vision of
road-users so that it not only attracts the attention but also allows sufficient time
for response.
(iii)
Operation: As far as possible, the device must be designed and operated in a
uniform and consistent manner so that the road-user can properly respond
to
it, based on
his previous exposure to similar traffic control situations.
(iv)
Maintenance: A device should be of high standard and adequately maintained
to retain
its legibility and visibility. This would command the respect of road-
users.
(v)
Uniformity: All devices must adhere to uniform specifications so that an average
road-user can recognise and understand them easily.
(b)
Classification
The U"affic control devices may be classified into the following four
main categories:
*
Traffic signs
*
Road markings
*
Traffic signals
*
Miscellaneous
traffic control devices
5.1.
Traffic Signs
Traffic signs are traffic control devices, whether fixed or portable,
for
conveying
warning,
information,
requirements,
restrictions
or



======================================================================
PAGE 29 of 84
======================================================================
17
prohibitions of any description specified by law/regulation, to the traffic
on roads.
They fall into three broad categories viz. regulatory signs, warning
signs and
informative
signs. As
far
as
possible,
traffic
signs
should
communicate
their
message by
graphic
symbols.
The
size,
colour
combination and other standards for all road U'affic signs have been given
in ''Code of Practice for Road Signs" (IRC:67-1977).
5.2.
Road Markings
Road markings are probably the simplest, cheapest and most cost-
effective. They can regulate, warn or guide traffic through lines, symbols
or words. They also serve as symbolic barriers for separating the opposing
streams of traffic; provide information for turning movements, special
zones; and so
on. They
are very
important
at
intersections
to guide
pedestrians across the carriageway and thus promote road safety. They
not only contribute to road safety but also to the comfort and confidence
of the driver.
Road marking must
attract
immediate
attention,
have
adequate
legibility for the approach conditions and convey a clear meaning so as
to provide
sufficient
time
for
the
driver
to
respond. Road markings
mainly
include
central
line;
traffic
lanes;
pedestrian
crossings;
stop
lines; no overtaking zones; carriageway width reduction and transition
markings; pavement
edge
lines;
route
direction
arrows;
bus
stops;
parking space limits; yellow box to indicate no-stopping area, etc.
The Indian Roads Congress has developed uniform standards for
road markings and presented in **Code of Practice for Road Markings
(with paints)" (IRC:35-1970). For details, this document may be referred
to.
5.3.
Traffic Signals
A
traffic
signal
is
traffic
control
device
operated
manually,
electrically or mechanically by which
u-affic
is
alternately directed
to
stop
and
proceed.
Traffic
signals, when
properly
designed,
located



======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 84
======================================================================
18
and operated, achieve one or more of the following:
(i)
effect orderly traffic movement;
(ii)
provide
for the continuous flow of traffic in small platoons, through proper
coordination at a definite speed along a particular route;
(iii)
allow other vehicles and pedestrians to cross a heavy
traffic stream;
(iv)
reduce incidence of right-angle and pedestrian accidents;
(v)
signals have standard indications which
all drivers can follow easily, and are
understood more easily and effectively at night or in foggy weather than the
hand signals of a policeman;
(vi)
control traffic more economically than by manual methods.
Traffic signals can be operated either in isolation which
is more
common or as coordinated parts of the linked signal system. It is desirable
to link signals on a principal traffic route in order to reduce delay and
the number of stops at the signals. This is generally accomplished through
a
master
controller
that
determines
the
phasing
of
signals
at
each
intersection of the system. With micro-processor technology, this system
can be so programmed as to provide preferential treatment to the major
flow at peak-flow times, or optimise the Uraffic movements in the entire
area based on various computer-based optimisation models (Area Traffic
Control System).
The guidelines for design,
installation and other requirements of
traffic
signals have been
stipulated
in IRC:93-1985;
**Guidelines on
Design and Installation of Road Traffic Signals**.
5.4.
Miscellaneous Traffic Control Devices
The traffic conu-ol devices described in para 5.1 to 5.3 are normally
supplemented by die following devices for improving
traffic flow and
enhancing road safety:
*
Barricades
*
Traffic cones
Drums and rope
Box junction



======================================================================

19
*
Central refuges
*
Speed-breakers
*
Lighted traffic bollards
*
Reflective devices
5.4. 1
. Barricades: The barricades are used to warn and alert drivers
of hazards created by construction or maintenance activities on or around
carriageway/footpath. The following requirements must be borne in mind:
(i)
These barricades could be of wood, fibre-glass, P.V.C. or mild
steel,
(ii)
Barricades are painted with red and white stripes sloping downward at an
angle of 45** in the direction along which the traffic
is to pass.
(iii)
If the lane/road is closed to vehicles, vertical red and white stripes are used.
(iv)
The width of each
stripe should not be less than 20 cm.
(v)
The
barricades
should
be
invariably
reflectorised
and/or equipped
with
lighting devices for night-time
visibility.
(vi)
Barricades should be provided
vO cordon off the excavated area.
(vii)
While red light is used at either end of the protected area (on the barricade
across the road), yellow light should be put
at regular intervals along the
longitudinal barricades to guide the motorists along the diverted path. While
red light should be a steady indication, the yellow light should be on flashing
mode, preferably with directional arrows. Solar power lighting devices may
be used for this purpose as
is the practice in other countries.
A typical barricade is shown in Photograph 2, while its dimensions
are indicated in Fig.
5.
5.4.2 Traffic cones/bats: These
are
portable temporary devices
used to delineate the diverted path either around an obstacle or to create
additional space for traffic movement. They should have the following
important features:
(i)
They
are generally conical
in shape with
a minimum height of 75 cm and
maximum of 90 cm Bat shape devices are also found verv
effective.
(ii)
They should have a broader and heavy base for stability so that they do not fall
down easily.
(iii)
Cones are of red colour with white bands. Bats are of white colour with diagonal
stripes in red colour.

(iv)
Though these devices could be of fibre glass, plastic or special rubber, they must
be capable of withstanding impact without damage to themselves or to vehicles.
(v)
For night use they should be
either reflectorised or equipped with
lighting
devices.
A typical
traffic cone and bat are shown in Photograph

5.4.3.
Drums:
Barrels or drums
are normally used
as
a cheap
alternative to traffic cones or protective barricades. As the enforcement
authorities (Traffic Police) have easy access to such barrels (confiscated

are, sometimes, used for cordoning

of pavement. During working hours, the same barrels can be moved on
to the pavement to provide working room for the construction activity.
Moreover, as they give the appearance of being formidable obstacles, they
command the respect of drivers, and yet they do not cause serious damage
to a vehicle in the event of being suiick against. However, barrels arc
bulky and not readily transportable. Drums should be normally painted
with horizontal, circumferential, red and white reflectorized stripes. They
are generally 90 cm in height and have, at least, two red and two white
stripes that are 10 to 20 cm wide. These are generally metal drums of
125 to 250 liU"es capacity. A flashing warning light is used when drums
are used
singly, and steady warning
lights when used
in a
series
for
channelisation.
5.4.4.
Box
junction:
The
critical
junctions/areas
are
marked
with yellow crossed diagonal lines in the form of a box to indicate the
area where vehicles must not become stationary even for a short while.
Regulations
are
introduced by
legal
notifications
to
prohibit
drivers
from entering such area even if the signal light is green, unless they are
sure tliey will be able to clear the area immediately. Tliis ensures that in
event of heavy
traffic ahead
neither
the junction
is choked nor
the
cross-traffic
and
pedestrian movement
across
the
road
is
adversely
affected.
It
is absolutely imperative
to display sign-boards adequately and
conspicuously to forewarn motorists about the box junction (Fig. 8). The
width
of crossed-diagonal
lines
should be
10 cm
Tliese
lines
must
necessarily be of yellow colour alone.
5.4.5.
Central refuges: The refuge island (Fig. 9) provides a place
of
safety
for pedestrians
to enable them
to
cross wide roads
which,
ordinarily, tliey could not have crossed at one time because of changing
traffic signals or continuous stream of oncoming uaffic from opposite
direction. A typical use of the refuge
is on roads where small number of
people habitually cross at different points for one reason or the other. The
important requirements are listed below:
(i)
A pedestrian central refuge should have raised kerb and should not be less than
1.2 metres in width and 3.6 metres in length. Openings or dropped kerbs should
be provided in the centre island
to assist pedestrians.

(ii)
The central refuge reduces the width of carriageway which can reduce vehicle
speeds but sufficient width should be available for safe passage of the largest
vehicles likely
lo use the road.
(iii)
A refuge island should not be provided on a road which has width of less than
12 meters.
(iv)
As far as possible, refuge island should not be installed in isolation; otherwise,
it would be vulnerable lo collision by vehicles.
(v)
Parking and loading/unloading restrictions should be ordinarily considered on
either side of the refuge island upto a distance of 50 metres on each
side,
(vi)
Lighted traffic bollards must be fixed at each end of the refuge island
so that
vehicles are forewarned of the impending obstmction on the road during night
time.
(vii)
The lighted traffic bollard should be sufficiently high and wide to be conspicuous;
the ideal height
is
1.2 metres.



======================================================================
PAGE 39 of 84
======================================================================

(viii)
Zebra crossing may be considered
at such refuge island across the road.
(ix)
The refuge island should be invariably painted with black and white stripes so
as to be conspicuous from a distance.
(x)
Where the pedestrian
traffic
is very heavy, overhead halogen
lights are also
recommended so as to make the pedestrian crossings not only conspicuous but
also to have a psychological effect on motorists about something important.
It
automatically commands respect from motorists because pedestrians are visible
even from a good distance.
5.4.6.
Speed-breakers: Speed-breakers are traffic control devices
which
alert the driver of a change
in conditions and break speed of a
vehicles. They can consist of small asphalt stripes placed on the pavement
(called rumble strips) or be uniformly but gradually raised surface with
horizontal
top.
It
is
very
essential
to
adhere
to
the
Specifications
"Tentative Guidelines on the Provision of Speed-Breakers for Control of
Vehicular
Speeds
on
Minor
Roads
(IRC:99-1988)".
The
following
features must be borne in mind:
(i)
Speed-breakers should not be ordinarily installed on major roads where traffic
volume
is very heavy. They are mainly constructed on streets with dead-end,
crowded residential areas with local traffic, or on sharp curves where frequent
accidents take place.
(ii)
On approaches
to
railway
crossings or weak/narrow bridges,
rumble
strips
should be provided (instead of speed breakers). These should be marked with
thermo
plastic
paint
and
supplemented
by
warning/speed
limit
signs
on
approaches.
(iii)
If, the size and shape of speed breakers do not conform to the Specifications
contained in IRC:99-1988 they may be hazardous to
traffic.
(iv)
The speed-breakers must be invariably painted with black and white bands, as
per IRC:99-1988.
(v)
Warning
sign-boards
indicating
the
presence
of
speed-breaker,
must
be
conspicuously displayed, at least 40 meters ahead on either side of the device.
5.4.7. Lighted traffic bollards: A lighted traffic bollard is a lighted
device
installed on
a
channeliser/island
to forewarn
motorists of
the
impending obstruction threat.
It also indicates the direction of the traffic
flow. ITie following requirements are essential.
(i)
The height of such a bollard should be about
1 .2 metres, above the ground level.
(ii)
The bollard has a colour combination of white, blue and yellow. The area of



======================================================================
PAGE 40 of 84
======================================================================
28
exposure showing the directional arrow should be a minimum of 30 cm square
(or of 30 cm diameter if it is circular). The remaining lower part of the bollard
is lemon yellow/traffic yellow.
(iii)
The bollard should be illuminated inside by incandescent or flourescent light.
(iv)
As the bollard is vulnerable to accident it should be made of material such as
plastic so as to avoid injuries.
A typical lighted bollard is shown in Photograph 5 and its dimensions
are given in Fig. 10.

Reflective devices: Reflective devices such as cat's eye, peli
stud, delineators, island markers are placed on the pavement along the
kerb and dividers
to warn and guide motorists during night time. The
underlying principle
is that when head-light falls on such devices, they
reflect
light
and
become
self
illuminating
and
visible.
These
are
recommended for kerb line, guard stones, central dividers, refuge island,
channelisers, speed-breakers, on sharp curves and along central median
(witliout physical dividers).

TRAFFIC SEGREGATION
Traffic segregation techniques can be classified into two groups:
*
Vehicle-Vehicle Segregation
*
Pedestrian-Vehicle Segregation
*
Time Segregation.
6.1.
Vehicle-Vehicle Segregation Techniques
Segregation
principles
are
being
applied
all over
the
world
to
separate
the slow-moving
traffic from the
fast one,
especially
in
the
Central
Business
District. This can be achieved simply by imposing
certain legal restrictions. The lorry u-affic, wherever possible, is confined
to the outer areas and restrictions imposed on their movements in the city
limits during peak periods. On major roads where
sufficient width
is
available, separate lanes are designed for fast and slow vehicles by using
painted lines or physical dividers. In some cases, even the minimum and
maximum speeds are also indicated. The following requirements must be
borne in mind.
(i)
Central dividers are not desirable on carriageways of width less than 18 meters,
unless
otherwise found essential for safety reasons.
In any case, minimum
carriageway width of 7.5m on either side for facilitating 2+2 effective lanes,
separated by a divider of minimum width of 1.2 m (i.e. total carriageway width
of 16.2m) must be available before considering the physical central dividers:
otherwise, continuous double lines be painted in the centre.
(ii)
The physical central dividers are not recommended on bridges and flyovers,
unless
the width of carriageway
in each direction
is
7.5
metres.
It must be
ensured that the effective carriageway width
at the approaches
is uniformally
carried through the bridge/flyover. However, continuous double lines should be
painted to separate the opposing traffic; yellow paint would be more conspicuous.
(iii)
The
central
dividers/verge should have adequate width
so
that
it
serves as
refuges for pedestrians to take shelter and can also accommodate other required
road furniture such as signal and/or lighting posts.
(iv)
Where
inadequate
central

provided,
it
is
desirable
to do
landscaping
so
that
glare
of

6.2.
Pedestrian Vehicle Segregation Techniques
These techniques can be classified into the following three categories:
*
Lx)ngitudinal segregation
*
Lateral segregation
*
Total segregation
*
Spatial segregation
6.2.1.
Longitudinal segregation
(i)
This mainly includes construction of side-walks/footpaths. The Spedfications
are given in IRC: 103- 1988 ''Guidelines for Pedestrian Facilities".
(ii)
Raised footpaths are always preferable. However, where not possible,
it is
absolutely essential
to segregate footpath from the carriageway by using
guard
stones
and
railings.
Railings
along
footpath/central
dividers
are
particularly important near the intersections so as to force pedestrians to
cross
only
at the designated zebra markings.
6.2.2.
Lateral segregation: Lateral segregation is mainly done to
ensure safe crossing of pedestrians across the path of vehicles. It includes
the following:
(i)
Zebra Crossing: IRC:35-1970 "Code of Practice for Road Markings (with
paints)" may be referred for details.
(ii)
Refuge island (discussed in para 5.4.5 of these guidelines)
(iii)
Railings along central dividers
Such railings are provided on those roads where pedestrians tend
to cross erratically, especially in the congested areas.
(iv)
Pederstrian
traffic
signal
(IRC:93-1985,
"Guidelines
on
Design
and
Installation of Road Traffic Signals" may be referred
for details)
(v)
Foot-over bridges
(vi)
Pedestrian subways
(vii)
Sky-walks
A
typical foot-over bridge,
pedestrian subway and skywalk
are
shown in Photographs
6, 7 and 8 respectively.

6.2.3.
Total segregation: The most ideal
situation
is, however,
complete pedestrianisation. The streets with intense pedestrian pressure
could
be
declared
^pedestrian
only
streets.*
The
restrictions
on
the
movement of vehicles may be imposed either during the pedestrian peak-
time only, or throughout
the day, depending upon the
local
situation.
Where several such streets meet, the
total area may be converted into
'Tedestrian
Only*'
area commonly known
as
'pedestrian
plaza'
or
'pedestrian precinct' or 'pedestrian mair. The following points must be
borne in mind while implementing such pedestrian schemes:
(i)
All such precincts must have arrangement for easy access to the emergency
vehicles like fire-brigade, ambulance.
(ii)
Goods vehicles must be provided reasonable access for loading and unloadng
during certain hours.
(iii)
Adequate parking space must be available in the vicinity so that the walking
distance
is resonable and the business in the area
is not adversely affected.
(iv)
Alternative routes are available for diverting the vehicular traffic thus displaced.
(v)
Bus service should not be adversely affected and passengers must be brought
within a reasonable walking distance.
(vi)
The encroachments, particularly hawkers/vendors, are adequately checked by
the authorities.
(vii)
The boundaries of pedestrian areas must be clearly demarcated and warning
signs
both
for
pedestrians
and
motorists
conspicuously
displayed on
such
boundaries to avoid confusion and improve safety. These warnings are expected
to perform the following functions.
*
Indicate to the pedestrian that he
is leaving an area where he enjoyed
complete freedom of movement or vice-versa.
*
Inform motorists that they are entering a zone which permits them only
restricted freedom of movement in terms of time, space
etc.
It
is,
therefore, recommended
that
the
entire pedestrian zone
is
created at a level different than the motorable roads and/or paved with
special material so as
to be prominent.
6.2.4. Spatial segregation: There are special segregation techniques
for the cyclists, buses, etc.
(i)
Bicycles tracks have been dealt within IRC:1 1-1962, "Recommended Practice



======================================================================
PAGE 46 of 84
======================================================================
34
for the Design and Layout of Cycle Tracks". The cycle tracks and side walks
should not be at the same level; a level difference of 10-15 cm is desirable in
the interest of pedestrian
safety. The boundary of the cycle track should be
clearly marked with white paint.
(ii)
Bus segregation is achieved through bus lanes and bus only streets. Bus lanes
and bus only
streets are discussed later under "Bus Priority Techniques'*.
6.3.
Time Segregation
Time segregation is meant to regulate the movement of vehicles by
time of the day. For example the heavy vehicles are not allowed during
peak hours in busy areas.
7. DEMAND MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES
The planning and transport policies should not be based on completely
unrestricted use of the motor vehicle. Emphasis needs to be laid on the
management of urban
transport system
to ensure movement of more
people in fewer vehicles in least time, while preserving and improving
the environment. Therefore extravagant use of low-occupancy private
cars especially in the busy and congested areas should be limited. This
can
be
achieved
through
traffic
resu*aint
and demand management
techniques which
inliibit or resU^ict car use in city centre.
The underlying principle is that the benefits a road user obtains from
a particular journey is more than the price that he would be prepared to
pay in order to make the journey. But,
if the price charged for making
a U"ip was gradually increased, then the point would be reached at which
the Uip maker would either decide not to go, or to go by another mode
of transport, or at another time. The principles of demand and supply
become very relevant in this context. The demand for use of road network
in a particular area, can be curtailed by raising price, directly or indirectly,
by levying taxes on the use of public roads and parking places, etc. In
other words, those who are responsible for causing
u-affic congestion
should be made to pay exu-a.
Basically these resu-aint methods should be:
(i)
Flexible, to meet differing and changing needs;
(ii)
efficient, so that undue restriction
is avoided;
(iii)
selective, by type, area and time of journey;



======================================================================
PAGE 47 of 84
======================================================================
35
(iv)
fair, and acceptable to the community at large;
(v)
simple, to administer and enforce, and not open to abuse;
(vi)
easy to understand and to follow for both casual and regular travellers.
Traffic, restraint can be achieved by two methods:
*
Indirect methods
*
Direct methods
7.1.
Indirect Methods
One of the major thrusts of the indirect methods
is in the area of
pubhc transport option. The motorists are encouraged to switch over to
pubhc
transport by making the
latter cheap, convenient, comfortable,
readily
available, and
highly
efficient.
Simultaneously,
restraints
are
imposed on
the movement of
the
personalised
transport which may
include:
*
banning of a particular class of vehicles
at certain time and/or in certain
areas;
*
auto-free zones where vehicles are totally prohibited;
*
special bus lanes and streets where space is reserved exclusively for public
buses and emergency vehicles;
*
prohibition of entry and turns, and limited access
facilities.
Bus priority techniques along with restrictions on the movement of
the personalised uransport through regulatory techniques yield the intended
results.
7.2.
Direct Methods
The following techniques are considered under this sub-head.
*
Parking controls
*
Road and bridge
tolls
•
*
Road pricing
*
Odd-even auto
traffic restraint
*
Staggering of office hours.



======================================================================
PAGE 48 of 84
======================================================================
36
7.2.1. Parking controls: Parking controls are the most widely used
form of restraint in almost all the cities of the world. These may include
parking restrictions along major arteries, either 24 hours or during the
peak time, depending upon the local conditions and requirements. Lately,
parking pricing
is becoming very popular,
as
it not only achieves the
objectives of reducing traffic congestion but also earns revenue.
It also
ensures that car spaces are not misused by a few for garaging, but are
put to optimum use for those who need them for the absolute minimum
time. Parking controls achieve the following:
*
make efficient use of parking spaces;
*
recover the cost of providing parking spaces;
*
reduce congestion and prevent obstruction to moving vehicles;
The parking pricing
is effected through the following methods.
(i)
Off-Street Pay and Park Areas
Off-street
parking
is
created
either
in
the
designated
parking
lots
(however,
selection should be done intelligently) or by constructing special multi-storey buildings
or under-ground parking garages. Tariff is collected either manually or by-using electronic/
mechanical aids.
(ii)
Oii-Steert Parking Meters
Where off-street parking facilities are limited while the demand for parking is very
high, parking meters may be installed along the kerb line of the roads where such parking
would not hamper the traffic flow. Such schemes are generally implemented in commercial/
shopping areas.
(iii)*^ Park-and-Ridc System
Large off-street parking areas are created to enable niolorists to park their vehicles
and switch over to the public transport like buses, trains, trams, etc. for onward journey
to their work places, so that the traffic volume along major arteries leading to the Central
Business Districts (C.B.D.) as well as the road network within the C.B.D.
is substantially
reduced.
7.2.1.1.
Requirements:
It may
be, however, remembered
that
motorists would tend to park on other roads in
tlie vicinity of the area
under parking c( n^rol. In other words, they are likely to foul otlier roads
'^nd areas where c )ngestion may consequently increase.
It
is, therefore.



======================================================================
PAGE 49 of 84
======================================================================
37
necessary to impose parking restrictions on all streets adjacent to the areas
where parking pricing has been introduced. Good parking enforcement
is the pre-requisite of the success of this system, which may be ensured
by employing traffic wardens, traffic policemen, towing cranes, etc.
Parking controls reduce
the peak-period
traffic and improve
the
general flow along such streets. As parking controls are not applicable
for the through-u-affic, the latter is encouraged to use such areas where
movement has now improved. In other words, while the congestion may
drop temporarily,
the
through-u*affic from other areas
is
likely
to be
atu-acted to such roads.
7.2.2. Road and bridge tolls: Tolls are generally collected for the
use of highways, bridges, tunnels and ferries. Most of these
tolls are
inu-oduced to recover the cost of the facilities so provided. As alternative
routes are available to motorists, this technique imposes traffic resU'aint
only
to some extent and may not prove very effective
as
a
resuraint
measure.
7.2.3. Road pricing: It is a technique that requires drivers of certain
categories of vehicles to purchase special licenses to use such vehicles
at specified times (generally peak-period) in designated areas (generally
the Central Business District). This technique, therefore, has an advantage
over the parking cortrol technique
in as much
that
it
affects moving
vehicles
as
well.
It
is based on the principle
diat vehicles
that cause
congestion in the busy office and commercial areas must be made to pay
for
it. Public buses, school buses and emergency vehicles are normally
exempted from these restrictions.
The
following
requirements
must
be
borne
in
mind
while
implementing such schemes:
(i)
Tlie area in which
restrictions are intended should be clearly defined by
proper boundary signs.
(ii)
The
restrictep
zone
must
have
the minimum
entry
points
for
effective
enforcement.
(iii)
Drivers entering the zone should display the licence on the wind screen.
(iv)
Such licences should be easily available at places like post offices, petrol
pumps, etc.



======================================================================
PAGE 50 of 84
======================================================================
38
(v)
This system requires good and effective enforcement so that drivers are not
able to cheat.
(vi)
The design of the licences should be such that it attracts immediate attention
and cannot be easily forged.
(vii)
Public acceptance of scheme, specially where mixed landuse of commercial
and residences exist is necessary.
(viii)
The road pricing can be varied with time of the day, but may be effected
only during peak hours.
(ix)
A
pre-rcquisite
for
the
success
of such
road
pricing
technique
is
the
availability of efficient, comfortable, cheap and convenient public transport
system to attract the affluent car-owners.
Such techniques ensure that people either pool their vehicles, or use
public transport, or change their journey routes or stagger journey time
to avoid entry through the restricted zones. This in turn, reduces traffic
congestion and accidents, and improves the environment besides saving
precious fuel.
7.2.4.
Odd-even auto
restrictions:
This
technique
envisages
restriction on private vehicles which have licence numbers beginning with
an even number from using the main arterials and certain designated areas
during certain days say on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Similarly,
tliose beginning with an odd number are restticted on other days
viz.
Tuesdays and Thursdays. The
restrictions can
also be imposed
with
reference to odd and even dates, instead of days of the week; Saturdays
and Sundays are generally excluded because of lean traffic days.
7.2.5.
Staggering of office hours:
It is one of the latest transport
demand management techniques being used in various advanced countries.
It envisages level or even out of peak-hours transport demand through the
staggering of office hours (opening and closing times).
As most offices and establishments open at about the same time,
there
is a heavy surain on
tlie public transport and on the main arteries
during peak hours. Therefore, the staggering of work hours for a longer
period can help spread the peak-load and relieve die extreme overcrowding
in buses, trains and u*ams, and congestion on the main arteries. Staggering
does
not reduce
the
total demand;
it only evens
out the demand
to
manageable proportions.



======================================================================
PAGE 51 of 84
======================================================================
39
Though this technique
is inexpensive and easily implementable,
it
is absolutely
necessary
to study
the existing conditions and transport
services schedules, their capacity limitations, origins and destinations of
workers, their travelling times, the inter-dependence of various types of
establishments, the need for certain core hours when
all establishments
should be working at normal full strength,
tlieir geographical locations,
etc. The
success of
this scheme
entails
voluntary cooperation of the
employers and the employees.
8. BUS PRIORITY TECHNIQUES
The priority for buses
is mainly related to movement of people as
opposed to movement of vehicles. The road space should be allocated to
the competing transport modes on the basis of demand and tlieir efficiency
in
terms
of
passenger
carrying
capacity.
Tlie
main
objective
is
to
provide protection to buses from delays which are associated with traffic
congestion. The bus which
is delayed by
congestion
will
find more
passengers waiting
at bus
stops and
will continue
to loose
time.
Tlie
following bus will find fewer passengers at the stops and may, tlierefore,
overtake the first one resulting in the familiar phenomenon of bunching.
Consequently, the service on the whole line
is disrupted.
It is, therefore,
necessary to accord priority to buses so as to make the public transport
more efficient and attractive with a view to discouraging private motorists
from bringing their personal vehicles on to roads, especially during peak-
time.
The following techniques are generally used to provide the desired
priority:
*
Priority manoeuvres;
*
Bus lanes;
*
Bus precincts;
8.1.
Priority Manoeuvres
It is a simple technique to give priority to buses by permitting them
turning movements which are prohibited to other vehicles. This
is often
used as a part of one-way scheme or in conjunction with contra-flow bus



======================================================================
PAGE 52 of 84
======================================================================
40
lane. However, this technique entails better enforcement so as to ensure
that other vehicles do not violate thereby defeating the main objective.
It is, therefore, necessary to fix sign-boards prominendy, indicating, for
example *Right turn only for Buses*.
It is also advisable to paint **Bus
only** along with the right turning arrow on the carriageway.
8.2.
Bus Lanes
Bus lanes are the most common form of bus priority techniques,
when road space
is set aside for buses either at a particular time or at
all times. Such lanes can be either with-flow or contra-flow.
8.2.1.
With-flow bus lane: A with-flow bus lane, (Fig. 11), is one
where buses move along the direction of traffic. Such a special lane
is
created when a part of the road
is exclusively reserved for buses.
It
is
usually
reserved
along
the
kerb
side,
and
in
the
centre
in
special
circumstances. The central reservation
is generally done on freeways/
expressways where bus stops are not frequent as the passengers are highly
exposed to traffic in such lanes. Therefore, on arterial roads, where bus
stops are frequent, reservation is made near the kerb side. Such bus lanes
are usually in operation only during the morning and evening peak hours.
These special lanes are sometimes made available to other High Occupancy
Vehicles (HOV)
as
well,
such
as
cars
with minimum four
persons,
contract
and
school
buses
and emergency
vehicles.
This
however,
depends on the local conditions that vary from city to city. Such lanes
are normally provided only
if the frequency of buses
is at least 60 per
hour and number of passengers moved by these buses is at least 1.5 times
the number carried by other vehicles in the same direction.
8.2.1.1.
Associated problems: On most Indian roads, which are
generally narrow and have a lot of mixed traffic, commercial establishments,
taxi and auto-rickshaw
stands, with-flow bus
lanes may not prove
a
success. However, where bus frequency
is very high and express bus
service
is also operative, such lanes may prove counter productive, as
boarding and alighting at a bus stop may hold all buses behind unnecessarily.
It
is also very difficult to shift
all taxi/auto-rickshaw stands to bylanes.
As various encroachments, excavations, garbage dumps and other such
impediments force pedestrians, many a times, to move on the carriageway.



======================================================================

======================================================================
PAGE 54 of 84
======================================================================
42
not only such bus lanes may not prove very useful but are also likely to
pose safety hazards. These lanes may also curtail substantially the space
for other vehicles on the carriageway, thus creating artificial traffic jams.
The success of such special lanes presupposes good enforcement and
would, therefore, call for large deployment of enforcement personnel all
through the lane. The other problems may be:
(a)
problem
related
to
deliveries,
thus
inviting
protest
from
traders
and
shopkeepers;
(b)
problem of turning movements at intersections;
(c)
delay
at the
stop along the lane when
it
is being used by several buses
sharing the same stop.
8.2.1.2.
Introduction requirements
(i)
Availability of minimum two effective lanes (each 3.5 m wide) in addition
to the reserved lane (minimum 4 m width);
(ii)
Painting single continuous white lines (each 25 cm wide) to delineate the
boundary;
(iii)
Painting of bus symbol and arrows to conspicuously indicate the lane 'buses
only';
(iv)
Time of operation to be indicated on the lane;
(v)
Sign-boards to be displayed prominently all along the lane, indicating the
specific time of operation; and
(vi)
Installation of red flasher lights at important junctions, especially where the
lane
is being discontinued
(either for some distance or completely), and
amber flasher at the beginning/intermittent entry points.
8.2.2.
Centra-flow bus lane: It is a lane on g one-way road, solely
reserved for buses that are permitted to drive against the flow of other
vehicles so that direct route of buses is not hampered by tlie introduction
of the one-way system and commuters are not inconvenienced.
The conu-a-flow bus lane, (Fig.
12), should not be less than 4 m
wide. Such bus
lanes
are usually
in operation
for 24 hours
to avoid
confusion. All other requirements are the same as spelt out in case of with-
flow bus lanes. Contra-flow bus lanes are generally introduced only when
flow
exceeds
30
buses
an
hour.
Tliey
are
also made
available
to
emergency vehicles and sometimes even to school
buses.

8.2.3.
Reversible bus
lane:
It
is
a with-flow bus
lane
that
is
provided in the centre and is used in the appropriate direction depending
upon the direction of the peak-flow. During the non-peak period, this lane
is used as a turning lane.
8.3.
Bus Precincts
Bus precincts are 'bus only sU"eets' also known as 'bus malls'. These
are normally introduced in city centres where pedestrian and bus activity
is very high. Access to such streets is permitted only to buses, emergency
vehicles
and
pedestrians. The
remaining
traffic
is
normally
diverted
through otlier roads. Parking lots are created at the periphery, with access
only through side lanes, so as
to facilitate drivers to leave their cars in
parking areas and take
lift in buses (known as park-and-ride system).
The introduction requirements are mainly proper signage and lane
markings. Central refuge islands should also be considered for helping
pedestrians cross the carriageway safely.
8.4.
Bus Priority Signal System
Traffic signals account for a major part of delay on urban streets.
With
a view
to promoting
the
public
transport system
they may
be
accorded high priority by suitable modifications of the signals system so
that there is minimum delay at intersections, lliis can be achieved through
the following two methods:
(i)
Bus pre-emption teihiiiqiie
'Bus pre-emption
is achieved by
fitting transponders on buses and
receivers on
traffic signal controllers. When a bus approaches a signal, the transponder sends a signal
which
is
detected
by
the
loop-detector
in
the
carriageway.
This
detector,
in
turn,
communicates with the signal controller which either terminates the cross-flow early or
extends the running green on the approach to enable the bus to clear the intersection. To
prevent
traffic queues
building up on
side
roads, an
additional mnning
time can be
subsequently allocated to them when no bus
is present on the main road, thus restoring
some of the time lost
to other traffic. Such priority can be extended to even emergency
vehicles.
(ii)
Co-ordinated traffic signals system
As buses have to halt at various stops between the signals and the halting time keeps
varying, they can rarely take advantage of the co-ordinated signals systems. To overcome



======================================================================
PAGE 57 of 84
======================================================================
45
this problem, a computer software has been developed to optimise the signal settings to
minimise
delay
to
buses
throughout
the
control
network.
This programme
takes
into
account the variation in bus journey time (compared with other vehicles) along each link
and the time spent at bus stops on that link. Accordingly, the priority is accorded to buses.
In the signal system that
is not vehicle-actuated, the fixed time signal can be so
designed as to give extra preference to the link having the maximum bus routes. Another
solution is to provide bus sluice (an empty lane from the end of bus lane to intersection
stop line). The said empty lane is usable only by 'buses so that they can go ahead without
getting caught in the traffic queue at the intersection. Naturally when the signal turns green
buses would be the
first to cross the intersection.
Though the bus priority signal system is not strictly low-cost,
it is certainly cost-
effective and can improve the overall efficiency of the public transit vehicles by 10 to
30 per cent.
8.5.
Bus Operations Management System
The following bus operations management techniques can also be
very useful in improving the public bus efficiency on important links.
Such techniques help in reducing the waiting time at tickfet counters and
bus stops, time for getting in and out at loading/unloading points, besides
minimising the chances on bunching of buses, especially during the peak
hours, along major routes. This ultimately reduces delays at intersections
and stagger the bus load ujiiformly in the entire network.

SELF-ENFORCING TECHNIQUES
Financial constraints and administrative difficulties restrain the use
of manpower and modern equipment to the bare minimum. Therefore,
it
is necessary to evolve simple engineering and management techniques
which can ensure
U^affic
discipline
automatically. The
self-enforcing
techniques make the enforcement easier and simpler, thus optimising the
use
of manpower
and
eliminating/minimising
the
need
for modem/
specialised equipment. Some of these techniques are listed below:
9.1.
Central Dividers
Central dividers on wide roads ensure
that vehicles confine their
movements only to
tlie correct carriageway, thus avoiding any conflict
with
traffic from the opposite direction.
9.2.
Railings
Tlie railings over central dividers, or along footpaths, ensure that
pedestrians do not cross erratically or spill over the carriageway.
9.3.
Parabolic Dividers
Parabolic dividers and flower-beds which have a height of nearly
1 metre ensure pedestrian discipline. As tlie railings in the middle of roads
are very vulnerable to accidents, parabolic dividers and llower-beds serve
the same purpose more efficiently, besides improving the environment.
A typical parabolic divider is shown in Photograph 9 while Fig. 13
gives the specifications.
9.4.
Channelisers
Channelisers
at intersections ensure
safe
turning movement and
proper lane discipline. Specially designed chamiclisers may be used at
those corners where certain turning or movement restrictions are to be
imposed. Some
typical
channelisers,
coirunonly
used,
are shown
in
Fig.
14.

Queue Channels
To ensure taxi queue discipline at airports, railway stations, hotels,
cinema tlieatres and other such important traffic generators,
it is desirable



======================================================================
PAGE 61 of 84
======================================================================
49
to delineate the queue channels by the use of raised kerbs so as to achieve
the following:
*
No unscrupulous taxi driver can jump queue to pick up passengers out of
turn.
*
The taxi queue does not interfere with the main traffic.
*
The passengers are given a specific area for boarding & alighting so as to
ensure their safety.
*
Unless the first taxi moves, other taxi behind cannot. It would automatically
ensure that no taxi refuses passengers for short distances.
*
Only one
police
constable
at
the head of the queue can ensure proper
discipline.
The width of such taxi channels should be about 2.2 metres for 4
wheelers and 2 meu-es for auto-rickshaws, Fig.
15.
9.6.
Parking Notches
Wherever footpaths are very wide while the parking demand is very
high, the authorities may consider permitting angular parking by providing
notches
in footpaths
to ensure orderly parking and in-out movements.
Fig.
16.
9.7.
Sleeping Policeman
To
avoid speed-breakers which
are normally
detested by most
motorists,
artificial bottlenecks can be created
at such locations. Such
bottlenecks also known as
* 'Sleeping Policeman" (Fig. 17) can be in the
form of convex protrusion of footpaths. These are provided generally in
the
residential
areas where
the
traffic
is mainly
local.
It
serves
the
following functions:
*
helps pedestrians as they have to cross shorter width;
*
commands respect from drivers as they cannot afford to be
fast;
*
continuous parking nuisance
is eliminated.
9.8.
Bus Bays/Bus Boxes
Bus bays are useful for proper marshalling of buses to the bus stop
without interferring with the main traffic flow on the carriageway. The

width of such bus channels should not be less than 3 metres, delineated
by
a
painted white
strip. Where
space
permits, bus bays
should be
segregated
by^ consuiicting
raised
dividers/islands.
However,
lighted
bollards must be fixed at the mouth of such bays on the divider so as to
fore-warn other motorists. The lay-byes (setbacks off the carriageway) are
preferable. Where adequate space is not available for consuiicting a lay-
bye, bus boxes should be painted in white for the guidance of drivers and
commuters (Fig.
18).
It will automatically ensure that commuters do not
spill onto this channel area and confine themselves only to the bus stops.
The lay-byes should conform to IRC:70-1977,
* 'Guidelines on Regulation
and Control of Mixed Traffic in Urban Areas'*.
9.9.
Share-a-Taxi System
This system envisages a point-to-point service from an important
a-affic generator to a common destination. In this scheme a taxi carries
four persons on a tariff computed on the basis of normal fare divided by
three. In other words, while each passengers pays only one-third of the
normal fare, the taxi driver gets about 33 per cent more. Naturally, the
chances of refusal to ply over short distance or charging excessively, etc.
are
almost eliminated. Moreover, such
taxis function
as
intermediate
public transport, reducing the load on public buses and utilising the taxi
occupancy to its optimum. Besides this system would increase the supply
of public U'ansport system.
The auto-rickshaws can also be covered by such scheme, carrying
three passengers. Total fare, comprising normal fare increased by 25 per
cent is divided by three to work out the tariff payable by each passenger.
This system, in slightly different form, is operating in some of the cities
like Sural, Jamshedpur, Indore, etc.
In large cities, this system can also benefit ladies who can form their
own group for taking a common ride that makes them feel secured.
Such scheme should be worked out in close association with the taxi/
auto-rickshaw associations after conducting survey of the areas so that
there is enough clientage for a particular route. The waiting time should
not exceed five minutes, which means four passengers must be available



======================================================================

55
every five minutes, so that the scheme along
thiat route
is successful.
It
is equally necessary to provide general taxi/auto-rickshaw stands in the
close vicinity of share-a-taxi stand so that passengers have a choice.
9.10.
Fixed Tariff System (Pre-paid Service)
At the airports, railway terminals, etc., there
is a tendency on the
part of taxi drivers to exploit passengers by overcharging or taking them
through longer routes or refusing to ply over short distances, or fleeing
passengers by
other means.
It
naturally
causes
serious
enforcement
burden and the need for deployment of traffic police personnel check such
activities.
It
is therefore, desirable to introduce the following system.
The entire c'ty can be divided into various zones and the normal
fares for the maximum distance in these zones are calculated. For the first
zone, about 100 per cent extra incentive in the fare so calculated is given
and the incentive for the subsequent zones is successively reduced; 30 per
cent - 40 per cent being the incentive for the last zone. These incentives
ensure that taxi-drivers are not tempted to indulge in mal-practices and
do not refuse plying over a short distance after long waiting at the queue.
The incentive amount offsets the waiting time.
A ticket counter is set up where the passenger buys a ticket for his
destination zone at a fixed rate. His name, address and destination are
recorded in the register and cab number is written on the receipt handed
over to him. This receipt is countersigned by the passenger after reaching
his destination. The
taxi driver collects the fare from ticket counter by
producing the countersigned receipt. The details
of both the driver and
passenger are available now with the traffic police. It ensures that, in the
event of a problem or crime, the passengers/drivers can be immediately
traced.
It acts as a psychological deterrent to unscrupulous taxi drivers
and provides a sense of security to the passengers. There is no monetary
exchange between the driver and the passenger.
A token amount is charged as a part of the fare payable to the taxis
as service charge. The amount so collected helps
in the operation and
maintentmce
of
the
ticket
counters. Good
sign-boards
are
absolutely
necessary
to inform passengers
about
tliis
system. They
should
also



======================================================================
PAGE 68 of 84
======================================================================
56
indicate various destinations and
the chargeable fare. Warning boards
should also be displayed advising passengers not to hire a taxi from any
other place.
10.
PUBLIC INTERACTION TECHNIQUES
Traffic Management scheme can hardly be successful without the
active participation and acceptance of the public. Voluntary cooperation
is
essentially
the
first
stage
of
public
interaction,
as
it
creates
an
environment where
the
road
user
is
taken
into
confidence
by
the
adminisU'ation, to accept the right of other road users and willingly modify
his own behaviour in the larger
interests. Pedestrians crossing only
at
specified zebra crossing, motorists confining to their lanes, minimum use
of horns,
etc.
are some
illustrations of
this dictum. This can be best
achieved through public communication by using all possible media. The
following media are generally available to the local administration.
10.1.
Large Displays
These displays could be in the form of hoardings, banners, kiosks,
some of the hoardings are as shown in Photographs
10,
11 and
12.
Photo. 10



======================================================================
PAGE 69 of 84
======================================================================
57



======================================================================
PAGE 70 of 84
======================================================================
58
Simple but interesting
traffic messages can be conveyed through
hoardings
located
at
vantage
points
and
banners
near
important
intersections. These messages should be periodically changed to avoid
monotony. All these displays should carry, as far as possible, the same
message, or at least the same concept, during a certain period.
It would
ensure
persistence of
the same concept/message, and
this would
get
impressed into road users mind since they would come across the same
message
throughout
the
city.
Normally
the
periodicity
of changing
messages should be one month.
The
bus
shelters,
foot
overbridges
and
fly-overs
can
also
be
exploited for displaying such messages,
as shown
in Photographs
13
and
14.
10.2.
Electronic Hoardings
Electronic hoardings can be effectively used for relaying variable
messages
to
keep
the
public
not
only
informed
of
various
traffic
innovations but also to give them interesting facts and statistics so that
their curiosity
is maintained.



======================================================================
PAGE 71 of 84
======================================================================
59
Photo. 14
10.3.
Mobile Messages
Traffic messages can also be commimicated by using stickers at the
rear of taxis and cars; posters fixed at back and side panels as well as
inside the public buses. These are shown in Photograph
15.
10.4.
LeaHets
Leaflets providing advance information about modifications and
implementation of new u-affic schemes, special arrangements on the eve
of important festivals and public functions, do's and don'ts of U-affic
safety; and other information of common public
interest can be very
effective. These should be printed in different languages namely: English,
Hindi, and the local language
(if different).



======================================================================
PAGE 72 of 84
======================================================================
60
Photo. 15
10.5.
Periodical Press Notes
The Press Note should be issued at regular intervals through leading
newspapers and magazines
informing
the
public
about
the proposed
traffic management
plans,
enforcement
drives,
cautionary
messages,
accidents
statistics and other useful
U-affic information that may be of
interest to the public. All traffic regulations and changes must be made
known to the public through such Press Notes.
Senior officers should also give interviews to the Press so that public
gets an insight about the not-so-obvious
traffic
aspects.
It also
elicits
public opinion about various measures taken by the local authorities so
that the administration gets the correct feedback to enable it to reconsider
certain changes and effect necessary alterations,
if required.
10.6.
T.V. & Radio Broadcast
T.V. and Radio are two very powerful media for reaching the public,
T.V. interviews, panel discussions and road safety films. Radio broadcast
on
traffic related matters should be organised
at frequent intervals
in
various languages. These two media can also be used for informing the
public about various traffic management measures that become necessary
on the eve of important events and major religious festivals.



======================================================================
PAGE 73 of 84
======================================================================
61
In view
of
the development of cable T.V.
network and
video
cassettes, the authorities can also persuade the concerned entrepreneurs
to keep some slots for telecasting traffic messages. At the end of video
cassette, normally blank recording space is available. It can be gainfully
used for traffic messages/films.
10.7.
Greeting Cards
Greeting Cards
with
suitable
traffic message
should be
sent
to
important personalities, voluntary organisations, public representatives
and political leaders, office bearers of various unions, members of the
Press, eminent
citizens and
all
those whose opinion
matter
in
traffic
management, on a couple of occasions such
as New Year and other
National days. These courtesies and decent gestures would earn the traffic
authorities the appreciation and willing suppoprt of such persons, without
which no major U'affic management plan can be successful.
10.8.
Seminars and Talks
Social organisations, commercial groups, associations representing
interest of road
users,
etc.
should
be
encouraged
to hold
seminars,
symposia,
workshops
and
panel
discussions.
All
proposed
important
traffic management schemes that are likely to have major impact on the
movement of various road users can be discussed threadbare so
tliat the
benefits tliat are likely to accrue get highlighted and apprehensions of tlie
public,
if any, an* removed.
It would also help in getting the objective
feedback so
that the
authorities may consider various suggestions and
effect appropriate modifications,
if so required
10.9.
Committees
Various
committees
representing
interests
of
different
road
users should be formed so that all sections of road users feel that
tJieir
interests
are
being
safeguarded
by
their
representatives.
Regular
meetings should also be held with the representatives of various unions
of taximen, transport operators, auto-rickshaws, etc. Special consultative
committees should be formed to deal with the specific issues, as
it helps
in bringing members, representing divergent
interests, across the
table



======================================================================

to appreciate various pros and cons of any important traffic management
scheme.
10.10.
Students Participation
The students should be actively involved in traffic discipline and
road safety so that an era of traffic culture can be ushered in.
The
authorities should
encourage 'Road Safety Patrol'
(R.S.P.)
activities
in
all
schools covering
children of
the age group of ^9-14.
Traffic
officers
should
visit
such
schools
and
impart them
traffic
education. They should be shown traffic safety films and guided about
various
do's
and
don'ts
on
the
road.
Outdoor
activities
like Road
Safety Weeks, Fuel Conservation Weeks, RSP Camps,
etc. should be
periodically organised, besides holding essay, painting, slogan and quiz
contests on traffic subjects, so as to stimulate the young ones thinking on
this vital aspect of life. The services of these children should also be used
during important bandobasts to supplement the traffic manpower.
It
is equally necessary
to involve
the college students
in similar
activities for promoting road safety. They can also help the traffic police
in disciplining the pedestrians, other road users, and controlling the bus
queues, etc.
10.11.
Traffic Warden Scheme
It
is equally necessary to seek community participation in traffic
control
and
road
sefety.
Volunteers
amongst
the
public
should
be
intelligently selected so
that the undesirable elements do not enter the
ranks. Such
volunteers
should- be imparted
special
training and
then
inducted
as
traffic
wardens. They can help
in
controlling
traffic
at
intersections, disciplining the pedestrians and noting down U-affic violations.
Periodical review meetings should be held with them. However, a close
watch on their working is necessary to make sure that no one takes undue
advantage of these powers.
10.12.
Traffic Exhibitions
The
authorities
should prepare
interesting
audio-visual
displays,
electronics games, etc. to convey u*affic messages more effectively. They



======================================================================
PAGE 75 of 84
======================================================================
63
should hold exhibitions with these displays and screen road safety films
at different places to educate the common man.
10.13.
Traffic Parks
Children parks should be created to inject traffic awareness amongst
school
children through
*play &
learn games*. Such parks
teach
the
children
as
to how they should make use of the roads
as
motorists,
cyclists
as well as pedestrians. Photograph 16 show some
profiles of
such parks.
Photo. 16
10.14.
Traffic Booths/Aid Post
Small cabins
should be
installed
at important
locations such
as
railway stations, airports, bus terminals and other important areas so tliat
Traffic Police can provide general assistance to the public
in terms of
information, first-aid, communication, etc. These booths should display
useful information about hospitals, airlines and train timings, hotels, etc.
so as to enhance the image of the Traffic Department as good Samaritans.
They
also provide
a nucleus and
field base
for
the
u^affic personnel
deployed in a particular area. One such booth is shown in Photograph 17.



======================================================================

======================================================================
riioto. 17
These public relations/public interaction techniques can energise the
community
into
active
participation.
Large
business
houses,
social
organisations and various citizens groups can be thus motivated to provide
the infrastructure
to impart Uraffic education and the above mentioned
traffic aids. In return, they can be allowed to advertise their names and
logos on all such aids. Their help can be sought for providing, in addition
to the aforementioned items, footpath and central railings, road dividers,
traffic cones, lighted bollards, information road signs, etc. They can also
be involved
in beautifying
various
traffic
islands,
central
verges and
roundabouts by turning them into beautiful gardens and green areas.
11.
INSTITUTIONAL COORDINATION AND CITIZENS'
COOPERATION
The
traffic
control
and
management
basically
involve
three
components
viz. road, vehicle and road user.
It
is, therefore, the joint
responsibility
of
all
the
organisations
responsible
for
its
operating
environment. Unless
all the concerned organisations interact with each
otlier and coordinate their efforts, the traffic police and traffic engineers
alone can not successfully meet the ever growing challenges thrown by
the urban traffic and transportation problems.



======================================================================
PAGE 77 of 84
======================================================================
65
11.1.
Institutional Coordination
The
following
three
major
areas,
in
particular,
require
good
coordination between various
utilities.
11.1.1. Roads: The local Municipal Corporation/PWD must ensure
good maintenance of all roads and footpaths including channelisers. All
safety measures should conform
to the
I.R.C.
standards and must be
maintained well. Good street lighting system in urban areas can be very
effective
in reducing
accidents. Concrete and mastic
surface provide
better riding quality and have longer
life.
11.1.2.
Road-side
frictions: The
road-side
frictions
specially
activities on
road
side
reduce
the
road
capacity,
for example
the
enc*- achment of footpaths forcing pedestrians to use main carriageways.
The other examples are: dumping of construction material and garbage
on roads/footpaths, poor location of manholes, erection of a large number
of
poles,
other
installations
like junction
boxes,
traffic
sign-boards,
manhole chambers etc, huge hoardings and other protruding structures
on road side. There are many other encroachments like su-eet vendors,
pavement dwellers, beggers and squatting of animals, etc. which not only
consU"ict the vehicular movement as a
^sults of inevitable conflicts, but
also impede the smooth and safe flow of pedestrians.
It is, therefore, essential and desirable to formulate certain policies
and
guidelines
for
regulating
the
aforementioned
road-side
frictions.
Joint action by
the
local municipal bodies and police can help bring
about better discipline.
A joint survey can also be arranged by the concerned departments
to see how various poles on roads and footpaths can be put to multipurpose
usage. For instance, no parking sign-boards can be fixed on
elecU"ic/
telephone poles along footpath wherever possible. Such surveys can help
reduce the street furniture and thus improve the movement on roads and
footpaths.
11.1.3.
Excavations: A large number of excavations are regularly
undertaken by various utilities like the water, sewerage, road maintenance



======================================================================
PAGE 78 of 84
======================================================================
66
department,
telecommunication and
electric
supply
departments,
gas
authority,
etc. Unless these excavations are properly coordinated with
respect
to space and time, they can cause
serious
traffic
disruptions.
As such excavations
are not normally taken during
the monsoon,
it
would be
desirable
to plan any such excavations which have
to be
inevitably carried out during the monsoon time. The
traffic police can
coordinate and monitor so that minimum inconvenience is caused to the
road users.
1 1 .2.
Enforcement
Beside the aforementioned three areas, good enforcement of rules
and effective checking of violations by the
traffic police can play an
important role in improving the carrying capacity of the carriageway.
However, a very vital aspect of the enforcement is the manner in
which individual officers and constables behave while enforcing traffic
laws in general, and new U-affic schemes in particular. The experience
usually makes a long-lasting impression on the person concerned, and he
describes
it to his family, to his friends and business acquaintances. It is
the aggregate of such impressions which largely makes public opinion.
It
is, therefore, very important to ensure that in enforcing the law,
tlie
goodwill of the public
is not forfeited. Thus,
it is very essential to impart
good education to the officers and men in the field in "Public Relations*'.
While cooperation between the public and the police
is of utmost
value, it can only be based upon mutual respect and understanding as well
as complete recognition and acceptance of both sides. There can be no
proper cooperation on the part of the police.
11.3.
Citizen's Participation
While
effective
resource-utilisation by
judicious
application
of
traffic
management
techniques,
well
researched
low-cost modem
technology to update the existing transportation facilities, and computer
usage to forecast the Uransportation needs to work out various alternatives,
may well be the present day traffic manager's panacea for maximising
the level of service and satisfaction, the one variable that can tlirow even



======================================================================
PAGE 79 of 84
======================================================================
67
the best traffic management plan into disarray is the lack of the citizen's
confidence.
A change unilaterally imposed
is most likely to be opposed.
It
is,
therefore, unwise to initiate any new measures of traffic regulation and
enforcement without adequate preparation
to ensure some measure of
public understanding and some degree of public acceptance.
In reality, public participation in traffic management falls woefully
short. The reasons are not too far to seek. Urban society
is no longer the
homogeneous community as
it was. A vast change in
its basic sUucture
has been brought about due to mass exodus from rural areas. The new
immigrant
is an alien in the urban environment. The pressures of daily
life
in
his changed circumstances keep him
totally involved
witli
his
personal problems. He has
neither
the energy nor any
inclination
to
involve himself in community matters. The local resident, on the other
hand, views every adminisuative change as an inu-usion into his Uaditional
life and is not kindly disposed towards any such changes. The administration
thus
is
often caught between
the unconcern of one
section
and
the
apprehension of the other, making the task of the
traffic manager very
arduous. With
the public responding more
positively, he can produce
solutions from various alternatives
tliat
will generally be acceptable to
both
sections
of
the
society
and
tliat
are
in
consonance
with
the
government policies.
Tlie success of any
traffic management scheme thus
rests on
die
pivots of public participation and institutional coordination. The lowest-
cost Uaffic management techniques, tlierefore aim to win the confidence
of the road user and enhance tlie credibility of tlie administration through
the coordinated efforts of various public agencies involved in the o-affic
and Uansportation management. Even if adequate funds are not available
for the implementation of various schemes, these efforts will generate a
lot of public goodwill and ensure their voluntary cooperation in making
the authorities task easier.
