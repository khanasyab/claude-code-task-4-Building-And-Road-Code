PREFACE
The Paper entitled "Guidelines for the Design of Small Bridges and Culverts" by Shri Goverdhan
Lai who retired as Additional Director General (Roads), Government of India, was published as
Paper No.
1 67 in Volume XVIII-Part 2 of the Journal of the Indian Roads Congress which was
presented and discussed at its Annual Session held at Bhubaneshwar in 1954. One of the main
objectives of the author in preparing this Paper was to help the Highway Engineers in the country to
do the planning and design of small bridges and culverts for road projects correctly and expeditiously.
While the Paper, in its original form, still has great value, IRC during 1970's felt that this
Paper needed revision since its first publication in light of the feedback obtained from members of
the profession and also to reflect the changes in revised IRC Codes of Practice for design of bridges.
Shri Goverdhan Lai, the author ofthe original Paper graciously agreed for its revision and for bringing
it out as a Special Publication ofthe Indian Roads Congress. Accordingly, Special Publication No. 1
3
"Guidelines for the Design of Small Bridges and Culverts" was published in 1973. and this was highly
appreciated by the members of the profession.
Since
1 973, the IRC Codes of Practice for design of bridges have undergone further major
changes. Considering various changes and new codal provisions made since 1973, a Committee (B-
1 1) for revision ofIRC:SP:13-1973 was constituted under the Chairmanship of Shri C.R. Alimchandani
in 1994. The work of the Committee was continued by the reconstituted Committee of General
Design Features Committee (B-2) from Jan., 2000 (Personnel given below)

The revised draft of SP: 1 3 was prepared by Shri C.V. Kand who was ably helped by S/Shri
K.S. Jangde, S.M. Sabnis, A.S. Khaire & S.P. Badhe of the earlier committee.
The revised draft was considered and discussed by the newly constituted General Design
Features (B-2) Committee in its meeting held on the 25
th August, 2000. The draft was given a final
shape by a Sub-Committee comprising of Dr. B.P. Bagish, S/Shri A.D. Narain, G.S. Taunk, Ashok
Basa and S.K. Nirmal.
The
finalised
draft
of the above Sub-Committee was considered by the B-2 Committee
in its meeting held on 23

th March, 2002 and the Committee approved the draft during its
meeting held on 24
th August, 2002. The final draft received from the Convenor, B-2 Committee was
considered and approved by the Bridges Specifications and Standards (BSS) Committee in its meeting
held on the 7
th December, 2002 and by the Executive Committee in its meeting held on 7
th December,
The Council during its meeting held on 3
rd January, 2003 approved the draft subject to
modification as per suggestions given by the members and authorised the Convenor, BSS Committee
to approve the document after getting the same modified by the Convenor of B-2 Committee.
In
April, 2003 the draft modified by the Convenor, B-2 Committee incorporating the comments of the
members of the Council was sent to Convenor, B.S.S. Committee for approval. Since the Convenor,
B.S.S. Committee was not in position, the Council during the Mid-term Council meeting held in
Pondicherry in June, 2003 decided that the document may be got approved by President, IRC
after
incorporating the modifications suggested by the Ministry ofRoad Transport & Highways and agreed
upon by Convenor, B-2 Committee. The draft modified on the above lines was put up to the then
President, IRC, Shri R.R. Sheoran for approval. He suggested certain modifications and also held
discussions with Shri G. Sharan, Convenor, B-2 Committee and Secretary, IRC. He desired that the
document may be further reviewed. Detailed review was carried out by Secretary, IRC with the help
of Shri R.H. Sarma, Technical Consultant, IRC. The modified draft was circulated to Shri Indu
Prakash, Convenor, BSS Committee, Shri V.K. Sinha, Co-Convenor, BSS Committee, Shri G. Sharan,
Convenor, B-2 Committee, Shri R.R. Sheoran, Past President, IRC, Shri S.S. Momin, President, IRC
and Dr. B.P. Bagish. Based on their comments the document was approved by President, IRC and is

INTRODUCTION
A large number of small bridges and culverts form part cfmost ofour highways. With the massive
road development plans which our country has taken up, it is necessary to look for standardization of such
structures so as to reduce the time spent on project preparation. However, there is need to exercise
utmost care in their design to bring about economy in the overall cost ofthe project. With this objective in
view, the revised Special Publication No. 13 "Guidelines for the Design of Small Bridges and Culverts"
taking into account a number ofmajor changes made in the IRC Codes of Practice for design ofbridges
has been brought out.
The following new Articles have been added now:
Article
1 (General Aspects); Article 13 (Geometric Standards, Specifications and Quality Control);
Article 20 (Protection Work and Maintenance); Article 21 (Raft Foundations), Article 22 (CD. Works in
Black Cotton Soils) and Article 23 (Box Cell Structures). Other Articles have been regrouped and
modifications incorporated wherever found necessary.
This revised Publication incorporates latest standard drawings for RCC solid slab superstructure
upto
1 0 m span, both right and skew type, supported with masonry/RCC substructure upto 4 m height, pipe
culverts and RCC box culverts. This Publication does not cover RCC substructure and superstructure
with bearings and also large span structures, which would need specific detailed designs. This document
is also not directly applicable for higher category roads like expressways and bridges/culverts with more
than two lanes which would need specific detailed designs. For rural roads, reference may be made to
IRC :SP:20 "Rural Roads Manual".
It is hoped that this Publication would go a long way in expediting the
work of project preparation ofhighway projects which invariably include a number of small bridges and
culverts.

GENERAL ASPECTS
1.1.
General
: Frequency of culverts and small bridges varies depending upon the region
and terrain. The location, size and other details of such structures should be decided judiciously to
cater for the discharge and balancing requirements. Number of culverts in
1 km length of road in
India varies from one (flat country) to three in undulating regions whereas one small bridge (upto
30 m) is found within
1 to 4 km length of the road. Number of culverts may increase in hilly/
undulating terrain.
1.2.
Definitions
1 .2.
1
.
Bridges
: Bridge is a structure having a total length above 6 m between the inner
faces of the dirt walls for carrying traffic or other moving loads over a depression or obstruction such
as channel, road or railway.
1 .2.2. Minor Bridge
: A minor bridge is a bridge having a total length of upto 60 m.
1 .2.3.
Small Bridge
: A small bridge
is a bridge where the overall length of the bridge
between the inner faces of dirt walls is upto 30 m and where individual span is not more than 10 m.
1 .2.4. Culvert
: Culvert is a cross-drainage structure having a total length of 6 m or less
between the inner faces of the dirt walls or extreme ventway boundaries measured at right angles
thereto.
1 .2.5.
The Small Bridges and Culverts can be of following types:
a)
RCC Hume Pipes
b)
RCC slab on masonry/concrete abutment and piers
c)
Stone slab on masonry/concrete abutment and piers
d)
RCC box cell structure

Standard Designs
1.3.1. MORT&H standard design for slab bridges
: Ministry of Road Transport &
Highways (MORT&H) in standard design of slab bridges have proposed round figures for design
span (c/c of supports). With a view to avoid confusion, same nomenclature of span is considered for
culverts and small bridges. The
design span of 6 m will have clear span of 5.60 m. The values of
clear span, effective span and end to end of deck for which standard designs of slab bridges are
available in Table 1.1.
Similarly type plans of MORT&H are available for skew slab bridges for right effective
spans of 4 m, 6 m, 8 m and 10 m for ske^w angles of 15°, 22.5°, 30° and 35°.

SITE
INSPECTION
2.1.
Selection of Site
:
Normally selection of site for culverts and small bridges is
guided by road alignment. However where there is choice, select a site:
(i)
which is situated on a straight reach of stream, sufficiently down stream of bends;
(ii)
which is sufficiently away from the confluence of large tributaries as to be beyond
their disturbing influence;
(iii)
which has well defined banks;
(iv)
which make approach roads feasible on the straight; and
(v)
which offers a square crossing.
2.2.
Existing Drainage Structures
:
If, there is an existing road or railway bridge or
culvert over the same stream and not very far away from the selected site, the best means of
ascertaining the maximum discharge is to calculate it from data collected by personal inspection of
the existing structure. Intelligent inspection and local inquiry will provide very useful information,
namely, marks indicating the maximum flood level, the afflux, the tendency to scour, the probable
maximum discharge, the likelihood ofcollection ofbrushwood during floods, and many other particulars.
It should be seen whether the existing structure is too large or too small or whether it has other
defects. All these should be carefully recorded.
2.3. Inspection should also include taking notes on channel conditions from which the silt
factor and the co-efficient of rugosity can be estimated.

ESSENTIAL DESIGN DATA
3.1.
In addition to the information obtained by personal inspection of an existing structure,
the design data described in the following paragraphs have to be collected. What is specified here is
sufficient only for small bridges and culverts. For larger structures, detailed instructions contained in
the Standard Specifications & Code of Practice for Bridges - Section I, of IRC:5 Clauses 100-102,
should be followed.
3.2.
Catchment Area
: When the catchment, as seen from the "topo" (G.T.) sheet, is
less than
1 .25 sq. km in area, a traverse should be made along the watershed. Larger catchments
can be read from the
1 cm = 500 m topo maps of the Survey of India by marking the watershed in
pencil and reading the included area by placing a piece of transparent square paper over it.
3.3.
Cross-sections
: For a sizable stream, at least three cross-sections should be taken,
namely, one at the selected site, one upstream and another downstream of the site, all to the horizontal
scale of not less than
1 cm to 10 m or 1/1000 and with an exaggerated vertical scale of not less than
1 cm to
1 m or 1/100. Approximate distances, upstream and downstream of the selected
site of
crossing at which cross-sections should be taken are given in Table 3.1.
Table 3.1
Catchment Area
Distance (u/s and d/s of the crossing) at
which cross-sections should
:>e taken

2.
From 3.0 to 15 sq. km
3.
Over 15 sq. km
100 m
300 m
500 m
The cross-section at the proposed site of the crossing should show level at close intervals
and indicate outcrops of rocks, pools, etc. Often an existing road or a cart track crosses the stream
at the site selected for the bridge.
In such a case, the cross-section should not be taken along the
center line of the road or the track as that will not represent the natural shape and size of the channel.
The cross-section should be taken at a short distance on downstream of the selected site.
3.4.
In the case of very small streams (catchments of 40 hectares or less) one cross-
section may do but it should be carefully plotted so as to represent truly the normal size and shape of
the channel on a straight reach.
3.5.
Highest Flood Level
: The highest flood level should be ascertained by intelligent
local observation, supplemented by local enquiry, and marked on the cross-sections.
5



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 154
======================================================================
1RC:SP: 13-2004
3.6.
Longitudinal Section
: The longitudinal section should extend upstream and
downstream of the proposed site for the distances indicated in Table 3.1 and should show levels of
the bed, the low water level and the highest flood level.
3.7.
Velocity Observation
: Attempts should be made to observe the velocity during an
actual flood and, if that flood is smaller than the maximum flood, the observed velocity should be
suitably increased. The velocity thus obtained is a good check on the accuracy of that calculated
theoretically.
3.8.
Trial Pit Sections
: Where the rock or some firm undisturbed soil stratum is not
likely to be far below the alluvial bed of the stream, a trial pit should be dug down to such rock or firm
soil. But if there is no rock or undisturbed firm soil for a great depth below the stream bed level, then
the trial pit may be taken down roughly 2 to 3 meter below the lowest bed level. The location of each
trial pit should be shown in the cross-section of the proposed site. The trial pit section should be
plotted to show the kind of soils passed through. However depth of trial pit in soils shall be minimum
2 m for culverts and 3 m for small bridges.
For more detailed investigation procedure given in CI. 704 of IRC:78-2000 may be referred
to.
3.9. For very small culverts, one trial pit is sufficient. The result should be inserted on the
cross-section.

EMPIRICAL AND RATIONAL FORMULAE FOR PEAK RUN-OFF
FROM CATCHMENT
4. 1
.
Although records of rainfall exist to some extent, actual records of floods are seldom
available in such sufficiency as to enable the engineer accurately to infer the worst flood conditions
for which provision should be made in designing a bridge. Therefore, recourse has to be taken to
theoretical computations. In this Article some of the most popular empirical formulae are mentioned.
4.2.

Where
Q
=
the peak run-off in m 3/s and M is the catchment area in sq. km
C

=
14-19 where the annual rainfall is more than
1 20 cm
=

4.3.
Ryve's Formula

(4.2)
Where
Q
=

C
=
6.8 for areas within 25 km of the coast
=
8.5 for areas between 25 km and 160 km of the coast
=
1 0.0 for limited areas near the hills
4.4.
Ingli's Formula

J M+ 10
v
;
Where
Q
=
maximum flood discharge in m 3 /s
M
=
the area of the catchment in sq. km
4.5.
These empirical formulae involve only one factor viz. the area of the catchment and
all the so many other factors that affect the run-off have to be taken care of in selecting an appropriate
value of the co-efficient. This is extreme simplification of the problem and cannot be expected to
yield accurate results.

A correct value ofC can only be derived for a given region from an extensive analytical
study of the measured flood discharges vis-a-vis catchment areas of streams in the region. Any
value of C will be valid only for the region for which it has been determined in this way. Each basin
has
its own singularities affecting run-off.
Since actual flood records are seldom available, the
formulae leave much to the judgement of the engineer. Many other similar empirical formulae are in
use but none ofihem encompasses ai! possible conditions of terrain and climate.

Rational Formulae for Peak-off from Catchment
4.7.
1
.
In recent years, hydrological studies have been made and theories set forth which
comprehend the effect of the characteristics of the catchment on run-off. Attempts also have been
made to establish relationships between rainfall and run-off under various circumstances. Some
elementary account of the rationale of these theories is given in the following paragraphs.
4.7.2.
Main factors
: The size of the flood depends on the following major factors.
Rainfall
(
1 )
Intensity
(2)
Distribution in time and space
(3)
Duration
Nature of Catchment
(1)
Area
(2)
Shape
(3)
Slope
(4)
Permeability of the soil and vegetable cover
(5)
Initial state of wetness
4.7.3.
Relation between the intensity and duration of a storm
: Suppose in an individual
storm, F cm of rain falls in T hours, then over the whole interval oftime T, the mean intensity 1 will be
F/T cm per hour. Now, within the duration T, imagine a smaller time interval / (Fig. 4.1). Since the
intensity is not uniform through-out, the mean intensity reckoned over the time interval t (placed
suitably within T) will be higher than the mean intensity i.e.
I taken over the whole period.
It is also known that the mean intensity of a storm of shorter duration can be higher than that
of a prolonged one.
I n other words, the intensity of a storm is some inverse function of its duration.
It has been
reasonably well established that

4.7.4.
For an appreciation of the physical significance of this relationship, some typical
cases are considered below.
Take an intense but brief storm which drops (say) 5 cm of rain in 20 minutes. The average
intensity comes to
1 5 cm per hour. For a short interval t of, say 6 minutes, within the duration of the
storm the intensity can be as high as

I
0.33 +

0.33
\
0.7 +
1
1 8.2 cm per hour
(4.6)
Storms of very short duration and 6 minute intensities within them (and, in general, all such
high but momentary intensities of rainfall) have little significance in connection with the design of
culverts except in built-up areas where the concentration time can be very short (see para 4.7.5.1)
due to the rapidity of flow from pavements and roofs.
Next consider a region where storms are of medium size and duration. Suppose 15 cm of
rainfalls in 3 hours. The average intensity works out to 5 cm per hour. But in time interval of one
hour within the storm the intensity can be as much as
15
3
I
3 +
1
\
1 +
1
10 cm per hour
... (4.7)
For the purpose of designing waterway of bridge such a storm is said to be equivalent of a
"one hour rainfall of 10 cm".
Lastly, consider a very wet region of prolonged storms, where a storm drops, say,
1 8 cm of
rain in 6 hours.
In a time interval of one hour within the storm the intensity can be as high as
18
6
6+11
1 +
1
= 10.5 cm per hour
Thus such a storm is equivalent of a "one hour storm of 10.5 cm".
4.7.5.
"One-hour rainfall" for a region for designing waterway of bridges
: Suppose
it is decided that a bridge should be designed for peak run-off resulting from the severest storm (in
the region) that occurs once in 50 years or any other specified period. Let the total precipitation of
that storm be F cm and duration T hours. Consider a time interval of one hour somewhere within the
duration of the storm. The precipitation in that hour could be as high as
F
T

Hence the design of the bridge will be based on a "one-hour rainfall of say 1Q cm", where
F
T
... (4.8)
Suppose Fig. 4.1 represents the severest storm experienced in a region.
If t represents one
hour, then the shaded area ADBC will represent lQ
.
It is convenient and common that the storm potential of a region for a given period of years
should be characterised by specifying the "one-hour rainfall" 1Q of the region for the purpose of
designing the waterways of bridges in that region.
I
has to be determined from F and T of the severest storm. That storm may not necessarily
be the most prolonged storm. The correct procedure for finding IQ is to take a number of really heavy
and prolonged storms and work out / from F and T of each of them. The maximum of the values of
/
thus found should be accepted as "one hour rainfall" of the region for designing bridges.
I of a region does not have to be found for each design problem.
It is a characteristic of the
whole region and applies to a pretty vast area subject to the same weather conditions. I of a region
should be found once for all and should be known to the local engineers.
The Meteorological Department ofthe Government of India, have supplied the heaviest rainfall
in mm/hour experienced by various places in India. This chart is enclosed as Appendix-"A" and
the values indicated therein, may be adopted for I
in absence of other suitable data. However, the
values are upto the year 1966 and efforts are being made to obtain the current updated values.
Start with / and then modify it to suit the concentration time (see next para) ofthe catchment
area in each specific case. This will now be explained.
4. 7. 5.1. Time of concentration (t
c)
: The time taken by the run-off from the farthest point
on the periphery of the catchment (called the critical point) to'' reach the site of the culvert is called
the "concentration time". In considering the intensity of precipitation it was said that the shorter the
duration considered the higher the intensity will be. Thus safety would seem to lie in designing for a
high intensity corresponding to a very small interval of time. But this interval should not be shorter
than the concentration time of the catchment under consideration, as otherwise the flow from distant
parts of the catchment will not be able to reach the bridge in time to make its contribution in raising
the peak discharge. Therefore, when examining a particular catchment, only the intensity corresponding
to the duration equal to the concentration period (t.) of the catchment, needs to be considered.
4.7.5.2. Estimating the concentration time of a catchment (t
c)
: The concentration time
depends on (1) the distance from the critical point to the structure; and (2) the average velocity of
11

======================================================================
IRC:SP: 13-2004
flow. The slope, the roughness of the drainage channel and the depth of flow govern the later.
Complicated formulae exist for deriving the time of concentration from the characteristics of the
L
=
the distance from the critical point to the structure in km.
H
=
the fall in level from the critical point to the structure in m.
L and H can be found from the survey plans of the catchment area and t
calculated from
Equation (4.9).
Plate 1 contains graphs from which tc can be directly read for known values of L and H.
4.7.6.
The critical or design intensity
: The critical intensity for a catchment
is that
maximum intensity which can occur in a time interval equal to the concentration time tc of the
catchment during the severest strom (in the region) of a given frequency I
(

has its own tc
it will have its own

The principal factors governing P are
: (i) porosity of the soil, (ii) area, shape and size of
the catchment, (iii) vegetation cover, (iv) surface storage viz. existence of lakes and marshes, and
(v) initial state of wetness of the soil. Catchments vary so much with regard to these characteristics
that it is evidently impossible to do more than generalize on the values of P. Judgement and experience
must be used in fixing P. Also see Table 4. 1 for guidance.

Relation between intensity and spread of storm
: Rainfall recording stations are
points in the space and therefore the intensities recorded there are point intensities. Imagine an area
round a recording station. The intensity will be highest at the center and will gradually diminish as we
go farther away from the center, till at the fringes of the area covered by the storm
, intensity will be
zero. The larger the area considered the smaller would be the mean intensity.
It is, therefore, logical
to say that the mean intensity is some inverse function of the size of the area.
If 1
is the maximum point intensity at the center of the storm, then the mean intensity reckoned
over an area "<z" is some fraction "/ " of /. The fraction / depends on the area
and the relation
is represented by the curve in Fig. 4.2 which has been constructed from statistical analysis
In hydrological theories it is assumed that the spread of the storm is equal to the area of the
catchment. Therefore in Fig. 4.2 the area
is taken to be the same as the area of the catchment.
The effect of this assumption can lead to errors which, on
analysis
have been found to be limited
to about
1 2 per cent

: The use of empirical formulae should be done with due caution and
only in consultation with expert. The average designer who cannot rely so much on his intuition and
judgement should go by the rational procedure outlined above.
The data required for the rational treatment, viz., A, L and H can be easily read from the
survey plans. As regards
I
() it should be realized that this does not have to be calculated for each
design problem.
This is the storm characteristic of the whole region, with pretty vast area, and
should be known to the local engineers.
Complicated formulae, of which there is abundance, have been purposely avoided in this
Article.
Indeed, for a terse treatment, the factors involved are so many and their interplay so
complicated that recourse need be taken to such treatment only when very important structures are
involved and accurate data can be collected. For small bridges, the simple formulae given here will
give sufficiently accurate results.

ESTIMATING FLOOD DISCHARGE FROM THE CONVEYANCE
FACTOR AND SLOPE OF THE STREAM
5.1.
In a stream with rigid boundaries (bed and banks) the shape and the size of the cross-
section is significantly the same during a flood as after its subsidence.
If the HFL is plotted and the
bed slope is measured, it is simple to calculate the discharge.
5.2.
But a stream flowing in alluvium, will have a larger cross sectional area when in flood
than that which may be surveyed and plotted after the flood has subsided. During the flood the
velocity is high and, therefore, an alluvial stream scours its bed, but when the flood subsides, the
velocity diminishes and the bed progressively silts up again. From this it follows that before we start
estimating the flood conveying capacity of the stream from the plotted cross-section, we should
ascertain the depth of scour and plot on the cross-section the average scoured bed line that is likely
to prevail during the high flood.
5.3.
The best thing to do is to inspect the scour holes in the vicinity of the site, look at the
size and the degree of incoherence of the grains of the bed material, have an idea of the probable
velocity of flow during the flood, study the trial bore section and then judge what should be taken as
the probable average scoured bed line.
5.4.
Calculation of Velocity
:
Plot the probable scoured bed line. Measure the cross-
sectional area A in m
2 and the wetted perimeter P in m. Then calculate the hydraulic mean depth, R
by the formula.
A
R =
—
(inm)
... (5.1)
P
Next, measure the bed slope S from the plotted longitudinal section of the stream. Velocity
can then be easily calculated from one of the many formulae. To mention one, viz., the Manning's
formula:

Judgement and experience are necessary in selecting a
proper value of n for a given stream.

is a function of the size, shape and roughness of the stream and is called its conveyance
factor. Thus, the discharge carrying capacity of a stream depends on its conveyance factor and
slope.
5.6.
When the cross-section is not plotted to the natural scale (the same scale horizontally
and vertically), the wetted perimeter cannot be scaled off directly from the section and has to be
calculated. Divide up the wetted line into a convenient number of parts, AB, BC and CD, etc.
(Fig. 5.1). C onsider one such part, say PQ, let PR and QR be its horizontal and vertical projections.
Then PQ = V (PR
2 + QR
2
). Now, PR can be measured on the horizontal scale of the given cross-
section and QR on the vertical. PQ can then be calculated.
Similarly, the length of each part is
calculated. Their sum gives the wetted perimeter.

5.7.
If the shape of the cross-section is irregular as happens when a stream rises above
its banks and shallow overflows are created (Fig. 5.2) it is necessary to subdivide the channel into
two or three sub-sections. Then R and n are found for each sub-section and their velocities and
discharges computed separately.
Fig.
5.2
Where further elaboration is justified, corrections for velocity distribution, change of slope,
etc. may be applied. Books on Hydraulics give standard methods for this.
5.8.
Velocity Curves
: To save time
in computation, curves have been plotted
in
Plate 3. Given R, S and n, velocity can be read from this plate.
5.9.
Better Measure than Calculate Velocity
: It is preferable to observe the velocity
during a high flood. When it is not possible to wait for the occurrence of high flood, the velocity
may be observed in a moderate flood and used as a check on the theoretical calculations of
velocity. In making velocity observations, the selected reach should be straight, uniform and reasonably
long.
5.10.
The flood discharge should be calculated at each of the three cross-sections, which
as already explained in para 3.3 should be plotted for all except very small structures.
If the
difference in the three discharges, thus, calculated is more than 10 per cent the discrepancy has to be
investigated.

DESIGN DISCHARGE
6.1
.
Estimated Flood Discharge from Flood Marks on an Existing Structure
6.1.1.
Having collected the necessary information from inspection as mentioned in para 2.2,
the discharge passed by an existing structure can be calculated by applying an appropriate formula.
In Article
1 5 some formulae for calculating discharges from flood marks on existing bridges are
discussed. Worked out examples have been included in Article 17.
6.1.2.
Distinct water mark on bridge piers and other structures can be easily found
immediately following the flood. Sometimes these marks can be identified years afterwards but it is
advisable to survey them as soon after the flood is possible. Turbulence, standing wave and slashing
may have caused a spread in the flood marks but the belt of this spread is mostly narrow and a
reasonably correct profile ofthe surface line can be traced on the sides ofpiers and faces of abutments.
This is perhaps the most reliable way ofestimating a flood discharge because in the formulae discussed
in Article- 1 5 the co-efficient involved have been accurately found by experiments.
6.2.
Fixing Design Discharge
6.2.1.
The recommended rule
: Flood discharges can be estimated in three different
ways as explained in Para 4. 1 to 6. 1 .2. The values obtained should be compared. The highest of
these values should be adopted as the design discharge Q, provided
it does not exceed the next
highest discharge by more than 50 per cent.
If it does, restrict it to that limit.
6.2.2.
Sound economy
: The designer is not expected to aim at designing a structure of
such copious dimensions that it should pass a flood of any possible magnitude that can occur during
the lifetime of the structure. Sound economy requires that the structure should be able to pass easily
floods of a specified frequency (once in 50 years) and that extraordinary and rare floods should pass
without causing excessive damage to the structure or the road.
6.2.3.
The necessity for this elaborate procedure for fixing Q arises for sizeable structures.
As regards small culverts, Q may be taken as the discharge determined from the run-off formulae.

ALLUVIAL STREAMS LACEY'S EQUATIONS
7. 1
.
The section of a stream, having rigid boundaries, is the same during the flood and
after its subsidence. But this is not so in the case of streams flowing within, partially or wholly,
erodible boundaries. In the latter case, a probable flood section has to be evolved from the theoretical
premises for the purpose of designing a bridge;
it is seldom possible to measure the cross-section
during the high flood.
7.2.
Wholly Erodible Section. Lacey's Theory
:
Streams flowing in alluvium are
wide and shallow and meander a great deal. The surface width and the normal scoured depth of
such streams have to be calculated theoretically from concepts which are not wholly rational. The
theory that has gained wide popularity in India is "Lacey's Theory of Flow in Incoherent Alluvium".
The salient points of that theory, relevant to the present subject, are outlined here.
7.3.
A stream, whose bed and banks are composed of loose granular material, that has
been deposited by the stream and can be picked-up and transported again by the current during flood,
is said to flow through incoherent alluvium and may be briefly referred to as an alluvial stream. Such
a stream tends to scour or silt up till it has acquired such a cross-section and (more particularly) such
a slope that the resulting velocity is "non-silting and non-scouring". When this happens the stream
becomes stable and tends to maintain the acquired shape and size of its cross-section and the acquired
slope.
It is then said
: "to have come to regime" and can be regarded as stable.
7.4.
Lacey's Equation
: When an alluvial stream carrying known discharge Q has come
to regime, it has a regime wetted perimeter P, a regime slope S, and regime hydraulic mean depth R,
In consequence, it will have a fixed area of cross-section A and a fixed velocity V.
For these regime characteristics of an alluvial channel, Lacey suggests^ 18
! the following
relationships.
It should be noted that the only independent entities involved are Q and K^. The Ksj-
is called silt factor and its value depends on the size and looseness of the grains of the alluvium.
Its
value is given by the formula:
K5/=1.76Vdm
...(7.1a)
where dm is the weighted mean diameter of the particles in mm. Table 7.1 gives values of
K5yTor different bed materials.
(Typical method of determination of weighted mean diameter of particles (dm ) as given in
Appendix-2 of IRC:5 is reproduced in Plate 4).

The Regime Width and Depth
: Provided a stream is truly alluvial, it is destined to
come to regime according to Lacey. It will then be stable and have a section and slope conforming to
his equations. For wide alluvial streams the stable width W can be taken equal to the wetted perimeter
P of Equation (7.1a).
That is
W = P = 4.8 Q
(7.2a)
Also, the normal depth of scour D on a straight and unobstructed part of a wide stream may
be taken as equal to the hydraulic mean radius R in Equation (7. 1 c). Hence,

LINEAR WATERWAY
8. 1
.
The General Rule for Alluvial Streams: The linear waterway of a bridge across
a wholly alluvial stream should normally be kept equal to the width required for stability, viz., that
given by Equation (7.2a).
8.2.
Unstable Meandering Streams
: A large alluvial stream, meandering over a wide
belt, may have several active channels separated by land or shallow sections of nearly stagnant
water. The actual (aggregate) width of such streams may be much in excess of the regime width
required for stability. In bridging such a stream it is necessary to provide training works that will
contract the stream. The cost of the latter, both initial and recurring, has to be taken into account in
fixing the linear waterway.
8.3.
In the ultimate analysis it may be found in some such cases, that it is cheaper to adopt
a linear waterway for the bridge somewhat in excess of the regime width given by Equation (7.2a).
But as far as possible, this should be avoided. When the adopted linear waterway exceeds the
regime width
it does not follow that the depth will become less than the regime depth D given by
Equation (7.2b). Hence, such an increase in the length ofthe bridge does not lead to any countervailing
saving in the depth of foundations. On the contrary, an excessive linear waterway can be detrimental
in so far as it increases the action against the training works.
8.4.
Contraction to be Avoided
: The linear waterway of the bridge across an alluvial
stream should not be less than the regime width of the stream. Any design that envisages contraction
of the stream beyond the regime width, necessarily has to provide for much deeper foundation.
Much of the saving in cost expected from decreasing the length oi'the bridge may be eaten up by the
concomitant increase in the depth of the substructure and the size of training works. Hence, except
where the section of the stream is rigid,
it is generally troublesc me and also futile from economy
consideration to attempt contracting the waterway.
8.5.
Streams not Wholly Alluvial
: When the banks of a stream are high, well defined,
and rigid (rocky or some other natural hard soil that cannot be affected by the prevailing current) but
the bed is alluvial, the linear waterway of the bridge should be made equal to the actual surface width
of the stream, measured from edge to edge of water along the HFL on the plotted cross-section.
Such streams are later referred to as quasi-alluvial.
8.6.
Streams with Rigid Boundaries
: In wholly rigid streams the rule of para 8.5
applies, but some reduction in the linear waterway may, across some streams with moderate velocities,
be possible and may be resorted to, if in the final analysis it leads to tangible savings in the cost ofthe
bridge.
25

8.7.
As regards streams that overflow their banks and create very wide surface widths
with shallow side sections, judgement has to be used in fixing the linear waterway of the bridge. The
bridge should span the active channel and detrimental afflux avoided. See also Article
1 8.

NORMAL SCOUR DEPTH OF STREAMS
9. 1
.
Alluvial Streams
9.1.1.
What is the significance of the Normal Scour Depth? If a constant discharge were
passed through a straight stable reach of an alluvial stream for an indefinite time, the boundary of its
cross-section should ultimately become elliptical.
This will happen when regime conditions come to exist. The depth in the middle of the
stream would then be the normal scour depth.
In nature, however, the flood discharge in a stream does not have indefinite duration. For this
reason the magnitude and duration ofthe flood discharge carried by it would govern the shape ofthe
flood section of any natural stream. Some observers have found that curves representing the natural
stream sections during sustained floods have sharper curvature in the middle than that of an ellipse.
In consequence, it is believed that Lacey's normal depth is an under estimate when applied to natural
streams subject to sustained floods. However, pending further research, Lacey's equations may be
applied.
9. 1 .2.
As discussed later in Article
1 1
, the depth of foundations is fixed in relation to the
maximum depth of scour, which in turn is inferred from the normal depth of scour. The normal depth
of scour for alluvial streams is given by Equation (7.2b), so long as the bridge does not contract the
stream beyond the regime width W given by Equation (7.2a).
9.1.3.
If the linear waterway of the bridge
for some special reason, is kept less than the
regime width of the stream, then the normal scour depth under the bridge will be greater than the
regime depth of the stream (Fig. 9.1).

different as discussed in Article-20.
9.2.
Quasi-Alluvial Streams
9.2.
1
.
Some streams are not wholly alluvial
: A stream may flow between banks which
are rigid in so far as they successfully resist erosion, but its bed may be composed of loose granular
material which the current can pick-up and transport. Such a stream may be called quasi-alluvial to
distinguish
it, on the one hand, from a stream with wholly rigid boundaries and, on the other, from a
wholly alluvial stream. Since such a stream is not free to erode its banks and flatten out the boundaries
of its cross-section as a wholly alluvial stream does,
it does not acquire the regime cross-section
which Lacey's equations prescribe.
9.2.2.
It is not essential that the banks should be of rock to be inerodible. Natural mixtures
of sand and clay may, under the influence of elements, produce material hard enough to defy erosion
by the prevailing velocity in the stream.
Across a stream section, the natural width of which is nowhere near that prescribed by
Lacey's theory, it is expected to find that the banks, even though not rocky are not friable enough to
be treated as incoherent alluvium for the application of Lacey's Theory. Such cases have, therefore,
got to be discriminated from the wholly alluvial streams and treated on a different footing.
9.2.3.
In any such case the width Wof the section, being fixed between the rigid banks, can
be measured. But the normal scour depth D corresponding to the design discharge Q has to be
estimated theoretically as it cannot be measured during the occurrence of high flood.

9.2.4.
When the stream width is large compared to depth
: In Article-5, for calculating
the discharge of the stream from its plotted cross-section, the probable scoured bed line (para 5.3)
was drawn.
When the stream scours down to that line
it should be capable of passing the discharge
calculated there, say q m
3/s. But the discharge adopted for design, Q, may be anything upto 50 per
cent more than q (see para 6.2.1). Therefore, the scour bed line will have to be lowered further.
Suppose the normal scour depth for Q is D and that for q is d, then,
...(9.2)
D = d
Q
q
Since d is known, D can be calculated. This relationship depends on the assumption that the
width of the stream
is large as compared, with
its depth, and therefore, the wetted perimeter is
approximately equal to the width and is not materially affected by variations in depth.
It also assumes
that the slope remains unaltered.
Q

where K is a constant.
3/
Hence, R varies as Q
5
. Since in such streams R is very nearly equal to the depth, therefore,
D varies as Q
5.
Hence, the equation (9.2).
From the above relationship it follows that ifQ is
1 50 per cent of q, D will be equal to
1 27 per
cent of d.
9.2.5.
Alternatively, the normal depth of scour ofwide streams may be calculated as under.
If the width of the stream is large as compared with its depth, then W may be taken as P and D as R.

If this equals the design discharge Q, then the assumed value of R is
correct. Otherwise, assume another value of R and repeat. When the correct value of R has been
found, take D equal to R. (See the worked out Example in Article-1 6).
9.2.7.
The procedure described above can be applied if either the slope of the stream or the
actual observed velocity is known.
If either of these are not known, the following procedure for
approximate calculation of the normal scour depth can be applied.
Suppose the wetted perimeter of the stream is P and its hydraulic mean depth R.
If Q is its
discharge, then,
Q

Thus, if the design discharge Q, the natural width W, and the silt factor

The above reasoning assumes that the slope
at the section
in the actual case under
consideration is the same as the slope of the hypothetical (Lacey's) regime section, carrying the
same discharge. This is not improbable where the stream is old and its bed material is really incoherent
alluvium. But if there is any doubt about this, the actual slope must be measured and the procedure
given in para 9.2.6 applied.
9.2.8.
When the stream is not very wide
: If the width of the stream is not very large as
compared with its depth, then the methods given above will not give accurate enough results.
In such
a case draw the probable scoured bed line on the plotted cross-section, measure the area and the
wetted perimeter and calculate R.
Corresponding to this value of R and the known values of S and n, read velocity from
Plate 3.
If the product of this velocity and the area equals the design discharge, the assumed
scoured bed
line
is correct.
Otherwise, assume another
line and repeat the process.
Then
measure D.
9.2.9.
Effect of contraction on normal scour depth
:
If, for some special reason, the
linear waterway L of a bridge across a quasi-alluvial stream is kept less than the natural unobstructed
width W of the stream (Fig. 9.1), then the normal scour depth under the bridge D
1 will be greater
than the depth D ascertained above for the unobstructed stream. Covered by the relationship:

MAXIMUM SCOUR DEPTH
1 0. 1
.
In considering bed scour, we are concerned with alluvial and quasi-alluvial streams
only and not with streams which have rigid beds.
1 0.2.
In natural streams, the scouring action of the current is not uniform all along the bed
width.
It is not so even in straight reaches. Particularly at the bends as also round obstructions to the
flow, e.g., the piers of the bridge, there is deeper scour than normal.
In the following paragraphs,
rules for calculating the maximum scour depth are given.
It will be seen that the maximum scour
depth is taken as a multiple of the normal scour depth according to the circumstances of the case.
1 0.3.
In order to estimate the maximum scour depth, it is necessary first to calculate the
normal scour depth. The latter has already been discussed in detail. To summarise what has been
said earlier, the normal scour depth will be calculated as under
:
(i)
Alluvial Streams. Provided the linear waterway of the bridge is not less than the
regime width of the stream, the normal scour depth D is the regime depth as calculated
from Equation (7.2b).
(ii)
Streams with Rigid Banks but Erodible Bed. Provided the linear waterway of
the bridge is not less than the natural unobstructed surface width of the stream, the
normal scour depth d is calculated as explained in Article 9.
1 0.4.
Rules for finding Maximum Scour Depth. The rules for calculating the maximum
scour depth from the normal scour depth are:
Rule (1)
:
For average conditions on a straight reach of the stream and when the bridge is
a single span structure, i.e.
it has no piers obstructing the flow, the maximum
scour depth should be taken as
1 .27 times the normal scour depth, modified for
the effect of contraction where necessary.
Rule (2)
:
For bad sites on curves or where diagonal current exist or the bridge is multi-
span structure, the maximum scour depth should be taken as 2 times the normal
scour depth, modified for the effect of contraction when necessary.
1 0.5.
The finally adopted value of maximum scour depth must not be less than the depth
(below HFL) of the deepest scour hole that may be found by inspection to exist at or near the site of
the bridge.
The following example will illustrate the application ofthe rules in para
1 0.4 above.

DEPTH OF FOUNDATIONS
11.1.
The following rules should be kept in view while fixing the depth of bridge foundations:
Rule (1)
In Soil. The embedment of foundations in soil shall be based on assessment of
anticipated scour. Foundations may be taken down to a comparatively shallow
depth below the bed surface provided good bearing stratum is available and
foundation is protected against scour. The minimum depth of open foundations
shall be upto stratum having adequate bearing capacity but not less than 2.0m
below the scour level or protected scour level.
Rule (2)
In Rocks. When a substantial stratum of solid rock or other material not erodible
at the calculated maximum velocity is encountered at a level higher than or a
little below that given by Rule (1) above, the foundations shall be securely
anchored into that material. This means about 0.6 m into hard rocks with an
ultimate crushing strength of 1 0 MPa or above and
1 .5 m in all other cases.
Rule (3)
All Beds. The pressure on the foundation material must be well within the
safe bearing capacity of the material.
These rules enable one to fix the level of the foundations of abutments and
piers.
1
1 .2.
The above rules are applicable for open foundations only. For deep foundations like
well, and pile foundations, wherever adopted depending upon site requirements depth of foundations
shall be worked out as per IRC: 78.

SPAN AND VERTICAL CLEARANCE
12.1.
As a rule, the number of spans should be as small as possible, since piers obstruct
flow. Particularly, in mountainous regions, where torrential velocities prevail, it is better to span from
bank to bank using no piers if possible.
12.2.
Length of Span
: In small structures, where open foundations can be laid and solid
abutments and piers raised on them, it has been analysed that the following approximate relationships
give economical designs.
For Masonry arch bridges
S =
2 H
For RCC Slab Bridges
S =
1 .5 H
Where
S
= Clear span length in metres
H
= Total height ofabutment or pier from the bottom of its foundation to its top in metres. For
arched bridges it is measured from foundation to the intrados of the key stone.
12.3. Vertical Clearance
: After fixing the depth of foundations Df, the vertical clearance
is added to it to get H. The minimum vertical clearance shall be provided as per Table 12.1.
Table 12.1
Discharge in m 3/s
Minimum vertical clearance in mm
Upto0.30
150
Above 0.3 and upto 3.0

Above 30 and upto 300
900
Above 300 and upto 3000
1200
Above 3000
1500
For openings ofculverts having arched decking, the clearance below the crown ofthe intrados
of arch shall not be less than 1/10 ofthe maximum depth of water plus 1/3 ofthe rise of arch intrados.
Further to keep the free board of approaches not less than 1750 mm (Clause 107.1 of IRC:5)
the vertical clearance in slab/box cell bridges may be increased suitably.
In designing culverts for roads across flat regions where streams are wide and shallow
(mostly undefined dips in the ground surface), and in consequence the natural velocities of flow are
very low, the provision of clearance serves no purpose. Indeed it is proper to design such culverts on
the assumption that the water at the inlet end will pond up and submerge the inlet to a predetermined
extent. This will be discussed in Article 19.
37



======================================================================
PAGE 56 of 154
======================================================================
IRC:SP: 13-2004
In case of structure over artificial channels or canals, etc. the minimum vertical clearance
should be taken 600 mm above the Full Supply Level.
12.4.
The Number of Spans:
1 2.4. 1
.
If the required linear waterway L is less than the economical span length it has to be
provided in one single span.
1 2.4.2. When L is more than the economical span length (S) the number of spans (N) required
is tentatively found from the following relation:
L
=
NS
1 2.4.3. Since N must be a whole number (preferably odd) S has to be modified suitably. In
doing so it is permissible to adopt varying span lengths in one structure to keep as close as possible to
the requirements of economy and to cause the least obstructions to the flow.
1 2.5.
To facilitate inspection and carrying out repairs, the minimum vent height of culverts
should normally be
1 500 mm. The vent size of irrigation culverts may be decided considering the
actual requirements and site condition. For pipe culverts minimum diameter should be
1 000 mm.

STANDARDS,
SPECIFICATIONS
AND QUALITY CONTROL
13.1.
Details of small bridges and culverts of probable spans and heights conforming to
latest IRC codes and guidelines are incorporated with a view to cut short the time in preparation of
estimates and design of culverts and attain uniform standards and quality control in the work.
13.2.
Geometric Standards
13.2.1. IRC standards
: Standards contained in IRC:73
and IRC: 86 are adopted for
Geometric Standards. The overall widths adopted for culverts and small bridges for 2-lane carriageway
are as follows.
NHandSH
-
12 m
MDR
-
8.4 m
Fig. 13.1 gives width for 4-lane roads.
1 3.2.2. Design loads for 2-Iane roadway
: Design loading for culverts and small bridges
should be as below:
Village Road and ODR (Rural Roads)
-
2-lanes IRC Class A
NH, SH and MDR
-
70 R or 2-lanes of Class A whichever
gives worst effect
1 3.2.3. Width of roadway
: The width of a culvert and small bridge (along the direction of
flow) should be such that the distance between the outer faces of the parapets will equal the full
designed width of the formation of the road. Any proposed widening of the road formation in the
near future should also be taken into account in fixing the width of the structure.
In case of high
banks, the length of culvert should be judiciously decided to avoid high face walls.
1 3.2.4. In small bridges, the width (parallel to the flow of the stream) should be sufficient to
give a minimum clear carriageway of 4.25 m for a single-lane bridge and 7.5 m for a two-lane bridge
between the inner faces of the kerbs or wheel guards. Extra provision should be made for footpaths,
etc., if any are required.
1 3.2.5. Siting of structures and gradients
: Culverts and small bridges must be sited on
the straight alignment of roads.
If the Nalla is crossing the road at angles other than right angle,
either skew culverts and small bridges should be provided or, if economical, the Nalla should be
suitably trained. The same gradient of road may be provided for these.
If these are situated at
change of gradient (hump), the profile ofvertical curve should be given in wearing coat. Alternatively,
the profile could be given in the deck itself. The bearing surface of deck slab on the abutmen/pier
cap should be horizontal.

13.3.
Design
:
13.3.1. Road top level
: For maintaining the geometric standards of the road, culverts and
small bridges should be constructed simultaneously with the earthwork as otherwise there would
be the following two disadvantages.
( 1 )
Practically, every culvert and small bridge becomes a hump on the road and geometric
of the road
is affected.
(2)
Duplicate work of consolidation of approaches giving rise to extra cost.
1 3.3.2. Minimum span and clearance
: From the consideration of maintenance of culverts,
it is desirable that the span of slab culvert is kept minimum 2 m and height
1 .5 m and diameter
of pipes 1.0 m. Culverts of small span or diameter are found to get choked due to silting and also
cause difficulty in cleaning.
1 3.3.3. Pipe culverts
: Pipe culverts shall conform to IS category NP3/NP4. The cushion
between the top of the pipe and the road level shall not be less than 600 mm. First class bedding
consisting of compacted granular material can be used for height of fill upto 4 m and concrete cradle
bedding upto a maximum height of fill upto 8 m.
For small size structures, RCC pipe culverts with single row or upto six rows of R.C.C.
pipes, depending upon the discharge may be used as far as possible, as they are likely to prove
comparatively cheaper than slab culverts.
13.3.4. RCC slab
: RCC slab culverts and small bridges should be adopted where the
founding strata is rocky or of better bearing capacity. In case where adequate cushion is not available
for locating pipe culvert RCC slab culvert should be adopted. RCC slab culverts/bridges are also
useful for cattle crossing during dry weather.
13.3.5. RCC box cell structures
: In a situation where bearing capacity of soil
is low,
RCC Box type culvert should be preferred.
13.3.6. Balancing culverts
: Balancing culvert are to be located at points on L section
of the road where down gradients meet. These balancing culverts balance the discharge from either
side of the road. Observation of the road alignment during rains also gives a good idea about location
of balancing culverts.
13.4
Numbering of Culverts and Small Bridges
:
13.4.1. The number of culvert/small bridge is indicated in each km. For instance number
21/8 represents the 8th CD structure in kilometer 21
.
The information regarding (1), the number of spans (2), clear span length in m and (3) the
type of decking or culverts is indicated below:
Number of spans,

13.4.2. The number of the structure
shall be inscribed near the top of he
left hand side
parapet wall as seen by traffic in the end elevation when approaching the structure from each direction.
In situtations where instead ofparapet walls, the structure is provided with railings, but having
no end supporting pillars on which the number could be inscribed, the number ofthe structure shall
be indicated by means of a numbering plate of the size 300 x 300 mm. There shall be two such
numbering plates, one for each direction of travel. The plates shall be welded or fixed securely to the
railing on the left hand side facing the carriageway as close to the entrance to the structure as
possible.
In the case of buried culverts, such as pipe culverts, where there is usually no parapet walls
or railings at the roadway level, two stone or RCC posts, having a cross-section of 1 50x1 50 mm and
exposed height 300 mm shall be set up, one on each side to mark the position of the culvert. Care
shall be taken to locate the marker posts fully outside the prescribed roadway width. The culvert
number shall not be engraved on the marker posts but be either engraved or painted at their base.
1 3.4.3. For details reference may be made to "Recommended Practice for Numbering Bridges
and Culverts", IRC:7-1971.
13.5. General Design Aspects and Specifications
: The type design of pipe culverts and
RCC slab culverts and slab bridges given here are based on following general aspects. Coursed
rubble stone masonry for substructure and parapet walls is generally found to be economical in
comparison to mass concrete substructure. The masonry below or above the ground level should be
as per IRC:40.
If bricks having minimum crushing strength of 7 Mpa are available, these can also be
used for culverts.
13.5.1
. Parapet wall and railing
: For culverts, where parapet walls are provided they shall
be of plain concrete Ml 5 grade or brick or store masonry with 450 mm top width. In case of pipe
culverts no parapet walls are needed and guard stones would be adequate except for culverts on hill
roads. Guard stones provided shall be of size 200x200x600 mm. Railings as given in Standard Drawings
ofMORT&H may also be provided for culverts and small bridges. Railings or parapets shall have
a minimum height above the adjacent roadway or footway safety kerb surface of 1 .1 m less one half
the horizontal width of the top rail or top of the parapet. Crash barriers may be provided when they
are found functionally required. Crash barriers when provided shall conform to provisions in IRC:5
and while adopting MORT&H standard drawings, the design of deck slab shall be checked for
provision of crash barriers.
1 3.5.2. Wearing coat
: Normally, the wearing surfaces of the road shall be carried over the
42

culverts/small bridges. However for low category road which do not have bituminous surfaces, concrete
wearing coat of average 75 mm need be adopted and approach profile may be suitably graded.
1 3.5.3. Approach slab
: Approach slab can be dispensed with in case of culverts.
1 3.5.4. Deck slab
: M 20 concrete for moderate and M 25 concrete for severe conditions of
exposure and high strength deformed bars conforming to IS: 1786 are specified for the deck slabs.
1 3.5.5. Expansion joint
: For spans upto
1 0 m premoulded bituminous sheet (like, shalitex
board) of 20 mm thickness are required to be provided.
RCC slab shall rest on tar paper over abutment/pier cap.
13.5.6. Pier/abutment cap/coping
: The minimum thickness of reinforced cap over solid
PCC/RCC substructure shall be 200 mm and that in case of masonry substructure shall not be less
than 500 mm. The minimum grade of concrete shall be M 20 and M 25 for moderate and severe
conditions of exposure respectively. However, the coping over the returns may be ofM 15 grade and
thickness not less than 100 mm.
1 3.5.7. Section of pier abutment and returns
: The abutment and pier sections should be
so designed as to withstand safely the worst combination of loads and forces as specified in the
IRC:6-2000.
1 3.5.8. Top width of pier/abutment
: In respect of masonry and concrete piers/abutments
minimum width at top of pier and abutments for slab bridges just below the caps shall be as per
Table 13.1. Tar paper bearings shall be provided between abutment/peir cap and RCC slab for spans
upto 10 m.

In the case of arch bridges, the top width of abutments and piers should be adequate to
accommodate skew decks and to resist the stresses imposed under the most unfavourable conditions
of loading.
1 3.5.9. Return walls or wing walls
: Wing walls are generally at 45° angle to the abutment
and are also called as splayed wing walls. Walls parallel to road are called as return walls.
Where embankment height exceeds 2 m, splayed return walls may be preferred. The length
of straight return should normally be
1 .5 times the height of the embankment. Where the foundations
of the wing walls can be stepped up, having regard to the soil profile, this should be done for the sake
of economy. Quite often short return walls meet the requirements of the site and should be adopted.
The top width of wing walls and returns shall not be less than 450 mm.
1 3.5.10. Weepholes and water spouts
: Adequate number of weepholes at spacing not
exceeding
1 m in horizontal and vertical direction should be provided to prevent any accumulation of
water and building up of the hydrostatic pressure behind the abutment and wing walls. The weep
holes should be provided at about
1 50 mm above low water level or ground level whichever is higher.
Weepholes shall be provided with
1 00 mm dia AC pipes for structures in plain/reinforced concrete,
brick masonry and stone inasnory. For brick and stone masonry structures, rectangular weepholes of
80 mm wide and 150 mm height may also be provided. Weepholes shall extend through the full width
of the concrete/masonry with slope of about
1 vertical to 20 horizontal towards the drainage face.
In case of stone masonry, the spacing of weep holes shall be adjusted to suit the height of the
course in which they are formed. The sides and bottom of the weep holes in the interior shall be
made up with stones having fairly plain surface.
For spans more than 5 m one water spout of 1 00 mm dia. in the center of the slab located on
either side of the deck shall be provided. The spacings of drainage spouts shall not exceed
1 0 m.
In case of one side camber the number shall be doubled and location suitably adjusted.
1 3.5.1 1. Foundation concrete
: Foundation concrete shall not be less than M 15 grade.
If
the foundation level is below water table,
1 0 per cent extra cement is to be added in concrete. The
minimum depth of footing shall be 300 mm. For foundation resting on rock a levelling course of at
least
1 50 mm in M 15 grade of concrete shall be used.
13.5.12. Arches
: The type of superstructure depends on the availability of the construction
materials and its cost. An evaluation of the relative economics ofRCC slabs and masonry arches
should be made and the latter adopted where found more economical.
The masonry arches may be either of cement concrete blocks ofM
1 5 or dressed stones or
bricks in
1 :3 cement mortar. The crushing strength of concrete, stone or brick units shall not be less
than
1 05 kg/cm
2
. Where stone masonry is adopted for the arch ring, it shall be either coursed rubble
masonry or ashlar masonry.

13.5.13. Raft foundation
: Raft foundations are found to be quite suitable for small bridges
and culverts where the founding strata is soft and has SBC upto
1 0 t/m
2
. The following aspects are
to be kept in consideration.
(1 )
Raft foundations are suitable for all types of structures other than pipe culverts.
(2)
Protection needs to be provided in the form of apron.
(3)
Cut-off should be done first, i.e., before the raft. Immediately, after the raft is complete,
aprons on U/s and D/s should be completed.
(4)
Details of raft foundation are given in Article 2 1
.
13.6.
Quality Control
1 3.6. 1
. Although, the work of culverts and small bridges is simple it is necessary to have
quality control in the work of stone/brick masonry and concrete in deck slab, bar bending, etc.
Reference may be made to "Guidelines on Quality Systems for Road Bridges", IRC :SP:47- 1998.
1 3.6.2. Specifications should be in accordance with "Specification for Road and Bridge Works"
ofM inistry of Road Transport and Highways published by Indian Roads Congress.
13.7.
Setting out of culverts and small bridges
: Setting out of culverts and small
bridges should be done from 4 masonry pillars, two in the direction of road and two along the stream,
all placed along two center lines. The top of pillars in the direction of road should be at the proposed
top level of deckslab. Two lines, one along the direction of stream and the other along the center line
of road should be inscribed on one ofthe pillars and all distances should be measured with respect to
these lines. The pillars should be placed sufficiently away from the zone of excavation.
13.8.
Masonry Work
13.8.1. All masonry work shall conform to IRC:40. The mortar mix in case of cement sand
shall be 1:3, 1:4 or 1:5, whereas, in case of cement lime sand it shall be 1.0:0.5:4.5.
1 3.8.2. Brick proposed to be used shall be of minimum compressive strength of 7 MPa.
However, for rivers with velocity of 4.5 m/s and carrying highly abrasive particles, this shall be
increased to
1 0 MPa.
1 3.8.3. Brick and stone masonry shall conform to IRC:40.
13.9.
Concrete
13.9.1. According to IRC :21, the minimum grade of plain concrete is M 15 of concrete and
that ofRCC is M 20. The size of metal to be used for RCC slabs and the grading of aggregates are
specified in relevant codes.
It is advisable to use power driven concrete mixer. Similarly, vibrators
should also be made available. Furthermore, precast concrete cover blocks must be provided to
ensure bottom cover to reinforcement. Water cement ratio must be limited to 0.45 maximum.
In
case of use of Plasticiser w/c ratio can be restricted to 0.4. Size of coarse aggregate will be 20 mm
for RCC and upto 40 mm for plain concrete.

Bar bending
: Lengths of bars
and numbers are given in standard drawings.
Cutting of bars from available stock must be done carefully. Generally, tendency of cutting bars of
required lengths and discarding pieces of shorter lengths give rise to greater wastages. Normally
staggered overlaps to the extent of 25 per cent may be provided. Calculated quantities of steel are
increased suitably to account for overlaps, its length conforming to IRC:21
. Steel chairs should be
provided for maintaining correct position oftop bars.

STRUCTURAL DETAILS OF SMALL BRIDGES AND
CULVERTS
14.1.
Abutment and Wing Wall Sections
: For RCC slab culverts designed for IRC
single lane of class 70 R loading or 2-lanes of IRC class A loading, the abutment and wing wall
sections upto 4 m height for a minimum bearing capacity of the soil of 1 6.5 t/m
2 are given in Plate 5.
These sections are not applicable for seismic zones IV and V.
The base widths ofthe abutment and the pier depend on the bearing capacity of the soil. The
pressure at the toe of the abutment should be worked out to ensure that the soil is not overstressed.
The pier sections should be made preferably circular in the case of skew crossings.
1 4.2.
Filling behind the abutments, wing walls and return walls shall confirm to IRC:78 as
reproduced in Appendix "B".
14.3.
Unreinforced Masonry Arches
: Plate 6 shows the details of arch ring of segmental
masonry arch bridges without footpaths for spans 6 m and 9 m.
The section of abutment and pier for masonry arch bridges will have to be designed taking
into account the vertical reaction, horizontal reaction and the moment at springing due to dead load
and live load. Table 14.1 gives the details of horizontal reaction, vertical reaction and moment at
springing for arch bridges of span 6 m and 9 m and Table 14.2 gives the influence line ordinates for
horizontal reaction, vertical reaction and moment at springing for a unit load placed on the arch ring.

ELEMENTS OF THE HYDRAULICS OF FLOW THROUGH BRIDGES
15.1.
The formulae for discharge passing over broad crested weirs and drowned orifices
have been developed ab initio in this section. These formulae are very useful for computing flood
discharges from the flood marks left on the piers and abutments of existing bridges and calculating
afflux in designing new bridges.
It is necessary to be familiar with the rationale of these formulae to
be able to apply them intelligently.
15.2.

Where L is the linear waterway. From Eq. (15.2) Velocity at Section 2

Therefore, the discharge through the bridge
Q = av

Since AB is —

On exit from the bridge, some of the velocity head is reconverted into potential head due to
the expansion of the section and the water surface is raised, so that
is somewhat greater than BC,
i.e. greater than 66.7 per cent of H. In fact, observations have proved that, in the limiting condition,
Dd can be 80 per cent ofDu
. Hence, the following rule
:

"So long as the afflux (Du -Dd) is not less than — Dd
, the weir formula applies,
i.e., Q
depends on Du and
is independent ofDd
".

The fact that the downstream depth Dd has no effect on the discharge Q, nor on the upstream
depth D u when the afflux is not less than V4 Dd is due to the formation of the "Standing Wave"

The Orifice Formulae: When the downstream depth, D d is more than 80 per cent
of the upstream depth D u
, the weir formula does not hold good, i.e. the performance of the bridge
opening is no longer unaffected by D d
.
In Fig. 15.2, X-X

it is easier to work in terms of h = D u - Dd instead of h'. But h is less than n as
on emergence from the bridge the water surface rises, due to recovery of some velocity energy as

In Conclusion
: Let us get clear on some important points
( 1 )
In all these formulae Dd is not affected in any way by the existence of the bridge.
It
depends only on the conveyance factor and slope of tail race. Dd has, therefore, got
to be actually measured or calculated from area - slope data of the channel as
explained already in Article 7.
(2)
The Weir Formula applies only when a standing wave is formed, i.e., when the afflux
(h = D u - D d) is not less than
lA Dd

AFFLUX
16.1.
The afflux at a bridge
is the heading up of the water surface caused by
it.
It is
measured by the difference in levels of the water surfaces upstream and downstream of the bridge
(Fig. 16.1).

1 6.2.
When the waterway area of the openings of a bridge is less than the unobstructed
natural waterway area of the stream,
i.e., when the bridge contracts the stream, afflux occurs.
Contraction of the stream is normally not done, but under some circumstances it is taken recourse to,
57

if it leads to ponderable economy. Also, in the case of some alluvial streams in plains the natural
stream width may be much in excess of that required for regime. When spanning such a stream, it
has to be contracted to, more or less, the width required for stability by providing training works.
16.3. Estimating afflux is necessary to see its effect on the 'clearance' under the bridge, on
the regime of the channel upstream of the bridge; and on the design of training works.
16.4.
For calculating afflux we must know (1), the discharge Q,
(2) The unobstructed
width ofthe stream W, (3) the linear waterway of the bridge L, and (4) the average depth downstream
of the bridge D d
.
16.5.
The downstream depth D d is not affected by the bridge
:
it is controlled by the
conveyance factor and slope of the channel below the bridge. Also, the depth, that prevails at the

of the bridge after its construction. Thus, Dd is the depth that prevails at the bridge site before its
construction. To estimate afflux we must know Dd

calculated from the data supplied.

OVERTOPPING OF THE BANKS
18.1.
In plains where the ground slopes are gentle and the natural velocities of flow in
streams are low, the flood water may spill over one or both the banks of the stream at places.
1 8.2.
Height of Approach Roads
: Consider the case where main channel carries the
bulk of the discharge and a small fraction of it flows over the banks somewhere upstream of the
bridge.
If the overflow strikes high ground at a short distance from the banks, it can be forced back
into the stream and made to pass through the bridge. This can be done by building the approach
roads of the bridge solid and high so that they intercept the overflow. In this arrangement, the linear
waterway of the bridge must be ample to handle the whole discharge without detrimental afflux.
Also, the top level of the approach road must be high enough to prevent overtopping.
If the velocity
of the stream is V(m/s), the water surface level, where
it strikes the road embankment, will be
V2 (m) higher than HFL in the stream at the point, where the overflow starts. This arrangement is,
79.6
therefore, normally feasible where the stream velocity
is not immoderately high.
1 8.3.
Subsidiary or Relief Culverts
: Sometimes, however, the overflow spreads far
and away from the banks. This is often the case in alluvial plains, where the ground level falls
continuously away from the banks of the stream. In sue h cases, it is impossible to force the overflow
back into the main stream. The correct thing to do is to pass the overflow through relief culverts at
suitable points in the road embankment. These culverts have to be carefully designed. They should
not be too small to cause detrimental ponding up ofthe overflow, resulting in damage to the road or
some property, nor, should they be so big as to attract the main current.
18.4.
Dips and Breaching Sections in Approach Roads
:
It is sometimes feasible as
well as economical to provide permanent dips (or alternatively breaching sections) in the bridge
approaches to take excessive overflows in emergencies. The dips or breaching sections have to be
sited and designed so that the velocity of flow through them does not become erosive, cutting deep
channels and ultimately leading to the shifting ofthe main current.
18.5.
Retrogression of Levels
: Suppose water overflows a low bank somewhere
upstream of the bridge and after passing through a relief culvert, rejoins the main stream somewhere
lower down. When the flood in the main channel subsides, the ponded up water at the inlet of the
subsidiary culvert gets a free fall. Under such conditions deep erosion can take place. A deep
channel is formed, beginning at the outfall in the mains stream and retrogressing towards the culvert.
This endangers the culvert. To provide against this, protection has to be designed downstream ofthe
culvert so as to dissipate the energy of the falling water on the same lines as is done on irrigation
falls. That is a suitable cistern and baffle wall should be added for dissipating the energy and the
issuing current should be stilled through a properly designed expanding flume.

PIPES AND BOX CULVERTS
19.1.
Feasibility of Pipe and Box Culverts Flowing Full
19.1.1. Some regions along plain consist of vast flat without any deep and defined drainage
channels in
it. When the rain falls, the surface water moves in some direction in a wide sheet of
nominal depth. So long as this movement of water is unobstructed, no damage may occur to property
or crops. But when a road embankment is thrown across the country intercepting the natural flow,
water ponds up on one side of it. Relief has then to be afforded from possible damage from this
ponding up by taking the water across the road through causeways or culverts.
1 9. 1 .2.
In such flat regions the road runs across wide but shallow dips and, therefore, the
most straightforward way of handling the surface flow is to provide suitable dips (i.e., causeways) in
the longitudinal profile of the road and let water pass over them.
1 9.1 .3. There may, however, be cases where the above solution is not the best. Some of its
limitations may be cited. Too many causeways or dips detract from the usefulness of the road. Also,
the flow of water over numerous sections ofthe road, makes its proper maintenance problematic and
expensive. Again, consider the case of a wet cultivated or waterlogged country (and
flat plains are
quite often swampy and waterlogged) where the embankment has necessarily got to be taken high
above the ground. Frequent dipping down from high road levels to the ground produces a very
undesirable road profile. And, even cement concrete slabs, in dips across a waterlogged country, do
not rest evenly on the mud underneath them. Thus, it will appear that constructing culverts in such
circumstances should be a better arrangement than providing dips or small causeways.
1 9. 1 .4. After we have decided that a culvert has to be constructed on a road lying across
some such country, we proceed to calculate the discharge by using one of the run off formulae,
having due regard to the nature of terrain and the intensity of rainfall as already explained in Article-
4. But the natural velocity of flow cannot be estimated because (i) there is no defined cross-section
of the channel from which we may take the area of cross-section and wetted perimeter and (ii) there
is no measurable slope in the drainage line. Even where we would calculate or directly observe the
velocity,
it may be so small that we could not aim at passing water through the culvert at that velocity,
because the area of waterway required for the culvert
^A = —
-J
is prohibitively large.
In such
cases the design has to be based on an increased velocity of flow through the culvert and to create
the velocity the design must provide for heading up at the inlet end ofthe culvert. Economy, in design
being the primary consideration, the correct practice, indeed is to design a pipe or a box culvert on
the assumption that water at the inlet end may head upto a predetermined safe level above the top of
the inlet opening. This surface level of the headed up water at the upstream end has to be so fixed
that the road bank should not be overtopped, nor any property
in the flood plain damaged.
71



======================================================================
PAGE 90 of 154
======================================================================
IRC:SP: 13-2004
Next, the level of the downstream water surface should be noted down. This will depend on
the size of the slope of the leading out channel and is normally, the surface level of the natural
unobstructed flow at the site, that prevails before the road embankment is constructed.
After this we can calculate the required area of cross-section of the barrel of the culvert by
applying the principles of hydraulics discussed in this Article.
1 9. 1 .5. The procedure set out above is rational and considerable research has been carried
out on the flow of water through pipe and box culverts, flowing full.
1 9.1 .6. In the past, use was extensively made of empirical formulae which gave the ventway
area required for a culvert to drain a given catchment area. Dun's Drainage Table is one of the class
and is purely empirical. This table is still widely used, as it saves the trouble of hydraulic calculations.
But
it is unfortunate that recourse is often taken rather indiscriminately to such short cuts, even
where other more accurate and rational procedure is possible and warranted by the expense involved.
Dun's Table or other in that class, should NOT be used until suitable correction factors have been
carefully evolved from extensive observations (in each particular region with its own singularities of
terrain and climate) of the adequacy or otherwise of the existing culverts vis-a-vis their catchment
area.
1 9.
1 .7. Considerations of economy require that small culverts, in contrast with relatively
larger structures across defined channels, need not be designed normally to function with adequate
clearance for passing floating matter. The depth of a culvert should be small and it does not matter
ifthe opening stops appreciably below the formation level of the road. Indeed, it is correct to leave
it in that position and let it function even with its inlet submerged. This makes it possible to design
low abutments supporting an arch or a slab, or alternatively, to use round pipes or square box barrels.
1 9.
1 .8. High headwall should not be provided for retaining deep over-fills. Instead of this the
length of the culverts should be increased suitably so that the road embankment, with its natural
slopes, is accommodated without high retaining headwalls.
1 9.
1 .9. Where masonry abutments supporting arches or slabs are designed for culverts
functioning under "head", bed pavements must be provided. And, in all cases, including pipe and box
culverts, adequate provision must be made at the exit against erosion by designing curtain walls.
Where the exit is a free fall, a suitable cistern and baffle wall must be added for the dissipation of
energy and stilling of the ensuring current.
1 9.2.
Hydraulics of the Pipe and Box Culverts Flowing Full
19.2.1. The permissible heading up at the inlet
:
It has been explained already that
where a defined channel does not exist and the natural velocity of flow is very low, it is economical
to design a culvert as consisting of a pipe or a number of pipes of circular or rectangular section
functioning with the inlet submerged. As the flood water starts heading up at the inlet, the velocity
through the barrel goes on increasing. This continues till the discharge passing through the culvert
equals the discharge coming towards the culvert. When this state of equilibrium is reached the
upstream water level does not rise any higher.
72



======================================================================
PAGE 91 of 154
======================================================================
IRC:SP: 13-2004
For a given design discharge the extent of upstream heading up depends on the ventway of
the cu 1 vert. The latter has to be so chosen that the heading up should not go higher than a predetermined
safe level. The criterion for safety being that the road embankment should not be overtopped, nor
any property damaged by submergence. The fixing of this level is the first step in the design.
1 9.2.2. Surface level of the tail race
: It is essential that the HFL in the outfall channel
near the
exit of the culvert should be known.
This may be taken as the HFL prevailing at the
proposed site of the culvert before the construction of the road embankment with some allowance
for the concentration of flow caused by the construction of the culvert.
1 9.2.3. The operating head when the culverts flow full
: In this connection the cases
that have to be considered are illustrated in Fig. 19.1. In each case the inlet is submerged and the
culvert flows full.
In case (a) the tail race water surface is below the crown of the exit and in case
(b)
it is above that. The operating head in each case is marked "H". Thus, we see that
: "When the
culvert flows full, the operating head, H, is the height of the upstream water level measured from the
surface level in the tail race or from the crown of the exit of the culvert whichever level is higher".
1 9.2.4. The velocity generated by "H"
: The operating head "H" is utilized in (i) supplying
the energy required to generate the velocity of flow through the culvert
(ii) Forcing water through
the inlet of the culvert, and (iii) overcoming the frictional resistance offered by the inside wetted
surface of the culvert.

From this equation we can calculate the velocity v, which a given head H will generate in a
pipe flowing full, ifwe know Ke and Kf
.

Values of K£ and Kf
: K e principally depends on the shape of the inlet.
The
following values are commonly used:
Ke
=
0.08 for bevelled or
Bell - mouthed entry
=
0.505 for sharp edged
entry
... (19.2)
As regards Kf
it is a function of the Length L of the culvert, its hydraulic mean radius R, and
the co-efficient of rugosity n of its surface.
The following relationship exists between Kf and n:

The graphs in Fig. 19.2 are based on Equation
1 9.4. For a culvert of known sectional area
and length, Ky can be directly read from these graphs.
19.2.6.
Values of K£ and Kf modified through research: Considerable research has
recently been carried out on the head lost in flow through pipes. The results have unmistakably
lemonstrated the following:-
•
The entry loss co-efficient Ke depends not only on the shape ofthe entry but also on the size
"entry and the roughness of its wetted surface. In general, Ke
, increases with an increase in the
e ofthe inlet.

======================================================================
IRC:SP: 13-2004
Also Kf the friction loss co-efficient, is not independent ofKe
. Attempts to make the entry
efficient repercuss adversely on the frictional resistance to flow offered by the wetted surface of the
barrel. In other words, if the entry conditions improve (i.e. ifKe decreases), the friction of the barrel
increases (i.e. Kf increases). This phenomenon can be explained by thinking ofthe velocity distribution
inside the pipe. When the entry is square and sharp edged, high velocity lines are concentrated
nearer the axis ofthe barrel, while the bell-mouthed entry' gives uniform distribution ofvelocity over
the whole section of the barrel. From this it follows that the average velocity being the same in both
cases, the velocity near the wetted surface of the pipe will be lower for square entry than for bell-
mouthed entry. Hence, the frictional resistance inside the culvert is smaller when the entry is square
than when it is bell-mouthed. Stream lining the entry is, therefore, not an unmixed advantage.

Suppose we know the operating head H and the length of the barrel L, and assume that the
diameter of a round pipe or the side of a square box culvert is D.
From D calculate the cross-sectional area A and the hydraulic mean radius R of the culvert.
low from R and L compute K
e and K
f using appropriate functions from Table 19.1. Then,
calculate Q from Equation (19.5). If this equals the design discharge, the assumed size of the culvert
is correct. If not, assume a fresh value ofD and repeat.

It is obvious that all components of X in Equation (19.7) are functions of the cross-section,
length, roughness, and the shape of the inlet of the pipe. Therefore, X represents the conveying
capacity of the pipe and may be called the 'Conveyance Factor'. The discharge, then depends on the
conveyance factor of the pipe and the operating head. In Plate 26, curves have been constructed
from equation (1 9.7) from which Q can be directly read for any known values of X and H.
Also, in the same Plate, Tables are included from which X can be taken for any known values
of (i) length,
(ii) diameter in case of circular pipes or sides in case of rectangular pipes, and

PROTECTION WORK AND MAINTENANCE
20.1.
Floor Protection Works:
In case structures founded on erodible soil are protected against scour by floor
protection works, the following is considered as sound practice.
20.1.1. For structures where adoption of shallow foundations becomes economical by
restricting the scour, floor protection may be provided. The floor protection will comprise of rigid
flooring with curtain walls and flexible apron so as to check scour, washing away or disturbance by
piping action, etc. Usually performance of similar existing works is the best guide for finalizing the
design of new works. However, the following minimum specification for floor protection shall be
followed while designing new structures subject to the general stipulation that post protection works
velocity under the structures does not exceed 2 m/s and the intensity of discharge is limited to
2m 3/m.
20.1.2. Suggested
Specifications:
20. 1 .2. 1
. Excavation for laying foundation and protection works should be carried out as
per specifications under proper supervision. Before laying the foundation and protection works the
excavated trench should be thoroughly inspected by the Engineer-in-Charge to ensure that:
(a)
There are no loose pockets, unfiled depressions left in the trench.
(b)
The soil at the founding level
is properly compacted to true lines and level.
(c)
All concrete and other elements are laid in dry bed.
20. 1 .2.2. Rigid flooring
: The rigid flooring should be provided under the bridge and it should
extend for a distance of at least 3 m on upstream side and 5 m on down stream side of the bridge.
However, in case the splayed wing walls of the structure are likely to be longer, the flooring should
extend upto the line connecting the end of wing walls on either side of the bridge.
The top of flooring should be kept 300 mm below the lowest bed level.
Flooring should consist of 1 50 mm thick flat stone/bricks on edge in cement mortar
1 :3 laid
over 300 mm thick cement concrete Ml 5 grade laid over a layer of 1 50 mm thick cement concrete
M10 grade. Joints at suitable spacings (say 20 m) may be provided.
20.1.2.3. Curtain walls
: The rigid flooring should be enclosed by curtain walls (tied to the
wing walls) with a minimum depth below floor level of 2 m on upstream side and 2.5 m on downstream
side. The curtain wall should be in cement concrete Ml 5 grade or brick/stone masonry in cement
mortar 1:3. The rigid flooring should be continued over the top width of curtain walls. In this context,
79



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP: 13-2004
relevant provision in "Guidelines for design and construction of river training and control works for
road bridges", IRC: 89-1997 is also referred.
20.1.2.4. Flexible apron
: Flexible apron
1 m thick comprising of loose stone bouiders
(weighing not less than 40 kg) should be provided beyond the curtain walls for a minimum distance
of 3 m on upstream
side and 6 m on downstream
side. Where required size stones are not
economically available, cement concrete blocks or stones in wire crates may be used in place of
isolated stones. In this context, relevant provision in IRC:89-1997 is also referred.
20. 1 .2.5. Wherever scour is restricted by provision of flooring/flexible apron, the work of
flooring/apron etc., should be simultaneously completed alongwith the work on foundations so that
the foundation work completed is not endangered.
20.2.
Maintenance
:
20.2. 1
. The bridge structures are more susceptible to damages during monsoon. It is generally
observed that following factors contribute mainly to damage.
(a)
Choking of vents
(b)
Wash outs of approaches
(c)
Dislodgement ofwearing course and cushion
(d)
Scour on D/S (downstream)
(e)
Silting on U/S (upstream)
(f)
Collection of debris on approaches in cutting
20.2.2. To minimize the occurrence of above phenomena, it is necessary to take adequate
steps as below:
(1)
The vents should be thoroughly cleaned before every monsoon.
(2)
The bridge vents should be cleared after the first monsoon flood as the flood carries
maximum debris with it.
(3)
Keep approaches almost matching with existing bank, i.e., cutting or embankment
should be minimum to avoid wash outs of approaches.
(4)
Disposal of water through side gutters shall be properly planned so that it does not
damage the cross-drainage work proper.
(5)
The wearing coat with cushion should be sufficiently stable and it should not get
dislodged during floods.
(6)
In the event of approaches being in cutting there is a tendency ofwhirling of water at
the approaches. This leads to collection of debris in the approaches. After the floods
recede, huge heap ofdebris is found on the approaches. This should be quickly cleared.

RAFT FOUNDATIONS
21.1.
Raft foundation is preferred when the good foundable strata is not available within a
reasonable depth. Thus, the sandy layer or sand and silty foundations warrant provision of raft
foundation. While providing raft foundation, some important points should be kept in view.
21.1.1. Raft top should be kept 300 mm below the lowest bed level. This will ensure protection
to raft and also would avoid silting tendency on U/S and scouring tendency on D/S. The raft will also
not be subjected to stresses due to temperature variations.
21.1.2. U/S and D/S aprons should be provided to protect the bridge from scouring
or undermining. The width of U/S and D/S aprons should be
1.5 dsm and 2.0 dsm respectively
(Fig. 21.1).
21 .1.3. The depth of cut-off wall should be 30 cm below the scour level. The normal scour
' a 2
^
73
depth is worked out by the formula d
=
1 .34 x
(Refer Equation 9.1).
(Scour Depth need not be increased by any factor as in case of open foundations as stipulated
inIRC:78-2000).

. 1 .4. Longitudinal cut-off walls should be provided on U/S and D/S side and they should be
connected by cross cut off walls. Longitudinal cut-off walls safeguard the bridge from scour where
as the cross-cut-off walls keep the longitudinal cut-off walls in position and also protect the bridge
from scouring particularly due to out flanking.
21.1.5. The raft is generally as wide as the deck but in certain cases may be narrower than
the deck (Fig. 21.2).
21 .1 .6. Pressure relief holes may be provided in the raft to relieve the raft from possible
uplift pressure from below. The holes need to be carefully packed with graded filter material to
prevent outflow of soil particles of the foundation strata alongwith the flow of water (Fig. 21.3).

CD. WORKS IN BLACK COTTON SOILS
22.1
.
Generally, the black cotton (B.C.) soil is of expansive nature. As it comes in contact
with water, the montmorillonite group cells expand. This phenomenon leads to heavy pressure on
structure and the structure may develop cracks and fail. It is, therefore, necessary to safeguard the
structure from the ill-effects of the damaging nature of the soil. It is desirable to cut the contact of
expansive soil and the foundation structure. This can be achieved by providing a sandy media all
around the foundation. Such non-expansive layer not only cuts the all around contact between soil
and foundation but also absorbs energy of swelling and shrinking of foundation soil below the layer of
sand and keeps the foundation safe.
22.2.
The expansive soils have very poor bearing capacity. The same needs improvement,
which can be done by providing layer ofmetal/boulder with sand having thickness of about 450 to 600
mm. Such layer, improves Safe Bearing Capacity (SBC) of the strata to a considerable extent and
safeguards the foundation from the adverse effects of the expansive soil also (Fig. 22.1).

BOX CELL STRUCTURES
23.1.
Where to Provide Box Structures
: Box structures are hydraulically efficient
structures where thickness of walls and slab are small and there is least obstruction to flow.
When the river or Nalla has sandy bed and/or purely clayey strata, the independent foundations
are likely to be deeper and this may enhance the cost of culverts and small bridges. Under these
circumstances box culverts are found to be a better solution. Several such box cell structures have
shown a good in service performance. Purely sandy soil or clayey strata may be at few places but
mixed soils are available in several cases. Where
(j) value of mixed soil is less than 15°,
it may be
treated as a clayey soil. Similarly, where safe bearing capacity of soil is found to be less than
1 0 t/m
2
,
box culverts are most suitable for such type of soils.
23.2.
Type of Boxes
: Box cell structures with and without earth cushion based on
MORT&H Standard Drawings are given in 10 plates as brought out in para 14.5.
23.3.
Foundation
: Where there is purely clayey strata top 900 mm below box should
have granular material, like, sandy murum or stone dust.
Where there is murum and mixed soil having
<j) more than
1 5°, there is no need of providing
sandy layer.
The box cell structures are of concrete of M 20 grade for moderate and M 25 grade for
severe conditions of exposure with HYSD steel bars.
Box cell structures are to be provided with curtain walls and apron and these must be completed
before floods. The best practice is to lay foundations of curtain wall and apron first and then lay box.

FILLING BEHIND ABUTMENTS, WING AND RETURN WALLS
1. FILLING MATERIALS
The type of materials to be used for filling behind abutments and other earth retaining
structures, should be selected with care. A general guide to the selection of soils
is given in
Table
1.

2. LAYING AND COMPACTION
2.1.
Laying of Filter Media for Drainage
The filter materials shouid be well packed to a thickness of not less than 600 mm with smaller
size towards the soil and bigger size towards the wall and provided over the entire surface behind
abutment, wings or return walls to the full height.
Filter materials need not be provided in case the abutment is of spill through type.
2.2.
Density of Compaction
Densities to be aimed at in compaction should be chosen with due regard to factors, such
as, the soil type, height of embankment, drainage conditions, position of the individual layers and
type of plant available for compaction.
Each compacted layer should be tested in the field for density and accepted before the
operations for next layer are begun.

3. EXTENT OF BACKFILL
The extent of backfill to be provided behind the abutment should be as illustrated in
Fig.

4. PRECAUTIONS TO BE TAKEN DURING CONSTRUCTION
4. 1
.
The sequence of filling behind abutments, wing walls and return walls should be so
controlled that the assumptions made in the design are fulfilled and they should clearly be indicated
in the relevant drawings. For example, if the earth pressure in front of the abutment is assumed
in the design, the front filling should also be done simultaneously alongwith the filling behind abutment,
layer by, and in case the filling behind abutment before placing the superstructure is considered not
desirable, the filling behind abutment should also be deferred to a later date. In case of tie beams
and friction slabs, special care should be taken in compacting the layer underneath and above them
so that no damage
is done to them by mechanical equipment.
4.2.
Special precautions should be taken to prevent any wedging action against structures,
and the slopes bounding the excavation for the structure should be stepped or strutted to prevent
such wedging action.
4.3.
Adequate number of weep holes not exceeding one metre spacing in both directions
should be provided to prevent any accumulation of water and building up of hydrostatic pressure
behind the walls. The weep holes should be provided above the low water level.

Representative disturbed samples of bed materials shall be taken at every change of strata upto
the maximum anticipated scour depth. The sampling should start from 300 mm below the existing
bed About 500 cms of each of the representative samples so collected shall be sieved by a set of
standard sieves and the weight of soil retained in each sieve is taken. The results thereof are then
tabulated A typical test result is shown below (Table A & B).
