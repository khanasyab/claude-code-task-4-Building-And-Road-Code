1.1
Structural evaluation of pavements involves application of a standard load to the
pavement and measuring
its response
in terms of stress,
strain or deflection. Benkelman
beam has been among the earliest equipment used for measuring deflection and structural
evaluation of pavements.
In this technique, a static load
is applied to the pavement surface
and rebound deflections are measured at one or more locations. Measurement of deflection
under a static load does not simulate the loading conditions produced
in pavements by a
moving vehicle. The evaluation of pavements by such methods
is labour-intensive and,
in
general, time consuming. The existing guidelines for strengthening of flexible pavements
using Benkelman beam technique are contained in IRC:81 and were developed based on the
findings of the Research Scheme R-6 of Ministry of Road Transport and Highways carried
out during 1984 to 1990.
1.2
One
of the serious
limitations
of the Benkelman beam technique
is
that the
measurement of deflection under a
static load does not simulate the loading conditions
produced
in pavements by a moving vehicle. Besides, the pavement sections considered
under R-6, which forms the basis of the existing guidelines, comprised thin and less
stiff
bituminous courses like BM and Premix Carpet as opposed to modern pavements comprising
thick and
stiffer bituminous courses
like DBM and BC. Benkelman beam evaluation under
static load
is known
to under-estimate the strength
of DBM and BC
layers.
Thirdly, the
Benkelman beam method
is labour-intensive and time consuming and test results are likely
to be affected by moving traffic on adjacent lanes, and unsafe to be carried out under heavy
traffic conditions. Fourthly, the repeatability of test results
is always a concern.
Finally, this
method does not predict the properties of the different constituent layers of the pavement,
which
is necessary for a comprehensive evaluation of the pavement. On account of these
limitations in the existing pavement evaluation methods,
it is considered necessary to have a
separate set of guidelines, especially for high performing well designed pavements.
1.3
Significant developments have taken place during the past few decades in terms
of the equipment and the analytical tools adopted for structural evaluation of pavements.
Impulse loading equipment commonly known as Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) have
been developed, which
closely simulates the duration and amplitude of the load pulses
2

IRC:115-2014
produced by moving wheel
loads. Analytical tools to backcalculate the
elastic properties
of the existing pavement have been developed over the years. One such backcalculation
software has been developed by the Transportation Engineering Division of NT Kharagpur
(Reddy, 2003) under the Ministry's Research Scheme R-81. Using the elastic properties of
the existing pavement layers, the requirement of strengthening can be worked out following
a mechanistic-empirical design procedure. One such procedure and the software have been
provided in IRC:37-2012.
2 SCOPE
2.1
These guidelines are meant for evaluating the structural condition of in-service
flexible road pavements using deflection data from Falling Weight Deflectometer as well as
other pavement data as inputs to a backcalculation model for determining the elastic moduli
of pavement layers, and,
thereafter, using these moduli as inputs to a pavement design
model for estimating the overlay requirement. The backcalculation software used
in these
guidelines is the one developed as a result of the research carried out under MoRTH Research
study (R-81, 2003) "Structural Evaluation of Pavements using Falling Weight Deflectometer"
and other studies conducted by the Transportation Engineering Section of NT Kharagpur
(R-81, 2003; Kumar, 2001; Reddy, 2003; Uday Kumar, 2011). The pavement design mode!
used in these guidelines is the one prescribed in IRC:37-2012.
2.2
These guidelines need to be applied to estimate (a) The residual life of an existing
pavement and (b) the overlay requirement.
2.3
Structural evaluation exercise should
include pavement condition assessment,
determining in-situ subgrade strength and pavement material investigations besides deflection
testing. The assessment of functional and structural condition of the pavement has to be
made on the basis of judicial evaluation of all relevant information collected from the afore-
mentioned investigations.
2.4
These guidelines may require revision from time-to-time based on future experience
and developments
in the
field. Towards
this end,
it
is suggested
to
all the organizations
using the guidelines to keep a detailed record of periodical measurements (both before and
after strengthening), type and thickness of overlay provided, performance,
traffic, climatic
condition, etc. and provide feedback to the Indian Roads Congress for further revision.
3 PRINCIPLE OF PAVEMENT EVALUATION USING FWD
3.1
Performance of flexible pavements can be evaluated by applying loads on the
pavements
that simulate the
traffic
loading,
recording the response
to such
loading by
measuring the elastic deflection under such loads, and analyzing these data duly considering
the factors influencing the performance such as subgrade strength, thickness and quality of
each of the pavement layers, drainage conditions, pavement surface temperature etc.
3.2
Among the equipment available for structural evaluation of pavements, the Falling
Weight Deflectometer (FWD) is extensively used world-wide because
it simulates, to a large
3



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 44
======================================================================
IRC:115-2014
extent, the actual loading conditions of the pavement. When a moving wheel load passes
over the pavement
it produces load pulses. Normal stresses (vertical as well as horizontal)
at a location
in the pavement will increase
in magnitude from zero to a peak value as the
moving wheel load approaches the location. The time taken for the stress pulse to vary from
zero to peak value
is termed as 'rise time of the pulse'. As the wheel moves away from the
location, magnitude of stress reduces from peak value to zero. The time period during which
the magnitude of stress pulse varies from 'zero-to-peak-to-zero' is the pulse duration. Peak
load and the corresponding pavement responses are of interest for pavement evaluation.
3.3
The resulting load-deflection data can be interpreted through appropriate analytical
techniques, such as backcalculation technique, to estimate the elastic moduli of the pavement
layers. The computed moduli are,
in turn, used for
(i) the strength evaluation of different
layers of in-service pavements
(ii) the estimation of the remaining life of in-service pavement
(iii)
determination
of strengthening
requirement,
if any and
(iv)
evaluation
of
different
rehabilitation alternatives (overlay, recycling, partial reconstruction, etc).
4 FALLING WEIGHT DEFLECTOMETER
4.1
Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD)
is an
impulse-loading device
in which
a
transient load
is applied to the pavement and the deflected shape of the pavement surface
is measured. The working principle of a typical FWD
is
illustrated
in Fig.
1. DO, D1,
etc.,
mentioned
in Fig.
1 are surface deflections measured at different radial distances. Impulse
load
is applied by means of a falling mass, which
is allowed to drop vertically on a system of
springs placed over a circular loading plate. The deflected shape of the pavement surface is
measured using displacement sensors which are placed at different radial distances starting
with the center of the load plate. Trailer mounted as well as vehicle mounted FWD models
are available commercially. The working principle of all these FWD models is essentially the
same. A mass of weights
is dropped from a pre-determined height onto a series of springs/
buffers placed on top of a loading
plate. The corresponding peak load and peak vertical
surface deflections at different radial locations are measured and recorded.

IRC:115-2014
4.2
Different magnitudes of impulse load can be obtained by selection of a suitable
mass and an
appropriate
height
of
fall. Under the
application
of the impulse
load,
the
pavement deflects. Velocity transducers are placed on the pavement surface at different
radial locations to measure surface deflections. Geophones or seismometers are used as
displacement transducers. Load and deflection data are acquired with the help of a data
acquisition system.
4.3
Typical
Falling Weight Deflectometers (FWD) include a circular loading plate of
300 or 450 mm diameter.
In these guidelines 300 mm diameter load plate
is recommended.
A rubber pad of 5 mm minimum thickness should be glued
to the bottom
of the loading
plate for uniform distribution of load. Alternatively, segmented loading plates (with two to four
segments) can be used for better load distribution.
4.4
A falling mass
in the range of 50 to 350 kg
is dropped from a height of fall
in the
range of 100 to 600 mm to produce load pulses of desired peak load and duration. Heavier
models use falling mass in the range of 200 to 700 kg. The target peak load to be applied on
bituminous pavements is 40 kN (+/- 4 kN), which corresponds to the load on one dual wheel
set of a 80 kN standard axle load. The target peak load can be decreased suitably
if the peak
maximum (central) deflection measured with 40 kN load exceeds the measuring capacity of
the deflection transducer. Similarly, the load can be increased to produce deflection of atleast
10 |jm at a radial distance of 1.2 m.
If
it is known from construction records or from coring or
from test pits that subgrade
is stiff and hence smaller than 10 pm deflections are expected,
testing with increased loads will not be required.
If the applied peak load differs from 40 kN,
the measured deflections have to be normalized to correspond to the standard target load of
40 kN. The normalization of deflections can be done linearly. For example,
if the measured
deflection
is 0.80 mm for an applied peak load of 45 kN, the normalized deflection for a
standard load of 40 kN
is 0.711 mm (0.80
* (40/45)). The load cells used to measure load
pulses produced by FWD should have a reading resolution of 0.1 kN or better and should
give readings accurate to 2 percent of measured value.
4.5
The stiffness of bituminous layers and hence the response of a pavement depends
on the pulse shape of the applied load (COST 336, 2005). Most FWDs have a load rise time
(from start of pulse to peak) of between 5 ms and 30 ms and have a load pulse base width in
the interval of 20 ms to 60 ms (COST 336, 2005). The duration of impulse load is maintained
approximately equal to the time needed to traverse the length of a tyre imprint at a speed of
about 60 km/h which
is in the range of 20 to 30 ms. The FWDs used for evaluation should be
capable of producing load pulses with loading time in the range of 15 to 50 ms.
4.6
Sufficient number of deflection transducers should be used to adequately capture
the shape of deflection bowl. Six to nine velocity transducers (geophones) are generally
adequate for measuring surface deflections of flexible pavements. Deflection sensors are
placed on the surface of pavement at different radial direction aligned
in the longitudinal
direction. The deflection transducers used should have a reading resolution of atleast 1 pm and
5



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 44
======================================================================
IRC:115-2014
should be accurate to +/- 2 percent of the reading. Typical geophone position configurations
(number and
radial
distances measured from
center of load
plate) commonly used
for
flexible pavement evaluation are
;-
(i) 7 sensors at 0, 300, 600, 900, 1200, 1500 and 1800
mm radial distances
(ii) 7 sensors at 0, 200, 300, 450, 600, 900, 1500 mm radial distances
(iii) 6 sensors at 0, 300, 600, 900, 1200 and 1500 mm radial distances and (iv) 6 sensors at
0, 200, 300, 600, 900, 1200 mm radial distances.
4.7
Calibration of the FWD
It is essential that FWDs are calibrated for getting accurate and reproducible results.
4.7.1
Static calibration
The load
cell(s) used
in the FWD should be calibrated
in a standard laboratory and the
readings of the load cell(s) should be matched to those of the reference load cell. The readings
of the FWD load cel!(s) should be accurate to 2 percent of the reference load cell readings.
The date of calibration of the load cell should not be earlier than 365 days from the date of
structural evaluation of pavements using FWD.
4.7.2
Load repeatability
^
For this test, FWD measurements should be carried out on a
level bituminous pavement
surface, which does not have any cracking. The range of load applied should generate peak
central deflections in the range of 250 pm to 600 pm. The standard deviation of the peak load
in the load repeatability test estimated from a minimum of twelve load drops should be less
than 5 percent of the mean value of peak load. Load repeatability may be checked before
using the FWD for any major investigation.
4.7.3
Absolute calibration of deflection transducers
.-
Dismounted
deflection transducers should be
calibrated
in
a
laboratory setup
following
any approved procedure and the deflection transducers should be accurate to 2 percent of
reference deflections. The date of static calibration of geophones should not be earlier than
one year from the date of structural evaluation of pavements using the FWD.
Deflection
repeatability check may
also be conducted
using
the data
collected
in
load
repeatability test. The standard deviation of the normalized deflections, should be less than
5 percent of the mean value of the reading.
Relative deflection comparison may be done before using the FWD for evaluation in a project.
This can be done by stacking all the transducers, one above the other, in a suitable stand and
placing the stand on the pavement surface (level and free from cracks). Deflection readings
of all the transducers corresponding to a series of load drops are recorded and compared.
The deflections produced in this test should be in the range of 250 pm to 600 pm. Difference
between maximum and minimum of the recorded (normalized) deflections should be within
4 pm.

5 PAVEMENT EVALUATION SURVEY AND DATA COLLECTION
5.1
General
The following are the broad categories of survey, investigation and data collection exercise;
(i) historical data about the pavement
(ii) condition survey of the pavement for identification
of uniform
sections having
similar conditions,
(iii)
deflection measurements using
falling
weight deflectometer and
(iv) pavement layer thickness and composition and the subgrade
characteristics.
5.2
Historical Data
Historical data on pavement can be useful
in identifying the reasons for different distresses
and
in
establishing whether the
distresses were caused
by
deficiency
in
design,
poor
material selection, improper construction and other reasons such as high water table and
poor drainage. Even though
in most cases
it would be
difficult to have a comprehensive
compilation of pavement history,
it would be advisable to look for the records to find out the
following:
i)
Initial pavement design - basis of design, guidelines followed, performance
criteria adopted, layer types, layer thicknesses and properties assigned
ii)
Data regarding functional and structural evaluation carried out
if the existing
surface is an overlay
iii)
Laboratory testing results on different materials used
iv)
Internal and external drainage arrangement made
v)
'As constructed' pavement details
vi)
Construction methods adopted
vii)
Quality control test results
viii)
Maintenance and rehabilitation data such as past distresses, effectiveness of
different maintenance and rehabilitation measures undertaken in the past
ix)
Climatic condition data regarding rainfall intensity, temperature, occurrence
of floods, overtopping of pavement, high water table, etc.
x)
Past traffic volume history, axle load spectrum data
xi)
Discussions with the engineers associated with design,
construction and
maintenance stages can yield valuable information.

5.3.1
Pavement condition survey shall precede the actual deflection measurement and
consists primarily of visual observations supplemented by measurements for estimation of
cracking, rutting and other distresses in the pavement.
It may be prudent to identify possible

causes of distress using condition survey and other investigations such as coring, test pits
and laboratory testing before conducting extensive deflection measurements using falling
weight deflectometer.
If the distresses are not related to the structural capacity of pavement
layers, FWD measurements may not be of much help. Rutting
in bituminous mix, distress
caused by stripping in mix, etc. are situations in which the structural condition of the pavement
may not necessarily be explained adequately by FWD measurements.
5.3.2
The information collected in the condition survey should be relevant and adequate
for identifying sections of uniform performance for the purpose of determining the sample
size for deflection measurements. Homogeneous sections for overlay design purpose will be
identified on the basis of deflection measurements and other relevant inputs such as traffic,
subgrade characteristics, deflection bowl parameters, etc.
5.3.3
The condition data would help to figure out the causes of distresses, some of which
could be treated by non-structural treatments like sealing, slurry surfacing, cold planing and
replacement of un-sound materials. This
will make up the functional loss and prepare the
pavement for receiving the structural overlay. Strengthening of flexible pavements should not
be attempted without restoring
its functional loss.
5.3.4
Suitable mapping formats should be used for mapping pavement distress data.
Each lane of the carriageway and the shoulder should be divided separately into blocks of
50 m length and one-lane width (3.5 m) and distress should be recorded for each block.
Paved shoulders should be divided into blocks of 50 m length and pavement shoulder width.
The formats should typically capture the following data about the pavement condition besides
having information such as pavement chainage, direction of traffic and pavement surface
type.
i)
Distress type - cracking,
rutting, shoving, bleeding, stripping, raveling, pot
holes, patching, etc.
ii)
Severity of distress
.
iii)
Extent of distress
iv)
Location of distress
Format for pavement condition survey for identifying sections of uniform performance is given
as Appendix-I.
5.3.5
Based on
the data
collected from
condition
survey,
the road
length
shall be
classified
into sections
of uniform performance
in accordance with the
criteria given
in
Table
1. Rut depth should be measured under a 3 m straight edge
in the middle of the
sub-section of selected length (50 m).
Similarly, cracking and other distresses should be
recorded for each block as mentioned in Clause 5.3.4. Sub-sections of uniform performance
should be
identified
for each
traffic lane and shoulder separately. This
will be
useful

selecting the sampling size for different portions of carriageway for conducting deflection
measurements. Identification of sections of "good, fair and poor" performance may be made
separately for each lane and shoulder based on the corresponding distress maps.
5.3.6
As
it
is
inexpedient
to change
the sample
size
for
deflection measurement
at frequent intervals,
it will be preferable
if the length of each uniform section
is kept at a
minimum of 1 km except in the case of localised failures or in other situations requiring closer
examination where minimum length of section should be 0.3 km from the consideration of
profile correction and constructability.
Table 1
Criteria for Classification of Pavement Sections

Good
Isolated cracks of less than 3.0 mm width
in
less than 5% area of total
paved surface AND average rut depth less than 10 mm
Fair
Isolated or interconnected cracks of less than 3.0 mm width
in 5 to 20%
area of total paved surface AND/OR average rut depth between 10 to 20
mm
Poor
Wide interconnected cracking of more than 3.0 mm width in 5 to 20% area
(include area of patching and raveling
in this) of paved area OR cracking
of any type in more than 20% area of paved surface AND/OR average rut
depth of more than 20 mm
5.4
Deflection Measurement
5.4.1
Estimation of sample size
The sample size or the interval at which deflection measurements are to be made can be
decided using simple statistical principles. Sample size should be larger
(i)
if the variation in
the measured deflections
is expected to be large and
(ii)
if the margin of error between the
mean deflection estimated from the measurements and the true mean of deflections should
be small. The following equation can be used for estimating the sample size (n).
n = (z * CV)2/(ME2)
...(1)
where,
n
=
sample size
z
=
normalized
normal
deviate
which
can
be
obtained
from
standard
statistical tables for a selected confidence level
CV
=
coefficient of variation of deflection (standard deviation/mean) expressed
as percentage
ME
=
acceptable margin of error (as percentage of mean)
5.4.2
It
is recommended that 90 percent confidence
level and 10 percent margin of
error (ME expressed as % of mean) may be considered
in these guidelines for the purpose
of estimation of sample size. The coefficient variability values for "good",
"fair" and "poor"
9



======================================================================
PAGE 18 of 44
======================================================================
IRC:115-2014
sections may be taken as (AASHTO,
1 993) 1 5 percent, 30 percent and 45 percent respectively.
Thus, for 90 percent (two-sided) confidence level (standard normal deviate z =
1 .285) and
1
0
percent margin of error, the minimum sample sizes for "good", "fair" and "poor" sections will
be 4,
1 5, 33.
It may be noted that sample size requirement can be different for individual lanes
as the condition is likely to be different. However,
it is recommended that for a uniform section
(good/fair/poor) the sample size required for the most distressed lane be considered for the
complete carriageway. The
interval at which data should be collected
will depend on the
length of uniform section.
If, for example, the length of section of uniform "fair" performance
is 2.0 km, the maximum spacing at which deflections should be measured
is 2000/15 = 133
m. The spacing can be rounded off to convenient practical values.
5.4.3
Different measurement schemes can be adopted. These include
(i) measurement
along the most distressed wheel path of the carriageway
(ii) measurement along inner as
well as outer wheel paths of all the lanes
(iii) measurement along both wheel paths of only
the outer most lanes and
(iv) measurement along the more distressed wheel paths of each
of the lanes. The guidelines given
in Table 2 are recommended for selection of deflection
measurement schemes for different types of carriageways.

The spacings given
in the table are with the assumption that the length of uniform

section
is 1.0 km. The actual spacing to be adopted can be obtained by multiplying
the spacing given
in the table by the length of uniform section
2)
Deflections may be measured along the hard shoulders
if the same are proposed to
form part of the new lane in case of widening projects
5.4.4
The wheel path selected for deflection study has to be clearly indicated in the data
sheets used for recording the deflection data. The scheme of wheel paths and sample size
selected for measurement of deflections should not be changed within a section of uniform
performance (good, fair, poor).
5.4.5
Positions of wheel paths must be identified by observing the surface condition of
the road.
If the same cannot be done, the following guidelines can be used for identifying the
outermost wheel path.
Outer wheel paths of outer lanes
:-
i)
For single-lane two-way carriageway
:- at 0.6 m from the outer edge of the
outer lane
ii)
For two-lane two-way carriageway and for multi-lane single carriageway
:- at
1 .0 m from the outer edge of outer lane
iii)
For divided carriageways with two or more lanes in each direction
:- 0.75 m
from the outer edge of outer lane
Outer wheel paths of inner lanes

Steps for measuring deflection at a test point
The following steps may be followed for measuring deflections at each test point. The exact
sequence of operations may be different for different models of FWD.
i)
Mark the test point on the pavement
ii)
Centre the load plate of the duly calibrated FWD over the test point
iii)
Lower the loading plate onto the pavement. There should be no standing
water (surface texture completely filled with water) on the pavement surface.
The loading plate should be
in proper contact with pavement surface.
If a
non-segmental plate
is used the presence of rutting at test location should
be noted
if
it
affects
the
contact between
plate and pavement surface.
The longitudinal and transverse slope of the pavement should not exceed
10 percent at the test location for accurate measurement of deflection
iv)
Lower the frame holding the displacement transducers (geophones) so that
the transducers are in contact with pavement surface
v)
Raise the mass to a pre-determined height required for producing a target
load of 40 kN
vi)
Drop one seating load. Load and deflection data for seating load drop need
not be recorded
vii)
Raise the mass and drop. Record load and deflection data into the computer
through data acquisition system. While peak load and peak deflections at
different selected radial positions must be recorded, complete time history of
load and deflections can be stored for each load drop
if feasible

Repeat step vii atleast two more times

If, during steps
vii and
viii, the deflections measured are too large or too
small as discussed in Clause 4.4, the test may be repeated by changing the
peak load

Raise
the geophone frame and

Measure pavement surface
layer temperature
at
half-hourly
intervals by
drilling holes of 40 mm depth into the pavement surface layer.
Fill the hole
with a drop of glycerol. Insert the thermometer into the hole and record the
temperature after three minutes
xiv)
Deflection
measurements
should
not
be
made
when
the
pavement
temperature
is more than 45°C. Guidelines given
in Clause 6.4.3 may be
followed for deflection measurement
in colder areas and areas of altitude
greater than 1000 m
Proforma for recording pavement deflection data
is given as Appendix-il.
5.5
Determination of Pavement Layer Thiclcnesses
5.5.1
Pavement layer thicknesses are essential inputs to the process of backcalculation
of layer moduli and, in turn, to the estimation of remaining life and overlay requirements of the
in-service pavement. Hence,
it is necessary that accurate information is collected about layer
thicknesses from different sources. Layer thicknesses can be obtained from historical data,
by coring bound layers and/or by excavating test
pits and/or through the non-destructive
technique of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey.
5.5.2
As
it has generally been difficult to get accurate records of as-constructed layer
thicknesses, the most effective method of determining thicknesses of all the layers has been
the excavation of test pits at suitable spacing and measure the layer thicknesses. Samples
of different layer materials can be collected from the test pits which can be examined for
signs of degradation and contamination of granular layers, stripping of bituminous mixes,
identification of rutted layers. The samples can be tested in the laboratory for evaluating the
layer moduli and for exploring causes of distresses, especially
in bituminous mixes. This
information will be useful for validating the layer moduli backcalculated from analysis besides
being useful in explaining the causes for some of the distresses observed on the surface.
5.5.3
It is recommended that 0.6 m x 0.6 m test pits be excavated at
1 .0 km interval or
at suitable larger interval where other records suggest uniformity of pavement composition
in such larger sections. The test pits may be excavated along the outer lanes only starting
from the outside edge of the outer lane in the earthen shoulders exposing pavement layers
sufficiently to note the condition and thickness of each layer. At each test
pit, the number
13



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:115-2014
of layers encountered,
description
of layer materials including signs of distress,
defects,
layer thicknesses, interface conditions should be recorded. After collecting necessary data
from the test pits they should be filled back as soon as possible with suitable material and
compacted so that they do not adversely affect the structural condition of the pavement and
also do not create traffic safety hazard. During the period the test pits are excavated and
remain unfilled, the area of excavation should be cordoned off by suitable barricading and
adequately displayed through traffic safety devices for ensuring night visibility.
'
5.5.4
Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP) tests may be conducted on the subgrade
layer exposed
in the test
pits to obtain the Dynamic Cone Penetrometer value for in-situ
subgrade. The DCP values obtained with a 60° cone can used to estimate the backcalculated
modulus value of subgrade layer using equation 2 (Kumar, 2001 ). These values can be used
for selection of modulus range for subgrade in the backcalculation process.

5.5.5
Since
it is generally difficult to excavate test pits in the inner lanes,
it is suggested
that cores be taken
in the bituminous layers at 2.0 km
interval on the inner lanes and at
1.0 km
interval
on
the
outer
lanes
(in
the
case
of
multi-lane
divided
or
undivided
carriageways). In addition, cores may also be taken at locations, where structural problems are
observed based on evaluation of FWD and/or distress data. These cores may be compared
to the cores taken from
portions of pavement without any significant distress to find the
reasons of deficiencies. The cores should be examined
for type of layers and thickness,
crack propagation (from bottom or top and depth of crack), and de-lamination
in the cores.
Stiffness modulus of the bituminous mix can also be determined by conducting appropriate
test (such as ASTM D 7369-09) on the core.
5.5.6
The locations of test pits and cores should coincide with the locations of FWD
test.
6 ANALYSIS OF DATA
6.1
Processing of Load and Deflection Data
6.1.1
The FWD test data collected from different load drops at each test point primarily
consist of peak load, peak deflections at different radial locations. Unrealistic deflection values
and obviously erroneous data must be removed. Some of the checks that should be applied
to the deflection data are
:-
(i) deflections should decrease with increasing distance from the
loading plate and
(ii) deflection values should not be more than the capacity of the sensors.
Average values of load and deflections are calculated from the three drop test data collected
at a given location.

======================================================================
IRC:115-2014
6.1.2
The deflections are normalized to correspond to a standard target load of 40 kN
as explained in Clause 4.4.
6.2
Identification of Homogeneous Sub-sections
6.2.1
The identification of sections of uniform performance done
in Section 4 of these
guidelines was done primarily to select an appropriate sample size for conducting deflection
testing. Since the assessment of the remaining life of existing pavement and the strengthening
requirement in terms of bituminous overlay will be done on the basis of the backcalculated
moduli of in-service pavement layers,
it
is prudent to
identify homogeneous sections for
the purpose of structural design primarily based on deflection bowl parameters and other
relevant information.
6.2.2
identification
of homogeneous sections
is generally done on the basis of the
following parameters
:- peak
deflections
or peak
deflection bowl
parameters, subgrade
strength, design traffic, layer thicknesses and extent and severity of distress, backcalculated
surface modulus
of the
total bituminous
layers,
remaining
life
of pavement and overlay
thickness requirement.
It
is proposed
in these guidelines that one of the deflection bowl
parameters, which
typically represent the stiffness of the upper layers along with design
traffic and subgrade strength, should be used for identification of homogeneous sections.
Other parameters as may be deemed suitable can also be considered
for this purpose.
Surface Curvature Index (SCI) calculated as the difference between
and D^^^ where,
and
D3QQ are the peak deflections (mm) measured at the center of loading plate and at a
radial distance of 300 mm is a bowl shape parameter, which reflects the contribution of upper
layers, is the bowl shape parameter to be used, alongwith other parameters, for identification
of homogeneous sections. SCI
is expressed
in mm here whereas the parameter
is used
in
inches or mils in many empirical expressions available in literature for empirically estimating
moduli of layers.
6.2.3
A statistical technique popularly used for identification of homogeneous sections
is the "Cumulative Difference" approach. This approach
is already being used extensively in
India
in many highway projects.
In this approach, the sequence of actual cumulative sums
in a measurement series
is compared with the sums that would have resulted from adding
averages. The difference between these values
is termed as cumulative difference. The
series of cumulative differences (zj for the measured sequence of a given variable
'x' (SCI,
subgrade strength, etc.) can be obtained using the following expression.
Z,= 'f,ixi-k~x)
...(3)
/=i
for all k =
1,
n,
i=ii
where x = (1/n) ^{xi)
Wherever the trend changes from positive to negative and vice-versa in the plot of cumulative
difference VS distance (or number of test location), that should be considered as a possible

IRC:115-2014
delineator for identifying homogeneous sections. However, judgment has to be applied for
considering a particular change in trend to be significant enough to suggest the presence of
a delineator there.
6.2.4
Homogeneous sections can be identified with reference to different parameters
such as
SCI,
traffic, subgrade
strength,
etc.
Delineation
carried
out based on
different
parameters
will
yield
a number of sub-sections. No sub-section should be shorter than
1.0 km in length and each subsection should have atleast twelve deflection test locations.
If
a subsection has only one or two test points,
it is a case of the pavement in need of localized
rehabilitation measures. The spacing considered for deflection measurement
in each sub-
section can be rounded off to convenient practical values.
6.3
Backcalculation of Layer Moduli
6.3.1
Measured surface deflections, normalized to a standard load of 40 kN, alongwith
other inputs such as radial distances at which deflections are measured, layer thicknesses,
Poisson's
ratio values of different layers, applied peak load and loading plate radius, are
used to backcalculate the elastic moduli of different layers of the existing pavement using an
appropriate backcalculation technique. The backcalculated moduli are used for the analysis
of the in-service pavement and for assessment of the structural condition of the pavement.
KGPBACK, which is a specific version of BACKGA program developed by the Transportation
Engineering Section of NT, Kharagpur for the research scheme R-81 (2003) of the Ministry
of Road Transport and Highways,
is recommended
in these guidelines for backcalculation.
Details of KGPBACK are given in Appendix-Ill.
6.4
Correction for Temperature
6.4.1
Backcalculated moduli values of the bituminous layers evaluated by FWD survey
are influenced by the pavement temperature. Hence the backcalculated moduli obtained at
temperatures other than the identified standard temperature will have to be corrected. For
areas in India having a tropical climate, the standard pavement temperature is recommended
as 35°C.
6.4.2
The backcalculated modulus of bituminous layer obtained from deflection survey
conducted at a temperature "T^' °C can be corrected to estimate the modulus corresponding
to a temperature of "T^" °C using equation 4 (Reddy, 2003).
E„ = ^E,,
...(4)
where,
X, temperature correction factor,
is given as
1-0.238 In
7;
1-0.238 In T2
where.

PAGE 25 of 44
======================================================================
IRC:115-2014
E-^^ = backcalculated modulus (MPa) at temperature
(°C)
E^2 ~ backcalculated modulus (MPa) at temperature
(°C)
The above factor was developed
for a pavement temperature range of 25
to 40°C. The
trends obtained by Reddy (2003) and Uday Kumar (2011) suggest that the relationship can
be extrapolated upto a temperature range of 20 to 45°C. Temperature correction need not be
applied to backcalculated modulus values of thin bituminous layers (less than 40 mm) and
for "Poor" sections.
6.4.3
In colder areas and areas of altitude greater than
1 000 m where the average daily
temperature
is less than 20°C for more than 4 months
in a year, the standard pavement
temperature
of 35°C
will
not
apply.
In
the absence
of adequate data about
deflection-
performance relationship,
it is recommended that deflection measurements in such areas be
made when the ambient temperature is greater than 20°C. No temperature correction needs
to be applied for backcalculated moduli of bituminous layers in this case.
6.5
Correction for Seasonal Variation
6.5.1
Moisture content affects the strength
of subgrade and granular subbase/base
layers. The extent to which the strength
is affected
will depend on the nature of subgrade
soil, gradation and nature of fines
in the granular layers,
etc. For the purpose of applying
these guidelines,
it
is intended that the pavement layer moduli values should pertain to the
period when the subgrade
is at its weakest condition.
In India, this period occurs during the
recession of monsoon.
It is, therefore, desirable to conduct deflection measurements during
this period. Where the same is not feasible, a correction procedure should be adopted.
6.5.2
Relationships developed
(R-81,
2003;
Reddy,
2003) based
on FWD
studies
conducted on different highways in eastern India are adopted in these guidelines. Until data
regarding the seasonal variation of backcalculated granular and subgrade moduli are available
from other zones of the country,
it
is recommended that the equations developed
in R-81
research scheme be adopted. Equations 6 and 7 can be used for estimating the modulus
value of subgrade layer from the modulus value backcalculated from deflections collected
during winter and summer respectively.
Equations 6 and
7 are applicable
for monsoon
subgrade modulus of 20 MPa or more (Winter/Summer Modulus of 30 MPa). Similarly, 8 and
9 are applicable for monsoon granular layer modulus of 60 MPa or more (Minimum Winter
modulus of 80 MPa and minimum Summer Modulus of 100 MPa).

7 ESTIMATION OF DESIGN TRAFFIC
7.1
General
7.1.1
Traffic,
in terms of standard axle load (80 kN)
repetitions,
shall be considered
for design of overlay. The cumulative standard axle repetitions may be worked out based
on actual data. Otherwise, the design traffic may be calculated as per the procedure given
in IRC:37 and Clause 7.4 below. For the purpose of structural design of pavements, only
the number of commercial vehicles of laden weight of 3 tonnes or more will be considered.
The traffic is considered
in both directions
in the case of two lane road and
in the direction
of heavier traffic in the case of multi lane divided highways. To obtain a realistic estimate of
design traffic due consideration should be given to the existing
traffic, possible changes
in
road network and land-use of the area served, the probable growth of traffic and design
life.
Estimate of the
initial daily average traffic flow for any road should normally be based on
7-day 24-hours classified traffic counts. However, in exceptional cases where this information
is not available 3-day count may be used.
7.2
Traffic Growth Rate
An estimate of likely growth rate can be obtained as follows:
a)
by studying past trends in traffic growth.
b)
by establishing econometric models, as per the procedure outlined
in IRC
guidelines
If the data for the annual growth rate of commercial vehicles is not available or if it is less than
5 percent, a growth rate of 5 percent shall be used (IRC:SP:84).
7.3
Design Life
The design
life
is defined
in terms
of the cumulative number of standard axles
in msa
that can be carried before a major strengthening,
rehabilitation or capacity augmentation
of the pavement
is necessary.
It
is recommended
that design
life
of overlay should be
18

======================================================================
IRC:115-2014
1 0 years. However, less important roads may be designed for a shorter design period but not
less than 5 years in any case.
7.4
Computation of Design Traffic
7.4.1
The design
traffic
is considered
in terms of the cumulative number of standard
axles
(in the lane carrying maximum traffic) to be carried during the design
life of the road.
This can be computed using the following equation:
365x[(l + r)"-l]
,
^
^
N=
-xAxDxF
...(10)
where,
N
=
cumulative number of standard axles to be catered for in the design
in
terms of million standard axles, msa
A
=
Initial traffic in the year of completion of construction, in terms of number
of Commercial Vehicles Per Day (CVPD)
D
=
Lane distribution factor (as explained in Clause 7.4.2)
F
=
Vehicle Damage Factor (VDF)
n
=
Design
life in years
r
=
Annual growth rate of commercial vehicles expressed
in decimal (eg
:
for 5 percent annual growth rate,
r = 0.05)
The traffic in the year of completion
is estimated using the following formula.
A=P(1+r)^
...(11)
where,
P
=
Number of commercial vehicles as per last count
x
=
Number of years between the last count and the year of completion of
construction
7.4.2
Distribution of commercial traffic over the carriageway
A realistic assessment of the distribution of commercial
traffic by direction and by lane
is
necessary as
it directly affects the total equivalent standard axle load applications used
in
the design process. In the absence of adequate and conclusive data,
it is recommended that
the following distribution may be assumed for design
until more reliable data on placement
of commercial vehicles on the carriageway lanes are available. However,
if in a particular
situation a
better estimate of the
distribution
of traffic between the carriageway lanes
is
available from traffic surveys, the same should be adopted and the design should be based
on the traffic in the most heavily trafficked lane. The design will normally be applied over the
whole carriageway width.
i)
Single-lane roads (3.75 m width)
Traffic tends to be more channelized on single-lane roads than two-lane
19



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 44
======================================================================
IRC:115-2014
roads and to allow for this concentration of wheel load repetitions, the design
should be based on total number of commercial vehicles in both directions.
ii)
Two-lane single carriageway roads
The design should be based on 50 percent of the total number of commercial
vehicles in both directions.
If vehicle damage factor in one direction is higher,
the design traffic in the direction of higher VDF
is recommended.
iii)
Four-lane single carriageway roads
The design should be based on 40 percent of the total number of commercial
vehicles in both directions.
iv)
Dual carriageway roads
The
design
of
dual
two-lane
carriageway
roads
should
be
based
on
75 percent of the number of standard
axles
in each
direction.
For dual
three-lane
carriageway and
dual
four-lane
carriageway,
the
distribution
factor will be 60 percent and 45 percent respectively.
Where there
is no significant difference between the traffic in the two directions, the design
traffic for each direction may be assumed to be as half of the sum of traffic in both directions.
Where significant difference between the two streams exists, pavement thickness
in each
direction can be different and designed accordingly.
For two way two lane roads, pavement thickness should be same for both the lanes even
if VDF values are different in different directions and designed for higher VDF. For divided
carriageways, each
direction may have
different thickness of pavement
if the axle
load
patterns are significantly different.
Where the distribution of traffic between the carriageway lanes and axle load spectrum for
the carriageway lanes are available, the design should be based on the traffic
in the most
heavily trafficked lane and the same design will normally be applied for the whole carriageway
width.
7.4.3
Vehicle damage factor
'
7.4.3.1
The Vehicle Damage Factor (VDF)
is a
multiplier for converting the number of
commercial
vehicles
of different axle loads
to equivalent number of standard
axle
load
(80 kN) repetitions.
It gives the equivalent number of standard axles per commercial vehicle.
The vehicle damage factor
is arrived at from axle load surveys conducted on typical road
sections so as to cover various influencing factors such as traffic mix, type of transportation,
type
of commodities
carried,
time
of the
year,
terrain,
road
condition
and
degree
of
enforcement. The AASHO axle load equivalence factors may be used for converting the axle
load spectrum to an equivalent number of standard axles. For designing a strengthening layer
on an existing road pavement, the vehicle damage factor should be arrived at carefully by
using the relevant available data or carrying out specific axle load surveys depending upon
importance of the project. Minimum sample size to be considered for collecting axle load
data
is given
in Table 3. Axle load survey should be carried out without any bias for loaded
20

IRC:115-2014
or unloaded vehicles. On some sections, there may be significant difference in axle loading
in the two directions of traffic. In such situations, the VDF should be evaluated direction-wise
for the purpose of design. Each direction can have different overlay thickness for divided
carriageways depending upon the loading pattern. The Spectrum of axle loads should be
determined separately for single, tandem, tridem and multi axle loads.

Equations 12 to 15 are used to compute equivalent axle load factors for single
axle with a single wheel on both sides, single axle with dual wheel sets on both sides, tandem
axle and tridem axle respectively.
Single axle with single wheel on both sides
Single axle with dual wheels on both sides
Tandem axle with dual wheels on both sides
Tridem axles with dual wheels on both sides
7.4.3.3
Where sufficient information on axle loads
is not available and the project size
does not warrant conducting an axle load survey, the indicative values of vehicle damage
factor as given in Table 4 may be used.

The structural condition of the pavement can be assessed
in different v/ays. One
such method
is the assessment of remaining

loads that the pavement was
initially designed
for and subtracting from them the
traffic
loads that have already been carried by the pavement. Some other methods estimate the
remaining
life of the pavement directly from the critical stress or strain levels in the present
condition, without taking into account the volume of traffic already carried. Another approach
is to compare the moduli of the present layers with those the layers were expected to have
initially. There are also procedures which correlate the deflections or deflection bowl shape
parameters with the remaining
life of the pavement. In these guidelines, the method in which
the remaining
life of the pavement
is estimated from the
critical strains computed for the
present condition of the pavement is adopted.
8.2
Any method of remaining
life estimation
will have
its limitations and the results
cannot
automatically be
accepted.
It
is,
hence,
very
important
that the
estimations be
compared with other indicators of the structural condition such as surface distress data, test
pit inspection, coring data, etc., to check whether all these data give similar indications.
8.3
Performance Criteria
The layer moduli of in-service pavement backcalculated from FWD deflection data are used
to analyse the pavement for critical strains which are indicators of pavement performance
in terms of rutting and fatigue cracking. The following approach
is proposed for design of
bituminous overlays for existing flexible pavements. The mechanistic criteria (fatigue and
rutting) adopted in the Indian Roads Congress guidelines (IRC:37-2012) for design of flexible
pavements form the basis for the overlay design method. Performance models adopted
in
these guidelines are given below.
8.3.1
Fatigue in bituminous layer
Fatigue model for 90 percent reliability is given as Equation 16
= 0.711
* 10-04 X [1/£j389 * [1/MJ
10,854
...(16)
where.
N

8.3.2
Rutting in subgrade
Rutting model for 90 percent reliability level
is given by Equation 17
N = 1.41 X 10-«x [1/£j4 5337
(17)
8.4
The following are the steps to be followed for design of overlays for Indian highways
based on FWD evaluation.
i)
Measurement
of
surface
deflections
of
homogeneous
section
of
the
in-service pavement using FWD
22



======================================================================
PAGE 31 of 44
======================================================================
IRC:115-2014
ii)
Normalization of the deflections to correspond to a standard load of 40 kN
iii)
Collection of information about layer type and layer thicknesses
iv)
Backcalculation of pavement layer moduli from the normalized deflections
using an appropriate backcalculation software. Backcalculation will be done
by considering the pavement to be a three layer system. All bituminous layers
will be combined together. Similarly granular base and subbase layers may
be combined. For pavements with modified subgrades, the modified layer
may be treated as part of subgrade. Cemented subbases may be treated to
be part of granular layer.
For pavements with cemented base, unless the pavement is being evaluated
for
its remaining
life within a short period after construction, the cemented
layer may be treated as part of granular layer
v)
Adjustment of the bituminous layer modulus (backcalculated) to a standard
temperature
of 35°C
using
the
correction
factors
given
by
equations
4 and 5.
vi)
Adjustment of the subgrade and granular layer moduli to correspond to post-
monsoon condition using equations 6 to 9
vii)
Selection of
1 5'*^ percentile modulus (1 5% of the values will be less than this
value) of each of the three layers considered for analysis
viii)
Analysis of the in-service pavement using linear elastic layer theory with the
backcalculated (corrected) moduli and layer thicknesses collected from field
as inputs. This includes computation of critical Strains (a) Horizontal Tensile
Strain at the bottom fiber of bituminous layer and (b) Vertical Compressive
Strain on top of subgrade. The loading configuration and the locations of
critical
strains considered
for analysis
will be similar to those adopted
in
IRC:37-2012.
ix)
Estimation of the remaining life of the pavement using the fatigue in bituminous
layer and subgrade
rutting performance
criteria adopted
in IRC:37-2012
given by equations 16 and 17. The strain values obtained
in step
viii will be
used to estimate the remaining lives from fatigue and rutting consideration.
Remaining life of the pavement will be the shortest of the lives obtained from
bituminous layer fatigue, subgrade
rutting and cemented base fatigue
(in
case of pavements with cemented base) criteria.
x)
For design of bituminous overlay, a trial thickness of overlay of an appropriate
material has to be selected and the
critical strains have to be evaluated.
The modulus value
of the bituminous overlay
material may be selected
as per the guidelines given
in IRC:37-2012. Design overlay thickness can
be selected by
trial
in such a way that the computed
critical
strains are
less than the permissible
limits given by the performance
criteria
for the

traffic
level considered. A typical design example
is presented
in
Appendix-IV for better appreciation of the design approach. A format for
compiling the backcalculated moduli
is given as Appendix-V.

KGPBACK SOFTWARE FOR BACKCALCULATION
OF PAVEMENT LAYER MODULI
111.1
A number of softwares such as ELMOD, EVERCALC, BISDEF, NUS-BACK, MICH-
BACK, MODULUS, PADAL, etc. are available for the backcalculation of pavement layer moduli
from deflections measured using FWD. Some of these models use regression techniques for
estimation of one or more moduli. Most of the traditional methods follow iterative approaches
in which the moduli are varied
in each step and the computed and measured deflections
are compared. The
iterations continue
till
satisfactory matching between the known and
computed deflections
is attained. The methods differ mostly in the techniques used for the
successive selection of new set of modulus values. Other non-traditional techniques such as
artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms have also been used for backcalculation.
111.2
KGPBACK, a specific version of BACKGA program, which was developed for the
research scheme R-81 (2003)ofthe Ministry of RoadTransportand Highways, is recommended
in these guidelines for backcalculation. KGPBACK
is a Genetic Algorithm based model for
backcalculation of layer moduli. Because of the features of the search algorithm used
in
them, Genetic Algorithms (GA) have become popular as an optimization technique that has
the ability to solve complex problems. The early use of GAs for backcalculation of pavement
layer moduli was with the development of NUS-GABACK program by Fwa et al (1997).
It
was shown
that NUS-GABACK performed comparably well against other programs and
showed consistency
in the accuracy of the solutions. The other GA based backcalculation
method reported
in literature was the program developed by Kameyama et al (1998) for the
backcalculation of moduli of flexible and rigid pavements.
111. 3
GA
is
a
population based search and
optimization
technique.
It maintains
a
population of individual solutions that compete amongst themselves based on the Darwin's
survival of the fittest principle (Deb, 1995; Goldberg, 2000). Each individual solution (called
chromosome) in the GA population
is a finite length string code corresponding to a solution
to the given problem. Each individual has a fitness value associated with
it which
is some
measure of its closeness to the actual solution.
111.4
The population
is
initially generated randomly and the fitness of each individual
in the population
is calculated. Then the genetic operators are repeatedly applied
to this
population
until the desired solution
is found or specified number of iterations are over. A
typical GA uses three operators:
- reproduction or selection, crossover and mutation.
In
reproduction each
individual
in the population produces offsprings according to
its fitness
value. Thus, individuals with higher fitness contribute more offsprings in each generation.
In
crossover operation, two chromosome strings are randomly selected and their portions are
exchanged with a probability P^ to form new individual. The crossover point about which the
strings are exchanged
is also selected randomly.
In mutation operation, each bit in the string
is flipped according to the probability P^, which
is usually very small.
111.5
Crossover and mutation operations on the mating pool generate offsprings. Fitness
values are calculated for these offspring values. Ail these operations carried out sequentially
28

IRC:115-2014
to complete one generation. The algorithm will run
till the desired convergence is attained or
till the maximum number of generations stipulated. The solution with the highest fitness value
obtained in different generations is stored.
111. 6
Backcalculation using GAsdoes not require seed moduli. Only the lower and upper
domain bounds of the layer moduli (range of moduli) are required. Length of chromosome
used to represent the variable is based on the required accuracy of backcalculated values. A
chromosome length of '10' for each layer modulus
is generally adequate.
111.7
The GA parameters
such
as
population, maximum
number
of
generations,
probabilities of crossover and mutation are given as inputs to the program. Objective function
OBJ
is calculated from the calculated and measured deflection values. OBJ
is the sum of
squares of the
relative error
in
deflections (difference between computed
deflection and
measured deflection divided by measured deflection) for all the sensor positions. Fitness of
each solution set is evaluated using Equation
Fitness = 1/1 + OBJ
...
(III.1)
The solution with the best fitness obtained in different generations is stored and given as the
final output (backcalculated moduli) along with the corresponding fitness values.
111.8
Salient Features of KGPBACK
111.8.1
KGPBACK uses linear elastic layered theory for the analysis of pavements
in
its
forward calculation algorithm. ELAYER computer program (Reddy, 1993), which uses linear
elastic layered theory for the analysis of flexible pavements, was used as the forward calculation
routine.
It is recommended that the pavement be modeled as a three layer system. For this,
layers with similar stiffness can be grouped together. Rough interfaces (with
full bonding)
are assumed between layers. KGPBACK,
like most other backcalculation programs, does
not backcalculate Poisson's ratio and thicknesses. Typical values of Poisson's ratio values
are selected for the analysis as Poisson's ratio values (when chosen within practical range)
are not expected to have any significant influence on the deflections. Thicknesses must be
available from construction
records,
test
pit data, cores or non destructive determination
using techniques such as GPR.
111.8.2
Length of chromosome used to represent the variable
is based on the required
accuracy of backcalculated values.
In KGPBACK, the length of chromosome was taken as
the number of layers multiplied by
1 0, with each layer modulus being represented by a string
of length "10".
111. 8. 3
It is important that GA parameters such as population size, maximum number of
generations and probabilities of crossover and mutation, are selected
in an optimal way so
that the GA works satisfactorily for the given problem. Based on an extensive study conducted
for the determination of optimal GA parameters for typical three layer pavement systems, the
following GA parameters have been selected.

Ranges
of
different
layer moduli
are
to be
given as
input
to KGPBACK
for
backcalculation. These ranges are
to be selected judiciously by experienced pavement
engineering taking into consideration the approximate age of the pavement, visual assessment
of the condition of bituminous layers, climatic conditions prevailing at the time of deflection
measurements and any other information
available from
test
pits,
cores, DCP tests and
laboratory tests conducted,
if any. The following ranges of moduli are recommended
for
different layers for carrying out backcalculation using KGPBACK.
Subgrade Modulus
i)
If no information
is available about subgrade
20 to 100 MPa
ii)
If an estimate of in-situ CBR of subgrade can be obtained from DCP tests,
classification of soil, laboratory CBR test, etc., the range of subgrade moduli
can be taken as 5*CBR to 20*CBR. Estimation of subgrade modulus range
can also be made using the average of the surface deflections measured at
radial distances of 1200 mm, 1500 mm and 1800 mm
(if available) using the
following expression.
Esu.„ade(MPa) = (1-uTP/(3.14*r*w)
.
...
(III.2)
where,
P =
total load (N) which can be calculated from applied load and radius of
load contact area,
r = average of radial distances (example 1200 mm,
1500 mm and 1800 mm),
|j = Poisson's ratio of subgrade and w (mm)
= average of surface deflections measured at 1200 mm, 1500 mm and
1800 mm
(if available) radial distances.
The subgrade modulus estimated from the above methods can be used
to narrow the range of moduli
to be used
in the backcalculation process
which can improve the accuracy of the remaining backcalculated moduli.
Experience of backcalculation of subgrade modulus from deflection bowls
measured on Indian highways suggests that the backcalculated values are
20% more compared to the values estimated using Equation
III. 2. Hence,
it
is recommended that the lower bound value for subgrade modulus may be
taken as 1.2*(modulus from Eq lll.2)*0.8 and the upper bound value can be
1.2*(modulusfrom Eq lll.2)*1.2.
Granular Layers (combined)
100 to 500 MPa

750 MPa to 3000 MPa

Selecting 15*^ Percentile moduli for the purpose of design, the design moduli
of in-service layers are
:- 1112, 173, 44.3 MPa respectively for bituminous,
granular and subgrade layers
The
in-service three layer pavement system has been analysed with the
above corrected moduli values. Standard dual wheel load of 20 kN on each
wheel has been considered
for analysis. Contact pressure of 0.56 MPa,
spacing between dual wheels of 310 mm, Poisson's ratios of 0.5, 0.4 and 04
for the three layers starting from the top are the other inputs used. Tensile
strain at the bottom of bituminous layer = 284.5 microstrains; Vertical strain
on top of subgrade = 439.6 microstrains
Remaining fatigue
life of the pavement obtained using Equation 16
is 11.07
msa whereas the remaining rutting life as obtained from Equation 17 is 233.7
msa. The existing pavement is inadequate to carry the design
1 00 msa traffic
from fatigue consideration
Selection of overlay thickness:
The combination of existing pavement and overlay
will be analysed as a
four-layer system
to ensure that fatigue and
rutting
criteria are
satisfied
for the assumed design
traffic.
Trial overiay thicknesses are selected and
maximum tensile strain at the bottom of the existing bituminous layer has
been computed using the thicknesses and moduli of various layers as inputs.
Analysis of the pavement with a Bituminous Concrete overiay (with VG-30
binder) of 95 mm thickness yields a tensile strain of 159.8 microstrain and
208.3 vertical subgrade strain. Elastic modulus value of BC mix has been
taken as 1695 MPa.
The following inputs are considered for calculation of critical strains, tensile
strain
at the bottom of total bituminous layer and
vertical strain on top of
subgrade
Layer thicknesses considered are
:- 95, 170, 575 mm
Elastic Moduli used are
:- 1695, 1112, 173, 44.3 MPa
Poisson's ratio values used in analysis are
:- 0.5, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4
The fatigue
life for this overiaid pavement will be 104.4 msa and rutting
life
will be 690.5 msa. Hence, design overiay thickness is 95 mm of Bituminous
Concrete with VG-30 binder.
