FOREWORD
It is well known that a fully developed
system of rural roads
serving
the
vast areas of the country is an essential infrastructural
facility for
rapid
socio-economic
development
of
the
country.
The
Governments
both
at the Centre and in the States have been
earmarking sizeable outlays for rural roads in the Five-Year
Plans
and this is expected to be stepped up further in the future Plans.
For
the
effective
and
efficient
deployment
of large public
funds on rural roads,
it
is
necessary
that
there
should
be
well
thought
out
guidelines on the
planning,
design, construction and
maintenance aspects. For this
purpose, the Indian Roads Congress
organised Regional Workshops on
Rural Road
Development
in
the
four
regions
of
the
country,
at
Gandhinagar
(Gujarat)
in
February
1981,
at
Nainital (U.P.) in July 1981, at Ranchi (Bihar)
in May
1982
and
at Hyderabad
(A.P.)
in November 1982. A
number of useful recommendations for application
by
the
autho-
rities concerned with rural road development emerged from
these
Workshops.
This
publication
contains
the
consolidated summary of the
discussions and recommendations made
at
the
above
mentioned
Workshops,
besides supplementary notes
on the different
aspects,
for
better
understanding and
ready reference
for
easier
appli-
cation of the recommendations in actual practice.
At
its meeting
held
at New
Delhi on 21.3.1983, the Rural
Roads
Committee
agreed
that
a
suitable
Special Publication to
serve as guidelines relating to rural roads
should
be
brought
out
incorporating
the
recommendations
of the four Regional Work-
shops
with
suitable
notes
concerning
planning,
construction,
maintenance,
quality
control,
etc.
At
the
said
meeting,
the
Committee
also approved a format for the proposed publication.
Initial
draft
for
this
publication
was
prepared by Shri K.
Arunachalam,
Deputy
Secretary,
Indian
Roads
Congress. This



======================================================================

======================================================================
was approved by the
Rural
Roads
Committee
in
their
meeting
held
at New Delhi on the 3rd December, 1983 and as
desired by
that Committee,
it was further reviewed by Dr. Bansilal, Member-
Secretary of the Committee under the guidance of Dr.
M.P.
Dhir,
Director, CRRI
and
processed
by
Shri Ninan Koshi, Secretary,
IRC and Shri P.C. Bhasin, Adviser, Indian Roads Congress for
its
final
printing
as
a
Special
Publication
of
the
Indian
Roads
Congress.
The Committee held the view that the existing manual,
namely. Manual on
'Route
Location, Design,
Construction and
Maintenance of Rural Roads' (IRCrSP 20-1979)
would
require
to
be
revised and expanded in the light of the guidelines and recom-
mendations
contained
in
the
present
publication
and
that this
work should be taken up in due course.
The
Indian
Roads
Congress
thanks
the
Governments
of
Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar
and
Andhra
Pradesh
for
hosting
the Regional Workshops and all the Engineers, Scientists and other
experts for
their active participation in these Workshops and
their
contribution besides Shri
S. Adaviyappa, Convenor, Rural Roads
Committee for ably guiding
the
deliberations
of
the
Workshops
and
the
Rural
Roads
Committee
which
has
greatly
helped in
bringing out this publication.

INTRODUCTION
1.1.
For a country
with agrarian economy like India, where
about 80 per
cent
of the population
lives
in 5.76
lakh villages, a
system of
roads well
serving
the
rural areas
is a basic require-
ment for social justice, national integration,
breaking the isolation
~
of the village
communities
and for the
integrated rural develop-
ment to
quicken
its pace.
Thus rural
roads
provide one of the
basic infrastructure
for achieving
the objective of integrated rural
development.
In the
hierarchy of
road
system
in the
country,
rural roads include Other
District
Roads
(ODR's)
and
Village
Roads (VR's) which have the following functions
:
(i) Other District Rmds — These
are roads
serving
the rural areas of
production and providing them with outlet to
market centres, bJock
development, taliika/tehsii headquarters or main roads.
(ii) Village Roads — These
are
roads connecting villages and group of
villages with each other or to the market centres and with the nearest
road of a higher category.
1.2.
Soon after
Independence,
the
country
embarked on
development
of
rural
roads,
and
sizeable
road
lengths were
constructed under programmes like the National Extension Scheme
.
of Community
Development.
There
have also
been a number
of other schemes
like the crash
scheme
for
rural
employment,
and the various
other
special
funds
for
rural
roads.
Having
regard to the experience
of earlier
efforts since 1947, a
National
Programme of Minimum Needs was
introduced
during the Fifth
Plan (1974-79) envisaging the allocation of larger
resources for the
social consumption of all areas in the
country,
the objective being
to establish a network of
essential
services on a
coordinated and
integrated basis, given
certain
pre-determined
criteria
of
unifor-
mity
and
equality.
Rural
roads
had
been
accorded their due
place in the
Minimaim
Needs
Programme, the objective being to
link all
villages with a
population of
1,500 and
above with all-
weather roads by the end of Fifth Plan.
In hilly,
tribal or coastal
areas where population is
relatively
dispersed, the idea v/as to go
by a cluster of villages of the like
size.
However,
due to paucity
of resources, this objective could not be fulfilled.



======================================================================

======================================================================

1.3.
According to the
national guidelines
for the Sixth Plan
(1980-85), all villages with a population of 1,500 and above, and 50
per cent of villages with population between 1,000 and 1,500 are to
be linked with roads by the year
1990.
Fifty per cent of the total
number of villages required to be so covered have
to be connected
by the year 1985.
An
appraisal
by
the
Rural
Roads
Working
Group of the National Transport
Policy
Committee
showed that
by March, 1978, only
about
29 per
cent of the
villages had all-
weather road connections while another
16 per cent of the villages
had
fair-weather
access roads.
The
Group
estimated
that for
giving
all-weather
access
to all
the villages,
it would require the
construction /improvement
of
8
lakh km
of roads
at
a
cost
of
Rs 11,000 crores (1978-79 price level).
1.4.
The task is
stupenduous and
requires concerted
effort
from all concerned, such
as policy
makers, planners, and design/
construction/maintenance
engineers.
The
effort
will have to be
directed towards achieving the following broad objectives:
(i) Development of an optimum rural road network
which will serve the
maximum
population
per
unit
length
and
at the same time get
integrated with the main road network.
(ii) The roads should be designed not only for
immediate
requirements
but also with a view to providing for future needs within
foreseeable
future.
From this
angle, the
initial design
should make adequate
provisions in respect of basic elements like
road land width, geomet-
ries, water crossings, drainage,
protective
works, etc. so that it may
be possible to
upgrade
the
roads to a
higher specification without
involving any appreciable wastage.
(iii) Rural
road
construction
should
imbibe
the
advancements
in
science and
technology, and
executed
with
full knowledge of the
properties and behaviour of road building materials with a
view
to
keeping
construction
costs
as
low
as
possible consistent with the
requirements of traffic and environment.
This includes
bringing
in
all
quality
consciousness and
control
measures
at each stage
of
construction
so that the
roads
constructed
are
durable and
offer
satisfactory service to the users.
(iv) There
should
be
a
constant
endeavour
in
using locally available
materials
to
the
maximum
extent
feasible.
This
includes
the
improvement
of engineering properties of local soils and other low
grade materials through appropriate stabilisation techniques.

roads
to
preserve
the
investments already
made on them so as
to

Regional Workshops on Rural Road Development
The Indian Roads Congress organised Regional Workshops on
rural road development in the four regions
of the
country.
The
main
objective
of these
Workshops was to identify the problems
faced and methodologies adopted at the state level by pooling
the
combined
experience in the light of local problems, organizational
set-up and
financial
limitations
so
as
to
evolve suitable recom-
mended practices for planning, design, construction
and
mainten-
ance
of rural roads.
The Workshops were held
at
Gandhinagar
(Gujarat) in February, 1981, in Nainital in July, 1981, in Ranchi in
May, 1982 and in Hyderabad
in November,
1982.
For
pointed
attention on
individual
aspects,
discussions
at these
Workshops
were held under four themes, namely,
(i) Planning and investment
criteria and organizational aspects
of rural
roads,
(ii)
Pavement
aspects
of rural roads and low-cost water crossings,
(iii) Construc-
tion techniques of rural roads, and (iv) Maintenance of rural roads.
These Workshops had
been
highly
useful
in
understanding
the
current practices being followed in the various states, the problems
faced
by
them and in finding ways and means for
improving
the
situation and imbibing better technology for optimum
benefit.
A
number
of
useful
recommendations
for direct application by the
authorities concerned with rural road development in the
country
emerged
from
these Workshops.
A consolidated summary of the
discussions and recommendations made
at
these Workshops and
prepared
by
the
subcommittee
under
the
Convenorship of Shri
T.K. Natarajan of CRRI and approved by the main Committee (the
personnel
given
below) in
their meeting held on the
21st
March
1983 is given in Section 2 of this publication.

Supplementary Notes
For
better
understanding and
ready
reference
for
easier
application of the recommendations, supplementary
notes
on
the
different aspects have been included in Section Siof this publication.
The
information
provided
reflects
the
current
state-of-art
and
better
engineering
practices.
These,
however, are not static and
will require to be reviewed and improved upon from time to
time
in
the light of the information flowing from research and develop-
ment studies, and feed-back from
user
organizations.
One
such
study in progress under the auspices of the Indian Roads Congress
is the socio-economic study of rural roads in nine
districts
of the
country.
1.7.
Fair-Weather and All-Weather Roads
It
will
be
desirable
that
rural
roads are constructed with
such surfacings and high level cross-drainage facilities so that these
d.e usable by traffic round the year in all the climatic seasons with-
out any interruption. However, in general, provision of such design
features will be too expensive and are neither necessary
nor
feasi-
ble
for
majority of rural roads which are expected to carry only a
low
volume
of
traffic.
Interruptions
for
short
period
should,
therefore, be tolerated and not considered to affect the all-weather
characteristics
of the
road.
Overflow
of
water at the low level
cross drainage structures, or the road becoming slushy and
impass-
able
because of rains are the major causes interrupting traffic
flow
on the road.
Thus the type of pavement surfacing related to
rain-



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 118
======================================================================
7
fall,
and the period of overflow or interruption at the cross
drain-
age
structures
are
the
governing
characteristics
determining
whether a road is of all-weather or fair-weather
type.
From
the
above
considerations, the following attributes are suggested as far
as rural roads are concerned
:
All-weather roads—
At
cross
drainage structures, the duration of over-
flow or interruption at one stretch does not exceed 12 houis
for ODR's
and 24 hours for VR's in hilly terrain, and 3 days in the case of roads in
plains.
The
total
period
of
interruption
during
the
year should not
exceed 10 days for ODR's and 15 days for VR's.
The pavement
should
consist
of
metalling (WBM)
or higher type where rainfall is more than
150 cm/year and should atleast be of material better than local soil, such
as moorum gravel, kankar, laterite, etc. where the rainfall is less than 150
cm/year.
Fair-weather roads—
Roads
not
satisfying
the minimum
requirement
specified above for all-weather roads.
These roads should be taken to be
in
a
stage
of development to be improved subsequently for conversion
into all-weather type.
1.8.
Activities Involved in Rural Road Development
Construction and operation of a rural road involves a number
of
activities,
some
running
concurrently
and
others
follov/ing
in close sequence. Important among these are
:
(i) Planning
- for
determining
the
route, i.e., the villages or points the
road has to connect.
(ii) Field
surveys
- for fixing the
alignment
in
light
of topographical
features, construction convenience, overall economy
etc.
(iii) Investigation - for the availability
and
suitability
of construction
materials; hydraulic and foundation
investigations for
water
cross-
ings; investigations for the design of pavement and drainage facilities;
etc.
(iv) Design - Geometric design
of
the
road which fixes
the horizontal
alignment, the vertical profile and the cross-section in
line
with
the
geometric
design standards; determination of the type and thickness
of
pavement
and
the
appropriate
material/composition
of
the
different pavement courses in light of the locally
available
materials
and
needs
of traffic/environment;
design of side drains (also catch
water drains in hilly areas) and disposal of surface
water
at
natural
outfalls;
design
of
cross
drainage
structures;
design
of retaining/
breast walls/pitching and other protection works; etc.
(v) Specifications — Specifications
for
the
construction of the various
components
of the
road.
This
will
generally
follow
the depart-

mental/IRC specification
modified
as
necessary
to
suit
the
local
materials,
and available equipment and skills. The specification will
lay down the lim.ts for material properties, the methods of construc-
tion, the equipment to be used and the quality
requirements
of
the
final product.
(vi) Construction and quality control— Construction
is the process of the
translating
the
designs
and
drawings
on
to
the ground closely
following the specifications
and
ensuring
the achievement
of the
stipulated quality standards.
(vji) Maintenance — The Maintenance phase
starts on the completion of
the construction activities and opening the road
to
traffic.
In
this
phase,
the
activities
are
directed
towards
achievement
of
the
objectives, namely, to make-up the damages to
the
road
in
service
caused
by
traffic and environmental factors and to maintain
it at
a
desired
level
of
serviceability, and
to
preserve
the
investments
already made on the road.

The guidelines
on
all the above activities can
be

''Manual
on
Route
Location, Design, Construction and Maintenance of Rural Roads".
These however, are not static and would require to be reviewed as
more and more experience
is generated in the coming
years.
For
this purpose,
it is suggested that the departments involved
in
the
development of rural roads document their
experiences
and
pass
on
the
information
to
the
Indian Roads Congress so that
these
guidelines could be improved from
time
to
time
in
the
coming
years.

CONSOLIDATED SUMMARY OF DISCUSSIONS AND RECO-
MMENDATIONS OF THE FOUR REGIONAL WORKSHOPS
ON RURAL ROAD DEVELOPMENT
2.1.
Planning and Investment Criteria and Organizational
Aspects of Rural Roads
2.1.1. Existing practices
(1) While planning
for rural
roads,
priorities
are assigned
keeping in view the criteria laid
down
for
these
roads under the
'Minimum
Needs
Programm.e' by the
Planning Commission that
viz.,
all villages with population of 1500 and above and also about
50 per cent of the villages in the
population
group
of 1000-1500
should be connected
with ^11-weather
roads.
Some of the
states
like
Punjab and
Haryana had gone far ahead of these norms and
achieved higher levels of accessibility.
On the other hand, some of
the states of the North Eastern
and the
Southern regions brought
out that it was not possible and certainly not fair to adhere to these
norms
particularly
in hilly
areas
because
of the pecularities of
location and the scattered nature of the settlements.
(2) Consideration
depending on
needs is given by the states
for providing
road
links to
tehsils,
education
centres,
railway
stations, health care
centres, water
resources, milk collection cen-
tres and
other
growth
centres in
order to
maximise
the socio-
economic benefits accruing to these areas.
(3) Special
consideration
is also
given
to the
provision of
road links in tribal areas
and in areas
inhabited
by
the weaker
sections of the society,
(4) In
hill
areas of
the
northern
region,
the
number of
villages with population of
1000
and
above
being
comparatively
small, states like Himachal Pradesh follow the system of developing
major valley
roads
where
bulk of
population
reside and inter-
valley roads
covering a
number of villages and hamlets enroute.
Link roads are then
provided
from
this
system
to
sub-valleys
covering production and horticulture belts.



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 118
======================================================================
(5) In remote and high
altitude
areas the possibility of pro-
viding aerial cable-ways is also
explored
as an
alternative to link
roads, particularly
where problems
of soil erosion
are acute and
ecological disturbance can possibly prove
deterimental.
(6) The
principles
of
planning
laid
down
in the 20-year
road
plan
(1961-81)
has
provided
major
guidance
in
the
past.
(7) Some of the states have formulated Master Plans for rural
road development, but the criteria vary somewhat from state to state.
While some states adopt
an
integrated area development appro-
ach in planning the road network,
others
take
into
account
the
population size of villages and logal opinion.
The
planning
hori-
zon varies from 5 to 20 years.
Some states take up
updating
the
Master Plans on an yearly basis.
(8) In most of the states, the task of connecting villages
with
rural roads is very heavy in relation to the plan allocations. More-
over,
an equitable share of the National
Rural Employment Pro-
gramme funds is not being made available for rural roads.
(9) On account of resource
constraints, many states take up
rural road construction in stages, earth
formation in
the first stage
cross-drainage in the second stage, and
metalling
and
black-top-
ping in the third stage.
On account of
resource
constraints, some
states do not go in for the third stage of black-topping at all except
in special cases of heavy
rainfall
areas or where funds are provi-
ded by International lending agencies.
(10) For funding rural
road
construction,
some states have
raised special funds through a cess on agricultural produce.
(11) The present organisational system for the construction and
maintenance of rural roads varies from state to state.
While some
states
have
exclusive
organisations
within
the P.W.D.
itself or
under the Panchayati Raj Department for looking after rural roads,
some
others
have
multiple
agencies.
However,
agencies like
Blocks and
Panchayats, in
general, do not have
adequate equip-
ment,
technical know-how
and
properly
trained
supervisory
staff.



======================================================================

======================================================================

(12) Some
states
have set up
state
level and district level
committees
to take care of coordination and other related
aspects
for rural roads to ensure planned construction according to proper
norms.
2.1.2.
Deficiencies in
existing practices
(1) Inasmuch
as
the
population size of
villages constitutes
the main criterion in the present planning process, thinly populated
areas, like hilly
areas,
coastal areas and tribal areas despite their
economic potential
and
social needs
tend to suffer unduly.
This
has to be looked at in
the
context that roads form the only mode
of communication in these areas.
(2) For hill areas, the existing norms do not provide for
suffi-
cient attention being paid to the
requirements
of improving
acces-
sibility to the villages and
hamlets which
are situated at different
altitudes and are thinly populated
and
scattered.
The
need for
the provision of
jeepable
roads,
mule paths and foot bridges in
remote areas
in hill
regions also requires
recognition
and consi-
deration.
(3) Since
the road
length
involved and
the related cost of
construction
are not
fully taken
into account, small size villages
not getting covered under the
present norms based on population
get neglected even though
they may be
requiring only short con-
necting links.
(4) The much needed existing
inventories as also perspective
developmental plans in the
other sectors
of the economy for each
block/tehsil/taluka
are
not
generally
available
with
the result
that
it has not been possible to prepare proper Master Plans.
(5) In the absence of proper Master
Plans, application of the
population criteria has resulted in the development of parallel road
systems in a number of cases.
(6) Some of the
rural
roads have
started
attracting heavy
traffic and are
in dire
need of
improvement.
This has however
not been possible because of difficulties in acquiring additional land
for improving cross-section and geometries.



======================================================================

======================================================================
14
(7) Due to the multiplicity of agencies
handling programmes
of rural road
works
and the
lack
of coordination among them,
rural road development and
maintenance suffer both
qualitatively
and quantitatively.
(8) Because of
the
lack of the needed equipment,
technical
know-hov^ and properly
trained supervisory stalf with Blocks and
Panchayats, the roads constructed or
maintained by them are not
upto the standards and in some cases have to be
abandoned when
taken over by State PWDs or REOs.
Similarly, roads constructed
by PWDs but
handed over to
Panchayats for
maintenance have
been found to suffer from want of proper upkeep.
2.1.3.
Recommendatioiis
(1) Rural roads being one of the key infrastructures for rural
development,
it is
necessary
to take a good
look at
the current
planning
methodology
and priority
principles
prevailing
in the
different
states in the
country
for both short-term and long-term
periods.
(2) All
states should
draw up
Master
Plan for rural roads
at the district level covering a
time
horizon of 15 to 20 years.
In
the preparation of
long term
Master
Plans
for
rural
roads at
district/takika
or
block
levels,
both
social
and
economic
needs should be kept in view.
In this
context, special considerat-
ion should be given to the follo^/ing aspects
:
(i) Inter-sectoral development needs,
(ii) Location and
dispersal
pattern of
villages of
different population
groups,
(iii) Co-ordination of growth
centres
with
other basic minimum social
needs like schools, primary health centres, markets, etc.;
(iv) Needs of areas producing
perishable goods
such as fruits, milk, sea-
food, etc.;
(v) Administrative needs.
(3) Some mechanism
to ensure
citizen
participation
in the
planning
should
be
evolved.
Some
States
have set up District
planning committees/councils which include people's representatives
in each district.
This opproach which will pave the way for effec-



======================================================================
PAGE 27 of 118
======================================================================
15
tive implementations of the rural road programme is worth emulat-
ing by other states as well.
(4) Roads required
for meeting
the special needs of a given
region
such
as for
hill
areas, desert areas, command areas and
tribal area, development should be given
special
emphasis
in
the
planning strategy.
Immediate
assessment of existing and planned
potential of these areas is called for.
(5)
In the planning process, while overall
national guidelines
of providing
all-weather
access
roads to villages with population
of 1500 and
above and 50 per cent of villages with size 1000-1500
may be kept in view, decisions
concerning
priority
would
vary
from state to state
taking into account
the conditions prevailing in
each state and the need to reduce regional imbalances. Investment
priority criteria
such as
maximum
population
per unit length of
road, maximum cultivated
land area
per unit length
of road also
merit consideration in the context of rural road planning.
(6) Socio-economic
impact
study
of rural
roads at district
level is in
progress in nine districts
spread throughout the country
with a view to developing
mathematical
models for planning and
prioritisation of
rural
road
network.
In
the
meantime,
each
state should
evolve a priority
ranking
procedure for
connecting
of villages with rural roads in a phased manner taking into account
weightages
for
parameters
like
population, length or density of
roads, irrigated area, per capita
income,
unit cost of construction
and financial
investments involved in
optimal rural road network
and existing/planned
market
centres, school,
medical and trans-
port facility.
Testing
the
validity of
the
priority
criteria
thus
developed
is very
important
so that
adjustments,
if necessary,
could be done in the weightages for various
factors.
In the mean-
tim.e, the following broad range of distribution of available outlays
for rural roads may be adopted
:
(a)
Linking
villages with population
per cent
of 1500 and above
60—80
(b)
Linking villages with population of
1000—1500
10—20
(c)
Rural roads in command areas having agricultural/
dairy
development,
for
exploitation of mineral
resources,
and in other
backward
areas
unless
these
requirements are
supplemented
by
the
respective sectors
10— 15



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 118
======================================================================
16
(d)
Linking villages of population less than
1000, and
villages that could be connected through short links
at nominal cost
10—15
(7) In order
to provide for wider service to rural
areas and
in view of the energy crisis, black-topping of rural roads should be
taken up only selectively and judiciously
where traffic,
local area
needs and climatic conditions so justify.
(8) Provision of stream crossings and
foot-bridges in remote
areas should receive due priority attention in the planning exercise
on a priority basis so that all-weather negotiability is improved.
(9) Where stage construction policy is adopted,
it is necessary
to ensure timely
availability of funds for
the subsequent stages as
also proper maintenance in the meantime.
(10) Since
the requirement of funds to improve the
accessi-
bility of villages with roads is
very heavy, it
will be useful for the
state to m.obilise
additional
resources.
Creating special schemes
by levy on agricultural produce, such as Market Committee Funds
and transfer of such funds
for use in
road
construction/mainten-
ance programmes could be considered.
Agro
industries like sug-
arcane factories could be
encouraged
to pool resources to const-
ruct their own roads which could be
allowed to be maintained by
them.
This
will
give a
sense
of involvement to such intensive
road users, and this will also encourage them to maintain the roads
in good order for reducing the transportation costs.
(11)
In situations where the
rural roads are primarily meant
to meet the needs of some particular
industry/organisation or pro-
ject, the concerned
beneficiaries should bear or contribute towards
construction/maintenance of these roads.
(12) While
planning
for rural
roads,
their
requirements
should be considered
in an
integrated fashion with those of road
transport.
Animal-drawn
vehicles will
continue to be an impor-
tant mode for farm to market movement in many areas.
However,
it is necessary to undertake a
critical
study into the kind of rural
transport
vehicles
for
both goods
and passengers that will meet
the
requirements
anticipated
in
the
different
regions
of the
country.



======================================================================

======================================================================
17
(13) Roads
through
the heart of residential areas of villages
and towns increase traffic hazards and c ause congestion and delay.
Where a serious problem of this nature
is feared,
it will
be
advis-
able
to
byepass
the
built-up area staying well clear of the limits
upto which the town or village is anticipated to grow in the foresee-
able
future
unless
the road in question is to terminate in the con-
cerned village/town.
(14)
It
is
necessary
that
the
requirement
of geometries is
given adequate attention at the construction stage
itself so
that
it
does
not
become a problem when the road has to be improved at
a later stage.
The geometric design
standards
prescribed should,
therefore,
be
adhered
to
except in difficult cases such as those in
remote and backward areas (where the traffic intensity will be very
light
of the order of 2-3 veh./day) where some relaxation could be
considered.
It is also necessary that adequate
land
widths
com-
mensurate
with
the
needs
should be procured at the initial stage
itself.
(15) While
expansion of the rural road network continues,
it
is advisable to give attention to safety
aspects
including
provision
of road
signs,
well
designed
speed
breakers
where they are so
justified
and
reduction
in
overloading
of public vehicles such as
tempos, matador vans etc.
(16) The programmes
for
construction and
maintenace
of
rural roads should be handled by a unified and a technically
com-
petent engineering organisation in each state.
It is also necessary to
create/set up a planning and monitoring cell
for
the
collection of
all
data
and
for
the
co-ordination of programmes with different
agencies so that efforts in the
rural
roads
development
are
duly
integrated and a periodical review of achievements and evolving of
remedial measures
is possible.
(17) At
present
funds
for rural roads are being channelised
through different agencies and as
such
no
proper
accounting
or
monitoring is possible for ensuring that investments are being made
in
creating
durable
and
properly
designed
assets in the form of
rural roads.
It would be better if all the funds are controlled in a
state by a single agency looking after rural road works.



======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 118
======================================================================
18
(18) Necessary arrangements for the systematic training of the
staff engaged on rural road works should be made.
(19) The setting up of a Rural Road Commission at the centre
as well as Rural Road Commission in each state may be given
due
consideration as they are intended
to
co-ordinate
and
channelise
the
working
of the
multiple
organisations into purposeful effort.
The Planning Commission should give
due
consideration
to
this
important recommendation.
2.2.
Pavement
Aspects
of
Rural
Roads
and Low
Cost Water
Crossings
2.2.1.
Existing practices
(1) The
existing
practices for the design of rural road pave-
ments are mostly based on ad hoc designs specified
for
broad
sub-
grade
soil
types
especially
for
the
less important village roads.
For the more important rural roads, the CBR method of
design
is
sometimes
used,
adopting
curve 'B' of the pavement design chart
recommended by the IRC.
Barring the arid zones
of
Rajasthan,
the CBR
of subgrade
soil
is evaluated under 4-day soaked con-
dition, the sample having been compacted to Proctor density in the
laboratory
even
though
the
density achieved in the field may be
far less.
(2) Although there is an increasing awareness of the need for
the
utilisation
of
locally
available
materials
like
gravels and
moorums, the tendency
towards
specifying
hard
stone
metal
in
base courses still persists even when other good quality construction
materials are available locally.
(3)
In
the
traffic
parameter,
even if the solid-wheel animal-
drawn cart traffic constituted a significant part of the total traflSc,
it
is not taken into consideration for design purposes.
(4)
It
has
been the experience that traffic increases manifold
sharply after the road has been built.
(5) In
regard to the water crossings, many of rural roads are
still fair weather roads since enough
funds
are
not
available
for
providing
all
the
needed
cross
drainage
works.
R.C.C.

pipes of NP2
grade
are
adopted
for
culverts.
Paved
dips
and
cement
concrete
carriageways
are
employed
for
medium size
shallow river crossings.
Locally available
materials
like
timber,
stone
slabs,
dry
stone
masonry,
stone in cement mortar are also
utilised to the extent possible.
2.2.2.
Deficiencies in existing practices
(1) Although
it
is
generally
realised
that the use of locally
available soils, gravels, moorums and aggregates should
be
maxi-
mised,
such
materials
are
not actually being incorporated in the
designs for lack of data on
the
location
and
properties
of these
materials,
lack
of
facilities
for testing these materials and lack of
trained personnel.
(2) Some
of
the states face the problem of durability of non-
bituminised pavements in the context of high
rainfall
and
terrain
conditions
obtaining
in
those
states
since funds available do not
permit black topping.
(3) The
absence
of
guidelines and type designs for bringing
about the much needed economy in design and for
promoting
the
use
of locally available materials for low cost water crossings, are
sorely felt.
2.2.3.
Recommendations
(1) Any ad hoc approach in pavement designs for rural roads
should be totally discouraged.
If at all,
it should be restricted
to
only
a
few
extreme cases where the traffic, both present and pro-
jected, is low
and
cannot
be
substantiated
with
any
degree
of
reliability,
like
in
the
case of village roads in remote areas inter-
linking only very small villages and hamlets.
(2) For ODRs
and other Village Roads where traffic can be
meaningfully anticipated, like the roads connecting big
villages
to
market-centres
etc.,
the pavement crust and composition require-
ments should be scientifically worked out.
These
designs
should
be based on proper material surveys and other field and laboratory
pre-investigations.
The
related
infrastructure
for
such
pre-
investigations must be provided.
There is need to carry out a base
line
survey
of all avilable materials and soils for road building on



======================================================================
PAGE 32 of 118
======================================================================
20
a district-wise basis and their properties analysed, so
that
a form
of data bank is available for ready use of highway engineers.
(3) The pavement design procedure evolved by CRRI should
be given a fair trial by constructing a few
roads
designed
by
the
proposed
method.
A
small
proportion,
say
10 per cent of the
rural road length planned to be constructed in the coming year
in
each
of the states, should be set apart for design and construction
following the methodology as
proposed
by CRRI.
The
perfor-
mance
of roads
constructed by such procedures should be moni-
tored by CRRI.
(4) Use
of
locally
available
materials
and
adoption
of
mechanically stabilised soils should be incorporated in pilot studies
and their performance suitably monitored.
(5) All
permanent
bridges on
rural roads may be designed
only for IRC class A loading and should
mostly be
of single lane
width (4.25 metre).
For
pipe
culverts, NP2 R.C.C.
pipes should
suffice.
For
all
cross-drainage
works,
the
use
of lime mortar
can be resorted to.
As far as
possible, masonry arch type of con-
struction should be
adopted
for
cross-drainage
structures using
lime mortar.
The use of economical locally available materials like
timber, bamboo and stone slabs etc. should be maximised.
(6) The States should forward to the Indian Roads Congress,
information about the various types of low
cost
water-crossings
in
use, suggestions for further improvements,
etc.
so that a
compr-
ehensive Publication for the
guidance of
the Highway
Engineers
could be brought out.
(7) The terms 'Fair-weather' and 'All-weather
roads' should
be defined in
the context
of low cost
water-crossings keeping
in
view the fact that stoppage of traffic for short durations a few times
during the rainy season should be
tolerated in view of the scarcity
of resources for rural roads.
2.3.
Construcion Techniques of Rural Roads
2.3.1.
Existing practices
(1) Compaction
of
earthwork
for
rural
roads
generally
follows two patterns
: (a) where the road is built to the first stage of



======================================================================
PAGE 33 of 118
======================================================================
21
earth or gravel/moorum surface,
compaction
is
generally done by
hand rammers or
manually
drawn rollers; (b)
where the road
is
provided
with
metalling or
black-topping,
it is
done by
power
rollers.
Compaction is
not
receiving proper
attention on roads
built by agencies other than R.E.Os or State P.W.Ds.
(2) Time of doing
the earthwork
acquires
significance from
the view point of availability of water for compaction.
(3) In black cotton soil
areas, a capillary
cut-off comprising
a
layer of sand or
moorum or
any other
suitable granular mate-
rial
is provided.
(4) The practice of providing black-topping
varies from state
to state depending on
climatic and
terrain conditions, availability
of funds,
importance
of the
road
and availability of the needed
materials and
equipment.
There is
neither
uniformity nor laid-
down criteria for black-topping these roads.
(5) Rural road works are taken up under various programme
by a number of organisations in the
same state.
Depending upon
the technical expertise and equipment
available, the standard.and
techniques of construction vary from totally
labour-intensive tech-
nology to the use of
regular
equipment
for earthwork and pave-
ment compaction as also
laying
of bituminous
surfacing.
In the
case of roads
constructed by Village
Panchayats,
Zilla Parishads
or Block Development
Organisations,
no quality control and ade-
quate specifications are being ensured.
(6) Locally
available
moorum,
gravel and
aggregates are
finding increasing application in
pavement
construction.
Mecha-
nical soil
stabilisation
is adopted
to some
extent in some of the
states.
The works are generally carried out either departmentally,
through contractors or cooperative societies.
(7) There
is awareness of the need for the provision
of catch-
water
drains and side drains
for disposal
of surface water,
parti-
cularly for roads
in hills.
It is felt that
this provision contributes
to better
serviceability
of
pavements
and
stability
of foundat-
ion.
(8) There is
all-round
appreciation
for
bringing
in better



======================================================================
PAGE 34 of 118
======================================================================
11
quality control measures in
construction,
since
roads constructed
now would constitute the main
feeder roads of tomorrow and
in
any case public assets must be made durable.
2.3.2.
Deficiencies in existing practices
(1) Compaction of earthwork leaves much to be desired, and
as a consequence
damages in the form
of excessive
deformation,
shear failure, etc., frequently occur.
(2) Power driven rollers
and other
equipment are generally
not available in adequate
numbers.
Difficulties
are also experie-
nced in transporting such
machinery to
the
dispersed rural road
work sites.
(3)
Soil stabilisation techniques require
trained and qualified
personnel who are not readily available in many cases.
(4) Due to lack of testing facilities
by way of equipment and
trained staff, quality of the construction work suffers.
(5) There
is
no co-ordination
of work
between
the works
undertaken
under the
National
Rural Employment Programme
with the normal
rural road
works taken
up under the Minimum
Needs Programme or through
other state resources by construction
agencies.
2 3.3.
Recommendations
(1) The Rural road construction
programmes should by and
large be labour
intensive.
However,
in certain important phases
of
work,
where
quality
control
is
of
paramount
significance,
the use of road-making machinery may be resorted to.
(2) There should be a
regular
system of monitoring in the
use of road making
machinery so as to
maximise their output and
utilisation.
Also,
the requirements
of road machinery and spares
should be worked out in
advance
and
their
procurement
arran-
ged in time.
(3) In
the
case
of embankments,
the lower layers may be
built
to
a
lower
level
of compaction,
say
90 per cent Proctor
whereas the top 30 cm of the embankment constituting the subgrade



======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 118
======================================================================
23
should invariably be compacted with power roller to
95
per
cent
Proctor
density.
However,
in
difficult and
not easily accessible
areas where power rollers cannot be
made
available
despite
the
best efforts, tractor-drawn/animal-drawn/hand-drawn rollers
may
be used for compaction.
In
such
cases,
the
lift thickness should
be reduced and the number of passes increased to achieve a reaso-
nable level of compaction.
(4)
Soil
stabilisation
technique
needs
to
be encouraged
as
much as possible so that locally available materials can be
utilised
to the maximum extent
possible.
(5) Where stage construction is followed,
it 'would
be
desir-
able to ensure timely availability of funds for subsequent stages
of
the
work
as
also
for
the
continued and proper maintenance of
surface between successive stages of the work.
(6) Quality control
is considered to be no less
important
for
rural
roads
than
for
other
higher categories of roads.
There
is
thus need for framing suitable guidelines suggesting
simpler
tech-
niques
of
quality
control
and
investigations
relating rural road
construction
which
could
be
used
by field engineers/block level
officers.
(7) The staff responsible for
the
construction
and
mainten-
ance of rural roads should be given periodic training
for
ensuring
proper construction and maintenance of these roads as well
as
for
ensuring strict quality control during their construction.
2.4.
Maintenance of Rural Roads
2.4.1.
Existing Practices
(1) Maintenance
activities
on
rural
roads
are
carried out
under two heads, as (a) short-term measures like filling of potholes,
dressing of berms, routine maintenance of C-D works, sign
boards
etc., and (b) long-term measures like periodic renewals, upgrading
of surface, repairs of C-D works, etc.
Strengthening of roads
and
improvements in structural capacity are not generally taken up out
of maintenance funds, except in special situations.
(2) The
existing
level
of maintenance of rural
roads,
in



======================================================================
PAGE 36 of 118
======================================================================
24
general,
is
very
low and
is
just
sufficient to keep the buses and
other vehicles somehow ply over them.
(3) In
many
states,
a
number
of agencies besides the state
PWDs are involved in the maintenance of rural roads.
(4) The
normal
periodicity
of renewal
is
5
to 6 years for
black-topped roads.
In the case of gravel/moorum
surfaces,
re-
newal coat is laid once in three years or so.
(5) Most of the maintenance grants are utilised towards gang-
men and casual labourers leaving very little money
for
materials
to
be
used
for
maintenance
works.
Bulk
of the maintenance
work
is
done
by
unskilled/inexperienced
labourers who do not
have any special tools or equipment.
2.4.2.
Deficiencies in existing practices
(1) In
the
context
of the
present
day
hike
in
the cost of
labour
and
materials,
the
existing
methods of allocation are in-
appropriate and the actual availability of funds is woefully
inade-
quate. The funds are made available on a kilometre basis, the
rate
ranging from Rs 2,000 to 4,000 per km which
forms only a part of
the actual requirements.
(2) Requirements
of various
maintenance
tasks
including
special repairs and ordinary repairs are not clearly identified. Also
there is no criteria laid down for prioritisation of these
tasks.
As
a
result
of lack of planning for maintenance works, the gangmen
and the labourers employed are not fully utilised.
Due to lack
of
proper planning, gangmen do not have
enough work
throughout
the year.
Engagement of casual labour also gives
rise
to
certain
labour problems.
(3) The recommendation of the Finance Commission are
not
generally adhered to by the State Finance Departments, and many
a time, the maintenance grants are slashed down.
As a
result
of
the
inadequacy
of funds,
it
has
not
been
possible for states to
follow any planned system of maintenance operations.
(4) Involvement
of
multiple
agencies
in
construction and
maintenance
results
in
poor
maintenance,
due to lack of proper
coordination among the various agencies.



======================================================================
PAGE 37 of 118
======================================================================
25
(5) Rural roads in hill areas have to face certain special
pro-
blems
like
landslides,
erosion,
etc.
during/after
rains
which
consume a major portion of the M & R grants.
2.4.3.
Recommendations
(1) Rural
roads,
being
productive
assets, should receive as
much
attention
if not more
towards maintenance as
is given to-
wards
construction
and
upgrading.
The
present
level of main-
tenance of rural roads is quite low.
Any neglect in this can prove
highly detrimental in the long run.
Adequate
funds
for
mainte-
nance should, therefore, be made available on time.
(2) The allocation of funds recommended for maintenance
of
roads by the Finance Commission should be made available in full
and
infact
enhanced
further
taking
into
consideration
the need
based physical norms recommended by the
Technical
Committee
of the All India State Chief Engineers, increase in prices of materi-
als and wage rates and special requirements of
hilly
areas, water-
logged reaches, flood damage restoration
etc.
In
this
regard the
states should prepare financial norms
for
maintenance
as
appli-
cable to their areas taking into account the traffic needs,,
the
topo-
graphy,
rainfall,
cost
of
materials
and
labour,
etc. and should
arrange to have the same updated regularly.
(3) The Eighth Finance Commission will shortly be consider-
ing the requirements for maintenance grants. A concrete proposal
in this regard supported by factual data
should
be
prepared
for
the consideration of the Commission so that it is possible to
obtain
sufficient funds commensurate with the needs.
(4)
It should be brought to the notice of the
authorities
res-
ponsible
for
allotting
funds that maintenance should receive due
priority vis-a-vis original works so that the
assets
already
created
are not allowed to go waste.
(5)
Since maintenance is more of a
management
problem,
it is but necessary that a proper management
system
be
followed
for the purpose of ensuring
the optimum
utilisation
of available
resources.
While the level of serviceability may be low
for
rural
roads, items requiring attention should be predetermined
depend-



======================================================================
PAGE 38 of 118
======================================================================
26
ing upon the nature and the volume of traffic, type
of
soil
condi-
tions, stage construction policy adopted, etc.
(6)
A small Manual on maintenance of rural
roads
should
be brought out setting forth
guidelines
to
carry
out
the
various
maintenance operations.
(7)
Different
categories
of
staff engaged
in
maintenance
should be exposed periodically to training courses.
(8)
The efficient drainage of water from the road
pavement
and embankment sides not only saves the pavement from
damage
but it also greatly improves the serviceability of roads
and as such
this aspect calls for suitable control measures to be adopted.
(9)
A regular system of programme charts and weekly diar-
ies should be adopted for the maintenance operations,
before
and
after rains, road by road in each sub-division.
(10) Provision of mobile gangs, area-wise
should be
encou-
raged to achieve better efficiency and productivity
in
maintenance
operations.
It should
be
ensured
that
they
are
provided
with
necessary mobility and the other needed tools and equipment.
(11)
The agency responsible for
the
maintenance
of
rural
roads should be
the
same
as responsible for the
construction
of
rural roads.
2.5.
Planning, Design, Construction and Maintenance of Command
Area Roads
2.5.1.
Existing Practices
(1)
There are twelve on
going World Bank aided Irrigation
projects, in
eight
states
containing
sizable
road
components, as
infrastructural
facility
in
the command
areas,
costing
over
Rs 200 crores.
Out of 7200 km
of project network
roads,
about
3100 km have been
completed.
The
balance
being
due
to
be
completed
by March 1985.
In
1981-82
budgets,
provision
of
about Rs 50 crores has been made for
the command
area
roads.
The projected
requirement
of road
length,
vital
for command
areas, may work
out
to
be
4
to
5
times
the
above
indicated
figures.



======================================================================
PAGE 39 of 118
======================================================================
11
{!)
The command
area
road
projects
are
financed
and
executed
according
to
the
terms
and
conditions
agreed
upon
between the World Bank, the Government of India, and
the
State
Government concerned.
Barring a
few
variations in
individual
project, the following practices are generally adopted.
(i) After a thorough reconnaissance
survey of the existing communica-
tions in the command
area,
a systematic road network plan is pre-
pared to
meet
the
objective
of serving the transportation
need of
the developments in the area,
with minimum road
length.
A 6 km
grid
is usually being adopted.
(ii) Detailed plans and estimates are prepared for the network
roads to
conform to the current Indian Roads Congress (IRC) standards and
practices.
(iii) The project costs
include
15 per
cent
physical
contingencies
over
the base costs and allow 7 to 10 per cent price increase
per year for
the period (4 to 5 years).
A
shedule
of
implementation
year
by
year is drawn up so as to complete the road network at least
a
year
before the other irrigation components,
(iv) All construction
is required to be carried out according
to
the IRC
specifications, standards and quality control methods and within the
prescribed time schedule.
For this purpose, the requirement of any
additional equipment, such as,
road rollers, water tankers, crushers,
field and
mobile
laboratories, workshop
facilities etc
, is carefully
worked out and included in the project estimates.
(v) The cost of essentially
needed
training
of road
engineers and the
supervising staff forms a part of the project.
(vi) Blacktopping is usually recommended but not insisted upon, depend-
ing upon the local circumstances.
(vii) In some projects, practical
field
research schemes and socio-econo-
mic evaluation studies with wide ranging and
far
reaching
applica-
bility have been included.
(viii) The projects are irrigation oriented.
However, the
planning
design
and construction is entrusted to the State Road Engineering Organi-
sation (PWD/B&C Dept. etc), in almost
all
the
states,
A
project
planning and monitoring cell
with suitable
composition
is
created
at the headquarters.
(ix) For contracts above a prescribed
financial
limit,
the
tender forms
and
procedures
adopted
are
as standardised by the Central Water
Commission (CWC)
in
consultation
with
the World Bank.
Inter
alia, they include (a)
prequalification, '(b)
prebidding conferences,
and (c) escalation and arbitration clauses.



======================================================================
PAGE 40 of 118
======================================================================
28
(x) For maintenance
of
the
C.A.
roads
after construction,
the
State
Government guarantee in the
agreement
that
they would
finance
and maintain the roads to appropriate serviceability level.
The PWDs of Gujarat
and
Rajasthan,
in
their case
study
reports on command area
roads
in
their
respective
states, have
explained in detail the planning,
design, quality control, construc-
tion techniques, staff training
etc.
as
adopted
on
their
projects.
Land acquisition delays are minimised by Gujarat Officers, through
unconventional approach to the problem.
2.5.2.
Deficiencies in existing practices
(1)
In the irrigation command areas, either out of
necessity
or convenience, the canal service roads are required
to
be thrown
open
to
public
traffic.
There
are
no
precise
guidelines
and
standards for design and construction of such canal service roads.
(2) The existing standards and specifications for
construction
of roads in waterlogged areas appear to be inadequate.
(3) In
the
absence of precise method of assessment of rise in
water-table due to irrigation, standardising practices of road-design
in such area is necessary.
(4) The irrigation
drains
usually
discharge
along
roadside
and
there
are
no
proper
guidelines for coordination of the road
drainage systems and irrigation drains, thus
resulting
in
damages
to the road
network.
This
includes
also
due
consideration
for
adequate and economical cross-drainage works for the roads.
(5) Maintenance
of roads
in
irrigated
area
pose
several
difficulties,
due
to
waterlogging,
non-availability
of
land
for
borrowpits,
etc.
which
are
not
usually
accounted
for
in
the
estimates and/budget provisions.
2.5.3.
Recommendations
(1) Command
area
roads
are
rural
roads
with
a
special
objective.
With the backing of the World Bank Loan, the standard
of
design,
construction,
quality
control
should be maintained at
a higher level
than
normal
works.
There
is
need
therefore
to
adopt similar methodology for rural road programmes.



======================================================================
PAGE 41 of 118
======================================================================
29
(2) The
introduction
of clauses
for
escalation,
prebidding
conferences and
other
provisions may
be
considered
for
rural
road projects as far as possible.
(3) The
deficiencies and
the
problems of design and cons-
truction and
maintenance
of roads
in command
areas may
be
examined in depth by the IRC, Union
Ministry
of Shipping and
Transport
(Roads Wing) and the State PWDs concerned to evolve
suitable
practices and
standards
and
incorporate them
in
the
Manual for Rural Roads.
(4) In command
areas,
the
land
acquisition
problems are
felt more acutely as they affect the time schedules,
and
hence
the
problems may be taken up with priority at a higher level.

3.1.
Planning of Rural Roads
3.1.1.
Guidelines of the 20-Year Plan (1961-81)
(1) The principles of planning laid down in the 20-Year Plan
(1961-81)
had
been
providing
the major guidance in planning of
rural roads so far.
For planning purposes,
the
land
area
of the
country
was
divided into three categories, namely, developed and
agricultural
area,
semi-developed area, and under-developed and
uncultivable area.
The total
length
of
the
road
system
for
the
country and the length of individual road categories were
calculat-
ed
by
a
'Star
and
Grid'
formula.
It
was
envisaged
that
the
accessibility
objectives
given
in
Table
1.
would
be
achieved
with the development of such a road network.

(2) The 20-Year Plan had no
doubt
given
broad
indication
on
the
density
of roads
to be achieved in different types of areas
but did not provide
guidelines
for
the
physical
planning
of the
road
system
which
should
take
into
account
the
spatial
and
locational
aspects
of human
settlements,
the
growth
potential,
the connectivity needs and costs, etc.
3.1.2.
Guidelines under the minimum needs programme
(1) Rural Road Development was taken up as a
part
of the
Minimum Needs Programme
in the Fifth
5-Year Plan (1973-78)



======================================================================

for the first time.
According to the national guidelines
laid
down
under
this
programme,
population
size of villages constitutes the
main consideration of
giving
road
connections
to
villages.
The
present objective is
to
connect
all
villages
having
a
population
of 1,500 and above, and 50 per cent of the villages with population
between
1,000
and 1,500 with all-weather roads by the year 1990.
The hilly, tribal and coastal areas are to
be
connected
by
taking
a cluster of villages with matching population.
(2) The population
criterion
of
giving
road
connections
to
villages has its own merits but
its
strict
application may
lead
to
certain distortions or deficiencies.
Some of these are
:
(i) Areas having thinly populated
villages,
such
as
tribal
areas,
hilly
areas,
etc. may unduly
suffer
despite their economic potential and
social needs.
This has to be looked
at
in
the
context
that
roads
form
the
only mode
of communication in these areas.
Also, this
will preclude small villages which could otherwise have been connect-
ed with short links at a nomimal cost.
(ii) The application
of
population
criterion may
lead
to
more
than
one connection to bigger villages while
smaller
villages
are
denied
of even the basic single connection.
(iii) In the absence
of
physical
planning
guidelines,
this may
lead
to
development
of
parallel
system
of
roads
not
following
any
hierarchial pattern nor amenable
for
proper
integration
with
the
main
road
network
as
also
for
operating
an
efficient
bus
route
which is one of the emerging needs in the rural
areas.
3.1.3.
Physical planning of rural roads
(1)
Essentially, a rural area comprises
a
number
of human
settlements
or
villages
with
supporting
agricultural
and
other
production
activities,
and
social
services.
In
these areas, roads
help promote the
efficient
delivery
of not
only
economic
goods
and services but also social services.
For example, faster mobility
of students, pati ents and Doctors and social workers
reflects
upon
the utilisation rate of these facilities.
(2) In the
prevailing
situation
v/here
thousands
of
villages
remain unconnected
with roads, provision of a road network satis-
fying the
socio-economic
needs
of the
villages
will
be
possible
only
in
stages
over
a
period
of time.
So that the work done at
the different stages is well integrated and no part of its goes

tuous
in
fiiture
years,
the
road
system
for
an
area
or
region
expected to be completed in the next 15-20
years
should
be
pre-
pared
in
the
first
stage
itself
in
the form of Master Plan.
This
Master Plan can be conveniently
worked
out
for
each
Develop-
ment
Block in the first instance which can be integrated to develop
District Master Plan for
each
District.
Procedure
for
preparing
Master Plans is discussed in succeeding paragraphs.
(3) In a rural area, the pattern of road network has
to
match
the
movement
pattern
in
that
area.
Movement
pattern
will
depend on the spatial distribution
of
the
various
settlements
and
locational pattern
of various economic functions of social amenities
in the area.
Intensity of movement will depend
upon
the degree
of dependency of the settlement on the others for its socio-economic
needs.
(4)
It
should be understood that in a developing economy
it
may not be possible to provide for
all
the
functions or amenities
to
all
the
settlements.
This
is for the reason that every function
requires some population threshold for
its
efficient fulfilment and
economic
justification.
This
will mean that
a large number of
small settlements will not be able
to
have
within
their own
area
certain
amenities.
For
example,
a
secondary school
cannot be
provided in each village but a large number of
villages
can
share
one
at
a
convenient point.
In other words, for bringing in small
settlements on the mainstream of national development, integrated
area
planning
approach
has to be used which integrates a cluster
of smaller settlements for
providing
the
various
missing
facilities
and
services
at
a
suitable
location
in
the cluster which may be
termed local centre or Nodal village.
These local
centres
can
be
further
integrated
to form a bigger group of settlements with func-
tions and amenities of middle order being
provided
at
a
suitable
point
which may
be
termed
a Service
centre.
A service centre
may serve an area of 30-80 sq.km.
and
a
population
of 20,000
40,000 and
provide
facilities
such as mandi or market, secondary
school, primary health centre, places
for
recreation,
etc.
Service
centres may
be further integrated to form a larger group of settle-
ments and higher order functions provided
at
a
suitable
location
which may be termed Growth Centre.
A growth centre will serve
an
area
of
200-300
sq. km. and
1,50,000—2,00,000
population.



======================================================================
PAGE 48 of 118
======================================================================
36
These
centres
would
have
activities
mainly
of
non-agricultural
nature with all centralised amenities and
facilities
in
the
field
of
education,
medical,
public
health, wholesale and retail shopping,
civic,
cultural
and
recreational
activities,
organised
industrial
estates, etc.
(5) The first step in the planning of roads in
the
rural
areas
is
the
identification
of the
settlements
which
have
potential or
capacity to act as local
centre,
service
centre
or
growth
centre.
Important
considerations
in
infiuencing
the choice of these points
are the size of population, the area of infiuence,
junction of
roads,
existance
of facilities like Block Development oflice or other
Govt,
offices, Post oflSces, bank,
high
schools and
colleges,
hospital
or
primary
health
centre,
organised
market
or
mandi,
veterinary
station, bus
terminal,
railway
station,
warehouse
and
collection
centres, agro service station, cinema, etc.
(6) Information on the existence of the
various
facilities
can
be
collected
through
a base line survey for socio-economic condi-
tion of the settlements in the region.
This should be supplemented
by
the
development
programmes
proposed
for
the
area
in the
different sectors of the economy.
Some of the
important
aspects
for which information should be collected are
:
(i) The type of
area,
viz.
developed
agricultural,
semi-developed,
or
undeveloped/uncultivable area.
(11) Location of human settlements and population of each settlement.
(iii) Location
of marketing
centres
or
mandis,
educational
centres,
hospitals/health centres, places of tourist attraction, etc.
(iv) The existing road network including the main road system.
(V) Location of industrial, mining and commercial activity.
(vi) The investments being made or proposed to be made
in
the
other
sectors of the economy.
Once the above
information
is
available,
the
settlement
can
be
graded for their capacity to act as nodal point by assigning suitable
weightages to the various
functions.
It
is
expected
that
the
on
going
socio-economic
study
of nine districts under the aegis of the
Indian Roads Congress will provide
guidelines
on
the
weightage
scale
to
be adopted.
A balanced framework of nodal points thus
developed
will
ensure
a
well
distributed
road
network
which



======================================================================
PAGE 49 of 118
======================================================================
37
should be generated
by
linking
every
lower
order
nodal
point
to the nearby higher order nodal point.
The smaller order villages
should then be connected to
the
nearest
of
these
links
or
nodal
points to complete the network.
(7) The
network
so
developed
should
be superimposed on
the existing network and examined in light of the
following
points
for any modification
:
(i) Maximum use of the
existing
road
links,
whether
fair-weather
or
all-weather.
(ii)
Integration with the main road system.
(iii) The proposed links should as far as possible serve maximum
popu-
lation per unit length.
(iv) The links should
avoid
expensive
ridge/stream
crossings and
low
lying areas prone to flooding erosion.
(v) The network should
develop
a
definite
hierarchy
of
roads.
The
hierarchy
of the roads should be tied with the hierarchy of the rural
settlements.
This will also help in estimation of
the
relative
traffic
volumes expected on the various links for design purposes.
(vi) The alignment of the road links should
be amenable
to maximum
use of locally available materials.
(vii) Introduction of public bus service is one of
the
emerging
needs
in
the rural areas.
For economic operation, a bus
route
should
have
sufficient catchment
area and
should
be as directional as possible.
This aspect should be given due
consideration
while
finalising
the
network.
(8) As mentioned
earlier,
a
Development
Block
is
a
con-
venient
area
for
starting
the
planning exercise.
A plan of road
network
developed
for
a
typical
Block
is shown
in
Fig.
1.
This plan
also indicates the possible bus route for the area.
Once
the network plan for all the Blocks
in
a
District
is
worked
out,
these
can
be
superimposed
on
the
District
Plan,
and
further
refinements made
for
compatibility,
connectivity
at
Block
inter-
faces, avoiding expensive bridge/ridge crossings, etc.
(9) While developing a road network at the Block
level
and
finalisation at the District level, there should be a system to
ensure
public
participation.
One way
in
this regard will be to have the
Plan examined
and
processed
through
District
Planning Com-
mittees/Councils which have people's representatives in them.

is that the

year
becomes infructuous in future years.
3.1.4.
Planning methodology developed by the CRRI*
(1) The Central Road Research
Institute
have
developed
a
simple methodology
for connecting various villages in a rural area
once the nodal points are identified and a road network
developed
to inter-connect
these.
The method which
is helpful in connecting
the villages in the interior is based on
the
concept
of "Minimum
Spanning Tree" borrowed from
the
'*Graph
Theory".
The
pro-
cedure involved is briefly described in the subsequent paragraphs.
(2) The
entire
road
transportation
system
in
a
district is
divided
into
four
parts,
viz.,
(i) Market centres attracting
traffic
from various villages; (ii) Main roads inter-connecting the
various
market centres;
(iii)
Villages of various population
levels
generat-
ing
traffic
to
and
fro
the
market
centre
for
their
marketing,
health,
education
and
other
facilities;
(in)
Village
roads inter-
connecting
the
various
villages
and
providing connection to the
nearest market centre or main road.
Such a system in its idealised
form is shown in Fig.
3.
(3) The
flow
of
traffic
in
the
road
network
is considered
analogous to the flow of current in a circuit.
The
market
centres
are considered as high intensity concentrated electric
charges
and
the
main
roads
as
cables
with
high
intensity
current flowing
through them.
The various yillages are considered as
small
con-
centrated charges.
The
high charges at market centres and along
the
main
roads
attract
the
smaller
charges
situated at various
villages around them.
Village roads are
assigned
weightages
in
direct
proportion
to
the
attraction
force
exerted
and inversely
proportional
to
the
connecting
road
length
which

Step-2
The
market
centres,
main

and
villages
of various
population levels are considered to
possess
the
following
magni-
tudes of electric charge,

Step-3
Connect the villages closest to the market
centres/main roads
and then proceed towards the
interior
depending
on
the
weight
IV of the road length.
The weight is given by
:
W = QID

Where—
D = Length of the link option
Q = Total

already
con-
nected as the case may be.
Q is equal to 100
or
80 if the village
is to be directly connected to
the
market centre or main road respectively.
Where
a village under consideration is to
be
connected
to a village already conected by rooted tree (such
village is termed as attracting village), Q is calcu-

Procedure for determining the road links
The
generation
of various
rooted
minimal
spanning trees
will start from their roots.
For identifying the various
tree
roots,
start connecting the villages which are closest to the market centre/
main
road
by
selecting
the
links of maximum weight (W) calcu-
lated by Equation (1).
In this way, as many roots as possible
are
identified.
Side by side, the various minimal
spanning
trees
are
generated by adding links of maximum weight (W) and connecting
village
by
village
starting from
the
village
close to the market
centre/main road and then proceeding towards the
interior.
The
procedure is continued till all the villages are connected.
Step-4
The system thus developed will be an idealised
one
without
any regard to the
existing
rural
roads.
For making use
of the
existing
road
network
to
the
maximum
extent
possible,
the
generated network
is superimposed on the existing one
and
modi-
fications made in it as considered necessary and appropriate.
One
way of carrying out the modifications
is
to
consider
the
existing
road links as of maximum weight (W) and
developing
the
rest of
the trees as explained earlier. Another refinement will be required

where a proposed road link
has
to cross a wide water
course
or
ridge involving
huge
expenditure.
For
such
cases,
it
will
be
necessary to examine the proposed links in
light of the field condi-
tions and make
necessary
modifications/adjiiStments
for
keeping
the cost of the lengths as low as possible.
Similar will be the
case
of the link options having marginal difference in weightage.
3.1.5.
Special consideration for hilly areas.
Hilly areas have
certain special
characteristics,
and
these
should
be
taken
into
consideration while planning rural roads in
these
areas.
First is
that in the hills, the
villages
are
generally
dispersed
located
at
different
elevations
and
thinly
populated
with
the
result
that
villages forming
a
cluster within
1 km
distance
and
making
up
population of 1,000 or more are very few.
Second is that because
of the difficult topography and the high cost involved
in
construc-
tion,
it may not be feasible to connect isolated villages with
motor-
able roads.
At the same time, these areas have
large potential for
horticulture production and tourism, and roads are the only means
of communication.
In light of these special characteristics,
plann-
ing of rural roads in hilly
areas
should keep in view the following
considerations in addition to those discussed in para 3.1.3.
(i) Villages
located
within
1 km radius having difference of elevation
not more than 100 m
should
be
considered
as a cluster of villages
and one
suitable
village
of
the
cluster
should
be
connected by
motorable road.
(ii) All isolated villages for which
it is not possible to provide
a
motor-
able road
connection
should
be brought within 3 km
radius and
altitude difference of 300 m from
a
motorable road.
This
can
be
effected by extending the road system upto such points as
is
econo-
mically feasible.
Beyond
these
points
upto
the
isolated
villages,
mule
paths
should be
provided.
Gravity
type
cableways, where
feasible, may also be considered for the transport
of produce from
such villages to the motorable road head.
3.2.
Geometric Design
3.2.1.
Design standards
(1) Geometric
design
deals
with
the
visible
elements of
a
road, i.e., how
it is aligned in the horizontal and vertical directions,
to what widths the various elements in the cross-section should
be
provided for, etc.
The geometric features of a road except for
the



======================================================================
PAGE 59 of 118
======================================================================
47
cross-sectional elements do not lend to stage construction.
Geome-
tric deficiencies are costly and sometimes impossible to rectify
later
on
due
to
subsequent
roadside
developments.
It
is,
therefore,
essential that the geometric requirements should
be
kept
in
view
right from the initial construction stage itself.
(2) Geometric design standards for rural roads (ODR's
and
VR's)
are
discussed
in
detail
in the IRC Special Publication 20.
Standards for some of the important geometric features which may
be
required
to
be consulted at the planning/alignment stage itself
are given in Table
3.
(3) Width of land acquired for a road
is the
most
important
element
affecting
its
widening
in the future.
While deciding on
the land width,
it should be borne in mind that value
of the
land
adjoining the road increases rapidly.
Hence, sufficient land
width
should be acquired at the outset according to the anticipated future
development of the road in question.
Unless this
is
done,
it may
be costly and sometime practically impossible to acquire more land
later on for widening or other improvements to
the
road.
Where
consolidations
of land
holding is to take place, advantage should
be taken for reserving the necessary land for the road along
align-
ments satisfying the geometric requirements.
3.2.2.
Alignment
(1) The Master Plan (see para 3.1) would
give
guidance
on
the
broad
route
for
the
roads
and the villages to be connected.
This will have to be
translated
on
to
the
ground
in the form of
properly aligned road links.
The
main
objective
in
this
activity
will
be
that
the
road
system
so developed should be efficient in
operation and economical in cost.
Some of
the
considerations
in
this regard are
:
(i) Alignment
should
be
as
directional
as
possible
so
that
there is
maximum economy in cost of construction, maintenance and
vehicle
operation.
(ii) The alignment should avoid crossing of
large
water
courses/ridges,
low
lying and
other problematic area needing expensive treatment.
It should be amenable to the maximum
utilisation
of
locally
avai-
lable cheaper construction materials.
The
idea
is that for the given
standards and
the
desired
level
of
service, the road should be as
economical as possible in initial construction.

(2) For fixing the alignment on the ground, certain field
sur-
face and investigations are required to be conducted.
These are
:
(i) Route surveys which include the operations of reconnaissance,
pre-
liminary survey and final location survey.
(ii) Soil
and
material
surveys and
laboratory
investigations
for
the
location
and
suitability
of road
construction
materials, design of
pavement
and
choice
of
specification
for
the
different pavement
layers.
(iii) Studies for drainage and investigations for the
location and
design
of cross drainage structures.
(iv) Miscellaneous such as for the working season, availability of labour/
equipment, logistic, etc.
Detailed
guidelines
on
all
these
aspects
are
contained in
IRC

: 20.
3.3.
Pavement Design
3.3.1.
General considerations
(1)
Generally, flexible type of pavement is adopted for
rural
roads.
The objective in the design of such pavements is to
provide
sufficient
cover
or pavement crust over the subgrade so as to keep
the deformation of the road vi'ithin tolerable limits so that the
road
is
able
to give a reasonable level of service over the design period.
The main parameters affecting the design are
:
(i)
Traffic, its volume and composition.
(ii) The strength of the subgrade to take up
the
imposed
stresses
and
strains
which
depends on the type of soil, the moisture content and
the variation of moisture from season to season,
and
the
state
of
compaction.
(iii) Environmental factors like rainfall, water table, freezing
conditions,
etc.
(2)
The parameter of traffic
for
pavement
design
purposes
is
indeed
complex
as
it
is
generally composed of a number of
different vehicle types with widely varying stress intensities imposed
on
the
pavement
structure.
Solid
wheeled bullock-carts have a
telling effect on the performance of
rural
roads,
especially when
these
are
in
large numbers and follow a channelised path.
Even
if
the Vv'heel loads are lighter,
the contact stresses imposed by such



======================================================================
PAGE 63 of 118
======================================================================
51
wheels are very high relative to the stresses produced by pneumatic
tyred vehicles.
To a varying degree, all
types
of
pavements
are
susceptible
to
damage
by cart traffic, but the problem
is
compa-
ratively less acute in the case of cement
concrete
pavement,
crete-
ways and bituminous surfacings.
(3)
The complexity of the problem being what
it
is,
in
the
absence of any rational solution to cater for different situations,
the
pavement
design
practices for rural roads in the country generally
fall under the following two broad heads
:
(i) Ad-hoc designs based on the general experience in the area.
(ii) Emperical procedure based on some mechanical
tests
on
the
sub-
grade soil.
The CBR method
is commonly used in the country.
(4)
The CBR method
of pavement design is
discussed in
para 3.3.2.
As
a
slight
modification
to
this
method, the CRRI
have proposed
a
design
procedure
which
is
discussed
in
para
3.3.3.
Ad-hoc design are brought out in para 3.3.4.
(5)
Ad-hoc designs do not take into account the soil strength
or traffic loads coming on the pavement and as such may
lead
to
under or over design.
These
should
not,
therefore,
be
adopted
except in extreme cases where traffic both present
and projected is
low and cannot be
substantiated
with
any
degree
of
reliability
like the case of village
roads
in
remote
areas
inter-linking
only
very small villages and hamlets.
Also, no design will be warran-
ted for unsurfaced roads, i.e., earth or moorum roads.
For
such
cases, atleast the top 150 mm thickness of the road should be
pro-
vided with better granular soils or moorum or any similar
locally
available materials.
3.3.2.
The CBR method
(1)
The procedure involves the testing of
the
soil
expected
to be used in the subgrade portion of the road for CBR
estimation
of traffic both by
volume
and
composition
expected
to
use
the
road during the design life
and
then referring to the design
chart
for arriving at the pavement thickness.
(2)
The density and moisture content of
the
subgrade
soil
specimens are the important aspects affecting the CBR value.
For



======================================================================
PAGE 64 of 118
======================================================================
52
rural roads,
it is a requirement that the top 300 mm of the embank-
ment forming the subgrade
should
invariably
be
compacted
to
95 per cent Proctor density.
As such, the density of the specimens
to be decided for CBR
should
be
in the range of 95-100 per cent
Proctor density.
(3)
The
choice
of moisture
'content of the test specimen is
not quite
so
simple.
The
moisture
condition
of the
subgrade
which the test specimen
is
expected
to
simulate
is
governed
by
local environmental factors
such
as water table, precipitation, soil
premeability,
drainage
condition
and
waterproofness
of the
pavement.
With the type of pavement
construction
practices
in
the country
for
rural
roads,
i.e.,
with
thin pavements made
of
granular materials which is at best sealed with
a
thin
bituminous
surfacing, unsealed shoulders,
box
type
of construction, etc.,
it is
reasonable to assume that in most cases,
the
subgrade
will
be
in
a saturated condition at least for a few
months
(during
the
rainy
season) in a year.
It is, therefore, recommended that as a general
practice, the soil specimens should be
soaked in water for a period
of 4 days prior to testing.
Exceptions
to
this can be areas where
the climate is arid throughout
the
year,
i.e., the annual rainfall
is
of the order of 500 mm or less.
(4)
Traffic is considered in terms of commercial vehicles
per
day in the design year, i.e.
trucks,
buses,
etc. whether
laden
or
unladen.
In other words, the method does not take
into
account
the solid wheel bullock-carts
which
if
present in
good
numbers
can cause considerable
damage
to
the
pavement.
One way
to
get over this is to choose
the
design
curve corresponding
to
the
next higher traffic intensity.
(5) The CBR design curves for A, B and C
traffic
categories
are
given
in
Fig.
5.
For
more
details of the method, reference
may
be
made
to
IRC:37- 1970 — 'Guidelines
for the Design of
Flexible Pavements'.
3.3.3. Design method proposed by the CRRI
(1) The CBR
method
requires
the
testing of subgrade
soil
specimens after soaking in water for 4 days.
This is time
consum-
ing, and requires a load frame for conducting the
test.
Also,

CBR curves for flexible pavement design (See para 3.3.2)
method does not take into
account
solid wheeled carts
which ply
in sizeable numbers* and cause considerable
damage to the
road.
The CRRI method which
gets
over
these
defficiencies
to
certain
extent,
is based on the following concepts:
(i) The CBR can
be
correlated
with
the
gradation and other
easily
determinable properties of
the
soil without the need for any elabo-
rate
laboratory
arrangements.
The
strength value so determined
is termed "Strength Index" which in effect is equal to the CBR.
(ii) All vehicles, whether pneumatic tyred, or solid
wheeled
carts
cause
damage to roads.
The damaging affect of different types of vehicles
has been evaluated in terms
of
that
of heavy
commercial
vehicle.
The
equivalency
factors
(in
terms
of heavy
commercial vehicles)
are 2 for solid-wheeled cart and 0.4
light
pneumatic
vehicles.
The
equivalent annual average daily traffic
is computed and termed
as
"Traffic Index".
(iii) Rural roads can be divided
into two
categories
depending
on
the
expected level of serviceability, categories I and II, the former having
better serviceability and accordingly needing thicker
pavement
than
the latter.
According to a study by CRRI, solid wheeled carts constituted 47%, 33% and
50/0 of the total traffic in plain, rolling and hilly terrain respectively.



======================================================================
PAGE 66 of 118
======================================================================
54
(iv) Based on a study of a large number of rural
roads
in
the
country,
pavement design curves have been
developed
correlating pavement
thickness
with
"Strength
Index".
Different
curves
have
been
proposed for tu'o ranges of
traffic
index
and
two
categories
(cate-
gories I and II) of roads.
(2) Application of this method involves the following
step
by
step procedure
:
Step
1
:
Estimate the average annual
daily
traific
in
terras
of
solid
wheeled
carts
(SWC),
pneumatic tyred heavy commercial vehicle
(CV) and light pneumatic tyred
vehicles
(OV)
and
calculate
the
traffic index (Tl) given by
:
77
2 X SWC + CV + 0.4 X OV
Step-2
:
In this step, the Strength Index
(or
the CBR)
is
computed
under one of the following two situations as appropriate
:
Situation 1
:
The ground water table
is
deep,
over
1,5 m
below
the
subgrade.
The
subgrade
is
taken
to be in a state of
equilibrium moisture content which in the absence of
factual
field
data may be assumed to be equal to optimum moisture content.
Situation 2
:
The ground water
table
is
shallow,
within
a
depth
of
1.5 m
below
the
subgrade.
The subgrade
is designed
for the state of full saturation, i.e. corresponding to 4 days soaking.
After
deciding on the subgrade moisture condition for design
(Situation
1 or 2), the Strength Jndex can
be
computed
by
using
the equations eiven in Table 4.
Step-3
:
Classify
the
road
into
category
1
or
II.
Category
I will
provide better serviceability than category II.
Knowing the
value
of
traflic
index,
strength
index
and
road category, the required
thickness of pavement can be directly
arrive d
at
by
referring
to
the appropriate design curve given in Fig. 6.

Drainage
The performance of a

can be
seriously
aff'ected
if adequate
precautions to obviate accumulation of moisture in the
pavement structure are not taken.
Some of the
measures
in
this
regard are
:
(i) The
subgrade should be sufficiently above HFL/ground water table,
or the natural ground level, the minimum
height
being
0,6 m
for
rural roads.
(ii) The road surface should be
provided
with
reasonable
crossfall
to
facilitate quick
runoff
of
surface
water,
and
suitable
side
drains

with outfall should be
constructed
wherever necessary.
The
cross-
falls recommended are given in Table 6,
(iii) The
shoulders
should
be dressed periodically so that they conform
always to the requisite crossfall and
are
not
higher
than
the
level
of the carriageway at any time.

Notes
:
1.
Use steeper values in table for high rainfall areas and vice-versa.
2.
For earth shoulders adopt crossfall 0.5
per
cent steeper
than
that
for pavement but not less than 3 per cent.
3.
On superelevated sections, the shoulders should normally
have the
same crossfall as the pavement.
3.4.
Pavement Materials
3.4.1.
General considerations
(1) The
cost
of pavement
constitutes
25-40
per cent of the
total cost of a rural road.
Further,
it is the
pavement
which
has
to
carry
the
traffic
plying
on
the
road,
and
its condition is an
important factor affecting the comfort of travel and cost
of vehicle
operation.
(2) Rural roads are essentially low cost
roads,
and
as
such
the
specification
for pavement should be as economical as possible
consistent
with
the
traffic
likely
to
use
the
road,
the
climatic
conditions,
etc.
From
this
angle,
local
materials
which
are
cheaper
to
extract and
involve minimum haulage cost should be
made use of to the maximum extent
feasible.
A
variety
of local
materials can be used which may be grouped under
the
following
categories
:
(i) Better granular soil for use
in
subgrade
or
as
surfacing
for
earth
roads.
(ii) Mechanical stabilisation of local
soil, and
stabilisation
with
lime,
cement, lime and flyash, as appropriate.



======================================================================
PAGE 72 of 118
======================================================================
60
(iii) Naturally occurring softer aggregates like moorum,
kankar,
gravel,
etc.
(iv) Brick and overburnt brick metal.
(v) Stone metal.
Some of the important
points
in
the
use
of these
materials
are
discussed in subsequent paragraphs.
3.4.2.
Better
granular
soil
:
Well-graded
soils
with
low
plasticity have better engineering properties and should
be
reserv-
ed for use in the subgrade portion, or surfacing in the case of earth
roads.
Such soils can be identified by
their
high
Proctor
density
and low P.I. values.
3.4.3.
Stabilisation of local soils
:
A
variety
of techniques
are available
for stabilising local soils for improving their engineer-
ing properties, but
not
all
the
techniques
are
applicable
to
all
types
of
soils.
A
brief description of the stabilisation mechanism
and
applicability
of
the
individual
techniques
are
given
in
Table 7.
This may be referred to
for
choosing
the
most
appro-
priate technique for stabilising the soil at site.
The mix proportions
are generally worked out in the laboratory based on soaked CBR.
3.4.4.
Naturally occurring softer aggregates
:
Softer
aggre-
gates
like
laterite, kankar, moorum, dhandla, etc. where available
within
economic
leads,
should
be made
use
of
in
pavement
construction
to
the maximum extent feasible.
The material may
occur in a graded form or as discrete
blocks
or
admixtured
with
soil.
The manner of using these is indicated in Table 8.
3.4.5.
Brick soling
:
In
alluvial
plains
where
hard
stone
aggregates
are
normally
not
available
within economical leads,
the general specification
adopted
for
sub-base
and
base
courses
is
to
provide
brick
soling.
Either
flat
bricks
or bricks on edge
can be used depending
on
the
thickness
requirements.
In
case
of
flat
bricks,
the
layers
are desirable.
The bricks should be of
good quality and well burnt.
Before laying,
it
is
generally
desir-
able to provide a cushion of sand above the earth subgrade.
3.4.6.
Water bound macadam
:
Water Bound Macadam
is
one
of the
most common
specifications adopted for construction
of sub-base, base and
surfacing
courses.
Broken
stone,
crushed

slag,
overburnt
brick
metal,
laterite,
or
kankar
can be used as
the coarse aggregate for WBM.
For details of the WBM
techni-
que, reference may be made
to IRC
: 19
'Standard
Specification
and Code of Practice for Water Bound Macadam'.
3.4.7.
Bituminous surfacings
(1) Bituminous surfacing is a
relatively
expensive
item
and
its
use
should
be made judiciously.
Even where used, the speci-
fication will not generally be
higher
than
single/two-coat
surface
dressing or 2-cm thick open-graded premix carpet.
(2)
Thin bituminous surfacing essentially serves
the
follow-
ing purposes
:
(i) Provides a smooth riding surface.
(ii) Seals the surface thus preventing the entry
of
water
which
would
otherwise weaken the pavement structure.
(iii) protects the granular base from the disruptive effects of traffic.
From the above considerations, bituminous
surfacing
would
be desirable in the following cases
:
(i) Pneumatic tyred fast vehicles disrupt unprotected granular bases and
create
dust
nuisance.
Also,
the
operating
cost of such vehicles is
highly
influenced
by
the
smoothness
of
the
road
pavement.
Bituminous
surfacing
will,
therefore,
be
advantageous when the
pneumatic tyred faster
vehicles ply
in
large
numbers,
say,
more
than 50 per day.
(ii) Pavements in high rainfall areas need to be protected
against
water
infilteration
and
erosion.
From
this
angle, roads in high rainfall
areas (rainfall greater than 150 cm per
year)
should
preferably
be
provided with bituminous surfacing.
3.5.
Cross-Drainage Stractwres
3.5.1.
General
:
Cross-drainage
structures
which
are
intended
for
crossing
of water barriers along the road alignment
constitute the most important component affecting
the
all-weather
character of the road.
These crossings are
generally
one
of the
costly items (forming roughly 25-30 per
cent
of
total
construction
cost) in road projects.
On rural roads, these structures
should
be
built
as
economical
as possible to be in consonance with the low-
cost concept of the road and at the same
time
be
consistent
with
the technical and functional requirements.



======================================================================
PAGE 77 of 118
======================================================================
65
3.5.2.
Choice of the type of water crossing
(1)
A variety of water crossings are possible.
These can
be
considered under two broad groups, namely
:
(i) Crossings that are submersible, such as
fords,
paved
dips,
cause-
ways, etc.
(ii) Crossings that are not submersible, such
as
culverts,
bridges
and
ferries.
Each type of crossing has an appropriate place for use.
Generally,
high level bridges across major
water
courses
are
not
envisaged
for
rural
roads,
and this aspect must be paid due attention at the
road planning stage itself.
(2)
The considerations in the proper choice of the type of cross-
ing are
:
(a)
rimciional
(i) Number of vehicles delayed
(ii) Length of time of each delay
(iii) Number of times per year these delays occur.
(b)
Technical
(i) Nature and width of stream,
and
flood
flows
whether
flashy
or
sustained
(ii) Velocity of flow and bed slope
(iii) Maximum and minimum depth of flow
(iv) Presence of floating debris, boulder movement on the bed, etc.
(v) Local materials and skills available.
(c)
Economical
(i) Cost of initial construction
(ii) Cost of maintenance or reconstruction
(iii) Cost of delays to vehicles (in the case of submersible crossings).
Normally, experience and local practice will be
highly
helpful
in
the
choice
of the appropriate crossing thus obviating the need for
detailed calculations.
However, there
can
be
overlapping
cases
suggesting more than one alternative.
In such cases where
doubt
exists,
it would
be
worthwhile to evaluate the alternatives taking
all
the
above
m^entioned
aspects
into
account.
For
the
quick
selection of promising alternatives,
the
guidelines
given
in
Table
9 will be helpful
.

Table
9.
Guideline sfor the Choice of Cross Drainage
Structure for Rural Roads
SI.
No.
Type of Structure
Locations where the structure will be
found suitable
1.
Ford
Shallow non-perennial stream where maximum
depth of flow does not exceed
1.6 m and
the
period of interruption at one stretch
does
not
exceed 12 hours for ODRs and
24
hours
for
VRs in hilly terrain, and 3 days in
the
case of
roads
in
plains.
Also,
the
total
period
of
interruption
should
not
exceed
10
days
for
ODRs and
15
days
for VRs.
Suitable
for
roads in arid or
isolated
areas
carrying
very
low traffic.
Also for roads in a network where
alternate
route
is
available
during the
rainy
season.
Low in
initial
cost,
and
ideal
for
crossing of men on foot and cattle.
Paved dip (or bed
causeway)
Same as for SI. No.
1 except that the traffic on
the road may be somewhat higher.
3.
Vented causeway
Shallow
streams
having
permanent
dry
weather flow exceeding
0.6 m
in
depth.
The
same criterion indicated for SI. No.
1 as regards
interruption equally apply to this case also.
4.
Submersible bridge
In cases where high level bridge
is too
expen-
sive to construct.
5.
Culvert
This
is
a
high
level
structure
having
total
span up to 6 m.
Suitable for narrow streams.
6.
High level bridge
Ordinarily high level bridges designed
to
cater
for
the maximum
possible
flood
discharge
should
not
be
considered
for
rural
roads.
However,
situations
warranting
such
bridges
are crossing of deep narrow streams or ravines
in hilly terrain.
7.
Ferry and pontoon/
boat bridge
In case of large streams where
it
is
not econo-
mical to provide a bridge, ferry service or pon-
toon/boat bridge may be appropriate.

3.5.3.
Design standards
(1)
Design loading
Road bridges, culverts and
vents
for
causeways
should
be
designed for the categories of loadings as; described in
IRC: 6-1966
"Standard
Specifications
and
Code of Practice for Road Bridges,
Section II-Loads and Stresses", reproduced below
:
IRC Class A Loading
:
This loading is to be
normally
adopted
for
all
roads on which permanent bridges and culverts are constructed.
IRC Class B Loading
:
This loading
is
to
be
normally
adopted
for
temporary structures and for bridges in specified areas.
Structures
with
timber spans are to be regarded as temporary structures for the purpose.
(2)
Roadway width
Culverts (upto 6m span)
:
In plain
and
rolling
terrain,
the
roadway
width on
culverts
(measured from outside to outside of
the
parapet
walls)
both
for ODRs and VRs
should
equal
the
normal roadway width given
in
Table
3.
In
mountainous
and
steep terrain, the clear roadway width
available
on
the
culverts
(measured from inside to inside of pappet wal|s or
kerbs)
should
be as below
:
,
i
ODRs
—
Same as given in Table 3
VRs
Minimum
—
As given in Table 3
Desirable
—
4.25 m
Bridges (greater than 6 m span)
:
At bridges constructed for
road traffic, clear width of roadway (between kerbs) should
be
as
under
:
Desirable
—
7.5 m
Where 7.5 m width
cannot be provided
—
5.75 m
Exceptional
—
4.25 m
Where a footpath or footbridge is provided
for
the
use
of
pedestrians, its width should not be less than
1.5 m.
Causeways
and
submersible
bridges
:
Roadway
width
at
causeways and submersible bridges should be
normally
adequate
for two
lanes of
traffic,
i.e.
7.5 m
wide,
unless
it
is
specially
reduced by the competent authority.

vertical
curves designed for safe stopping sight distance should be provided
at breaks in the grade line subject to a minimum length of 15 m.

(1) Ford
Location for the ford is chosen at a place where
the
stream
runs in shallow channel. A trench about
1 m wide and
1 to 1.2 m
deep is dug on the bed of the stream along
the
downstream
edge
of the road.
The trench is then filled with
stones
in
wire
crates
upto the level of the road.
As an alternative, a m.asonry
(stone or
brick in cement mortar
1:4) wall could be built
along
the
down-
stream edge to retain the
road
in
position.
The
road
surface is
formed by levelling the stream bed with gravel.
After one or two
seasons, fines transported by the stream will fill in the voids in
the
gravel surface, leaving a satisfactory stream
crossing.
Details of a
typical ford are illustrated in Fig. 7.

(2) Paved dip
This
is similar to a ford constructed
flush
with
the
stream
bed except for the provision of permanent riding surface protected
by cut-off walls both
on
the
upstream
and
downstream
sides.

(3) Vented Causeway
Vented
causeways
have
the
double
function
of
passing
normal discharge through the vents and
below
the
roadway
and
the
flood
discharge both through the vents and over the roadway
itself.
Some of the important considerations in the design
of
this
type of structure are
:
(i) The vents should be sufficient to pass the normal water flow without
overtopping.
This should
be checked
for
the maximum
annual
flood
to
ensure
that
the
interruption
criteria
given
in
Table
9.
are not transgressed.
(ii) The vents should be distributed throufehout the length cf the
cause-
way.
All entry faces should be
bell-mouthed
to
reduce
hydraulic
losses,
and
thereby the
afflux.
The
vents may
consist
of
pipes,
reinforced concrete slabs, arches or
stone
slabs
depending on
the
availability of materials and local conditions.
(iii) The roadway should preferably be given one way
crossfall
towards
the downstream side.
This will
have
the
advantage
of
reduced
afflux and avoid the
chance
of
a
standing wave
(consequence
turbulance and serious erosion) being formed.
(iv) Other measures for reducing the hydraulic resistance
are
rounding/
bevelling
the
upstream
edge
of
the causeway,
and
provision
of
streanjilined guard stones.
(v) The ^nal road levels (grade line on the causeway) should be kept
as
low
- as
possible
consistent however with satisfying the interruption
criteria.
It should be clearly understood that
the
flood
levels
will
increase (because of afflux) on the upstream side after
the
construc-
tion
of the
structure depending on the extent of obstruction.
Any
checking
for
the
interruption
criteria
should
be with reference to
the affiuxed flood level.
(vi) Suitable cut-off" walls should be provided at both
the upstream and
downstream sides.
Unless rock is met with
at
higher
levels,
these
walls
should go down to at least Im and 2m respectively on the
up-
stream and downstream sides respectively.
These
walls
should
be
protected by means of apron
comprising
rubble
stone
or cement
concrete
block to
a
width
of 2m and 5m on the
upstream
and
downstream sides respectively.
Fig. 9. shows a
typical
vented causeway using R.C.C.
pipes
for
the vents.
(4) Submersible bridge
Submersible
bridges
are
functionally
superior
to
vented
causeways,
and
are
provided
where
it will be very expensive to
construct
high
level
bridges.
Normally,
the
ventwayand deck



======================================================================
PAGE 84 of 118
======================================================================
n
level should be so fixed that it is possible to pass
below
the
road-
way
the
flood
of
5
to
10 year frequency.
In the design of such
bridges, the impact of floating debris should be taken care of.
3.5.5.
Details of non-submersible cross-drainage structure
(1)
Culverts
A
culvert
is
defined
as
a
bridge structure having a gross
length of 6 m or less between faces of abutments or
extreme
vent-
age boundaries.
Culverts may be of different types, namely,
pipe
culvert, R.C.C. slab culvert, R.C.C. box culvert stone slab
culvert
or masonry arch
culvert, but their choice will depend on the
rela-
tive cost and
construction convenience.
Pipe culverts are versatile and will be found to
be
economi-
cal
and
easy
to
construct
in most of the situations where a diffe-
rence in level of at least 1.25 m between the stream level and road
level
is
available.
R.C.C.
pipes
should
be
of NP-2
grade
to
IS
: 458
and
shall
have
a minimum diameter of 0.75 m to ensure
easy cleaning. The minimum cushion over the pipe shall be 0.6 m.
It is important to place the pipes on an even
bedding
of granular
soil
or
sand
shaped
to fit the lower portion of pipe to a height of
at least one-fourth the diameter
of the
pipe.
Longitudinal
slope
of the
pipe
should
be
1 in 1000 minimum.
It will be preferable
to
extend
the
pipes
beyond
the roadway till they meet the earth
slopes so that
expensive
headwalls
are
avoided.
The
entrance
should be bell-mouthed to improve hydraulic efficiency.
R.C.C. slab or stone slab culverts may
be
used
where
the
available
difference
in level between the stream bed and road top
is not sufficient to introduce a pipe.
Stone
slab
culverts may
be
advantageous
in
areas
where
suitable
stone
is
easily available.
They can be used for spans upto about 1.5 m.
In
isolated
areas,
where
the
crossing
is generally used by
men,
cattle
or
a
few
light vehicles, empty bitumen or oil drums
with their ends removed
could
be
used
as a temporary crossing.
The
drums
are
placed
one
after
the
other in a line, with earth
cushion
to
a
depth
of
at least 0.6 m on the
top.
These
may,
however, require to be replaced once every 2-3 years.

(2) Foot bridges
In isolated areas, in locations where provision of a motorable
bridge may not be economically feasible and where
a
crossing
is
required
only
for people and cattle, provision of foot bridges will
be an expedient solution.
Foot bridges may
vary
in
shape
and
details of construction depending on the local materials
available.
A
variety
of
materials,
like tree trunks, wooden sections,
R.S.Js
or used rails can be used for the main beams over
which
wooden
deck
could
be
constructed.
In areas where bamboo is available
in plenty, two to four pieces of bamboo can
be
clamped
or
fixed
together to act as a single beam for span upto 3 m.
For foot bridges, the minimum width of deck shall be
1.5 m.
Where
the
crossing
stream
is
deep,
or the water current is fast,
hand railings should be provided.
(3) Timber bridges
In
areas
where
timber
is
locally
available,
it can be used
both
for
the
foundations
and
the
superstructure
of
a
bridge.
Timber
bridges
should
be
considered
as
temporary
structures
having a life span of 10-20 years.
The
foundations
may
consist
of
timber
piles
or
trestles
depending on
local
conditions.
Pile
type
supports
should
be
used when
site
conditions
are
affected
by
deep
water or swift
current
causing
scour,
low
capacity
soil
overlying
rock, or un-
consolidated
soil
with
low
bearing
capacity.
Typical
timber
trestle pier and pile
pier
are
illustrated
in
Fig.
10.
For
spans
greater than 5 m, a double row of piles/trestles should be used
for
the pier.
Timber for the piles
and
other
structural
members
of the
bridge should be creosoted sal wood or any other wood of
similar
quality.
The
cap
or
timber
which
rests directly on the piles/trestles
should consist of creosoted wood 200 mm x 300 mm
in
size
and
long enough to bear all the supports.
The cap is generally fasten-
ed
to
the
supports
by
means
of
drift
pins
which
consist
of
iron rod pieces of about 0.6 m long sharpened at one end.

75
slightly smaller than the size of the drift pin
is
bored down
verti-
cally through the cap just over the centre of each support, and the
pin
dipped
in
hot
bitumen
driven
with
a heavy hammer down
through the cap and
into the
support.
Stringers
or
longitudinal
beams
may
be
of rectangular
or
circular wooden
sections for
spans upto about 6 m.
Beyond this span, rolled steel
joists
(RSJ)
should be used.
All
stringers
should
be
at the same level at the top so that
floor planks will bear evenly on every stringer in a
panel.
If one
stringer
is
slightly
higher
than the rest, turn
it over and trim
it a
little at the ends where
it rests on the cap.
Cutting of the
timber
sections all along the length for achieving the desired
level
should
be avoided.
Decking planks 100 mm thick should be laid with each
plank
nailed
to
one
next to
it so that a solid slab of wood 100 mm thick
is obtained.
The floor should also be creosoted.
(4) Masonry arches for culverts and bridges
Masonry arches for culverts and small bridges will be
found
suitable
where
there
is
sufficient
difference in the level between
the
stream
bed
and
the
road,
and
necessary
skilled labour is
available.
The masonry arches may be either of cement concrete blocks
1:3:6 or dressed stones or bricks in cement mortar
1:3.
Details
of
masonry arches for spans upto 6 m are given in Fig.
11.
(5) Scupper
Scupper
is
an
opening
below the roadway formed by stone
corbelling for cross drainage
purposes.
This
can
be
advantage-
ously
used
in
hilly
areas
where stones are generally available in
abundance.
The scuppers should be built in
such
a manner that
flow
along
the
bed
of natural
water
course
is not obstructed.
Minimum cushion over the scuppers should
be
40 cm.
Scuppers
and culverts on hill roads should be provided with catch pits.
(6) Other types of bridges
Among
the
other
types,
suspension
bridges
will be found
convenient
for
crossing
deep
gorges
in
mountainous
and

Another
type which is used
by the armed
forces and for emergency crossings
is the
Bailey
bridge
which
is
formed by joining pre-fabricated panels and members.
(7) Boat ferries
Ferry is a floating device that operates between two
terminal
points
of
a
road
network interrupted by a water barrier.
Ferry
should normally be considered only
where
the
draft
is
adequate
for
plying
of
boats,
there
is
not much
seasonal fluctuations in
water
level
or
widths,
and
where
the
river
current
is
within
manageable limits.
The site of crossings should allow
the
econo-
mical
construction
of terminal
facilities
sush
as ramps, loading/
unloading
platforms,
etc.

conditions of the river, the ferry will not be safe and the
operation
should be suspended.
For passenger traflSc, country boats having
capacity of 15-20 passengers can
be
operated
economically.
For
transport
of
vehicles
like
lorries
and
passengers/cattle in larger
numbers, large-sized boats or two boats
joined
together may
be
warranted.
(8) Pontoon bridges
Pontoon bridges are temporary means of
crossing
the
water
barriers.
These may
be employed at locations where ferry is not
economically or technically feasible and at
locations
with
difficult
bottom conditions to make fixed bridging uneconomical.
3.5.6.
Signs and guide systems
for
water
crossings:
Gene-
rally, a majority of the low cost water crossings of rural roads
will
have some deficiency or the other as compared to permanent high-
level
structures
on
main
roads.
These may
be
with regard to
submergence
during
the monsoon
season,
or
limitation on load
carrying capacity or roadway width.
All submersible crossings must be provided with flood gauges
to indicate the depth of flow over the roadway for warning the road
users.
Type
design
for
flood
gauge
is given in IRC
: 67.
Also,
guide posts (circular or streamlined in shape)
should
be
provided
at two-metre
centres on either edge of the roadway.
These posts
should be about 0.5 m high, and should be painted white.
For all crossings deficient in load capacity or roadway width,
the
restrictive/warning
signs
should
be
posted
sufficiently
in
advance
on
either
side
for
advance
notification
to
motorists.
Details of these signs are given in IRC
: 67-1977.
3.6.
Construction and Quality Control
3.6.1.
General
(1)
Construction is the phase of operation where
the
design
and
drawings
are
translated
on
to the ground to form the road,
closely following the laid-down
specifications.
Quality
control
is
the
phase
which
runs concurrently with the construction phase to
ensure that the road has been built in accordance with the
design/
drawings and that the specification requirements have been fulfilled



======================================================================
PAGE 90 of 118
======================================================================
78
so
that
one
can
be
sure
of the
performance
expected
of
the
road.
(2)
The construction method
will
depend on
the
type
of
specification and
the
complement of tools and plant available for
the project.
Compaction of subgrade to say 100 per
cent
Proctor
density will be possible only with power rollers.
Surface
dressing
will
require
at least
a
hand operated sprayer, and premix carpet
will call for mechanical mixing equipment.
In
other
words,
the
necessary equipment must be made available if these
specifications
are to be constructible.
It is, therefore, necessary that while choos-
ing the specification and laying down the acceptance limits for
the
work,
the
requirement
of the equipment needed must be worked
out and arrangements made for their availability in working condi-
tion at site.
3.6.2.
Earthwork
(1)
Earthwork constitutes a major component in the
cost
of
any
road
project,
and on the overall basis, the cost of earthwork
may amount to 40-70 per cent of the cost of a rural road.
Careful
site
planning
and
eflicient
operation of the activities involved are
therefore necessary for economising road construction cost.
(2)
Earthwork may be for
forming
the
whole
road
cross-
section upto the surfacing as in the case of earth roads, or upto
the
subgrade
level
for
roads
provided
with
pavement courses.
In
either case, the main
activities
involved
in
earthwork
operations
are
:
(i) Identification of the sources for the embankment material; and
(ii) The earthwork process.
(3)
Generally, the
soil
used
for embankment
construction
should
be
the same
as the one available in the road side borrow
areas or
from
nearby
roadway/drainage
excavation.
Import
of
soil
from
long
distances
should
not ordinarily be considered for
rural roads.
Guidelines for
the
location of roadside
borrowpits
(see IRC: 10
for
more
details)
are
given
in Table 10.
Among
the available soil, the one with better engineering properties (better
soil has higher Proctor density and lower
plasticity
index)
should
be reserved
for
the
top
300 mm
height
of
the
embankment.



======================================================================
PAGE 91 of 118
======================================================================
79
Table 10.
Guidelines for the Location of Roadside Borrowpits
1
.
Location and Shape
Borrowpits should be
rectangular
in
shape
with
one
side
parallel
to
the
centre
line
of the
road.
If on road land, they should be dug as near the
road boundary as possible.
In any case, no borrowpits
should
be dug
within
5 m of the toe of the final section of the road
embankment,
after making due
allowance for future development.
Borrowpits
should
not
be
dug
continuously.
Ridges
of not less than
8 m width should be left at intervals not exceeding 300 m.
Small drains
should
be cut through the ridges to facilitate drainage.
2.
Depth
The depth of borrowpits should be so regulated that
:
(a)
The bottom
of the pits do not cut an imaginary line having a slope
of
1
: 4 projected from
the
edge
of the
final
section
of
the
road
embankment;
(b)
The
bed
level
of
the
pits should slope down progressively towards
the nearest cross drain, if any,
and should
not be
lower
than
the
bed of the cross drain;
(c)
Where
the
pits
are on
temporarily
acquired
cultivable
land,
the
depth
should
not
exceed
450 mm.
The
top
soil
to
a depth of
150 mm
should
be
stripped and
stacked
aside.
Thereafter
soil
may be dug to a
further
depth
not
exceeding
300 mm.
The
top
soil should then be spread back on the land.
3.
Special Cases
(a)
In waterlogged areas the borrowpits should take
the form
of deep
narrow continuous ditches, connected with
natural
drainage,
so
as
to conserve as much land as possible.
(b)
Borrowpits should not be dug
within
800 m
of towns
or
villages.
If unavoidable, they should not exceed 300 mm in depth and
should
be drained.
(c)
Where
the
road embankment
is
used
as
flood
bank,
as
far
as
possible,
earth
should
be borrowed only from the river side.
The
inner edge of any borrowpit should not be less than
15 m from
the
toe
of the bank.
Where borrowing earth from the landside cannot
be avoided, a berm at least 25 m
wide
should
be
left
between
the
borrowpit and toe of the bank.
The toe of the bank on the rear side should have a cover of 750 mm
to 1.25 m over the saturation line drawn at a
slope
of
1
in
6 from
the high flood level on the river side.

======================================================================
80
A quick estimation of
plasticity
index
can be had by the Uppal's
Syringe method.
The method consists of making
a
paste
of
soil
passing
425 micron
sieve
by adding sufficient quantity of water so
as to bring
it close to the plastic limit state.
The
paste
is
put
in
the
syringe
and
pushed through the holes.
If the thread coming
out of the holes is unbroken and shiny, the PI
can
be
considered
to
be
m.ore than
10.
The threads do not com.e out of the syringe
for soils having PI less than
5.
For soils with PI between 5 and
10,
the texture of the threads
is not smooth.
(4)
The earthwork process involves the following activities
:
(i) Excavation—This is for winning soil for the embankment which may
be from
the roadside borrow areas, or from nearby roadway/drain-
age excavation.
Excavation in
hard
soils
can
be
facilitated
by
prewetting, or pre-ripping with a plough.
(ii) Hauling and depositing —This includes the hauling of
the
excavated
material and
depositing
the same in layers at the embankment site
directly.
The activities of excavation, hauling and depositing should
be combined i^to single task so that double handling of the material
is avoided.
(iii) Breaking
clods—Clods
of
earth
which
contain
clay,
exceeding
150 mm
in
size
should be broken either at the excavation site or at
the embankment.
If left in position,
the clods
with
unslaked
clay
in them will
not only
permit
proper compaction
but
also
create
problems of unequal expansion in the presence of water.
(iv) Adjustment
for
raoistiire—For
a
constant
compactive
effort, the maximum
density
will
be
achieved
at
a
particular
moisture content which is termed the
optimum
moisture
content
(OMC).
The OMC
will
depend on
the type
of
soil
and
the
intensity of compactive effort.
For
the
same
soil, OMC will be
lower for higher compactive
effort
than
for
smaller
compactive
effort.
For the type of soil used
in
the
embankment,
the OMC
should be determined corresponding to the
proposed
compactive
effort which
is normally Proctor compaction.
In
actual
working,
the moisture content
is
maintained
within
a
tolerance
of ±
1.5
per cent of OMC.
However,
for
highly
expansive
clay?,
it
is
preferable to compact these at about 2 to 4 per cent on the
higher
side of OMC.
This is for the reason that such clays
compacted at
lower moisture
content
im.bibe
considerable
water subsequently

showing
signs
of

Moisture may be adjusted either at the borrow area or
after
the soil has been delivered at the embankment site.

(v) Spreading in layers—The compaction plant
can
exert
its
effective compactive effort only upto a certain depth.
It is, there-
fore, necessary that the material for compaction
is spread in layers
not exceeding
this
critical
depth.
For
8-10 tonne
3-wheeled
rollers normally used in the country, the thickness
of
loose
layer
should not exceed 225 mm.
For lighter rollers, the layer thickness
will have to be lower than this figure.
(vi) Compaction—This
is
the
most
imf)ortant
phase
of
embankment construction.
The
type
of compaction
equipment
appropriate for the job will depend on the type of soil to be
com-
pacted.
However, three-wheeled
power
rollers
will
be
found
suitable
for
most
soils,
though
sheepfoot
roller
will
be
more
appropriate for clayey soils.
Three-wheeled power rollers are also required
for
compact-
ing the pavement
courses.
It
is,
therefore,
necessary
that
all
efforts should be made to procure this piece
of equipment
which
has the most crucial role to play in the construction of rural roads.
The level of compaction
should
not
be allowed to go below the
following
:
Top 300 mm of embankment
95 per cent Proctor
forming subgrade
density
Body of embankment
90 per cent Proctor
density
There may, however, be isolated areas
where
limited
rural
road works may have to be done but no power roller can be made
available. In such cases, tractor-drawn/animal-drawn/hand-drawn



======================================================================
PAGE 96 of 118
======================================================================
84
rollers
may
be
used.
The
layer
thickness
may,
however,
be
reduced and the number of passes increased to achieve
a
reason-
able level of compaction.
Two designs
of animal-drawn
rollers
are illustrated in Photos 2 and 3.
These
are
capable of compac-
tion upto about 90 per cent Proctor density.
3.6.3.
PaYement courses
(1) As discussed in para 3.4, a variety of materials are
possi-
ble for in use in pavement courses
depending
on
availability and
suitability.
The effort should
be
towards
maximising
utilisation
of the following m_aterials/techniques in pavement construction
:
(i) Locally available softer
aggregates
in
whatever form
they
occur,
either in virgin state or after treatment, see Table 8 for
the manner
of their use.
(ii) Stabilisation of local soil for improving the
engineering properties-
see Table 7 for the choice of appropriate stabilisation technique.
(2) In soil stabilisation, the important operations are pulveri-
sation
of
the
soil,
uniform
mixing
of the
stabiliser
with
the
soil and compaction
of the mixed material with power roller to a
density not less than 95 per cent Proctor.
Pulverisation is difficult
in clayey soils and
it would
be
advantageous to use some sort of
equipment.
Most
versatile
equipm^ent
in
this regard is the agri-
cultural tractor
to
which
m.ould-board
plough, disc-harrow and
off-set harrov/ could
be
hitched
for
processing
the
soil.
After
achieving
the
required
degree
of
pulverisation
(100
per
cent
passing 25 mm sieve and
60 per cent
passing 4.75 mm sieve),
the
soil is levelled, moisture content adjusted, and the stabiliser spread
over it manually.
The off-set harrov/ is then used for
4-6
passes
for mixing.
After levelling, the layer
is
compacted
with
power
roller.
For heavy clays, pre-treatment with lime may be
adopted
for aiding pulverisation.
(3)
In
the
purely
manual
method,
the
soil
is cut several
times with hoe/spade for
pulverising
it.
The
stack
of the cut soil
is
then
made,
moisture adjusted and stabiliser spread on
it.
The
whole stack is then turned over 4-6 times till uniformity
to
mixing
is achieved.
(4)
In
soil
stabilisation
works,
the amount
of
stabiliser
should be determined in advance
in
the
laboratory
for
satisfying



======================================================================
PAGE 97 of 118
======================================================================
85
the
specified
strength
criteria.
Tt
will
be
advantageous
to add
about 1/2 p^r cent extra
stabiliser
to
cover
possible
loss
during
spreading
and
non-uniform mixing in the field.
When lime
is the
stabiliser, its quantity should
be
regulated
in
terms
of available
calcium oxide content.
(5)
Water
bound macadam
construction
depends
for
its
strength
on
complete
rolling
to
interlocking of the coarse aggre-
gates.
It will, therefore, not be
advisable
to
start
on
this
type
of
construction
unless
suitable
power
rollers
in
working
order
are
available
at site.
Also, this type of consti-uction will require a
lot of water for driving
in
the
screening/filler
material.
Adjust-
ments in the working season are also, therefore, called for.
(6)
For rural
roads
where
bituminous
surfacing
is
to
be
provided,
the
choice may
fall on either surface dressing or open-
graded thin premix surfacing.
Surface dressing (single or two-coat)
is
simple
to
lay from the angle of tools and plant, but the surface
should receive reasonable amount of pneumatic traffic
so
that
the
binder can work up to embedded chips properly.
Where sufficient
pneumatic traffic is not expected, surface dressing
with
pre-coated
chippings can be adopted with advantage.
(7)
Premix carpet construction will warrant
suitable
mixer,
atleast
an
improvised
one.
It
will
be advantageous to heat the
aggregate separately prior
to
mixing
with
bitumen
for
ensuring
better coating.
3.6.4.
Qoality control
(1)
The road work may be executed
departmentaliy
or
let
out
on
contract,
but
in
either
case the basis of construction
v>^ill
be the drawings and the specifications.
It
will
bs
incumbent on
the
Engineer-in-Charge
to
ensure that the materials incorporated
and the work executed
are
in
accordance
with
the
specification
requirements.
(2)
For
ascertaining whether the material or work conforms
to specification requirem.ents,
objective
testing
will
be
required.
The whole
operation of controlling the quality of the materials and
the work with the help of
objective
tests
performed
at
predeter-
mined frequency generally goes by the term "quality control".



======================================================================
PAGE 98 of 118
======================================================================
86
(3)
For
small
works,
quality
control can be performed by
the construction staff itself, but for large
works,
e.g.,
construction
of a
large number of rural roads in a single area,
it will be advan-
tageous to have separate quality
control
unit
independent
of the
construction staff.
(4)
The construction specification normally
adopted
in
the
country
are
tailored
to
a combination of both procedural control
and end point control.
For example, in the case of earthwork, the
specifications
not
only
stipulate
the
control
on moisture content
at the time of compaction and layer thickness
(which
are
controls
on
the
process) but also on the final compacted density (end point
control).
Control at all stages of construction
is
therefore,
neces-
sary to achieve the desired characteristics of the completed work.
(5)
Among the quality control
tests,
some
are
crucial,
i.e.
those
relating
to
the
properties
which
have
a
telling
effect on
the performance.
Such
crucial
tests
are
listed
in
Table
11
for
pointed
attention
with recommended
frequency of testing.
This
does not mean
that
tests
to
control
other
properties
are
not
warranted.
(6)
Achievement of good quality work can
be
helped
to
a
great
extent
through care and attention at the material survey and
investigation stage itself.
It is at this stage
that
properties
of the
available
soils and
other
materials
are tested to choose the most
appropriate material with
identified
source.
Considerable
testing
work
at
the quality control stage could be obviated if it is ensured
that the material delivered at site is
from
the
same
pre-identified
source.
For example, repetitive testing of aggregates for aggregate
impact value could be obviated (except
perhaps where
the quality
changes or is in doubt) if it is made
sure
that
the
aggregates
are
delivered from a pre-tested quarry.
(7)
Quality control operations
for
rural
road
construction
will
require
a variety of laboratory equipment.
A list of the mini-
mum equipment
required
for
a
rural
road
project
is
given
in
Table
12.
It
will
be advantageous if these equipment are carried
in a m.obile laboratory so that
a
good
coverage
of a
large
area
can be had quickly and effectively.

Table 13.
Bkoad Outline of Some of the Common Tests on
MATtRTALS AND WORK
1
.
Deterjiiinatioil of Moisu-re Content of Soils (IS: 2720, Pt. 11)
Where facilities are available, the method consists of drying a sample
of
the soil in the oven at K)5-i .lO"C for a period
i normally not mofc than 24
hours)
till the dry weight of the soil becomes constant.
In the field, the alcohol method, though less accurate, can be ust d
as
a
quick test.
It consists of taking ihe soil specimen in a evaporating dish, pouring
over
it methylated spirit at the rate of about one millilitre for each gram of
soil,
mixing
the
two
materials
and
igniting the spirit.
After burning av^ay of the
spirit, the dish
is cooled and weighed.
2.
Liquid Limit and Piastic Limit (IS: 2720, Pt. V )
The liquid limit test is conducted on the standard
instrument
with
soil
specimens at various moisture contents.
The liquid limit is taken as
that
mois-
ture content where the standard groove will close under an impact of 25 blows.
The plastic limit is the water content at
Vvhich
the
soil
will
begin
to
crumble
v/hen
rolled
into a thread of 3 mm in diameter.
The Plasticity Index
is taken as the difference between liquid limit and plastic limit.
3.
Moisture-Deiisity Relationship (IS: 2720, Parts Vli Sc Vfl!)
Two degrees of compaction, light compactic n
(IS: 2720,
Part Vli)
and
heavy
compaction
(IS: 2720, Part VIII) are usually specified.
The former com-
paction also goes by the term Proctor compaction.
In light compaction, the v/et soil
is compacted in
three
equal
layers
by
the rammer of weight 2.6 kg and free fall 31 cm with 25 evenly distributed
blows
on
each
layer.
In
heavy compaction, rammer weighs 4.89 kg and the free fall
is 45 cm.
Compaction is done in 5 equal layers, each being given 25 blows.
The procedure
is to compact the soil
with
different
moisture
contents
and
drawing
a moisture-density curve to find out the maximum dry density and
the corresponding moisture content (CMC).
4.
In-sita Density by Sand Replacement Method (IS: 2720, Pt. XXVUI)
The principle of the method
is to find the volume of a
hole
cut
in
the
layer to be tested by filling it up with sand of known density.
Moisture content
of the soil sample is determined to work out the dry density.
A hole roughly 10 cm dia. and 15 cm deep
is made
and
the
excavated
^ soil
is
carefully collected and weighed.
Sand pouring cyli.ider is placed on the
hole and the sand allov/ed to run to fill up the hole.
5.
Core Cutter Method (iS: 2720, Part XXIX)
In this method, a metallic ring of known dimensions is pushed or
driven
by
a hammer into the compacted soil layer and the compacted soil after trimm-
ing both the faces flush with the ring, is
weighed
and
the
dry
density
deter-
mined.
The application of this method is rather limited to fine grained cohesive
soils.

6.
Aggregate Impact Value (IS: 2386, Part IV)
The apparatus consists of a metal base and
a
cylindrical
steel
cup
of
internal dia.
10,2 cm and depth 5 cm in which the aggregate specimen is
placed.
Metal
hammer
13.5-14.0 kg
weight
having
a
free fall from a height 38 cm is
arranged to drop through vertical guides.
Aggregate
sample
passing
12.5 mm
sieve
and
retained
on
10 mm
sieve is filled in the steel cup in three layers by
tamping each layer with 25 blows.
After subjecting
the
test
specimen
to
15
blows,
the
crushed
aggregate is sieved through 2.36 mm sieve.
The Aggregate
Impact Value is expressed as the percentage of fines formed in terms of the total
weight of the sample.
7.
Tray Test for Control of Rate of Spread of Binder (IRC SP: 11)
Light metal trays of about 20 cm x 20 cm and
3 cm
deep,
previously
weighed
and numbered are placed at intervals along the road in the path ofthe
binder distributor.
After passing of the distributor the
trays
are
removed
to
find
out
the
rate
of
spread of binder.
Tests with such trays at a number of
locations can also indicate the uniformity of distribution.

Maintenance
3.7.1.
General
:
Road maintenance
is an operation of keep-
ing the facility as
nearly
as
possible
in
its
original condition as
constructed, or
as
subsequently
improved to provide satisfactory
level of service for
movement
of goods
and
passengers.
Safe-
guarding the investments already made, extending
the life of the
road, better facility of travel
and
creating
a good
image
of the
Government in public eyes are some
of the
advantages
of good
maintenance.
Maintenance
of rural
roads
which
are
spread
throughout the country is somewhat complex because
of the
low
cost specification adopted,
differences
in
prevailing
construction
practices,
terrain,
soil
type,
climate,
types of
locally
available
materials, resources both organisational and
financial,
and
quite
often there is a tendency
to
ignore
their
importance
because
of
their lower ranking in the heirarchy of road system.
A
conscious
effort is, therefore, needed
to
understand the inter-play of several
factors in developing optimum
maintenance
management systems
under different situations.

ort needed in the maintenance of lower-order
roads
like MDR,
ODR and VR in the year 1978.
A summary of the recommenda-
tions of this Committee
is given
in
Table
14.
The norms
reco-
mmended by the Committee
are by
and
large
physical
norms
which can be quantified in terms of money from time to
time and
from place to place depending on the prevailing cost
of materials
and wage rates.
(2) Though
the
recommendations
of
the Committee
have
been there since some years, the general experience has been
that
maintenance funds commensurating with the needs are
not
being
made available.
It
is,
therefore,
necessary
that
the
available
resources are put to best possible use.
From this angle,
action in
the following directions will be helpful
:
(i) Close inspection of the road
prior
to, during
and
after
rains
in
identification and correction of defects.
In this country rain
is
the
major source of damage
to
the
roads.
Close
inspection
of the
road prior to rains and appropriate
corrective measures
can ward
off major damage that might
happen had no
action
been
taken.

For example, a choaked drain can cause rise
in
water
level which
might overtop and wash out the road.
Simple action
to
clear
out
the drains of debris could have warded off such
a
danger.
Impor-
tant
points
to
be
looked
for
during
the
inspection
are listed in
Table 15 for guidance.
(ii) Maintenance
activities may
run
into
several numbers and types.
While some generally crop up only in a particular season and which
will have to be attended
to
urgently, some
others
are
of
routine
type and can
be
attended to
in any
time
during
the
year.
For
optimum utilisation of the available resources,
it
is
necessary
that
the maintenance activities are listed out and prioritised.
Based
on
this priority list, a calendar of activities could be drawn
up
for
the
day-to-day working of the maintenance gangs.
3.7.3.
Maintenance operations
(1) The
various
maintenance
operations
can
be
broadly
classified into three categories
:
(i) Routine maintenance, comprising patch repairs; heavy berm
repairs;
arboriculture and landscaping;
maintenance of and repairs to road-
side drains,
road
signs,
inspection
bungalows,
rest
houses, and
godowns; and
(ii) collection
of data
such
as
trafific
data,
which
are
required to be
carried out by the maintenance staff once or twice every year.
(iii) Periodic maintenance, which consists of work items such as
renewal
of the wearing surface that are to be carried
out
periodically
every
few years.
(iv) Special
repairs, and
flood and
rain damage repairs, which consist
of
repairs
to
the embankment, pavement, culverts, road furniture,
etc., necessitated by landslides, earthquakes,
cyclones,
heavy
rains/
cloud bursts, floods, etc. the nature and extent of such repair
works
could not be foreseen or predicted.
(2) The
details
of
these maintenance activities are indicated
in the following paras.
Before starting with
the
work,
it
should
be ensured
that
adequate
arrangements
(which
include
the
erection of barriers, signs, and red flags/lights/reflectors) are made
for the
safety of the
traflfic,
workmen,
pedestrians,
cattle,
etc;
and wherever possible, the work should
be
confined
to
half
the
pavement width at a time leaving the other half for the traffic,
and
if that is not possible and if short alternative routes are
not
avail-
able, diversion roads may have to be provided for the traffic.

Paicti repairs
These are carried out to rectify local
distresses
in
the
pave-
ment.
The
distress may
be
manifested
in
the
form
of loss of
material from the pavement crust resulting in
pothole,
or
uneven
surfaces
due
to
localised ruts, settlement/consolidation, etc.
The
need
for
patching
is
usually
the first indication of major distress
to the pavement.
More often, the principal cause for
the
distress
happens to be the lack of proper drainage.
Each location requiring
patching should
be
examined
carefully
to
identify
the causes of
the
distress,
so
that
suitable maintenance measures can be taken
not only to rectify the
damage
but
also
to
prevent
or
delay
its
recurrence.
Regular
and
frequent
dragging
can
be done on earth and
gravel roads for filling-in ruts and potholes as soon as these defects
appear
and
dressing
the
road
to
proper
camber.
This can be
accomplished by a mechanical power grader if available,
or
by
a
v/ooden
drag
consisting
of two halves of a log of v>'ood 2.6 to 3 m
long and about 250 mm dia., framed together to be
approximately
2 m apart.
Dragging cannot be very effective on a dry or too
soft
a
surface
and
hence
it
shall
preferably
be done after a shower
when the surface
is
just
m^oist.
The number
of passes
needed
with the drag will depend on the length of the drag and
the
width
of the road.
In
the
case
of roads
having WBM as the wearing course,
patch
repairs
to
rectify
localised
potholes,
ruts,
corrugations,
ravelling damaged edges, etc., should be done by cutting
the
road
to
regular
shape
upto
the
affected
depth, and then laying fresh
material and compacting.
For bituminous surfaces, the rectification of potholes
consists
of squaring
the
edges
of
the
hole
and
cutting the hole to solid
material with vertical edges before filling up
the
hole
v^^ith
fresh
gravel, WBM
and/or
bituminous
materials, depending upon the
depth of the hole.
Before applying bituminous
patch
material,
a
tack
coat
at
the
rate of 7.5 kg per 10 sq.m. area shall be applied
on all the surfaces of the hole that would come in contact with
the
bituminous
patch
material.
The
bituminous patch material shall
be a
prepared
premix
conforming
to
clause
5.6
'Premix open-

graded
patching'
of IRC
: 82-1982.
For
rectifying
iinevenness,
the uneven area is first defined by a string
line
and
marked;
the
area
upto
atleast
0.3 m beyond
the
marked
area on all sides
is
thoroughly cleaned, and on the uneven area, a tack
coat
followed
by premixed
bituminous
patch
material
is
applied
as per clause
5.6 of IRC
: 82-1982.
For treatment of other types of defects in bituminous surfaces,
the procedures indicated in IRC
: 82-1982 should be followed.
Berm repairs
Heavy repairs
to
the
berms may be necessitated because of
loss of material
or
settlement,
due
to
the
action
of the
traffic
(passing/overtaking vehicles) and environment
(rains, v/ind, etc.).
BermiS may
be
restored
to
their
proper
longitudinal
and
transverse profiles by applying the drag.
The drag would
not be
eifective if the berm surface is dry or too soft, and hence dragging
may be resorted to after a shower when the surface
is just moist.
It should be ensured that berms upto a width of 30 to 50 cm
from the edge of the pavement
are
maintained
properly
so
that
lateral support to the pavement is assured.
In
the
case
of
grass
shoulders, a careful watch should be kept to ensure that the
grass
does not trap the material
washed
off
the
road
by
rains,
thus
raising of the
level of the shoulder
adjacent to the pavement with
the result that the water stagnates at the edge of the pavement.
Arboriculture and landscaping
The road might have grass on the berms, side
slopes
of
the
embankment and
side
ditches;
or
other
plants/shrubs including
trees along the
road
to
prevent
soil
erosion/shifting
sand-dunes
from, affecting the road, or for
providing
shade,
etc.
Also
tree-
guards/fences might also have been provided.
These will require
proper miaintenance by
way
of mowing,
pruning,
lopping,
and
felling in the case of grass/trees and repairs/painting
for
the
tree-
guards and fences.
Further,
wherever
the
trees
get
uprooted
during the storms, etc., they are to be cleared speedily.
Roadside drainage
It is
essential that the roadside drainage system is maintained



======================================================================
PAGE 110 of 118
======================================================================
98
properly to
avoid
serious
damages
to
the
pavement
and
the
shoulder.
Maintenance measures in this regard are of two parts
the maintenance of side drains/catch
water drains and the mainte-
nance of cross-drainage
structures
like
culverts,
causeways
and
bridges, retaining walls, breast walls, etc.
The maintenance of the side drains
includes the
removal of
accumulated
silt, debris, leaves,
etc.,
from
the
drains,
repairing
the linings if provided,
and
restoring
the
profile
of the
whole
drain.
These operations are done atleast twice in the rainy season
and a careful watch kept
to
ensure
that
the
drains
do
not
get
chocked up by accidental slips of side earth.
The
bottom
of the
side drain should be maintained atleast
1 m
below
the
formation
level of the road.
The
silt,
etc.,
removed from
the side
drain
shall be disposed
off
suitably;
if conditions permit, these may be
thrown at least 2 m from the
side drain on the side away from the
road; where possible, leaves etc.,
can
be
disposed off by burning
them.
Under no
circumstances
should
the
silt,
etc.,
removed
from the side drains be
utilised
for
repairing
the
road
surface.
Where silting of
the
side
drains
occur
frequently,
realigning of
the side drains may be considered
for
increasing
the
velocity
of
flow.
Cross drainage structures, retaining
walls and
breast
walls
should be periodically
inspected
and
necessary
repairs
carried
out.
In the case of cross drainage structures,
it should be ensured
that they never remain clogged due
to
silting,
debris,
etc.
They
should also be protected
against
erosion/scouring and
structural
damage.
It may be emphasized here that a clogged drain or cross
drainage structure may prove more dangerous to a rural road than
the provision of no drains at all, as
the
defective
drain
increases
the chances of waterlogging and
water
gaining
access to sub-base
and base courses.
Where the culverts are too small for a man to get
inside for
observation and clearance work, suitable
long-handled
shovels or
shovels attached to
rods
can
be
used
to
probe
and
clear
silt,
vegetation, and
debris.
Trees
or
branches
obstructing
culvert
entrances might require to be
sawn
into
smaller
pieces
to
help
their removal.
Culverts which frequently get
clogged
by
debris
should preferably be provided with grills on the upstream entrance.



======================================================================
PAGE 111 of 118
======================================================================
99
Erosion/scouring
and
structural
damage
should also be rectified
by filling with gravel and
compacting
it, and
recurrence
be
pre-
vented by taking
suitable
rneasures such
as protecting
it with rip-
rap, concrete, stone gabions,
or
mattresses on
the
downstream
side of the
outlet,
if
necessary, the
discharge
velocity may
be
reduced by increasing the area of
cross-section of the culvert and/
or reducing
its gradient, or
masonary/concrete
fan
discharge
or
drop outlets may be provided.
Road signs
The road signs/trafiic aid devices are provided to give
proper
guidance to the traffic and
to
ensure, road
safety.
As
such
the
maintenance
of these
is an important part of the overall mainten-
ance activity.
Missing signs and direction posts shall
be
replaced
promptly.
Painting
of road
signs, guard/parapet rails, kilometre
stones and
boundary
stones,
and
numbering
of
cross
. drainage
structures should be done wherever required and cleaning of these
to
remove
dust,
vegetation,
etc.,
should
be
carried out
atleast
twice a year so that the signs etc., would be visible to the traffic.
Periodic maintenance
Whatever be the
type
of the
pavement,
it
needs
periodic
renewal of the wearing surface to maintain
it
in
a
traffic
worthy
condition.
The
type
and
periodicity of the renewal depend upon
the type and quality of materials used in the existing pavement,
the
climate, terrain, and traffic volume and intensity.
In the case of earth roads,
it
is
necessary
to
lay
one
layer
of moorum
or
gritty
earth
for
15 cm thickness
once
in
3 years
followed
by
rolling.
For WBM
surfaces,
after
scarifying and
loosening
the
existing surface and reshaping, fresh stone metal for
an additional thickness of 7.5 cm thickness needs
to
be
laid
once
in 3
years, and adequately compacted with a road roller to at least
95 per cent Proctor
density.
In
the
case
of bituminous
surfaces
the
following
practice is recommended
: for roads in plain terrain,
a renewal coat of surface dressing
as
per IRC: 17-1965
shall
be
provided
once
in
4
years
after
bringing the road to the correct
gradient and camber by necessary
patch
work;
where
the
traffic
intensity
is
high
or
on
special
locations
on these rural roads in



======================================================================
PAGE 112 of 118
======================================================================
100
plains, premix carpet as per IRC
: 14-1977 may
be
laid
once
in
6
years.
For
roads in hilly terrain, surface dressing is not recom-
mended because there are
likely
to
be
many
curves
where
the
grit flies off under the action of pneumatic tyres; and hence
premix
carpet
according
to
IRC
: 14-1977
should
be
provided
as
the
renewal coat once in 6 years, after bringing the road to the
correct
gradient and camber by necessary patchwork.
Special repairs, and flood and rain damage repairs
Any damage to the pavement/shoulder, side drains
or
cross-
drainage
structures,
embankments,
retaining
walls,
breast walls,
etc. due to natural calamities like landslides, earthquakes,
cyclones
or
heavy
rains,
cloud
bursts, and
floods should be immediately
repaired or the facility reconstructed
to
restore
it
to
the
proper
condition.
3.7.4.
Maintenance management
(1)
General
:
The objectives of Maintenance
Management
are
to
plan
and
programme
the
maintenance
activities making
optimal use of the
resources
of men,
materials,
machinery
and
money
so that the planned works are performed to a traffic-worthy
condition.
The
steps
to
achieve
these
objectives
are
discussed
below.
(2)
Road data banks
:
A proper management decision could
be
taken
only when
sufficient data are available on the problem.
Hence
it is of vital necessity
to
collect and
compile
all
relevant
data about the road and its environment and
the
resources
avail-
able
to
maintain
the
road
network.
These
data should also be
updated regularly.
It
is recommended
that
the
following
data
may be made available in the road data banks.
(i) Road
cross-section
including
pavement,
composition
(type
and
thickness) shoulders, height of embankment, side slope, etc.
(ii) Geometries of the alignment.
»
(iii) Details
of various
structures
along
the road
viz.,
cross
drainage
structures, roadside drains, breast
walls,
retaining
walls,
kilometre
stone, traffic signs, inspection bungalows, rest houses, godowns,
etc.
(iv) Condition of the road—pavement surface
condition
(rutting,
pot-
holes, etc.), condition of shoulder, and side drains.
(v) The maintenance history of the road—the date and type
of
mainte-
nance put in, and
its subsequent performance.



======================================================================
PAGE 113 of 118
======================================================================
101
(vi)
Traffic volumes and the quarterly rate and type of accidents.
(vii) Data regarding the funds made available, men, materials and equip-
ment and also their achievements/performance in the previous years;
changes
in
available
resources and possible improvements in them;
spare-parts inventory, etc.
Each state shoiiid
possess
a
suitable
machinery
to
collect,
analyse and compile these data, update them regularly, and appro-
priately utilise them.
(3)
Stawdards of maintenance
: The next step in maintenance
management
will
be
to
evolve
reference
standards
to help the
maintenance staff to take the right decisions.
In a systems concept,
there are three distinct types of reference standards
:
(i) Quality standards which define the level of quality
below which
the
various
components
of
the
road should not fall, so that the road
users are given a satisfactory level of service from the
technical and
economic
points
of
view.
These standards are the basis for deter-
mining v^hen and what type
of
maintenance
activities
are
to
be
provided
to
the
road
network.
Cracking, rutting, potholing, etc.
are the parameters used to assess the quality level.
(ii) Quantity standards, which indicate the resources required to achieve
the necessary level of service; and
(iii) Operational standards, which specify the working method
and
crew

consistent
with
a
reasonable level of productivity for
each maintenance activity possible.
These standards be revised and
improved based on the achieved possible output in the field.

Operational management
:
For
proper management of
the resources allocated for maintenance, the objectives to be aimed
at should be reduction in costs for a defined quality of work, better
woik perfoimance within the same
cost and
proper
deployment
of
men
and
machinery
to
ensure
an
optimal utilisation of the
available resources.
For this,
it is necessary to
identify
the
basic
maintenance
activities,
quantum
of work
needed
in
relation to
quality standards and the resources needed to fulfil these
tasks
in
terms of materials, machinery and man-hours.
Having done
this,
it
would
be easy to prepare a work schedule for weekly, monthly,
quarterly and yearly operations.
In this way,
it
will
be
possible
to move
from
a
purely
financial accounting system to a rational
process of analytical management.

Modernisation of
maintenance
management
may
involve
radical changes in traditional working methods.
Mobile system of
gangs
in
the
place
of the time-honoured labour groups, who are
practically immobile and have little
or
no
equipment
will
go
a
long way
in
streamlining
the
routine maintenance work.
The
maintenance personnel should also be given periodic training.
