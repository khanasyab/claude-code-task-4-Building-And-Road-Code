FOREWORD
Over the years, the CPWD Works Manual has served as a guide book for CPWD. The Government
of India in the last few years has introduced several new provisions/ instructions on public procurement.
Some of these important changes include introduction of Central Public Procurement Portal (CPPP),
Government e-Marketplace (GeM), preferential market access for micro and small enterprises, preference
for domestic manufacturers, Contracts on EPC mode etc. The Department of Expenditure has also issued
General Financial Rules (GFR) 2017, “Manual for Procurement of Goods 2017” and “Manual for
Procurement of Consultancy and Other Services 2017”.
With new emerging construction technologies gaining dominance over the conventional construction
practices and with the rising expectations of various stakeholders for timely delivery of the projects, there
is a need for transformative changes requiring revision of the Works Manual to make it more nimble,
effective and delivery oriented, rather than being process centric with obsolete provisions.
This Works Manual has been written covering, inter-alia, the set of instructions contained in the
GFR 2017 and the two manuals issued by the Department of Expenditure. It is also in consonance with
the fundamental principles of service delivery, customer focus, efficiency, transparency, fairness,
competition, economy and accountability. Efforts have been made to cover all major aspects of construction
and maintenance in a user-friendly manner while having the necessary flexibility to quickly respond to the
varying scale and complexities of the requirements of the clients.
There were extensive consultations with various stakeholders at all levels including the MoHUA
and the E & Y team. I am confident that CPWD officers, by using the present Manual, will be able to ensure
quality and speedy delivery of works. Manual issued by CPWD is to be taken as a repository of mandatory
provisions with the spirit of effective execution of works.
I would like to acknowledge the lead taken by Shri Manu Amitabh, Chief Engineer CSQ (Civil), and
dedicated efforts of Shri Sudhir Kr. Dak, SE(C&M), Shri Ashish Kumar Singh, Director (Finance),
Shri Shivani Kaushal EE(Manual), Shri A. K. Sikka, EE(Contract), Shri Vimal Khetan, EE(E), CSQ,
Shri. M.C. Singhal, EE(QA), CSQ, Shri D.S. Adhikari, AE (QA), CSQ and all other officers of CSQ under
dynamic leadership of Dr K M Soni, ADG(TD) and other units who have individually provided their valuable
inputs in revision of this Manual.

PREFACE
CPWD Works Manual was last published in the year 2014. Over the years, various guidelines
have been issued on procurement policies by the Government of India. GFR 2017 has also been brought
out, which further enabled an efficient and effective framework of fiscal management while providing the
necessary flexibility to facilitate timely delivery of services.
Further, the need to bring about changes in CPWD especially the need for business process
re-engineering has been engaging the attention of the MoHUA. In the above background, the MoHUA
commissioned a study on the ‘Working and reorganization of CPWD’ through Ernst & Young (E&Y) in May,
2017. The objective of the assignment was, inter-alia, to study in detail the working of CPWD keeping in view its
mandate and functions, to carry out an analysis of its structure and organization and to suggest measures for
enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the organization by ensuring optimal utilization of resources. One
of the prime recommendations of E&Y was to redraft the CPWD Works Manual in line with the latest trends in
the construction sector and global best practices and to make it concise, effective and delivery oriented.
In view the above, ‘CPWD Works Manual 2014’ has been re-written and revised as
‘CPWD Works Manual 2019’ by making major conceptual changes therein.
This Manual, details the mandatory provisions whereas the workflow processes form part of the
SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures). Efforts have been made to make the Manual user friendly by
arranging the chapters as per the sequence of execution of works and by introduction of “Definitions” and
“Glossary of Terms”. A write up on “About the Manual” has been incorporated to facilitate field officers.
Every effort has been made to bring out the Works Manual 2019 with utmost precision and accuracy.
However, if any discrepancy is noticed herein, it may be brought to the attention of Chief Engineer (CSQ)
(Civil), CPWD, Room No. 325-A, Nirman Bhawan, New Delhi- 110011.
I am grateful to Shri Prabhakar Singh, Director General, CPWD, without whose worthy guidance
and support, it would not have been possible to complete the assiduous and challenging task of
re-writing this Manual. I also acknowledge the lead taken by Shri Manu Amitabh, Chief Engineer, CSQ
(Civil), Shri G C Kabi, Former Chief Engineer (CSQ) and the efforts of Shri Sudhir Kumar Dak, SE(C&M),
Shri Ashish Kumar Singh, Director (Finance), Shri Shivani Kaushal EE(Manual), Shri A. K. Sikka, EE(CSQ),
Shri Vimal Khetan, EE(E), CSQ, Shri. M.C. Singhal, EE(QA), CSQ, Shri D.S. Adhikari, AE (QA), CSQ
and all other members of his team who deserve deep appreciation for their sincere and untiring efforts in
bringing out this Manual.

Annexure -2 and in SOP 2/2. For Submission of PE/ RE for grant of A/A and E/S for Capital
Works of GPRA/ GPOA Scheme funded through MoHUA Grant details are as given in SOP 2 /3.
2.13 Charged Expenditure
(1) All expenditure connected with the satisfaction of decrees of the Courts is to be treated as
‘Charged’ expenditure for payment of award on budgeted works. The payments made in
satisfaction of Court decrees etc., in the following cases will not, however, be treated as
‘Charged’ expenditure:
(a) (i) Payment of awards under Land Acquisition Act.
(ii) Payment of compensation under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923.
(iii) Payment of awards by Arbitrators under Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
(iv) Payment by Arbitrators under Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.
(b) Payments involving refunds of revenue and security deposits lodged by the contractor
and kept in the Public Accounts.
(2) In case of (a) above, the payments should be made out of the Voted portion of the grants. In
respect of (b), the payments should be treated as refunds of revenue and adjusted as deduction
from the respective heads provided the original recoveries were treated as receipts and
adjusted under the receipt heads of accounts. Where ever the recoveries were adjusted as
deductions from expenditure, the refunds of such recoveries under the orders of the Court
etc. should be treated as ‘Charged expenditure’.
(3) Refunds of Security Deposits should be debited to ‘Public Accounts’ if the same is kept in
that account. On the other hand, if the deposit has been forfeited, the refund should be treated
as ‘Charged Expenditure’.
(4) In cases where an appeal is filed against the decree in the lower Court and the decreed
amount is deposited in the Court as security for staying the execution of decree, the same
should be kept initially as a ‘Deposit’ in the Public Accounts. Later on, if the amount is refunded
as a result of the Court’s order, then the expenditure will be charged in accordance with (1)
and (2) above.

balances are available or not) and adjustments in accounts made later on.
(6) Where decrees/awards are normal feature, Ministries/Departments may include provisions
for likely payments during a year on the basis of the past trends and other information available
with them at the time of framing the estimates. If this provision proves inadequate, it may be

of Indirect Taxes and Customs etc.) of which rent receipts, although adjustable under the
Major head 0216, are not passed on to the Director of Estates, MoHUA. Apart from the Chief
Controller of Accounts, MoHUA, only the Accounts Officers of Departments maintaining
such separate pool of accommodation should furnish estimates of “License fee” receipts

2.20 Savings, Excesses and Supplementary Demands
2.20.1 Surrender of Savings
(1) During the course of the financial year, it may be found that the expenditure under some of
the sub-heads is likely to be less than the provisions in the budget owing to one or more of the
following reasons:
(i) Actual postponement of expenditure.
G-28011/113/2022-IAB
634841/2022/IAB
102/1563
CHAPTER 2 : BUDGET AND RECONCILIATION OF ACCOUNTS CPWD WORKS MANUAL 2019
10 165 Years of Engineering Excellence
(ii) Normal savings due to economy.
(iii) Normal savings due to original overestimating or administrative causes
(a) All anticipated savings noticed in a grant or allotment has to be surrendered
sufficiently in advance before the close of the financial year. The surrenders should
be made immediately as soon as the savings are foreseen without waiting till the
end of the year, unless these are required to meet increased expenditure under
some other unit or units which can definitely be foreseen at that time.
(b) No savings are to be held in reserve for meeting possible excesses in future.
(c) Budget Division, Ministry of Finance has issued instructions on the need for the
individual Ministry/Department to put in place effective mechanism for realistically
assessing their requirement of funds in a way that would ward off the occurrence
of unwarranted surrender of savings at a later date. In this regard, Rule 62 of GFR
2017 may be referred.
2.20.2 Supplementary Demands
Expenditure for which no provision has been made in the original Budget Estimates for the current
year cannot normally be incurred. If either owing to (i) an unforeseen emergency, or (ii) underestimating
or insufficient allowance for factors leading to the increase in expenditure, excess
expenditure on a particular item of the budget estimate is inevitable, action may be taken for
submission of an application for allotment of additional funds by re-appropriation or supplementary
grant, where it is not possible to get funds by re-appropriation.
If the amount authorized through appropriations for a particular service is found to be insufficient
for the purposes of that year or when a need has arisen during the current financial year for
supplementary or additional expenditure upon some new service not contemplated in the annual
financial statement for that year, a supplementary demands for grants proposal shall be made
before Parliament. However, if any money has been spent on any service during a financial year
in excess of the amount granted for that service and for that year, demand for such excess, as the
case may be is to be laid before both the Houses of Parliament for authorizing (subject to the
report of the Public Accounts Committee) the expenditure incurred in excess.
2.20.3 Supplementary Grant
As per Rule 66 of GFR, if savings are not available within the Grant to which the payment is
required to be debited, or if the expenditure is on “New Service” or “New Instrument of Service” not
provided in the budget, necessary Supplementary Grant or Appropriation in accordance with Article
115 (1) of the Constitution should be obtained before payment is authorized. Instructions issued
from the Budget Section of CPWD/ MoHUA from time to time are to be followed in this regard.
2.20.4 Annexure to the Supplementary Demands
As recommended by the Public Accounts Committee, any order for re-appropriation, issued during
a financial year, which has the effect of increasing the budget provision under a sub-head or
standard object head by more than the limit specified in Budget Division’s OM or as mentioned in
the Delegation of Financial Power Rules, is required to be reported to Parliament along with the
final batch of the Supplementary Demands for Grants.

CPWD WORKS MANUAL 2019 CHAPTER 2 : BUDGET AND RECONCILIATION OF ACCOUNTS
2.21 Appropriation Account
(1) Appropriation Account relating to the expenditure brought into account during a financial year is
required to be submitted to the Parliament. The Appropriation Account, thus, compares the total
grants (original, supplementary, etc.) made by the Parliament for any particular purpose with
the actual expenditure incurred by Government on that purpose. While making such comparison,
explanations should be given in the Appropriation Account for the variations between the final
grant and the actual expenditure under each sub-head, whether excesses or savings.
(2) The sub-heads in respect of which reason for variations both for savings and excesses are
required to be included are as follows:
(a) If the variation in a sub-head exceeds the prescribed limit - All variations, both savings
and excesses, irrespective of the percentage which the variation bears to the sanctioned
provision (original, or supplementary, or both taken together).
(b) If the variation in a sub-head does not exceed the prescribed limit.
(i) Where the variation is in excess
All cases in which the excess exceeds 10% of the total sanctioned provision or
as prescribed, whichever is higher - The total sanctioned provision in this clause
means the original provision (if there is no supplementary provision), supplementary
provision (if there is no original provision), and original and supplementary provision
taken together if they exist.
(ii) Where the variation is a saving
All cases in which the saving exceeds 10% of the original provision, or as
prescribed, whichever is higher, if in that sub-head there is no supplementary
provision in a sub-head either with or without any original provision - All cases,
in which the saving exceeds 10% of the supplementary provision will be included.
(c) If the grant/appropriation as a whole has been exceeded (i.e. where excess has occurred
in any of the four segments, viz. voted revenue, voted capital, charged revenue and
charged capital) - Only such sub-heads as involve an excess of over the prescribed
amount may be picked up. If, however, there is no individual sub-head involving an excess
of over such prescribed amount, sub-heads which mainly account for the overall excess
may be included. However, the criteria laid down in (a) and (b) (ii) will also be followed.
2.22 Re-appropriation
(1) A transfer of fund from one primary unit of appropriation to another such unit may become
necessary. Such a transfer is termed “re-appropriation”, and can be sanctioned only by the
competent authority prescribed under DFPR and Orders of Ministry of Finance from time to
time..
(2) Transfer of funds within one primary unit of appropriation under the same grant and involving
two or more Zones does not amount to re-appropriation, and does not, therefore, attract the
provisions of Rule 18 of the Delegation of Financial Powers Rules, because Appropriation
Accounts are prepared on the basis of the total grant under a particular primary unit of
appropriation in all the CPWD Zones.
(3) Rule 64 of GFR 2017 regarding provisions relating to the Re-appropriation of Funds, relevant
rules under DFPR are given in SOP 2/4.

CHAPTER 2 : BUDGET AND RECONCILIATION OF ACCOUNTS CPWD WORKS MANUAL 2019
12 165 Years of Engineering Excellence
2.22.1 Restrictions on Appropriations/Re-appropriations
All Re-appropriation shall be done as per GFR 2017/ DFPR provisions and according to orders
issued by MoF from time to time.
2.23 Allotment of Funds
(1) After the budget grants are approved by the Parliament, the Ministry allocates the sanctioned
funds to the DG, CPWD. Director Finance, CPWD who functions as IFD of CPWD distributes
the allocated funds with the approval of ADG(TD)/DG, CPWD among the concerned Heads
of Departments/ Other Budget Controlling authorities in the field/ or to any subordinate offices
as approved by the ADG(TD)/DG, CPWD based on priority, urgency and specific need
according to their demands and availability of funds. The distribution of budget by the Head of
Department/ subordinate offices shall be informed to the Director (Finance) of CPWD and
Pay & Accounts Officers for check against allocations.
(2) While preparing detailed statement showing the distribution of the funds, the following points
should receive the attention of the budget authorities:
(i) The statement should show the distribution of the final allotments by the budget controlling
officers in consultation with respective finance officers of the Zones/ Divisions which
are primary units of appropriation to cover a number of individual items or works. It
should also contain an abstract of the charges by the prescribed sub-heads.
(ii) Specific allotment should be made for each individual major work.
(iii) Provision for Voted and Non-Voted (charged) items should be shown separately.
(iv) The amounts and details of the allotment/ ceilings intimated by the Ministry should be
strictly adhered to and on no account altered/ breached.
(3) The distribution statement, when issued, should be regarded as the authorised program of
expenditure. Any change required therein during the course of the year should be dealt with
under the Rules of Re-appropriation.
2.24 Review of Budget Allocations
(1) All budget controlling and monitoring officers should review every month the progress of
expenditure vis a vis physical progress against the funds placed at their disposal from time to
time. Physical progress vis a vis financial is important to be monitored. They should submit
excesses or savings anticipated as soon as noticed to the Director (Finance) of CPWD.
These statements should include all items and should be prepared separately for voted and
non-voted expenditure.
(2) To ensure effective control of the expenditure against the appropriations made vis a vis
physical progress in the prescribed Proforma issued, a quarterly review of the expenditure is
conducted until the end of September and thereafter every month till the month of February
hence excess/savings must be reported to Director (Finance) of CPWD from time to time.
(3) Where the progress of expenditure is not even and upto the required standards, timely action
should be taken the CE’s/ Budget controlling authorities/ Director (Finance) of CPWD to
accelerate the expenditure by the expenditure incurring units. According to the guidelines
issued by the MoF, last Quarter expenditures should not exceed 33% of BE and 15% in the

CPWD WORKS MANUAL 2019 CHAPTER 2 : BUDGET AND RECONCILIATION OF ACCOUNTS
month of March of the financial year. Rush of expenditure in any month should be avoided
following Guidelines of the MoF. FOs shall also watch the pace of expenditure vis a vis
physical progress of the works in their respective zones. Director (Finance) of CPWD should
take corrective actions in view of imbalanced pace of expenditure and availability of funds in
form of budget reduction/ adjustment among zones/budget controlling units. The units will not
try to incur expenditure due to surplus funds at their disposal, merely to avoid the lapses
without following prescribed procedure and formalities.
2.25 Reconciliation of Accounts
(1) The Budget controlling authorities and concerned DDO/ Divisional Officer/AAO of divisions
are jointly responsible for the reconciliation of the figures given in the accounts maintained by
the Head of the Department with those appearing in the Pay and Accounts Office’s (here in
after called PAO) Accounts Officer’s books. Concerned ADG/SDG’s will oversee the overall
functioning of Accounting and Financial matters with help of senior most Account & Finance
officer available at their office and ensure that all divisions are performing their function under
stipulated time and the reconciliation should be made monthly, the initial responsibility resting
with the Accounts Officer. The detailed procedure for reconciliation of expenditure incurred
by Drawing and Disbursing Officers (DDO’s), including cheque drawing DDO’s (Divisional
Officers), and appearing in the books of the Pay and Accounts Officers has been prescribed
under CPWD Accounts Code and GFR 2017.
(2) The Chief Engineers/Director General as Heads of Department would maintain consolidated
Zone-wise and grant wise records, i.e. Major Head, Minor Head, Sub-Head-wise expenditure
in Form no. GFR 12.
2.26 Regularization of Excess
2.26.1 Avoiding excess
(1) Excess over voted grants and appropriations and surrenders reflect on the effectiveness of
control over expenditure.
(2) In cases where the schemes are not fully worked out at the budget stage, and a realistic
estimate of the likely expenditure during the year is not found possible, provision for preliminary
expenses and immediate requirements need only be included in the budget as far as possible,
subject to review later on during the financial year on the basis of progress made in the
planning of and sanction of the schemes.
(3) Apart from the realistic estimation of the budget, adequate steps should be taken for effective
control over the progress of expenditure against the sanctioned grants, including expenditure
on account of book adjustments and payments for procurement of stores, supplies and
services.
2.26.2 Sanctions to Regularize Excesses
(1) A statement in Form no.8 should be prepared annually for submission to the Ministry by the
end of December every year to show the causes of excesses and savings under different
sub-heads, along with reasons why steps were not taken in time to surrender the savings, or
to obtain necessary funds to cover the excesses before the end of the financial year however
excesses are not permissible in normal circumstances. Separate statements should be
prepared for each grant.

106/1563
CHAPTER 2 : BUDGET AND RECONCILIATION OF ACCOUNTS CPWD WORKS MANUAL 2019
14 165 Years of Engineering Excellence
(2) If the grant has been exceeded, sanction should be obtained to the excess from the Ministry
of Finance in case of non-voted expenditure, or from the Parliament in the case of voted
expenditure.
(3) As voted and charged portions, and as also the revenue and capital sections of a grant/
appropriation are distinct, and re-appropriation inter-se is not permissible, an excess in any
one portion or section is treated as an excess in the grant/appropriation.
(4) Excess in the demands as a whole requires regularization by the Public Accounts Committee,
which generally takes a serious view of such excess, and insists upon satisfactory
explanations from the Department concerned.
(5) Similarly, savings and surrenders should also be avoided. The Public Accounts Committee
takes serious view of the same as in the case of excess. Large savings are indicative of
loose budgeting in the sense that these prove the inability of the Department to spend usefully
the funds to the extent anticipated.
2.27 Departmentalization of Accounts- AGs/ CAGs Inspection and Internal Audit by O/o CCA,
MoHUA
2.27.1 General

(2) The CGA prepares annual accounts including summary civil Appropriation Accounts, showing
under the respective heads, the annual receipts and disbursements for the purpose of Union
Government.
(3) The Divisional officers and higher officers should furnish the explanations as promptly as
possible, and ensure that these are concise, accurate and fully informative. The explanations
should indicate with sufficient clarity whether a variation or financial irregularity could not
have been foreseen.
(4) While submitting the Appropriation Accounts, the Divisional officers should take into
consideration the facts that the Public Accounts Committee, while scrutinizing the Accounts,
