Guidelines for The Design of  
Stabilized Pavements
1 INTRODUCTION
1.1	
Stabilization has been use practice for many years now and has made vast 
progress in improving the quality of pavements, as a result recent year have shown a rapid 
progress in stabilization. The age long technique is not limited to subgrade or embankment 
any more and has paved its way to the pavement layers like sub-base and base and in some 
special cases even in wearing course.
1.2	
IRC:SP:89-2010, deals with Soil and Granular Material Stabilization using Cement, 
Lime & Fly Ash, which are traditionally being used as stabilizers to improve the strength and 
durability characteristics of various types of soils and granular materials in pavement structure 
and termed as Conventional Stabilizers (CS) in this document. In recent past, a number 
of companies are promoting different types of Commercial Chemical Stabilizers (CCS) in 
the market. The companies indicate that such stabilizers are special chemical compounds, 
which have been evolved after a long research and should be mixed with cement to enhance 
the strength and durability characteristics of soil cement mix. The dosage of such CCS to be 
mixed varies from 0.5 per cent to 5.0 per cent of cement content. These chemical stabilizers 
are available either in powder form or in liquid form. The categories of different CCS available 
in the country are as follows:
	
a)	
Natural Inorganic Powder Binders
	
b)	
Water Repelling Nano Chemicals
	
c)	
Waste Oil
	
d)	
Petroleum Based Products
	
e)	
Liquid Stabilized Products
	
f)	
Synthetic Polymers
	
g)	
Sulphonate Lignin etc.
1.3	
Some companies mix these chemical compounds in cement itself at the 
manufacturing plant and sell such products (cement mixed with admixtures), with a commercial 
name. Such products are ready to use and therefore can be directly mixed with soils or 
granular materials for site specific requirements in the desired quantity as determined by 
detailed laboratory/field tests. However, some companies provide the CCS separately, which 
is required to be mixed at site with cement in a manner as suggested by the company before 
being used with soil or granular materials. It is claimed that the materials stabilized with CCS 
not only yield better strength but result in improved elastic and thermal properties of the mix 
and therefore less prone to cracking and shrinkage cracks. Since long term performance of 
roads constructed with such special products is not available, it becomes difficult to accept 
such products for large scale application.

1.4	
In order to promote stabilizers, this document has been brought out as an 
addendum to IRC:SP:89-2010 as IRC:SP:89 (Part II) to deal with various aspects of 
Commercial Chemical Stabilizers/Conventional Stabilizers. The addendum deals with issues 
such as mechanism for acceptance of CCS/CS, test requirements, material characterization 
and design aspects to be looked into while selecting any CCS/CS for the purpose of soil/
granular materials stabilization and/or construction of cementitious base and cementitious 
sub-base layers or to improve CBR values of the sub-grades. Since long term performance 
of roads constructed with such materials is not known, a conservative approach is being 
suggested.
1.5	
The task of preparation of IRC:SP:89 (Part II) “Guidelines for the Design of 
Stabilized Pavements” was assigned to Composite Pavement Committee (H-9). The draft 
was prepared by the subgroup comprising Dr. Sunil Bose, Shri Sudhir Mathur, Shri Bidur 
Kant Jha and Shri Mohit Verma. The draft was deliberated in a series of meetings. The H-9 
Committee finally approved the draft document in its meeting held on 9th September, 2017 
and decided to send the final draft to IRC for placing before the HSS Committee.

The Highways Specifications and Standards Committee considered and approved the draft 
document in its meeting held on 13th October, 2017. The Executive Committee in its meeting 
held on 2nd November, 2017 considered and approved the same for placing it before the 
Council. The Council of IRC in its 213th meeting held at Bengaluru on 3rd November, 2017 
considered and approved the draft IRC:SP:89 (Part II) “Guidelines for The Design of Stabilized 
Pavements” for printing.
2 MECHANISM OF ACCEPTANCE FOR CCS
2.1	
The following two documents shall be checked and carefully examined before 
accepting any commercial stabilizers for field trial:
• 
Base Document of Product
CCS varies in composition and effectiveness. The addition of CCS in soil and/or granular 
material may result in reduction of plasticity, change in gradation and improvement in strength 
and durability characteristics of the mix. Therefore, the Engineer must thoroughly examine 
the base documents provided by the supplier/company for such unproven products. The 
document should provide the basic information such as: 
	
(i)	
Broad chemical composition
	
(ii)	
Place of manufacturing
	
(iii)	 Locations of successful field applications and
	
(iv)	 Other relevant information pertaining to the product
The document should also bring out in terms of test results, the advantage of using CCS 
vis-a-vis conventional stabilizers such as cement or lime-flash-cement etc. in improving the 
strength and durability characteristics of the soil/granular materials proposed to be used for 
road works. It must be ensured that the CCS materials do not contain toxic/heavy metals 
which due to leach ability may affect the soil, plants and ground water. The test methods for 
obtaining the test results and certificate for the same is given in Annexure-I.

• 
Certificate of Usage
Certificate of Usage from the Country of Origin with successful project reports and field 
evaluation reports on roads in our climatic conditions. If the product is in existence in India 
for more than 2 years and has been tested for some experimental road trials, the supplier 
should also furnish the following information:
	
i.	
Certificate of usage in India in last 2 years.
	
ii.	
Success rate of the new technology in Indian condition as per last 2 years 
data.
	
iii.	
Quantum of work completed in Government Projects using new technology.
	
iv.	
Field Evaluation report by Government Institutes/Organizations on roads 
constructed with new technology in different regions with varied climatic 
conditions viz., sub-zero, Snow-bound, high rain fall conditions, etc.
For Proven Products
In case the CCS has been already proven for successful usage in different weathering 
conditions in India for any category of roads, test reports of such road tracks done should be 
furnished and shall be alone adequate for its considerations if a separate fatigue equation for 
such stabilizer is developed through reputed Institute like IIT’s, NIT’s, CRRI etc., the same 
can be used at the discretion of the user.
3 MATERIAL CHARACTERIZATION
3.1 
Requirement for Soil Modification/Subgrade Improvement
CCS/CS can be used for soil modification or improvement of subgrade soil or for construction 
of cementitious base/sub-base layers meeting the requirements as laid-down in the latest 
edition of IRC:37. It is recommended from economic consideration that mix-in-place methods 
of construction be used for subgrade improvement. The main requirement for CCS/CS 
modification or stabilization of subgrade soils shall remain the same as given in Table 6 of 
IRC:SP:89-2010. In case the subgrade soil is highly plastic, it can be modified with lime and/
or flyash before being mixed with CCS/CS. The technical requirements for lime and flyash 
modification for subgrade improvement shall remain the same as given under Clause 4.3 to 
4.6 in IRC:SP:89-2010.
3.2 
Requirement for Stabilized Sub-base/Base
Materials which shall be considered for the construction of cementitious sub-base/base 
layers in a pavement structure stabilized with CCS/CS are as given below:
	
i.	
All types of aggregates including marginal aggregates*
	
ii.	
Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement Material
	
iii.	
Reclaimed Concrete Pavement Material

Mines Waste
	
vi.	
Construction and Demolition Wastes
	
vii.	
All types of soil-granular materials mixes having PI<20 for sub-base and 
PI<10 for base
It is required that the materials shall conform to the gradation as mentioned in Table 1. In 
case the materials do not meet the gradation and other physical properties but satisfying the 
strength, durability with residual strength and toxicity, shall be considered after exhaustive 
research and development by any reputed Institute/Organization like IIT’s, NIT’s, CRRI etc.
*Marginal Aggregate: A marginal materials can be defined as materials which do not in their 
present form possess quality levels as defined by current highway standards sufficient for their 
use as various pavement structural components including surfaces, bases, and/or subbases. 
Aggregate produced from a more weathered or weather prone rock, or hard rock containing 
weathered seams or weaker sedimentary rocks, which after processing contains moderate or 
highly plastic fines, is susceptible to weathering and when compacted will produce a soaked 
C.B.R. value between 40 per cent and 100 per cent.

3.3 
Test Requirements
It shall be noted that CCS/CS can be toxic and may pollute the soil, plant/human/animal/
aquatic life and underground water through leaching and hence every CCS/CS must be 
checked for presence of heavy metals, toxicity and leaching with reference to Annexure-I. 
CSIR laboratory at Lucknow has the facility of conducting tests there may be few accredited 
laboratory having the facility to conduct the test.
All the properties of material to be stabilized with CCS/CS and intended to be used in various 
layers of the pavement structure shall be checked as per IRC:37 & IRC:SP:89-2010 and the 



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 44
======================================================================
IRC:SP:89 (Part II)-2018
6
relevant clauses of MoRTH Specifications for Road and Bridge Works, 2013, along with the 
following considerations:
i.	
For CCS/CS stabilized sub-base material, the durability shall be checked by the 
Method 1, Clause 4.7.2, IRC:SP:89-2010.
(It may please be noted that this test has not been specified for cement stabilized sub-bases.) 
ii.	
For CCS/CS stabilized base material, the durability shall be checked by the 
Method 2, Clause 4.7.2, IRC:SP:89-2010. This test is as per ASTM D-559 for 
wetting and drying and ASTM D-560 for freezing and thawing. Freezing and 
Thawing procedure is required to be followed, if the stabilization is to be done 
in snow bound areas or where the minimum temperature is under sub-zero 
conditions. Refer Annexure-II A and B for details of tests.
iii.	
As specified by AASHTO and ASTM, a brush is being used in a standardized 
manner to evaluate material loss in the durability test. A mechanical brushing 
apparatus has been developed by CSIR, South Africa that would brush the 
specimens using a consistent effort. However, such equipment is not widely 
available in India therefore either of the brushing methods can be adopted as per 
the availability. The brushing apparatus is shown in Fig. 1 below:
Fig. 1 Automated Brushing Apparatus

3.4 
Requirement for Crack Relief Layer on CCS/CS Stabilized Base Layer
A crack relief layer shall be provided on CCS/CS stabilized base layer designed for traffic 
>=2 MSA. The crack relief could be either Aggregate Interlayer or Stress Absorbing Membrane 
Interlayer (SAMI) or emulsion stabilized/foam bitumen layer as allowed in IRC:37.
4 DESIGN METHODOLOGY FOR STABILIZED PAVEMENTS USING CCS/CS
4.1	
The design methodology for CCS/CS stabilized pavements shall remain the same 
as provided in IRC:37. The following types of pavement with CCS/CS can be considered 
with bituminous surfacing and a crack relief layer in terms of Aggregate or Stress Absorbing 
Membrane Interlayer (SAMI):
	
•	
Stabilized Bases with Stabilized Sub-bases
	
•	
Stabilized Bases with Granular Sub-bases
	
•	
Granular Bases with Stabilized Sub-bases
4.2 
Design Considerations for Sub-base and Base
Elastic Modulus: The relevant design parameter for bound sub-bases is the elastic modulus 
E, which can be estimated from the unconfined compressive strength of the material. The 
elastic modulus must be calculated by the following equation:
	
MR = 1000 x UCS for Rapid Hardening CS
	
MR = 750 x UCS for Slow Hardening CCS/CS
Where, E = Elastic Modulus of Stabilized Material
UCS = Unconfined Compressive Strength in MPa (7 and 28 days for Rapid Hardening & 
Slow Hardening Stabilizers respectively)
For design, 20% of E value derived from above given relation shall be taken. In case the 
elastic modulus is derived by 4 point beam testing with dynamic loading machine, the 
E value for design shall be taken directly with a minimum factor of safety of 1.5. The detailed 
procedure of testing & calculating elastic modulus value by 4 point Beam testing is given in 
Annexure – II B. However in this case the E value should be restricted to 1700 Mpa.
Flexural strength can be taken as 20% of UCS
Bound Sub Base Layer: Since the sub-base acts as a platform for construction traffic, low 
strength sub-base is expected to crack during construction, therefore for such cases, a design 
value of 600 MPa is recommended for design, though the modulus value as calculated by 
equation (1) may be in the range of 2000 MPa to 4000 MPa. The Poisson’s ratio may be 
taken as 0.25. The CCS/CS stabilized layer shall be cured for minimum 15 days before the 
construction of the subsequent layer. If the stabilized sub-base layer have UCS in the range 
of 0.75 to 1.5 MPa, the recommended E value for design shall be 400 MPa.



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 44
======================================================================
IRC:SP:89 (Part II)-2018
8
Bound Base Layer: Flexure strength of a CCS/CS stabilized base is critical to the satisfactory 
performance of a bituminous pavement. Stabilized base layer may consist of soil or aggregate 
or soil-aggregate mixture stabilized with CCS/CS. It is required that stabilized mix should 
give a minimum strength of 4.5 to 7 MPa. It is recommended that the laboratory strength 
shall be at least 1.1 times higher than the design strength due to variability of construction in 
field. The upper limits of E value for base layer is restricted to 1400 and 1700 MPa by UCS 
and Beam method respectively. The fatigue strength is required for carrying out the fatigue 
damage analysis of CCS/CS treated base. Cumulative damage analysis as suggested in 
IRC:37 shall be carried out.
4.3 
Pavement Design Procedure
4.3.1	
The design procedure as provided in IRC:37 including cumulative damage analysis 
shall be followed with design parameters as proposed above. There can be large number of 
combinations for a good pavement depending upon the availability of materials. Some of the 
typical sections are given in Annexure - III.
5 CONSTRUCTION PRACTICES
5.1	
The construction of CCS/CS stabilized layer follow the same basic procedure as 
explained in Chapter 5 of IRC:SP:89-2010. Two methods of stabilization as indicated below 
can be used:
	
1. Mix-in-place Stabilization
	
2. Plant-mix Stabilization
5.2	
The procedure explained in above given reference shall be followed with following 
considerations:
	
For Mix-in-place Stabilization, specialized stabilization machinery shall be 
used capable of providing in-situ rock/boulder crushing-cum-pulverizing-cum-
homogenizing features and for a constant depth/uniform operation. Manual mixing 
methods using labour/agriculture based methodology shall not be permitted except 
for low volume roads, where the depth of mixing of loose soil with the additive is not 
more than 100 mm-120 mm. Some of the recommended specialized machinery 
types are given in Annexure - IV.
	
For Plant-mix Stabilization, calibration of plant (Concrete batch mix/WMM) with 
the CCS shall be done to achieve the proper homogeneity of all the material as 
per specified combinations.
	
Success of stabilization technology depends on effective mixing of ingredients 
including stabilizers hence good quality equipment is must. Dosage of admixtures 
/stabilizers could be less than 3 per cent for few products hence intimate mixing 
through good effective equipment is essential.

6 PERFORMANCE BEHAVIOR
6.1	
The resilient modulus and permanent deformation are important properties and 
shall be evaluated. The performance evaluation shall include the following field testing:
	
a)	
Resilient Modulus of different layers by Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) 
or by means of extracting cores from the 28 days cured layers for UCS testing 
to arrive at E-Values.
	
b)	
Deformation of different layers by Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)
	
c)	
Surface Irregularities by Visual Inspection
6.2	
Manufacturer of a CCS shall submit report on performance evaluation done by 
reputed Government Organization/Institution like NIT’s, CRRI, IIT’s or any NABL approved 
laboratory.
6.3	
The performance evaluation report of roads constructed with such stabilizers shall 
be evolved after two years of trial with a frequency of two times every year.
6.4	
Routine visual observations shall be taken and recorded monthly.

ANNEXURE-I
TOXICITY LEACHING TESTING ON STABILIZERS MIXED WITH SOIL
(Refer Clause 2.1 and 3.3)
The study shall be conducted according to the USEPA Guidelines (1311 of July 1992) for 
Toxicity Characteristics Leaching Procedure (TCLP).
TCLP is a soil sample extraction method for chemical analysis. When a material is disposed 
in landfills, hazardous substances contained in them may enter the environment. So to 
classify that material as hazardous, the regulatory test TCLP determines the quantity of 
hazardous substances leaching from a material under simulated conditions. If the levels 
of the hazardous chemicals are below TCLP limits for that particular chemical entity, the 
material can be disposed off in a municipal landfill without any treatment. If the levels exceed 
the limits, then the material has to be disposed off in a secured landfill or has to undergo 
further treatment for neutralization or stabilization.
The stabilizer shall be mixed with dried and sieved soil in recommended w/w ratio, water 
added, mixed thoroughly and can be casted in proctor moulds. Water containing mixed spiking 
solution of chromium, nickel, copper and lead shall be added in another set of samples. 
This shall be carried out as per IS 4332 part 3. The Stabilized samples shall be extracted 
in closed vessels with the leaching solution at pH 2.88 ± 0.05 as per TCLP protocol at 
30 ± 2 rpm for 18 ± 2 hours at ambient temperature (23 ± 2°C). The resultant leachates shall 
be filtered, processed and analysed on Atomic Absorption Spectrometer for different metals 
using standard protocols (APHA, 2005). All the leaching studies shall be done in triplicate 
and the mean results shall be present.
The moulds of soil samples along with the controls shall be crushed, dried, sieved and tested 
for the leaching of metals (Chromium, Nickel, Lead and Copper) as per TCLP of USEPA 
(1311 of July 1992). The results shall indicate the levels of all the metals in reference with 
limits prescribed by USEPA for TCLP.
The testing shall be done by any organization/institution working under CSIR like Indian 
Institute of Toxicology Research, Lucknow and National Environmental Engineering Research 
Institute, Nagpur etc.

ANNEXURE-II A 
DURABILITY TESTING FOR STABILIZED MATERIALS
(Refer Clause 3.3)
To determine the resistance of compacted stabilized materials to repeated adverse weather 
conditions. The test procedure is followed as per IS Code IS: 4332 (Part IV): Methods of test 
for stabilized soils: wetting and drying, freezing and thawing tests for compacted soil-cement 
mixtures.
Procedure for Wetting and Drying
A representative sample weighing about 20 kg or more of the thoroughly mixed material shall 
be made to pass through 20 mm and 4.75 mm: IS Sieves, separating the fractions retained 
and passing these sieves. Care shall be exercised so as not to break the aggregates while 
pulverising. The percentage of each fraction shall be determined. The fraction retained on 
20 mm IS Sieve shall not be used in the test. The percentage of soil coarser than 4.75 mm 
IS Sieve and the percentage of soil coarser than 20 mm IS Sieve shall be determined. The 
ratio of fraction passing 20 mm IS sieve and retained on 4.75 mm IS Sieve to the soil passing 
4.75 mm IS Sieve shall be determined. The material retained on and passing 4.75 mm IS Sieve 
shall be mixed thoroughly in the determined proportion to obtain about 16 kg of soil sample. 
A representative sample weighing approximately 16 kg of the thoroughly mixed material shall 
be taken. The soil, potable water and required amount of CCS/CS shall be mixed properly. 
The mixture should be broken up without reducing the natural size of individual particles. The 
specimens shall be formed by immediately compacting the soil-cement mixture in the mould 
(with the collar attached) and later trimming the specimens. In addition the tops of the first 
and second layers shall be scarified to remove smooth compaction planes before placing 
and compacting the succeeding layers. This scarification shall form groove at right angles to 
each other approximately 3 mm in width and 3 mm in depth and approximately 6 mm apart. 
During compaction, a representative sample of the soil-CCS/CS mixture weighing not less 
than 100 g shall be taken from the batch for moisture content determination. The compacted 
specimens shall be weighed with the mould. The specimens shall then be removed from the 
mould. The oven-dry density in g/cm3 shall be calculated. The specimens shall be identified 
suitably as No. 1 and 2. These specimens may be used to obtain data on moisture and 
volume changes during the test. Two more specimens shall be similarly formed and their 
moisture content and dry density be determined. These specimens shall be identified as 
No. 3 and 4 and used to obtain data on soil-CCS/CS losses during the test. The average 
diameter and height of specimens No.1 and 2 shall be measured and their volume shall be 
determined. All the four specimens shall be placed on suitable carriers in the moist chamber 
and protected from free water for a period of seven days. Specimens No. 1 and 2 should be 
weighed and measured at the end of the seven-day period to provide data for calculating 
their moisture content and volume. 
At the end of the storage in the moist room, the specimens shall be submerged in potable 
water at room temperature for a period of 5 h, refer Photo 1 and removed. Specimens No. 
1 and 2 shall be weighed and their dimensions measured. All four specimens shall then be 
placed in an oven at 70°C for 42 h and removed. Specimens No. 1 and 2 shall be weighed

and their dimensions measured again. Specimens No. 3 and 4 shall be given two firm strokes 
on all areas with the wire-scratch brush. The brush shall be held with the long axis of the 
brush parallel to the longitudinal axis of the specimen or parallel to the ends as required for 
covering all areas of the specimen. These strokes shall be applied to full height and width 
of the specimen with a firm stroke corresponding to approximately 1.4 kg. 18 to 20 vertical 
brush strokes may be required to cover the sides of the specimen twice and four strokes may 
be required at each end, the above process constitute one cycle (48 h ) of wetting and drying. 
The specimens shall again be submerged in water and the same procedure continued for 12 
cycles. Testing of No. 1 and 2 specimens may be discontinued prior to 12 cycles should the 
measurements become inaccurate due to soil-CCS/CS loss of the specimen. After 12 cycles 
of test, the specimens shall be dried to constant weight at 110°C and weighed to determine 
the oven-dry weight of the specimens. The data collected will permit calculations of volume 
and moisture changes of specimen’s No. 1 and 2, and the soil-CCS/CS losses of Specimen’s 
No. 3 and 4 after the prescribed 12 cycles of test.
For Specimen’s No. 1 and 2 the difference between the volumes of specimens, refer Photo 2, 
at the time of moulding and subsequent volumes as a percentage of the original volume 
should be calculated. The moisture content of Specimens No.1 and 2 at the time of moulding 
and subsequent moisture contents should be calculated as a percentage of the original 
oven-dry weight of the specimen. The oven-dry weight of Specimen’s No. 3 and 4 shall be 
corrected for water that has reacted with the CCS/CS and soil during the test and is retained 
in the specimen at 110°C, as follows:
	
Corrected oven-dry weight = Wd X 100/(w+100)
Where,
	
Wd = oven-dry weight after drying at 110°C, and
	
w = percentage of water retained in specimen.

The percentage of water retained in the Specimens No. 3 and 4 after drying at 110°C for 
use in the above formula may be assumed to be equal to the average percentage of water 
retained in specimen No. 1 and 2. The soil cement loss of specimens MO. 3 and 4 shall be 
calculated as a percentage of the original oven-dry weight of the specimen as follows:
	
Soil cement loss, percent = A/B x 100
Where,
	
A = original calculated oven-dry weight minus final corrected oven-dry weight
	
B = original calculated oven-dry weight.
Procedure for Freezing and Thawing
The soil sample and specimens shall be prepared in accordance with the procedure given in 
wetting and drying.
At the end of the storage in the moist room, water saturated felts about 5 mm thick, blotters 
or similar absorptive material shall be placed between the specimens and the carriers. The 
assembly shall be placed in a freezing cabinet having a constant temperature not warmer 
than -23°C, refer Photo 3 and 4 for 24 h and removed. The No. 1 and 2 Specimens shall 
be weighed and measured. The assembly should then be placed in the moist chamber or 
suitably covered container having a temperature of 25°C to 30°C and a relative humidity 
of 100 per cent for 23 h and removed. Free potable water shall be made available to the 
absorbent pads under the specimens to permit the specimens to absorb water by capillary 
action during the thawing period. The No. 1 and 2 Specimens shall be measured and weighed. 
Specimens No. 3 and 4 shall be given two firm strokes on all areas with the wire-scratch 
brush. The brush shall be held with the long axis of the brush parallel to the longitudinal axis 
of the specimen or parallel to the ends as required for covering all areas of the specimen. 
The strokes shall be applied to the full height and width of the specimen with a firm stroke 
corresponding to approximately 1.4 kg. Eighteen to twenty vertical brush strokes are required 
to cover the sides of the specimen twice and four strokes are required on each end. After 
being brushed, the specimens shall be turned over end for end before they are placed on 
the water saturated pads. The specimens shall be placed in the freezing cabinet and the 
procedure continued for 12 cycles. The No. 1 and 2 Specimens may be discontinued prior 
to 12 cycles should the measurements become inaccurate due to soil- CCS/CS loss of the 
specimen. After 12 cycles of test, the specimens shall be dried to constant weight at 110°C 
and weighed to determine the oven-dry weight of the specimens. The data collected will 
permit calculations of volume and moisture changes of Specimens No.1 and 2 and the soil-
cement losses of Specimens No. 3 and 4 after the prescribed 12 cycles of test. The volume 
and moisture changes and the soil-CCS/CS losses of the specimens should be calculated as 
given in wetting-drying procedure.

ANNEXURE-II B
DETERMINATION OF ELASTIC MODULUS “E”
(Refer Clause 3.3 and 4.2)
Determination of elastic modulus of the mix to be used in design of pavements is of paramount 
importance to replicate the performance on field. The following methods to arrive at the 
design modulus are described in this section:
Method 1:- Correlation of unconfined compressive strength and elastic modulus.
Method 2:- Determination of elastic modulus by third point beam load test.
For the determination of unconfined compressive strength, IS: 4332 (Part V)-1970 
Determination of Unconfined Compressive Strength of Stabilized Soils is to be followed. The 
selection of sample type depends upon the gradation of samples that is to be stabilized:
	
a)	
Fine-Grained - Not less than about 90 per cent of the soil passing a 2.36 mm 
IS Sieve.
	
b)	
Medium-Grained - Not less than about 90 per cent of the soil passing a 
20 mm IS Sieve
	
c)	
Coarse-Grained - Not less than about 90 per cent of the soil passing a 
40 mm IS Sieve.

It should be noted that in the UCS test the results can be affected by both the size and shape 
of the sample tested, e.g. a cube or cylinder specimen. The results are often converted to 
those for 150 mm cube by multiplying the result with a correction factor. Some correction 
factors are given in table below:

is MPa for UCS and Elastic modulus. Thus the care must be administered to convert the test 
values to MPa before applying the values in design.
As per Section 7.2.2.2 of IRC:37-2012 (for Stabilized Sub base)
“The relevant design parameter for bound sub-bases is the Elastic Modulus E, which 
can be determined from the unconfined compressive strength of the material. In case of 
cementitious granular sub-base having a 7-day UCS of 1.5 to 3 MPa, the laboratory based E 
value (AUSTROADS) is given by the following equations:
Ecgsb = 1000 * UCS ……A1
Where UCS = 28 day strength of the cementitious granular material
Equation A1 gives a value in the range of 2000 to 4000 MPa. Since the sub-base acts as a 
platform for the heavy construction traffic, low strength cemented sub-base is expected to 
crack during the construction and a design value of 600 MPa is recommended for the stress 
analysis. Poisson’s ratio may be taken as 0.25.
If the stabilized soil sub-bases have 7-day UCS values in the range 0.75 to 1.5 MPa, the 
recommended E value for design is 400 MPa with Poisson’s ratio of 0.25.
It is also to be noted that “Where commercially available stabilizers are used, the stabilized 
material should meet additional requirements of leachability and concentration of heavy 
metals apart from the usual requirements of strength and durability.”
For Stabilized base, section 7.3.2 “Cementetious Bases” reads 
“7.3.2	
Cementitious bases
7.3.2.1	
Cemented base layers may consist of aggregates or soils or both stabilized with 
chemical stabilizers such as cement, lime, lime-flyash or other stabilizers which are required 
to give a minimum strength of 4.5 to 7 MPa in 7/28 days. While the conventional cement 
should attain the above strength in seven days (IRC:SP:89-2010(30)), lime or lime-flyash 
stabilized granular materials and soils should meet the above strength requirement in 28 
days since strength gain in such materials is a slow process. Though the initial modulus of 
the cementitious bases may be in the range 10000 to 15000 MPa, the long term modulus 
of the cemented layer may be taken as fifty per cent of the initial modulus due to shrinkage 
cracks and construction traffic (65, 66). Australian guidelines recommend use of Equation 
7.2 for the cemented layer. Curing of cemented bases after construction is very important 
for achieving the required strength as described in IRC:SP:89 and curing should start 
immediately by spraying bitumen emulsion or periodical mist spray of water without flooding 
or other methods.
7.3.2.2	
Strength parameter
Flexural strength is required for carrying out the fatigue analysis as per fatigue equation. 
MEPDG suggests that the modulus of rupture for chemically stabilized bases can be taken 
as 20 per cent of the 28 day unconfined compressive strength. The same is recommended 



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 44
======================================================================
IRC:SP:89 (Part II)-2018
18
in these guidelines. The following default values of modulus of rupture are recommended for 
cementitious bases (MEPDG).
Cementitious stabilized aggregates – 1.40 MPa
Lime—flyash-soil – 1.05 MPa
Soil cement – 0.70 MPa
Poisson’s ration of the cemented layers may be taken as 0.25.”
Determination of elastic modulus beam load test
Elastic Modulus test are conducted in order to check whether stabilized mixture layer act 
as flexible or rigid, so that if the Modulus of Elasticity is high, the pavement consisting of 
stabilized layer and bituminous layer will be considered as semi-rigid and then the suitability 
of Stabilized layer as a base layer will be compared with respect to semi rigid pavement. The 
equipment shall be computerized cyclic beam loading set up. To determine the flexural strength 
of casted beams, it consists of three points loading, and the test shall be conducted at different 
amplitude and frequencies for finding the maximum elasticity modulus. The recommended 
specimen sizes, to be used in Laboratory are 500×100×100 mm and 300×75×75 mm.
Procedure: Soil-Stabilizer shall be mixed either by hand or in a suitable laboratory mixer 
in batches of such size as to leave ten per cent excess after molding test specimens. This 
material shall be protected against loss of moisture, and a representative part of it shall be 
weighed and dried in the drying oven to constant weight to determine the actual moisture 
content of the Soil-Stabilizer mixture. When the Soil-Stabilizer mixture contains aggregate 
retained on the 4.75 mm sieve, the sample for moisture determination shall weigh at least 
500 g and shall be weighed to the nearest gram. If the mixture does not contain aggregate 
retained on the 4.75 mm sieve, the sample shall weigh at least 100 g and shall be weighed to 
the nearest 0.1 g. The batch shall be mixed in a clean, damp, metal pan or on top of a steel 
table, with a blunt brick-layer’s trowel, using the following procedures:
a)	
Calculated amount of water to give moisture content 2 per cent less than the 
required final moisture content should be added to the soil passing 4.75 mm IS 
Sieve, thoroughly mixed and kept in a sealed container to avoid moisture loss 
overnight for uniform distribution of moisture. 
b)	
The additional water required for bringing the moisture to the required level should 
be calculated. The calculated weight of the moist soil and stabilizer required for 
making the specimens should be mixed thoroughly. The remaining quantity of 
water to make up the required moisture content of the Soil-Stabilizer mixture 
should be added and thoroughly mixed.
c)	
The saturated surface-dry coarse fraction of the soil shall be added and the entire 
batch mixed until the coarse fraction is uniformly distributed throughout the batch.
Divide it into three equal batches of predetermined weight of uniformly mixed Soil-Stabilizer 
to make a beam of the designed density. Place one batch of the material in the mould and 
level by hand. When the Soil-Stabilizer contains aggregate retained on the 4.75 mm sieve,

carefully spade the mix around the sides of the mould with a thin spatula. Compact the 
Soil-Stabilizer initially from the bottom up by steadily and firmly forcing (with little impact) a 
square-end cut 12 mm diameter smooth steel rod repeatedly, through the mixture from the 
top down to the point of refusal. Approximately 90 rods distributed uniformly over the cross-
section of the mould are required; take care so as not to leave holes in clayey Soil-Stabilizer 
mixtures. Level this layer of compacted Soil-Stabilizer by hand and place and compact layers 
two and three in an identical manner. The specimen at this time shall be approximately 95 
mm high. Place the top plate of the mould in position and remove the spacer bars. Obtain. 
Final compaction with a static load applied by the compression machine or Compression 
frame until the height of 75 mm is reached. Immediately after compaction, carefully dismantle 
the mould and remove the specimen onto a smooth, rigid wood or sheet metal pallet. Flexural 
test of moist cured specimens shall be made as soon as practicable after removing from the 
moist room, and during the period between removal from the moist room and testing, the 
specimens shall be kept, moist by the wet burlap or blanket covering.
Turn the specimen on its side with respect to its molded position (with the original top and 
bottom surfaces as molded perpendicular to the testing machine bed) and center it on the lower 
half-round steel supports, which shall have been spaced apart a distance of three times the 
depth of the beam. Place the load applying block assembly in contact with the upper surface 
of the beam at the third points between the supports refer Photo 5. Carefully align the center 
of the beam with the center of thrust of the spherically seated head block of the machine. 
As this block is brought to bear on the beam-loading assembly, rotate its movable portion 
gently by hand so that uniform seating is obtained. Apply the load continuously and without 
shock with a screw power testing machine, with the moving head operating at approximately 
1.2 mm/min. With hydraulic machines adjust the loading to such a constant rate that the 
extreme fiber stress is within the limits of 7 ± 0.4 kg/cm2/min. Record the total load at failure 
of the specimen to the nearest 3 kg. Make measurements to the nearest 0.2 mm to determine 
the average width and depth of the specimens at the section of failure.

The combinations of the seating loads applied for dynamic loading should be suitably adjusted. 
The factor of safety 1.5 to be considered for design the elastic modulus obtained with beam 
dynamic test.
Considering beam test apparatus is not commonly available it is recommended to keep the 
basis of E value as UCS test which is more commonly available across various laboratories 
in country.
At the same time the commercial stabilizers must develop their own fatigue equation and get 
it verified by Government institutes like IIT.

MIX DESIGN EXAMPLE
(Refer Clause 4.3)
INPUT PARAMETERS
Design Traffic Loading (MSA)
The new composite pavement has been designed for full design life i.e. 50 MSA as per traffic 
projections.
Load Location
A global coordinate system is used to define load locations, the layered system geometry 
and the points below the road surface at which results are required. The global coordinate 
system is also used to describe the resultant displacements and stress and strain tensors. 
The X-axis is usually taken as the direction transverse to the direction of vehicle travel. The 
Y-axis is then parallel to the direction of vehicle travel.

Fig. 7 Global Coordinate System
The Z-axis is vertically downwards with Z = 0 on the pavement surface.
Two alternative formats are available for specifying the points to be used for results calculation:
	
An array of equally spaced points along a line parallel to the X-axis;
	
A grid of points with uniform spacing in both the X-direction and the Y-direction.

By the alternate of an array of equally spaced points along a line parallel to the X-axis, the 
following inputs are opted:
 
Option 1: Stabilized Base with Granular Sub Base
	
	
Z axis: 100.00, X axis: 0.00, Y axis: 0.00
	
	
Z axis: 340.00, X axis: 0.00, Y axis: 0.00
	
	
Z axis: 590.00, X axis: 0.00, Y axis: 0.00
 
Option 2: Stabilized Base with Stabilized Sub Base
	
	
Z axis: 100.00, X axis: 0.00, Y axis: 0.00
	
	
Z axis: 250.00, X axis: 0.00, Y axis: 0.00
	
	
Z axis: 400.00, X axis: 0.00, Y axis: 0.00
Design CBR
Subgrade strength has the profound influence on the performance of pavement as well the 
cost of the project too. CBR of 7 per cent has been considered for the determination of new 
pavement composition. 
Material Properties
Elastic Modulus (E Value)
The modulus value of the stabilized base composition for base has been derived from 
laboratory analysis by 4 point beam method. The average E-Value found is 2600 MPa. For 
analysis factor of safety is taken as 1.5. 
The E-value for design is 2600/1.5	
 = 1733.33 say 1700 MPa
Poisson’s Ratio
The Poisson’s ratios taken for analysis are shown in Table below:

Fatigue Criteria
Bituminous Surfacing
Considering the temperature 35oC & VG40 bitumen with reference to IRC:37 page 23, the 
elastic modulus of bituminous layer is taken as 3000 MPa.
	
Now if we put the E-value in given fatigue equation, further derive as
Nf = 2.021* 10-04 x [ 1/έt] 3.89 * [1/MR]0.854
Stabilized Aggregate Layer
The equation for cement stabilized referred in IRC:37 is
N = RF[(113000/ E.804 + 191)/ έt ]12
Where,
RF= reliability factor for cementetious material for failure against fatigue
N= Fatigue life of cementetious material 
E= Elastic modulus of cementetious material
έt= tensile strain in the cementetious layer microstrain 
Rutting Equation
As large number of data for rutting failure of pavements were obtained from the Research 
Scheme of MoSRT&H and other research investigations. Indian Roads Congress set the 
allowable rut depth as 20 mm, the rutting equation was obtained as:
N = 4.1656x 10-08[1/έv]4.5337
N = 1.41x 10-08[1/έv]4.5337
Where,
N = Number of cumulative standard axles to produce rutting of 20 mm
έv = Vertical Subgrade Strain (micro strain)

CHECKING OF THE SAFETY OF CEMENTITIOUS BASE DUE TO OVERLOADING
Since there are plenty of single, tandem and tridem axle loads which are far higher than 
standard axle load used for pavement design, thickness of cement layer must be checked 
for sudden fracture of the brittle material like cemented base due to higher axle loads using 
cumulative damage principle. One tandem axle is taken as two single axles and one tridem 
axle is taken as three axles carrying equal weight since the interference of stresses at the 
cemented base are little due to axle loads being about 1.30 m to 1.40 m apart. All multiple 
axle vehicles are combination of single, tandem and tridem axles. The axle load data can be 
classified or grouped in such a manner that all tandem and tridem axles can be converted 
into single axle repetition for stress analysis. The axle load spectrum of the traffic data is as

Cumulative Fatigue :
0.00181
It can be seen that total fatigue damage is less than 1. Hence the pavement is safe and 
Cementitious layer will not crack prematurely. There is no superposition of stresses in 
Cementitious layer due to location of this layer at shallow depth.
