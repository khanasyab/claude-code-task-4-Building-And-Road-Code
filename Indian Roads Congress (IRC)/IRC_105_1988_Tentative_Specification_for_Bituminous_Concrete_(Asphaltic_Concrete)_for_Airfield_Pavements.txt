cations & Standards Committee
in
their
meeting
held
at New
Delhi
on
the
24th
November,
1988
The specification got
the
approval of
the
Executive
Committee
by
circulation
and
the
Council in their meeting held on the 10th December,
1988.
2.
SCOPE
2.1.
This tentative specification deals
with
the
basic
out-
lines for the design, construction and controls needed
while
lay-
ing
bituminous
concrete
(Asphaltic
Concrete)
surface
course
mixes for airfields.
2.2.
Bituminous concrete shall be used as a
surface course
and normally
it should not
be
laid
directly
over
water
bound
macadam or any granular base.
2.3.
The work shall consist of
constructing
single layer of
bituminous concrete upto 50 mm
thickness
and
the
mix
shall
consist of mineral aggregates and appropriate binder mixed
in
a
hot mix plant and laid with
a
paver
on
a
previously
prepared
bituminous/cement
concrete
base
to
the
requirements
of
the
specification described herein and conforming to the lines, grades
and cross sections.
3.
DESIGN CRITERIA
Bituminous concrete mixes should be properly
designed
so
as to satisfy
certain
criteria
needed
to assure adequate stability
and durability.
The mix
as
designed
and
laid
should
satisfy
requirements given in
Table
1
based
on
Marshall
method
of
design, which
is suggested for the present for the sake of simplicity
and uniformity.
Table
1.
Requirement of the Mix
(i) Marshall Stability (ASTM Designation; D 1559)
determined on Marshall Specimens compacted by
75 compaction blows on each end, in kg (minimum)
820
(ii) Marshall flow, (mm)
2— 4
(iii) Per cent voids in mix
3—
5
(iv) Per cent voids in mineral aggregate filled with bitumen
75—85
(v) Per cent voids in mineral aggregate (VMA)
13—16
(vi) Binder content per cent by weight of total mix (to be
decided on Marshall design method)
5—7.5
Notes
:
(1)
It
is
suggested
that
higher
stability
values
consistent
with
other
requirements should be
achieved
as far as possible.
Also at touch-
down areas and
at taxi-tracks it is recommended that near minimum
flow values be specified.
(2) The binder content
in
the
case
of
slag
is likely to exceed the limit
indicated in the Table.

JOB MIX FORMULA
5.1.
While
the
laboratory
mix
design
gives
the different
proportions of the mineral aggregate
combinations
in
terms
of
individual sieve sizes of aggregate
blending
of
aggregates (each
size having within a range
of
individual
sieve
sizes)
would
be
necessary.
This
blending
ratio
is
obtained
on a
weight basis,
giving the per cent weight of the coarse aggregate,
fine
aggregate
and
filler to give
the
ultimate
aggregate
gradation.
It can also
tie proportioned on a volumetric basis based on
the
unit
weight
of bulk density of the
aggregate
supplied.
This
mineral
aggre-
gate
combination
together
with
the
corresponding
optimum
bitumen
content
as
determined
in
the
laboratory,
constitutes
the job mix formula for implementation during construction.
5.2.
While working out
the job
mix
formula,
it
shall be
ensured that
it
is
based
on
a
correct
and
truly
representative
sample of materials that will actually be used in
the work so that
(his lormula could be adhered to in practice on that specific con-
struction project and that
the
mix
and
its
different ingradients
satisfy the physical and strength requirements of these
specifica-
tions.
5.3.
Alongwith the job mix formula proposed
to
be
used
on the work, the following details shall be given
:
(i)
Source and location of all materials.
(ii)
Proportions
of

However,
in
restricted
locations
and in
narrow
widths where the
available
plant can
not be
operated, manual
laying of the mix may be
permitted.
The mix should be spread
in such a manner that after con, paction, the required thickness of
wearing course
is uniformly obtained.
6.5.3,
Longitudinal
joints and edges shall
be constructed
true to the delineating lines para^l to the centre line of the road.
Longitudinal joints shall be offset by at least
150 mm from those
in the lower course.
All joints, longitudinal,
transverse and con-
struction, shall
be
cut vertical
to the full thickness of
the pre-
viously laid
mix
and
the cut surface painted
with hot bitumen
before placing fresh material.
6.6.
Rolling and Compaction
6.6.1
.
After spreading by paver, the mix shall be thoroughly
compacted by rolling with a set of rollers moving at
a
speed
of
not more than 5 km per
hour,
immediately
following
close
to
the
paver.
The
initial
or
breakdown rolling shall be with 8 to
12 tonne three wheeled steel roller and the
finished
rolling
with
8 to
10 tonne tandem roller.
Before
finishing
with
the
tandem
roller,
breakdown
rolling
shall
be
preferably
followed by an
intermediate rolling with a
smooth
wheel
pneumatic
roller
of
15 to 30 tonne capacity having a tyre pressure of 7
kg/cm 2
.
All
the compaction operations
i.e. break down
rolling,
intermediate
rolling
and
finished
rolling
can
be
accomplished
by
using
vibratory roller of
8
to
10
tonne
static
weight.
During
the
initial or breakdown rolling and
finished
rolling,
the
vibratory
system shall be switched
off. The joints and edges shall be rolled
with 8 to 10 tonne three wheeled static roller.
The wheels of roller shall be kept moist to prevent the
mix
from adhering to them.
But
in
no
case
shall
fuel/lubricating
oil be used for this purpose nor
excessive
water
poured
on
the
wheels.
Rolling shall commence longitudinally from
edge
and
proceed towards the centre, except that on superelevated
points,
10



======================================================================

it shall progress from the lower
to
upper
edge
parallel
to
the
centre
line
of the
pavement.
The
roller
shall proceed on the
fresh material with rear or fixed wheel leading so as to
minimise
the pushing of the mix and each pass of
the roller
shall
overlap
the preceeding one by half the width of the rear wheel.
6.6.2,
Rolling
operations
shall
be
conducted
when
the
mix
is neither too hot nor too cold so that shoving or hair cracks
may be eliminated.
Rolling shall be continued
till
the
density
achieved
is
at
least 98 per cent of that of Laboratory Marshall
Specimen and
all roller marks are eliminated.
6.6.3.
Rolling operations shall be completed in all respects
before the temperature of the mix falls below 100°C.
7.
OPENING TO TRAFFIC
Traffic may be allowed after completion of the final
rolling
when the mix has cooled down to the surrounding temperature.
8.
CONTROLS
8.1.
Adequate
quality
control
at
every
stage of work
is
essential and as such a field laboratory must be set up
to
ensure
the following controls
:
8.1.1.
Periodic sieve analysis of each type of the
aggregate
at the cold feeder should be made to
see
that
the
gradation
of
aggregate follow the job mix formula.
The number
of samples
per day would depend upon the number of bulk
supply
of
the
aggregates made in a day at the
plant
site.
The
physical
pro-
perties as required, in Table 2 shall
be
determined
at
the
rate
of one
test
each
for
every
50— 100 m3
of
aggregates.
Filler
grading
shall
be
tested
at the rate of one test for every 5 m 3 of
filler.
8.1.2.
For
mix
grading
one
set
of
tests on individual
constituent
and
mixed
aggregate
from
the
dryer for each 100
tonnes of mix subject to a minimum of
two
sets
per
plant
per
day will be done.
8.1.3.
Peroidic
check
of
the
aggregate
at
the
gradation
control
unit
(if fitted
with
one) or at the hot mix gates should
be made to see that the proportion of the aggregates
as specified
in the job wise formula,
is complied with.
8.1.4.
Periodic check on penetration
and
softening
point
of the binder should also be
done
in
the
manner
specified
in
IS
: 1203 and
IS
:
1205.

It
shall
he
ensured
that
the
aggregates
are not
totally wet in which case
it would affect the output
of
the
plant
adversely.
The temperature
measuring
device
installed
at
the
end ol
dryer should be
checked
periodically
to
see
that
the
aggregate
temperature
never
exceeds
J63°C.
A tolerance upto
i<J
C
on the lower side could be permitted.
8.1.6.
The bitumen temperature should be well
within
the
limits specified.
The viscosity of heated
bitumen
shall
be
bet-
ween
150 and 300 centi stockes for which the normal temperature
range tor paving bitumen
is
1 50°— 177
C C.
8.1.7.
At no time
the difference in temperature
of
aggre-
gate and bitumen should exceed 14°C.
8.1.8.
At
least
one
sample
for
every 100 tonnes of bitu-
minous mix discharged at the
pugmill
chute
shall
be
collected
and the following tests done subject to a
minimum
of two
sets
being tested per plant per day.
(i)
3 Marshall specimens shall be compacted and tested
for
the
stability, How value, voids content and densitv.
The average
\alue should closely follow the Laboratory design value.
(ii) Bitumen shall be extracted from about
1000
grams
of
the
mix and bitumen content determined.
(iii) A
sieve
analysis
of
the
aggregates
after
the bitumen
is
extracted, shall be done and the gradation determined.
8.1.9.
The temperature of the mix
at
the
time
of laying
shall not exceed 160
r C and shall not be
less
than
120°C.
Care
should be taken to ensure
completion of compaction before
the
temperature
falls below the limit specified
in para
8.2.
8.2.
Rolling operation shall be completed in every
respect
before the temperature of the mix
falls below I00
c C.
8.3.
After the mix
is compacted the thickness laid may
be
checked by noting the depth
of
penetration
of
hot
steel
scale.
This shall aho be correlated with the measured area
of
the
sur-
lace laid and the total plant output of the mix
in tonnes (as «iven
in the plant scale).
Fore\-,
ft- or less
of compacted
surface,
one
field density test should be conducted
to
determine
the
density
ol
the mix as laid, compacted
and
finished.
The
bulk
density
shall not be less than 98 per cent of the Laboratory density.

8.5.
The longitudinal profile of the
finished
surface
shall
be tested with a straight edge 4.5 m long
parallel
to
the
centre
line and the transverse profile with a camber plate.
Any
irregu-
larity greater than 4 mm
shall
be
corrected.
The
longitudinal
profile of the finished surface shall also be tested with
a
rougho-
meter/profiiometer and
it should be ensured
that
the
roughness
shall not exceed 2000 mm per kilometre.
