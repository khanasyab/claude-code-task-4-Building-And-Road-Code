GUIDELINES FOR USE OF CONSTRUCTION AND DEMOLITION  
WASTE IN ROAD SECTOR
1 INTRODUCTION
The draft “Guidelines for Use of Construction and Demolition Waste in Road Sector” was 
first taken up by the Embankment, Ground Improvement and Drainage Committee (H-4) of 
previous tenure i.e. 2012-14 and was prepared by the Subgroup comprising Dr. Mahesh Kumar, 
Shri U.K. Guru Vittal, Shri Satander Kumar and Dr. N.B. Mazumdar. Later, the H-4 Committee 
was re-constituted for 2015-17 and the draft was deliberated in a series of meetings. The H-4 
Committee finally approved the draft document in its meeting held on 30th September, 2015 
and decided to send the final draft to IRC for placing before the HSS Committee.

The Highways Specifications & Standards Committee (HSS) considered and approved 
the draft document in its meeting held on 23rd June, 2017. The Executive Committee in its 
meeting held on 13th July, 2017 considered and approved the same document for placing 
it before the Council. The Council in its 212th meeting held at Udaipur on 14th and 15th July, 
2017 considered and approved the draft “Guidelines for Use of Construction and Demolition 
Waste in Road Sector” for printing.
Indian construction industry accounts for approximately 50 per cent of the country’s capital 
outlay in successive Five Year Plans’ projected investment and continues to show a growing 
trend. Construction & Demolition (C&D) waste which is generated by the construction 
industry, makes up about 25 per cent of the Municipal Solid Waste generated annually. The 
percentage of India’s population living in urban areas has increased from 14 per cent at 
the time of Independence to about 31 per cent at present. Demand for housing and road 
infrastructure in urban areas is also similarly growing. Legal restrictions on mining in different 
parts of the country, imposed due to environmental concerns have pushed the construction 
industry to plan for and promote the use of C&D waste in construction activities including 
road works.
Construction & Demolition waste constitutes one of the largest waste streams in the world. 
The amount of C&D waste generated in the country has increased considerably in recent 
years. Estimates by different agencies regarding quantum of C&D waste generated in our 
country varies. Management of C&D waste is of major concern due to the shortage of dumping 
sites and increase in transportation and disposal costs besides pollution and environmental 
degradation. Dumping of C&D waste across our cities chokes rivers, blocks surface drains, 
disrupts traffic movement and is an eyesore on the urban landscape.
Re-utilisation and recycling is an important strategy for management of C&D waste and it 
has important implication on natural resources and environment. Recycling of aggregate 
material from construction and demolition waste can help to reduce the demand-supply gap 
for aggregates, conserve depleting sources of good quality stone aggregates and decrease 
environmental degradation due to quarrying activities. Worldwide many countries are resorting 
to partial replacement of natural aggregates with C&D Waste to varying degree.

C&D waste can be used in all categories of roads including NH, SH and MDR. Its usage 
for low traffic volume roads under various schemes like PMGSY, MMGSY, MGNREGA and 
urban roads carrying low traffic (colony roads) would be greatly beneficial for our country as 
a whole.
1.1	
Terminology
Construction and Demolition (C&D) Waste – Waste generated during construction, 
demolition or renovation (remodelling) of any structure/buildings (residential/office/ 
commercial, etc) or associated activities for infrastructure provision.
Construction & Demolition waste as available in dump yards or at its place of generation 
would comprise of chunks of different sizes. To ensure utilisation of C&D waste, it is important 
that C&D waste (debris) is not mixed with excavated earth. Also wood pieces, plastic, metal 
bits if any, should be separated. Additionally such C&D waste (debris of different sizes) would 
require processing, i.e., crushing and sieving to bring it to proper gradation.
Processed C&D waste/Recycled Aggregates (RA): Processed C&D waste denotes 
material generated through crushing and sieving to yield a mixture of stone aggregates, 
brickbats, tile pieces, mortar pieces, etc having a particular size range, i.e., passing and 
retained sieve sizes, in other words, size graded material conforming to specification limits. 
Processed C&D waste is also called as Recycled Aggregates.
Recycled Concrete Aggregates (RCA) – Crushed and size graded concrete material 
produced from discarded or demolished concrete. RCA comprises of the stone aggregates 
(coarse aggregate) which were used for preparing demolished or discarded cement concrete 
(source concrete) and it is usually found to be having some amount of cement mortar sticking 
to stone aggregate particles. It does not contain brickbats, tile pieces, glass, etc.
Natural Mineral Aggregates (NMA) – Aggregate particles which are retained on 4.75 mm 
sieve, and have been derived from crushing naturally available gravel or hard stone, fulfilling 
strength property requirements for coarse aggregates as per IS 383, ‘Specifications for 
Coarse and Fine Aggregates for Concrete’.
1.2	
C&D Waste Disposal and Utilisation Studies and Practices
Industrialised countries have systems in place for recycling of construction and demolition 
debris. Use of Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste aggregates in road works is a widely 
accepted practice in countries like Denmark, USA, UK, France, Japan, etc. 
In the German construction industry, a ‘Closed loop recycling system’ operates for the 
management of C&D wastes resulting in recycling of the order of more than 80 per cent. 
The closed loop system comprises of steps for (a) avoiding construction wastes (b) recycling 
methods to allow reuse (c) reducing disposal of C&D wastes to the minimum possible extent 
and (d) avoiding the disposal of recyclable wastes.

About 95 per cent recycling of concrete rubble has been achieved in Japan. Emphasis in Japan 
has now shifted from ‘quantity-oriented’ to ‘quality-oriented’ recycling, to enable Recycled 
Concrete Aggregates (RCA) to be used in all types of constructions, including high strength 
concrete in new construction. Japanese Standards and Regulations have three classes 
of recycled aggregate: Class H, M and L denoting high, medium and low quality. Special 
techniques have been developed using mechanical scrubbing using eccentric tubular vertical 
mill and application of heat to remove mortar sticking to aggregate pieces for producing high 
quality recycled aggregate. 
Many Institutes/PWDs in India have carried out experiments and studies to understand the 
nature of construction and demolition waste with a view to evolve avenues for utilisation of C&D 
waste in various construction activities related to buildings, roads and other infrastructure. 
Some amongst them are:
	
o	
CSIR-Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), New Delhi
	
o	
National Council for Cement and Building Materials (NCCBM), Ballabhgarh
	
o	
Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), presently trifurcated

Delhi city can be considered as a typical example for Indian cities with regard to handling of 
C&D waste. It is estimated that the city of Delhi generates about 3000 tonnes per day (TPD) 
of C&D waste on an average. Respective Municipal Corporations of Delhi (MCD – North, 
South and East) are responsible for the transportation and disposal of unclaimed waste (Delhi 
Municipal Corporation Act, 1957) in their jurisdictional area. However, the total quantity of 
C&D waste collected and disposed by MCD is estimated to be less than the quantity of C&D 
waste generated in the city. Moreover, C&D waste is generally disposed of without adequate 
processing and it gets intermixed with other wastes. In addition to the ad-hoc nature of this 
system, constraint of space for storage of the C&D waste is the main concern. Keeping this 
in view, Municipal Corporation of Delhi (before trifurcation) and the environmental subsidiary 
of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd. (IEISL) carried out various exercises 
for appropriate management of C&D waste in Delhi. CRRI did a ‘Feasibility study on use of 
Construction & Demolition (C&D) waste in road works’ in which they carried out a detailed 
laboratory investigation on C&D samples collected from Delhi. It was found that processed 
C&D waste can be used in different forms in road works. 
1.3	
Sources of C&D Waste Material
The principal source for generation of construction and demolition waste are building 
construction/renovation/demolition sites. However, no authenticated data is available about 



======================================================================

quantum of C&D waste generation in India. TIFAC report (2001) states that estimated waste 
generation during construction is about 40 to 60 kg per sqm of built-up area. Similarly, waste 
generation during renovation and repair work is estimated to be about 40 to 50 kg per sqm of 
built-up area, and 300-500 kg per sqm for demolition of buildings. India added 1 billion sqm 
of housing in 2013, the C&D waste generated from new construction in the year 2013 would 
be about 50 million tonnes. As per 2011 census, urban areas in India had about 110 million 
dwelling units. Considering an average area of 75 sqm per dwelling and that 5 per cent of 
housing stock is taken up for renovation/demolition every year, C&D waste generation would 
be about 124 million tonnes per annum (BMTPC Guidelines on C&D waste 2016).
1.4 
Brief Details about International Specifications
Many countries around the world have incorporated several provisions to facilitate use of 
C&D waste for infrastructure building. Developed countries are leading in this regard.
European (CEN) Practice – EN 12620 includes recycled aggregate in the EN Standard for 
aggregate used in concrete. According to this EN code, aggregates can be of the following 
types:
 
• 
Natural aggregates from mineral resources,
 
• 
Manufactured aggregates of mineral origin, involving thermal or other 
modification, and
 
• 
Recycled aggregate, resulting from processing of inorganic material 
previously used in construction.
UK–BS 8500-2:200628 is the complementary British Standard to BS EN 206-1:200051, 
it refers to two types of recycled aggregate – Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA), and 
Recycled Aggregate (RA). RCA is obtained by crushing demolished concrete structures, 
discarded precast elements and unused hardened concrete. BS 8500 stipulates that RCA 
must be predominantly composed of coarse aggregates and masonry content should be 
less than 5 per cent. Such aggregate can be used in structural concrete of cube strength 
upto 50 MPa. In case RCA contains higher percentage of mortar, a maximum of 20 per cent 
replacement of coarse aggregate can be made in concretes of cube strengths between 25 to 
50 MPa. RA may contain masonry up to 100 per cent. 
Germany has elaborate regulations for recycling materials in order to utilise them and make 
them an alternative to fresh materials. Most of them are used in road construction. German 
guidelines DIN 1045 permits up to 25 per cent of RCA in structural concrete of cube strength 
37.5 MPa in dry or low humidity environments. Similar practices are followed in many other 
countries. Worldwide trends with regard to provisions in specifications for using C&D waste 
aggregates (RCA as well as RA) in concrete are summarised in the Table 1. (A.K. Mullick, 
2012)

2 SCOPE OF GUIDELINES
These guidelines deal with the use of processed C&D waste (RA and RCA) for road works 
such as embankment, sub-base and base course, for manufacturing kerb stones, paving 
blocks and for replacing a part of aggregates in different types of cement concrete pavement 
(PQC, DLC, Roller compacted concrete pavement, etc). C&D wastes can be used in all 
types of roads including NH provided relevant specification requirements as given in these 
guidelines are met with. These guidelines on C&D waste usage in road sector have been 
prepared based on experience gained by different agencies who have worked in this area and 
practices being followed around the world. Processed C&D waste (RA or RCA) should not be 
used for constructing reinforced soil walls or for making concrete to be used in structural/load 
bearing elements (Structures like bridges, culverts, flyovers, etc), pre-stressed concrete and 
also for bituminous pavement layers. Use of reclaimed bituminous materials from existing 
black top road pavements is not covered in these guidelines, for which MORTH Specifications 
section 519 can be referred to. 
3 ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS OF USING PROCESSED  
C&D WASTE PRODUCTS IN ROAD SECTOR
Using processed C&D waste for road construction has the following advantages:
	
a.	
Mitigates shortage of raw materials such as coarse aggregates, sand, etc., 
bridging the demand supply gap.
	
b.	
Usually it is available closer to the site, especially for construction within or 
near a city where C&D waste processing facilities can be set-up, thus saving 
transportation cost for the aggregates. 
	
c.	
Conservation of natural resources such as river sand, stone aggregates, etc.



======================================================================

d.	
Saving land required for dumping of C&D waste by its recycling and usage.
However, strength characteristics of processed C&D waste material may differ from natural 
mineral aggregates. This aspect should be kept in view for its proper use.
4. TYPICAL PROPERTIES OF PROCESSED C&D WASTE
Construction & Demolition wastes usually comprises of chunks of concrete, broken brick-wall 
pieces, rubble, tiles, stone pieces, mortar, plaster of paris, etc. Wood and steel (or metallic) 
components are generally removed for recycling before C&D waste is dumped in the dumping 
yards. Hence metal and wood are not generally seen in C&D waste. Demolition of ‘Pucca’ 
and ‘Semi-Pucca’ buildings, on an average generates about 500 and 300 kg of waste per 
sqm of built-up area respectively.
Many times, the C&D waste collected for disposal is heterogeneous in composition and 
contains considerable amount of excavated soil, making recovery of useful materials more 
difficult. Saleable material such as pipes, conduits, light sheet material used in ventilation 
system, wires, pieces of wood and sanitary fittings are removed at source for resale. For 
effective utilisation of C&D waste, care must be exercised to ensure that C&D waste does not 
get intermixed with excavated soil. Table 2 shows the composition of C&D waste as reported 
by different agencies. Typical physical and engineering properties of processed C&D waste 
as per CRRI study are given in Tables 3, 4 and 5. Table 6 shows typical properties of 
processed C&D waste aggregates as per a study conducted by Haryana PWD and Tables 
7 and 8 are based on a study carried out by NCCBM. Table 9 provides typical range of 
engineering properties of RCA from different Indian studies (Dr.P. Lakshmy 2015). It should 
be noted that properties of processed C&D waste shown in these tables are typical values 
given for information only and properties of any particular C&D waste aggregate intended to 
be used in road works may vary from these values. C&D waste properties vary depending 
upon composition of waste (relative percentage of brickbats, stone pieces, concrete, etc), 
strength properties of original constituents, age of the demolished structure, etc. Hence each 
sample of processed C&D waste should be tested to determine its physical and engineering 
strength properties before using it in any road project. Stabilisation techniques (preferably 
using cement) can be adopted to improve strength properties of C&D waste. The frequency 
of tests on C&D wastes (number of tests to be conducted) can be kept same as those 
specified for natural mineral aggregates.

φ value reported is apparently on the higher side. As reported in literature, φ value of C&D 
waste varies from 38° to 51° (M.R. Madhav, 2015). However, a limiting value of 40° may be 
considered for angle of internal friction during the design.

5 EFFECT OF C&D WASTE USAGE IN CEMENT CONCRETE
Cement concrete can be prepared using processed C&D waste aggregates (RA) or by using 
Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA). Many of the studies report usage of RCA rather than 
RA in concrete. The most significant factor that influences properties of RCA is that it contains 
hydrated hardened cement paste sticking to natural mineral aggregates. This hardened paste 
reduces specific gravity and increases porosity leading to higher water absorption. Also coat 
of weak mortar attached to aggregates results in weaker interfacial transition zone between 
aggregate phase and mortar, leading to reduction in strength of concrete. Table 10 shows 
the effect of replacing Natural Mineral Aggregate (NMA) with RCA in a high strength concrete 
mix, having cement content of 500 kg/m3 (PPC), silica fume and water/binder ratio of 0.243, 
on the physical characteristics of the concrete. The reference mix in Table 10 (without RCA) 
was designed for a target slump of 175 mm. The dosage of super plasticizer was maintained 
constant in all the mixes.

From Table 10, following conclusions can be drawn:
	
i.	
As the proportion of RCA replacing NMA is increased, workability (slump) 
decreases.
 
ii. 
Strength of concrete (compressive, flexural and split tensile strength) 
decreases with increase in RCA. Quantum of decrease in each type of 
strength varies from one another.
	
iii.	
Even with 100 per cent replacement of NMA, compressive strength values of 
60 MPa at 28 days with 80 mm slump were obtained.
From a review of published results, following conclusions have been reported with regard to 
usage of RCA in cement concrete:
	
i.	
When NMA was replaced with RCA by 100 per cent, compressive strength of 
concrete decreased by about 25 per cent at 28 days.
	
ii.	
Drying shrinkage and creep of concrete made using RCA, may be higher 
than concrete made using freshly crushed stone aggregates (natural 
mineral aggregates - NMA). However, the values seldom fall outside the limit 
permitted in structural codes, and up to 20 per cent replacement can give 
comparable results to concrete made using NMA.
	
iii.	
Concrete made using RCA tends to be less resistant to those deleterious 
reactions which are dependent on fluid transport into concrete, mainly as 
a result of increased permeability. Chloride ingress may be more rapid. 
Abrasion resistance is lower.
	
iv.	
RCA concrete has better resistance to carbonation than concrete made using 
NMA. However, it tends to be less resistant to fluid transport into concrete, 
mainly as a result of increased permeability.

CRRI carried out a study on effect of partial replacement of NMA by C&D waste aggregates 
(RA) on strength properties of Dry Lean Concrete (DLC) and Pavement Quality Concrete 
(PQC). Replacement was limited to coarse aggregates only. To investigate the effect of C&D 
waste on the properties of hardened Pavement Quality Concrete, M40 grade of concrete was 
designed using Portland pozzolana cement (IS 1489 – Part 1), coarse aggregates comprised 
of Delhi Quartzite (Natural mineral aggregates) and sand from Badarpur (near Delhi) was 
used as fine aggregate. In case of PQC, cement content was kept as 420 kg/m3 and water/
cement ratio was kept equal to 0.44 in all the mixes tested. For evaluating compressive 
and tensile strength, concrete mixtures containing 20, 40 and 60 per cent of NMA (Delhi 
Quartzite) replaced by processed C&D waste aggregates (RA) were prepared. Compressive 
strength results of PQC mixtures at 7 and 28 days are given in Table 11. It can be seen that, 
using RA in PQC led to decrease in 28 days compressive strength by about 12 per cent when 
60 per cent of NMA had been replaced by C&D waste aggregates (RA).

in Universal Testing Machine. Results of these tests are given in Table 12. These results also 
show marginal decrease in flexural strength, due to usage of RA.

mixes with different C&D content are given in Table 13. Recently, CRRI carried out another 
study using RCA and reported very nominal decrease in strength of concrete made with 
RCA+NMA mix in comparison with concrete made using NMA alone (Table 14). This was 
attributed to ‘rough texture of RCA which provides better bonding and interlocking between 
the cement mortar and the RCA’. Fly ash was also used as an admixture in these studies (Dr.
Lakshmy Parameswaran, 2015).

6 C&D WASTE PROCESSING PLANT IN DELHI
In collaboration with Municipal Corporation of Delhi (formerly under MCD, presently 
under North Delhi Municipal Corporation), a pilot project has been implemented by IL&FS 
Environmental Infrastructure & Services Limited (IEISL) to demonstrate the potential of a 
scientifically managed process for utilisation of C&D waste in Delhi. Salient features of this 
plant are given in this section. The activities carried out include collection, transportation to 
the designated processing site and processing of the waste to produce value added products. 
The plant was set up in the year 2009 on PPP basis at Jahangirpuri (Burari) in North Delhi in 
a seven acres plot provided by MCD (Photo 1). In this plant, C&D waste received at this plant 
(Photo 2) is processed to prepare value-added products like paver blocks, kerb stones, etc.

Being the first such project of organised management of C&D waste in the country, it has set 
an example, which can be replicated by other cities in India.

 
Photo 2 (a) and 2 (b) C&D Waste brought at Burari Plant in Delhi
The design and technology for processing was evolved from scratch, modifying and fine 
tuning the design a number of times. The initial capacity of 500 tonnes per day (TPD) of C&D 
waste has been expanded to 2000 TPD at present. The operations include crushing, sieving 
and sizing the C&D waste, separating ‘fines’ (particles less than 75 micron size) from the 
crushed C&D waste and using C&D waste aggregates to prepare value added products. The 
operational units in the plant include: 
 
• 
Inspection and weighing of C&D waste using computerised weigh bridge
 
• 
Mechanical and manual segregation and resizing (crushing)
 
• 
‘Dry’ and ‘Wet’ processing for separating different size fractions 
 
• 
Preparation of C&D waste products like coarse aggregates, manufactured 
sand, paving blocks, kerb stones, concrete blocks, etc.

Photo 3 Dry Processing of C&D Waste
The operations start with C&D waste being brought from designated dumping sites to the 
plant in trucks. The waste is unloaded on the tipping floor where undamaged whole bricks 
are removed manually for further use. C&D waste received at this plant is generally devoid 
of any wood or plastic or metal. Any such waste if present, is also manually removed. C&D 
waste is then crushed manually and/or mechanically to 200 mm to 400 mm size range for 
further processing, using dry process or wet process. In the dry process, concrete pieces 
are segregated manually and are fed to the crusher for size reduction (Photo 3). The dry 
processing unit handles and processes concrete blocks and stones to produce Recycled 
Concrete Aggregate (RCA).
Wet process has been developed to improve the recovery ratio from the C&D waste received 
at the plant (Photo 4). Moreover, wet process is less noisy, creates less air pollution and the 
end products are cleaner. The biggest advantage of wet processing facility is extraction of 
sand from the processed C&D waste. This helps in generating more amount of useful output 
from the facility and lesser amount of process residues. The wet processing line consists of 
different units like Grizzly crusher(s), Prograde for separating very fine sized particles (less 
than 75µ size), Vibro screens, Evo-wash (washing plant) and Sedimentation tank (called 
‘Thickner’). The Wet Processing system at Burari has been designed to handle about 60 
tonnes of C&D waste per hour. Water is recycled after sand washing so that only about 10 to 
15 per cent of fresh water is required. As reported by IEISL, products made in this plant have 
been tested in various laboratories and found to be suitable. Market has been developed for 
these products (Photo 5 to 8). The products made in this plant have been priced at a lower 
cost than Delhi Schedule of Rates (DSR) as shown in Table 17. The approach road to this 
plant has been paved with concrete made using C&D Waste (Photo 9)

7 SPECIFICATIONS AND METHODOLOGY FOR USING PROCESSED  
C&D WASTE IN ROAD SECTOR 
In this section, salient aspects of specifications and methodology for usage of C&D waste 
in road works are given. Processed C&D waste can be either Recycled Aggregates (RA) or 
Recycled Concrete Aggregates (RCA). Construction of road embankment, sub-base and 
base layers of road pavement can be taken up using RA or RCA. For concrete applications, 
RCA is preferred, however RA can also be used in concrete applications as explained in 
section 7.7.
7.1	
Processing of C&D Waste
Before using C&D waste in road works, it requires processing (mainly crushing and grading). 
Adequate care should be exercised when C&D waste is produced during construction or 
demolition activities to ensure that, it is not intermixed with soil or wood (or any other organic 
material like leaves, plant braches, etc) or plastic (waste plastic bags, pipes, etc). Glass and 
ceramic tiles are not generally separated from C&D waste. However, adequate precautions 
should be exercised to protect workers (use of gloves and gum boots) from such sharp 
edged pieces. Metallic parts (reinforcement steel, wires and cables, etc) are usually removed 
before or during demolition as they have high scrap value. Even then, if some metallic parts 
are still left behind, they should be removed before crushing the C&D waste.

The next step would be crushing C&D waste in stone crushers (Jaw type crushers) of suitable 
capacity to convert the big chunks of debris to desired gradation (re-sizing). For using C&D 
waste in rural roads or for small works, Engineer may allow manual crushing of C&D waste, 
instead of mechanical crushers. C&D waste after crushing should be checked for its gradation 
and if it meets the specification requirement for the application for which it is intended to be 
used, no further processing would be required. Otherwise, crushed C&D waste would have 
to be sieved using mechanical sieves available at stone crushing plants to bring C&D waste 
aggregates to required gradation. Additionally, mechanical stabilisation (intermixing particles 
of different gradation using tractor towed rotavators in the field) may also be adopted. After 
processing C&D waste in this manner, it can be used in road works in following ways:
	
a.	
Embankments
	
b.	
Flexible pavements – In granular sub-base layer, for bound/cement stabilised 
base and sub-base course and for granular base courses
	
c.	
Concrete pavements – Dry lean concrete, Roller Compacted Concrete, Plain 
cement concrete pavement
	
d.	
Paving blocks and Kerb stones

Processed C&D Waste for Embankment Construction
Crushed C&D waste (RA) can be used as fill material for embankment construction since 
it fulfils MORTH and MORD Specifications with regard to density and plasticity. However, 
in case of earth embankments, maximum size of coarse material should not exceed 75 
mm. In case of rockfill embankments, MORTH Specifications limit the maximum size of 
coarse particles to be 300 mm. C&D waste in unprocessed form normally contain particles 
of different sizes. Hence it would be necessary to crush C&D waste, so that maximum size 
of the particle is less than 75 mm. If it is not economically feasible to crush C&D waste to 
75 mm and below size, the Engineer may allow particles of bigger size (upto 300 mm size) 
subject to field demonstration of satisfactory compaction. Compacted C&D waste, per se, 
may not support growth of vegetation and may be having surface voids. It is also a non-plastic 
material, and hence, embankments constructed using C&D waste would be prone to erosion 
and subsequent failure. Hence it is suggested that side slopes of embankments constructed 
using C&D waste should be protected by providing a good earth cover, in a manner similar to 
fly ash embankments (Fig 1). The side cover thickness can be about 0.5 m for embankment 
height less than 1 m. For embankments of height varying from 1 to 3 m, cover thickness 
can be kept as 1 m. Cover thickness of 1.5 to 2 m would be required for embankments of 
height exceeding 3 m. The design of the embankment (stability analysis) is mandatory for 
high embankments (embankments of height 6 m and above), and design should be carried 
out as per IRC:75, ‘Guidelines for the Design of High Embankments’. Crushed C&D waste 
may have a very high value of angle of internal friction (φ). However, it is recommended that 
actual φ value should be determined using laboratory tests on representative samples and in 
any case, a maximum limiting value of 400 be considered for φ value during stability analysis. 
Further, C&D waste usage for reinforced soil wall construction (reinforced earth embankment 
or mechanically stabilised earth wall) is not recommended.

Before undertaking construction of road embankment using C&D waste, clearing and 
grubbing activities should be carried out at the proposed site. After clearing and grubbing 
operation, the existing ground needs to be compacted as per specification requirements. 
Embankment construction activities can then be started by laying loose layer of crushed 
C&D waste. The material shall be tipped, spread and levelled in layers extending to required 
dimensions by a suitable dozer. Side earth cover shall also be spread simultaneously to 
provide confinement to C&D waste. Water should be sprinkled above this loose layer by 
using water tankers. Quantity of water required can be based on field trials or compaction 
test carried out on crushed and powdered C&D waste in the laboratory. After sprinkling water, 
mixing should be carried out by using a tractor towed disc harrow or rotavator. The tolerance 
limits of variation from the specified moisture content (OMC) are normally +1 per cent to 
–2 per cent. However, due to porous nature of C&D waste particles, slightly higher quantity 
of water may sometimes be required. Compaction can then be carried out using vibratory 
rollers to the specified degree. The compacted thickness of each layer should not be more 
than 250 mm. For constructing embankments for rural roads having height less than 1.5 m, 
the Engineer may permit use of static rollers, but thickness of compacted layers shall be 
restricted to 150 mm. After compaction of each layer, the surface voids shall be filled with 
broken fragments of C&D waste or good earth. Next layer, where required, shall be placed 
in the same manner, above the earlier compacted layer. The top of the embankment shall 
be provided with subgrade constructed using good earth to act as a sealing layer over C&D 
waste embankment. The quality control operations can be carried out as per MORTH or 
MORD specifications depending upon category of the road in a manner similar to earthen 
embankments.

Granular Sub-base Construction Using RCA
MORTH Specifications Section 405 provides Guidelines for ‘Crushed Cement Concrete Sub-
base’ which consists of breaking and crushing the damaged cement concrete slabs (i.e., 
RCA) and re-compacting it as sub-base in one or more layers. This clause restricts use of 
‘Cement concrete’ only. Cement concrete should be crushed to conform to WBM aggregate 
gradations given in Table 18. Crushed material can be compacted using tandem or vibratory 
rollers with light sprinkling of water. Thickness of each compacted layer shall not be more 
than 75 mm. For details, MORTH Specifications (Section 405) can be referred.

RA Usage in GSB Layer
Crushed C&D waste (RA) is a heterogeneous material and contains brick bats, mortar, tile 
pieces apart from concrete chunks. However, crushed C&D waste is a free draining material, 
possessing good CBR value. If adequate care is taken to ensure that C&D waste is not 
mixed with clayey soil, crushed C&D waste would be a non-plastic material. However, the 
gradation of crushed C&D waste may or may not satisfy the MORTH or MORD Specifications 
for sub-base layer. By suitably modifying the crushing process and by adopting mechanical 
stabilisation technique (by mixing gravel/moorum/sand and crushed C&D waste in suitable 
proportions as per IRC:SP:89 ‘Guidelines for Soil and Granular Material Stabilization Using 
Cement Lime and Fly Ash’), it would be possible to obtain desired gradation for using it in sub-
base layer. Such mechanically stabilised processed C&D waste should be tested to ensure 
that its gradation, plasticity and strength requirements meet MORTH or MORD Specifications 
for GSB materials, depending upon type of the road in which it is intended to be used. 
7.5	
C&D Waste for Bound/Cement Stabilised Sub-Base/Base Course
The base course of flexible pavements normally consists of granular layers like WBM or 
WMM. Presently IRC:37 ‘Tentative Guidelines for Design of Flexible Pavements’ as well as 
IRC:SP:72 ‘Guidelines for the Design of Flexible Pavements for Low Volume Rural Roads’ 
provide templates for design of flexible pavements by adopting bound/cement stabilised 
base and sub-base layers. C&D waste aggregates (RA) usually contain brick bats and hence 
they may not satisfy strength criteria (AIV or Los Angeles abrasion value) for aggregates to 
be used in granular base courses like WBM or WMM. However, processed C&D waste (RA 
as well as RCA) can be stabilised using admixtures like cement or a mixture of cement+fly 
ash or cement+slag or a combination of such cementitious materials. After stabilising C&D 
waste, it can be used for bound sub-base or base course construction. When C&D waste 



======================================================================
PAGE 31 of 37
======================================================================
IRC:121-2017
22
is crushed, both coarse aggregate sized particles and powdered C&D waste are produced. 
Both these components can be stabilised using cement and used in sub-base or base course 
construction.
MORTH or MORD Specifications as well as IRC:SP:89 and IRC:SP:72 can be referred to 
for gradation and strength requirements of admixture stabilised (bound) C&D waste. In case 
of rural roads, minimum 7 days compressive strength of 1.70 MPa is required for cement 
stabilised C&D waste for its use in sub-base course. IRC:SP:72 (which is applicable to rural 
roads) stipulates minimum 7 days compressive strength of 3.0 MPa for cement stabilised base 
course layer. IRC:SP:89 specifies 7 days unconfined compressive strength varying from 1.5 
MPa to 12 MPa for cement stabilised base/sub-base course depending upon gradation of the 
material. Mix design of cement stabilised C&D waste should be carried out as per IRC:SP:89 
to decide percentage of cement to be added to C&D waste for use in cement stabilised layer. 
Further, the design mix should satisfy the durability test requirements also as per IRC:SP:89. 
7.6 	
C&D Waste for Granular Base Course
RCA can be used as a component for construction of granular base courses like WBM, WMM, 
etc in case, it fulfils aggregate requirements like gradation, strength, water absorption, etc as 
per MORTH Specifications in case design traffic is more than 2 msa or MORD Specifications 
in case design traffic is less than 2 msa. Strength properties of RA are generally inferior 
to RCA. RA can also be used in lower base course of rural roads if it meets aggregate 
requirements like gradation, strength, water absorption, soundness, etc. 
7.7	
RA and RCA Usage for Cement Concrete Pavement/Paving Blocks/Kerb 
Stones
As per MORTH and MORD Specifications, aggregates conforming to IS:383 can be used 
for constructing plain cement concrete pavement, dry lean cement concrete sub-base, roller 
compacted concrete, paver blocks, kerb stones, etc. C&D waste aggregates (RA or RCA) 
after processing (crushing and sieving) may not exactly meet strength requirements specified 
for aggregates to be used in cement concrete as per MORTH or MORD Guidelines. RCA 
may contain coating of cement mortar sticking to it, which may cause reduction in strength 
properties of concrete and such concrete may have higher shrinkage. Hence, following 
points are suggested for using C&D waste aggregates (RCA and RA) for cement concrete 
pavement, paving blocks and kerb stones:
	
(a)	
Studies have shown that when natural sand is used, up to 30 per cent of 
natural crushed coarse aggregate (natural mineral aggregates - NMA) can 
be replaced with Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) without significantly 
affecting strength properties of the concrete for grades upto M40. Hence, 
Recycled Concrete Aggregates (RCA) of size more than 4.75 mm can be 
used for partial replacement of NMA for rigid pavement construction (PQC 
and RCCP) for rural roads and urban colony roads having average daily 
traffic less than 200 vehicles per day. Further such replacements shall be 
restricted to concretes of grade M30 and below. Replacement of NMA by 



======================================================================
PAGE 32 of 37
======================================================================
IRC:121-2017
23
processed C&D waste aggregates can be restricted to about 20 to 30 per 
cent depending upon laboratory test results. Combined gradation of RCA 
and NMA shall meet the specified gradation of coarse aggregates to be 
used for PQC. This combined gradation shall be used during the mix design. 
Replacement of NMA by RCA is not advocated in case of PQC used for 
highways (M40 and above).
	
(b)	
Replacement of NMA by RCA in dry lean concrete base course can be 30 
per cent. Combined gradation of RCA and NMA shall meet the specified 
gradation of coarse aggregates to be used for DLC or RCCP as the case 
may be. Mix design has to be carried out after incorporating RCA. 
 
(c) 
In case of kerb stones and paving blocks used for footpaths and light traffic 
(cycle and two wheeler track, parking areas and rural roads carrying average 
daily traffic upto 200 vehicles per day) RCA can be used to replace upto 
100 per cent of NMA provided specified compressive strength is achieved 
at 28 days. Combined gradation of RCA and NMA shall meet the specified 
gradation for coarse aggregates to be used for paving blocks/kerb stones.
	
(d)	
During processing, some amount of powdered C&D waste is also produced 
apart from coarse aggregate particles. Powdered C&D waste can be used 
to replace about 20 to 25 per cent of natural sand in DLC and RCCP using 
concrete of M20 grade or less. Usage of powdered C&D waste to replace sand 
can be in addition to usage of RCA or RA which are used to replace coarse 
aggregates (NMA). Use of such powdered C&D waste as manufactured 
sand to replace natural sand in higher grades of concrete (more than M20) 
is not advocated. Instead, as indicated in Section 7.5, such powdered C&D 
waste can be used in stabilised pavement layers.
	
(e)	
When C&D waste aggregates (RA or RCA or manufactured sand) is used in 
PQC/DLC/RCCP or for Paver blocks, concrete mix design has to be carried 
out as per IRC specifications using C&D waste aggregates and optimum 
quantities of different materials (natural as well as C&D waste aggregates, 
binder, water and super plasticisers if any) shall be determined. Same mix 
proportions shall be adopted during execution of road works.
	
(f)	
When C&D waste aggregates are used, mixing of ingredients for concrete 
can be carried out by adopting ‘Two Stage Mixing Process’. In this process, 
first, the required amount of NMA, fine aggregate and RCA or RA as the 
case may be, are mixed for about 60 seconds. About half of the required 
quantity of water is added to this aggregate mix and mixing continued for 
another 60 seconds. Cement is added to this mix and mixed for 30 seconds. 
Remaining half of the required quantity of water is then added and mixing is 
continued for 120 seconds to yield the concrete mix ready for placement and 
compaction.
	
(g)	
Processed C&D waste aggregates (RA, RCA or manufactured sand) should 
not be used for pre-stressed concrete or in structural concrete (bridges, 
culverts, flyovers, etc).

Quality Management
Quality management is essential for achieving the goal of constructing durable and good 
quality roads. Processed C&D waste (RA and RCA) shall be free from deleterious material 
such as, organic content, vegetable matter, coal, clay lumps, external substances such as 
plastics, carry bags, paper etc. RA shall also be free from chemicals, known to be detrimental 
for the strength or durability of concrete such as, chlorides, sulphates, etc. beyond the 
threshold value. Quality checks (including frequency and type of quality control tests) for 
embankment or pavement layer construction using C&D waste aggregates shall be carried 
out in the same manner as per provisions of MORTH or MORD Specifications for relevant 
components of work using naturally available materials. Application of provisions of MORTH 
or MORD Specifications shall be decided depending upon category of the road. Further, 
standards from BIS regarding aggregates and concrete (IS 383, 456 etc.) need to be kept in 
view in this regard.

SUCCESSFUL CASE STUDIES
Several state governments as well as union government have taken up several initiatives to 
promote usage of C&D waste. India’s first plant for recycling of C&D waste was established 
in 2009 at Burari in North Delhi by IL&FS under an agreement with North Delhi Municipal 
Corporation. Brief details of this plant have already been given under Section 6. Based on 
the success of this venture, another C&D waste processing plant was established by IL&FS 
at Shastri Park, New Delhi in association with East Delhi Municipal Corporation. Details of 
other initiatives/successful case studies are given below:
CONSTRUCTION OF RURAL ROAD USING C&D WASTE BY KRRDA
Karnataka Rural Roads Development Agency (KRRDA) constructed a rural road near 
Bengaluru City in Nov 2012 by using processed C&D waste (RA). Pavement cross section 
adopted by them is shown in Fig 1. This rural road constructed under NGNRY scheme of 
Karnataka Government, provides connectivity to Sydamipalya village, a rural habitation having 
population less than 500. C&D waste for constructing this road was collected from Bengaluru 
City. Collected C&D waste was crushed to bring it to gradation specified for conventional 
GSB/Soil-Aggregate materials and used in road construction. The Control Section consisted 
of GSB, Soil-Aggregate and WBM Base layers and PMC with seal coat as wearing course. 
In the first test section, crushed C&D waste was used to replace GSB. In the second test 
section C&D waste was used to replace both GSB as well as Soil-aggregate base course. 
The performance of all the sections has been good (Photo 1 and 2).

PAVEMENT WIDENING WORK USING C&D WASTE IN DELHI 
Demonstration test road construction of about 150 m length involving usage of stabilised 
C&D waste in both bound as well as granular (unbound) form for base and sub-base course 
respectively, was taken up jointly by CRRI, IEISL and MCD in 2009 at Delhi. The work involved 
widening existing road pavement on both sides of the road. For sub-base, crushed C&D 
waste conforming to GSB gradation specified by MORTH was adopted. Over the granular 
sub-base, 150 mm cement stabilised base course (5 per cent cement admixture) was laid. 
For mixing cement with crushed C&D waste, tractor towed disc harrow was used (Photo 3, 4 
and 5). The pavement cross adopted is shown in Fig 2. Performance of this stretch monitored 
over a period of two years was very good.

EAST KIDWAI NAGAR, NEW DELHI
M/s Enzyme India Pvt Ltd has set up C&D waste recycling plant with the support of M/s 
NBCC in 2014 to use C&D waste generated during ‘Re-development of East Kidwai Nagar, 
New Delhi’. The project involves demolition of 2444 existing houses and allied structures. The 
plan is to produce bricks/kerb stones using C&D waste generated in an eco friendly manner.
AHMEDABAD, GUJARAT
Ahmedabad Enviro Peojects Pvt Ltd has commenced a 100 tonne per hour capacity plant 
for recycling C&D waste since June 2014. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has 
designated 16 spots around city where citizens can dump C&D waste. The agency then 
collects C&D waste from these designated spots in their own vehicles. The C&D waste thus 
collected is being used to produce RCA, bricks, blocks and other precast concrete products.
