INTRODUCTION
1.1.
Background
A good road network has an important bearing on the economic growth of a country. Huge length of
roads falling
in various categories, such as, National Highways, State Highways, Major District Roads, etc.,
exist in the country and road construction projects comprising original construction work as well as repairs are
being taken up all over the country on these roads.
In the changing scenario of globalization and economic liberalization, a great deal of emphasis
is
already laid on development of infrastructure through construction of a dependable road network. Consequently,
consistency in the quality of road and incorporation of quality as major attribute in the organization entrusted
with the task of road construction have assumed paramount importance.
Quality of a product or service has many aspects and the fact that quality should conform to the
customer's requirements has now become the focal point in managing quality in all organizations/projects.
However, quality was often considered as conformance to specifications particularly in the road sector and was
based on detection at the end of production stage, thus, ensuring conformance to specified requirements
entirely through inspection and testing of the product at the end.
This was the quality control phase through
which the road construction industry has been travelling in the recent past.
If one looks around in trie corporate sector,
it is revealed that mere conformity to specifications is no
longer considered as a measure of quality and the major corporate organizations have switched to a Quality
Assurance* (QA) phase. The QA stresses on planned and systematic working with a view to eliminate non-
conformities.
Statistical process control techniques are employed to assure that the product meets specified
requirements, rather than achieving
it through detection and rejection of defectives at the end of production
The concept of quality assurance has already been employed through development of manual and procedures
in a few of the major bridge/road projects in the country. However, the concept needs to be universalized so as
to incorporate assurance of quality in all the road works being carried out.
The road construction industry, now employs the quality control approach in its work and the procedures
and testing methodologies are brought out under publication of IRC: SP:
1 1 (Hand Book of Quality Control for
Roads 3nd Runways). While addressing to its terms of references, the IRC-Project Preparation, Project Contract
and Management Committee (H-8) under the Chairmanship of Shri P.D. Wani took up the task of bringing out
a revised
draft of the above document. A Sub-Committee was constituted
for this purpose under the
Chairmanship
of Shri
K.B.
Rajoria,
Engineer-in-Chief,
Public Works Department, New
Delhi. During

IRC:SP:57-2000
the meeting of this Sub-Committee held at New Delhi on 18.10.97,
all the members present, expressed the
need to incorporate the principles of quality assurance in the road construction works and accordingly
it vyas
decided to bring out guidelines on preparation of quality assurance manual for roads and runways.
Shri S.M.
Nerkar was entrusted the task of revising the IRC: SP:1 1
.
In line with MOST Specifications for Road Works,
Third Revision, and Shri J. Ganguii was assigned the task of drafting the "Guidelines for Quality Assurance in
Roads".
In the meantime, the IRC brought out a document IRC: SP: 47-1998 "Guidelines on Quality Systems
for Road Bhdges (Plain, Reinforced, Prestressed and Composite Concrete)" for bridges.
This document
incorporates the elements of quality assurance in respectof bridge works.
In the IRC H-8 Committee meeting
held at New Delhi on 8.11.1998,
it was decided to revise the IRC: SP:
11 and also bring out a separate
document for Quality Assurance System for Roads; on the lines of the document for bridges. Accordingly, the
bridge document was kept in view while drafting the document pertaining to highways and road works.
The document as prepared by Sub-group was discussed in Project Preparation, Project Contract and
Management Committee (H-8) in the meetings held on 31 .1 .99 at Hyderabad and on 28.8.99 at Mumbai. The
Committee (personnel given below) approved this document in its meeting held at Mumbai on 28.8.99.

The Guidelines were approved by the Highways Specifications & Standards Committee in its meeting
held at New Delhi on 21
. 1 2. 1 999. Later on, these Guidelines were approved by the Executive Committee during
its meeting held at New Delhi on 2.5.2000 and by the Council during its
1 59'^ meeting held at Pune on 26.5.2000.
The document presented herein incorporates the elements of quality assurance in highway and road
works and should serve as a useful guide to organizations entrusted with managing quality in such works.
Needless to say the approach towards quality assurance
is based on the ISO-9000 standards which are
currently being employed universally as QA Standards in managing quality.
1.2.
Need for 'Guidelines on Quality Systems'
In order to achieve the aim of building safe, serviceable, durable and economic highways/roads, the
road structure should meet certain requirements. The characteristics that a structure should possess to fulfil!
these requirements have to be specified. The codes of practice and the contract documents strive to achieve
this by way of defining design criteria, practical rules, technical specifications, testing and acceptance criteria
and workmanship.
All these strategies implicitly depend upon human skills for their successful and reliable
application which, eventually, determines the quality of highways/roads. The basic desire to produce quality
work is essential in the minds of all those connected with highways/road projects.
In order to achieve the required level of quality of the final product, as specified by engineering science,
it is necessary to have a strategy for management of human skills by way of Quality System defining quality
policy, quality assurance plan and quality audit.
Apart from
this,
it
is also necessary to explicitly define
'Quality' itself, which is expected to be achieved through the Quality System. These guidelines have, therefore,
been evolved to facilitate preparation of appropriate Quality System for individual highway/road projects. Use
and application of these guidelines will inculcate,
in
all those involved
in highway/road building activity, an
ability to provide the product or services expected of them consistently, thereby, assuring the users and
instilling confidence in the users.
In drafting these guidelines, an attempt has been made to achieve compliance with international codes
on Quality Systems, published by International Standards Qrganization. Compliance with the present guidelines
will be a step towards obtaining ISO Quality Certification, enabling Indian designers and contractors to compete
internationally.

1.3.
Scope
These guidelines cover quality systems for activities of highway/road construction using asphaltic,
concrete pavements. These include project preparation, design and drawing, construction and supervision,
contract management, quality of materials and equipment used in construction, and workmanship. The guidelines
also cover the organizational requirement for adoption of quality system by suppliers, purchasers, owners,
approving authorities and consultants.
These guidelines will enable:
(i)
Compliance with codal requirements of quality control.
(ii)
Setting up of internal quality systems for each of the organizations dealing with
,
various aspects of highway/road construction.
(iii)
Setting up of external quality systems by the suppliers, to ensure conformance to
specified requirements
(a)
At final inspection or,
>
(b)
During production and installation, or
(c)
During several stages, such as, design/development, production, installation
and maintenance.

GENERAL APPROACH
2.1.
Concept
The term 'Quality' has been defined as the totality of features and characteristics of a product or
services that bear on
its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs.
In the contractual environments, needs/
requirements are specified, whereas, in other environments implied needs/requirements should be identified
and defined. The code of practice endeavours to meet the requirements by a three pronged strategy.
Firstly,
it specifies the acceptable materials of construction outlining the various tests of acceptance; secondly,
it
defines various design criteria practical rules and sound engineering practices for guiding the designers
in
arriving at appropriate structural solutions; and thirdly,
it deals with the workmanship and other aspects of
construction which ensure that the design intents are realised in actual construction. The contract documents
and technical specifications define the inter-relation of various parties to the contract as well as the requirements
of quality.
All these strategies implicitly depend upon human skill for their successful and reliable application.
The total system of policy, management responsibility, internal and external control, testing and quality
control, acceptance criteria, corrective action, and documentation
is covered
in the quality system,
it also
encompasses the overall organization structure, responsibilities, procedures and processes for implementing
quality management.
The aspect of overall management functions that determines the quality policy and
implements
it by such means as quality planning, quality control and quality assurance within
its quality
system,
is referred to as 'Quality Management'.
The terms used in the field of quality management have acquired specific meanings and applications,
different from the generic definitions found in dictionaries. Internationally accepted definitions and terminology
have been included in Annexure, which also gives corresponding usage in relation to highway/road projects.
The 'purchaser' or 'customer' is the term used for those who place order for the 'product' or 'service' and the
term 'supplier' for those who undertake to procure/produce/supply the same. The quality of the product (or
service) is ensured and maintained by following a documented 'Quality Plan' which sets out specific quality
practices, including 'Quality Control' which are operational techniques of controlling quality. 'Quality Assurance'
(QA) includes all those planned actions necessary to provide adequate confidence that the product (or service)
will meet the requirements, and is essentially a system of planning, organising and controlling human skills to
assure quality. Quality Assurance Plan sets out planned actions required for quality assurance. The continuous
monitoring and verification of the status of QA activity to ensure that
it
is being followed
is called 'Quality
Surveillance'.
'Quality Policy' is a formally-documented statement of management's intentions and directions
as regards to quality. 'Quality Audit' is a managerial tool used for reviewing the whole or a part of the quality
system by internal or external agencies not connected with operation of QA plan. 'Total Quality Management'

brings to these concepts a long term global management strategy to achieve and improve quality and calls for
the participation of all members of the organization for the benefit of the organization itself,
its members,
its
customers and society as a whole.
2.2.
Principal Components of Quality System
Implementation of quality system involves the following principal components:
(i)
Supplier's Quality Policy
Commitment of the management of supplier to achieve and sustain quality of the product or
service to meet purchaser's stated or implied needs, whether contractually required or not.
(ii)

2.4.
Quality Assurance and Quality Assurance Manual
Quality Assurance (QA) is defined as all the planned and systematic activities implemented within the
Quality System and demonstrated as needed, to provide
adequate confidence that an entity will
fulfill the
requirements. A Quality Assurance Manual (QAM) provides a base document outlining policy, procedures,
responsibilities, compliance, acceptance criteria and documentation.
It should be prepared and accepted by
all parties concerned before start of project.
It should generally cover the following:
(a)
Identification of all parties involved in QA and their inter-relationship.
(b)
Internal QA system of each party.
(c)
Levels of cross-checking/verification in case of multiple verifications/controls,
including systems of inspection and audit, wherever applicable.
(d)
Qrganization of personnel, responsibilities and lines of reporting for QA purposes.
(e)
Criteria for acceptance/rejection, including identification of proper authorities for such
decisions.
(f)
Inspection at the end of defect liability period.
(g)
Items to be covered in maintenance manual.
(h)
All formats for documentation.
Though, several parties may be involved in enforcing quality assurance for any particular item of work
or a product, the ultimate responsibility of compliance with QAM and of achieving required quality generally
rests with one party. When process and/or product control is carried out by the supplier/producer or his agent,
it
is termed as internal control or 'one level' control. For important items of work, independent parallel checks/
supervision are carried out by one or more agencies, either on full scale or on sample basis. This is normally
carried out as external control or second level control.
In some cases,
third level of control may also be
required, such as, that by a regulatory body or by insurance agency.
These levels of control parties, their
functions and inter-relation between them should be clearly defined
in the Quality Assurance Manual. The
Manual also should identify the responsible parties, their functions and inter-relation between them.

Classes of Quaiity Assurance for Roads
Depending upon the levels of checking/cross-checking and controls, required to provide adequate
confiQ6; ce, four classes of quality assurance are mentioned below
:
Classes of quality assurance
Class Nomenclature
(1)
Nominal QA
Q-1
(2)
Normal QA
Q-2
(3)
HighQA
.
Q-3
(4)
Extra HighQA
Q-4
,
There will be four classes of QA for Highway/Road construction.
2.6.
Guidelines for Selection of QA Class for Highway/Road Projects
Prior to 'Project Preparation' stage, one of the four classes of QA should be chosen for the project.
This classification should be reviewed depending on site specific problems and types of solutions being evolved.
At this stage the final selection of the overall QA class of the project should be made.
Simultaneously,
decision regarding upgradation of class for some of the activities,
if found necessary, should be made as
explained in Section 3.2 of this document.
The following guidelines are given for selection of appropriate QA class for Highways/Roads. The word
roads include Village Roads, Other District Roads and Major District Roads and Highways include
State,
National Highways and Expressways.
For roads described above, the owners must prescribe encourage implementation of an appropriate
QA as per the guidelines given below:
Selection of a QA class (out of Q-1
, Q-2, Q-3 and Q-4 class) for a particular situation will have to be
made diligently taking into account the speciality of the situation, e.g., A road normally coming under
Q-1
or Q-2 class
if located close to coast, high altitude, high
rainfall, needs to be classified under
Q-3 class.
An appropriate QA class needs to be selected right from the investigation stage and further for preparation
of project, execution of project, etc.
Large projects of upgradation of State Highways to National Highways will have to appropriately classified
in Q-3 or Q-4 class depending upon the provisions for upgradation.
Quality Assurance requirements for these four QA classes are given in Table No. 3. 1
. Various activities,
like, project preparation, design and drawings, contractual aspects, etc. for these four QA classes may be
12



======================================================================
PAGE 23 of 168
======================================================================
IRC:SP:57-2000
performed either by the in-house staff or by external agency depending upon the importance and the QA class
of the project, e.g., data collection for the project preparation for Q-1 class can be done by in-house staff.
Whereas, data collection for Q-3 class will have to be done through specialised agencies and cross-checking
may be through in-house agency. Such important differentiation of the inputs in case of these four QA classes
for different activities are enumerated in the Table 3. 1
(1 )
Q-1 class QA is recommended for Village Roads
(2)
Q-2 class QA is recommended for the following:
(a)
Other District Roads
(b)
Major District Roads
(3)
Q-3 class QA is recommended for the following;
(a)
State, National Highways
(b)
Coastal Roads.
(c)
Roads in high altitude. (Decide quality classification based on IRC:SP:20
-Appendix-B)
(d)
Roads in high rainfall areas average over 2000 mm
(4)
Q-4 class QA is recommended for the following:
(a)
Motorways/Expressways
(b)
Roads in Tunnels/Urban Underpasses
(c)
Roads built over high water table areas (Subgrade within a range of 1 500 mm
from capillary fringe defined in IRC:34-1 970)
(d)
Roads built over reclaimed land
(e)
Elevated highways in urban areas not covered under IRC:SP:47-1 998
2.7.
Quality Assurance Manual for Highways/Roads
2.7.1.
The owner, consultant, approving authority, main contractor, material suppliers, specialist/
nominated sub-contractors, manufacturers of materials being incorporated in permanent works are the parties
involved in the overall QA system for road construction.
Typical organisational structure for various parties involved
in design and construction (owners,
consultants, contractors) are given in Figs. 2.1
, 2.2 & 2.3.
2.7.2.
Various activities on a road project can be classified under three groups.
(1)
Design
(2)
Construction
1
(3)
Manufacturing



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 168
======================================================================
IRC:SP:57-2000
2.7.2.1
.
In design activity, purchaser is the authority who places the order for design and/or
project preparation.
It may be either the owner of the road as in the case of preparation of detailed
design, or the contractor, as in the case of design and construct contracts. Supplier is the consultant
who undertakes to prepare the design.
The design, drawings and tender documents are the end
products. The QA manual should cover those requirements of quality system, which concern services
or expertise.
2.7.2.2.
In construction activity, purchaser is the authority who places order for the construction
of road. Supplier is the contractor who constructs the road.
In this case, the end product is the road.
2.7.2.3. Manufacturing activities fall under the following two categories.
'
The first category consists of factory manufactured item for general use, like, aggregates,
cement, bitumen/bitumen products, reinforcement, etc. Quality assurance for manufacture of these
items need not be covered under the Quality Assurance Manual for Roads.
However, the requirements of quality system pertaining to the specifications of quality, testing
and acceptance procedure, procurement, storage, traceability and such other relevant items, which
are to be carried out by owner/designer/contractor, should be covered therein.
The second category of manufactured items cover chain link fencing, road markers, lane
dividers, lighting masts, energy absorbing terminals, road signs, etc. manufactured by specialist suppliers
and are purchased for use as finished products by the contractor.
The quality assurance manual
should cover the quality assurance of such items.

IRC:SP:57-2000
QUALITY ASSURANCE REQUIREMENTS OF DIFFERENT
CLASSES OF QUALITY
3.1.
General
This section contains detailed guidelines indicating requirements of different classes of quality for road
projects. The selection of a class for projects
is discussed in Section 2. The requirements of quality control
and level (degree) of control are given in Table 3.1 under six sub-heads, as follows:
(1 )
Project Preparation
(2)
Design and Drawings
(3)
Contractual Aspects
(4)
Construction Organizations
(5)
Materials
(6)
Workmanship
Aspects of projects preparation as well as designs and drawings have been covered briefly, and are
indicative of the general approach. However, the aspects of construction affecting quality are covered in greater
detail.
3.2.
Project-Specific QA Plan
The contents of the table provide broad check-list of various activities for a typical road project.
List A
as indicated
is not to be considered complete.
It may be modified to suit any specific project requirement/
specification. Based on this table and QA class chosen
in accordance with Section 2 a detailed 'project-
specific' quality assurance plan shall be prepared.
All relevant factors must be considered in detail before
finally choosing the overall quality assurance class for a particular project or even for particular activities within
the project itself, taking into account the consistency of the QA requirements for all critical components of the
road. Such QA plan
is normally prepared by the owner or by construction agency and when prepared by the
latter,
it
is scrutinized and approved by the Owner or the Consultants to the project. The QA plan shall be
documented
in the form of QA Manual. The QA plan/manual so prepared should form part of the contract
agreement.
A typical QA plan for construction activities
is illustrated
in Section 4.

SECTION 4
TYPICAL QUALITY ASSURANCE PLAN FOR
DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION
4.1.
Introduction
Quality planning
to assure quality of product has been adopted over the
last few decades for
special and complex projects.
However,
in case of highway engineering and construction, efforts
in this
regard are visible only
in the recent years.
As a result of continuing efforts,
it has become possible to
evolve appropriate methods and level of documentation for Quality Assurance plan for highway projects.
Surveillance of project implementation,
if well organized into a quality assurance plan, contributes
towards
quality.
For
this,
step
by
step
procedures which would
help
in
achieving
consistent and
comprehensive methods of checking and approval of works at every stage, need to be established and
documented.
These procedures should be reviewed
periodically, amended, as found necessary, and
revised documents prepared.
'All parties involved
in the QA plan should have their internal QA systems clearly defined
in form
of
a
specific
Quality
Assurance
Manual
(QAM)
for
the
respective
purposes,
such
as, QAM
for
manufactured products (by the manufacturers or suppliers).
It
is also necessary for owner/purchaser to
have his own internal QA plan. QAM for highway project as a whole integrating
all these plans shall be
prepared/or approved by the owner and/or approving
authority,
if any.
Each vendor
(i.e.,
supplier,
designer, contractor, manufacturer) will thus, have his own internal QA procedures which are required to
be agreed upon,
in advance, with the purchaser of the respective activity.
As highway building
in India
is
mostly undertaken by Govt, agencies,
it
is necessary that the contractor/designer obtains concurrence of
their QAM from
the concerned Government Department
('Department').
The Guidelines
provided
in
Sections 2 and 3 should be used by the respective parties
in evolving of the operational QAM
to be
agreed between the contractor and the Department for adoption at site.
Quality assurance plan for a road construction project, documented
in quality assurance manual,
would essentially comprise the following aspects:
•
Organisation
•
Control
of data and
documentation,
both
product
(roads)
related documents and
quality
related records together with control documents.

4.3.1.
Road related documents
Drawings, specifications, work instructions and other road related documents shall be maintained
as described below to ensure that only the latest approved documents are used for the construction of
each part of the work, which covers both the temporary and the permanent works:
45



======================================================================
PAGE 56 of 168
======================================================================
IRC:SP:57-2000
(a) The issuing authority should maintain the registers of drawings/documents giving information
about reference number, revision reference,
title/date of issue, to whom issued, number of
copies
issued,

4.3.2.
Quality related records and documents
For quality assurance of work,
it
is essential to document each and every operation and activity
connected
with
the work and
maintain
the
record
of
inspections,
approvals/non-approvals and
other
statistical
day-to-day
information
about
the
progress
of work.
These
are
normally recorded
in
the
standard forms (to be specially evolved for each activity) and they constitute an important component of
the Quality Assurance Manual.
Each activity or operation could be broadly categorised as under:
(a)
Method Statement
The method statements give detailed proposals
of the constructing agency which are
approved by the 'Engineer' (owner's Engineer-in-charge of the
project). These method
statements are written
in form of various steps in a particular sequence supplemented by
suitable sketches
to be
self-explanatory.
No change
shall be
carried
out from
the
procedures prescribed
in the method statements without first obtaining approvals to such
change from the 'Engineer'.
(b)
Inspection Proforma
These
are
used
for
the
purpose
of
seeking
approvals
from
the
'Engineer'
or
his
representative before commencing every operation, such
as, pour cards
for concrete,
approval
to reinforcement, approval
to formwork,
approval
to
setting
out,
approval
to
earthworks, approval
to asphalting,
etc. These are usually supplemented by standard
check-list which have to be verified by the 'Engineer' and after he
is satisfied about the
vahous points the approval
is then accorded on that form.

IR:SP:57-2000
(c)
Test Results
This set of proformae
is meant for recording the results of day-to-day tests carried out
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
or
specifications.
The
proformae
are
usually
maintained
in two forms; one
is loose leaf system for recording the various observations
during each test and second is for recording the summary of test results in a register form
to facilitate later analysis.
(d)
Daily Diary of Work and Quantity Records
Elaborate
registers
are
required
to
be
maintained
at
site
to
record
the
day-to-day
operations,
activities and events taking place
at the
site of work, such
as, equipment
deployed,
manpower
deployed,
activities
carried
out,
different
types
of
materials
consumed, detailed observations of the
activities
at
site (foundation
strata,
tilts,
shifts,
etc.), visits by senior level engineers and follow-up of their instructions. These records will
enable
preparation
of
the
completion
report
as
well
as
investigating
any
unusual
observations, which come to notice afterwards.
(e)
Non-conforming Products
Detailed statements have
to be prepared describing the procedures to be followed as
soon as any result not conforming
to the requirements
(or unusually better results)
is
obtained.
Such statements deal with the
(i) procedures to be adopted for rectification of
the
particular component where
such
result
have
been
noticed,
(ii)
the
long
term
corrective
action,
and
(iii)
immediate
preventive
actions
in
other
similarly
affected
activities
till the long term corrective actions are implemented.
(f)
Quality Audit
A separate set of proformae with detailed
instructions are
laid down
for facilitating the
audit of the quality assurance by an independent unit at periodical intervals.
4.4.
QA Procedure for Setting out Works and Temporary Works

IRC:SP:57-2000
4.8.
Protection during Construction Stage
In order to produce a quality end product,
it
is necessary to lay down procedures for preventing
any damage
or deterioration
of the
various
materials
brought
to
site as
well
as
the works
partially
completed or fully completed
till the completion of the entire job.
These procedures will have to be laid down
in respect of the following:
(a)
Storage
of
materials,
like,
cement,
rebars,
aggregates,
bitumen,
emulsions,
inflammable
solvents, etc.
(b)
Protection of the partially completed components of the road, both from the point of view of
structural
stability
(including
the
hydraulic
factors) and
from
the
adverse
effects
of
the
environment.
(c)
Prevention of accidents to the structure as well as all personnel working on the project due to
incomplete work or works in progress.
If any deterioration
is noticed
inspite of protective measures, the same
is to be rectified before
taking up subsequent operations.
4.9.
Non-Conforming Products
For quality assurance of the finished work,
it
is necessary for the materials and workmanship to
fully comply with the work requirement.
Non-conforming work has to be dealt with as per procedures for
dealing with non-conformities as per Proforma F1
Special situations, however,
arise, such as, strength of concrete, where non-conformance may
only be known after sometime, e.g., after 28 days. Therefore, separate detailed procedures should be laid
out for dealing with such non-conforming concretes (Refer Proforma E-1 for further guidance).
4.10.
Quality Audit
The Quality Assurance Manager of constructor and 'Department'
shall objectively evaluate the
extent of compliance with the quality systems and their effectiveness. The audit shall include the process
and product quality audit as well as the assessment of adequacy of systems as laid out in QA Manual.
The audit programme
shall assign
qualified personnel
to perform such
audits and define the
procedures and frequency of audits, the method of reporting the findings and recommendations and the

Design Aspects
It is assumed in the earlier sub-section that the design
is not the contractor's responsibility and
is
separately finalised by the Departnnent. However, where the contractor
is also to supply the design, the
QAM should include the agreed procedures for the items listed below to achieve QA in design:
(a)
Organisation and Functional Responsibilities (including Personnel Qualifications)
Responsibilities for ensuring quality by persons in-charge of design and assuring that the
stipulated quality indeed has been achieved (assurance function of QA team) need to be
clearly defined.
(b)
Design Basis Report for Development of Design
This includes:
.
•
Requirements of project/client
•
Preliminary drawings and
data: source,
responsibilities
of supply and methods
of
verification
•
Design approach, applicable codes, special design specifications
•
Methods of analysis, calculation, checking and internal approvals
•
Contents of design reports (detailed calculations)
•
Final drawings
•
Checking and approval by external approving authority,
if any
(c)
Preparation and approval of design
This includes:
•
QA on software (prior testing and verification)
•
Design preparation
•
Design verification (independent review, alternative analysis and qualification testing)
•
Interface control (internal and external)
•
Control of manufacturers/vendors design
•
Approval to design, distribution of design documents and document control
•
Design change requests
•
Checking and approval by external approving authority,
if any
(d) Audit and corrective actions
(e) Design documentation and records
4.12.
Proformae of Quality Records
As mentioned earlier, exhaustive and detailed proformae will have to be evolved and prescribed
for the above purpose for each of the major highway to suit its special requirements, which form a part of
the Quality Assurance Manual
for the
project.
However,
certain
typical proformae which have been
adopted on some of the work sites
in
India, are attached for each of the category to give an idea of the
structure
of these
forms.
These
are
not complete
in
themselves and
they need
to
be
modified,
augmented or supplemented according to the needs of a particular work.

SECTION 5
TYPICAL PROFORMAE
Note:
Typical Proformae which have been adopted on some of the work sites
in India are attached to
give an idea of the format of these Proformae.
These are indicative and may be modified, augmented or
supplemented according to the needs of a particular work. The proformae are divided into categories:
Category A:
Planning Proformae
-
Category B:
Inspection Proformae
Category C:
Calibration Proformae
Category D:
Surveillance Proformae
Category E:
Proformae for Registers and Records
Category F:
Proformae for Procedural Guidelines of QA System.

SURVEILLANCE OBSERVATIONS
The following items should be observed during concrete pour by the OA Survillance Team
1)
Mixing of Concrete:
Check the concrete class and the respective mix design already approved.
Check the condition of the aggregates to be used.
Check the weighing and water dispensing method adopted during the mixing.
Check that the mixer machine has been cleaned properly.
Check that the required mixing time is allowed.
2)
Transportation/Conveyance (as Specified, but generally to cover following):
Check
if the equipment is in proper working order.
Check
if the specified methods are being followed.
Check
if the stipulated time limits are observed.
Check
if the non-conforming wet concrete is being rejected and disposed off.
3)
Placing of Concrete
Check that:
The concrete is not segregated during pour. The height of dropping
is controlled.
The concrete
is poured
in layers.
The vibrators are being applied systematically to compact uniformly and adequately,
avoiding over vibration.
The concrete is not being pulled or pushed. Pouring
is being done close to the final
position.
The cold joints are not allowed to be developed.
The under water concrete is being poured only by tremies or pipeline.
The forms are not getting displaced or deformed during the concrete pour and vibrating.
No cement slurry is getting lost. Suitable number of carpenters are present to watch
and repair formwork dunng the pour,
if required.
The concrete is poured within the allowable time limits from the time of batching.
The concrete cubes are taken as required.
The curing arrangements are satisfactory
The equipment is in working condition.
The equipment is cleaned properly.
The quality of wet concrete is as per specifications, (slump, homogenous mix etc.)
Continuous supply of concrete is assured.

GUIDELINES FOR NON-CONFORMING WORKS
1.
General
In broad terms, for the Quality Assurance of the finished work
it is necessary for the materials
and workmanship to conform with the Contract requirements.
Ideally, non-conforming work shall be
rejected.
The statement above
is true
in general terms,
but special
difficulties arise
in the case of
concrete, where
the non-conformance may
only
be known
after 28 days cube
results become
available,
in which period work has progressed further.
In some of the situations, acceptance after
repair/review for adequacy
is feasible.
Therefore, separate procedures are
laid out for some of the
non-conforming
situations.
In case
the
feasible
items do
not meet the
requirements
after such
repair/review, the non-conforming item should be rejected.
2.
Concrete/Asphalt Work
The
primary means by which
Quality Assurance
shall be achieved
is by
the procedures
described
in relevant material qualification and workmanship method statement.
The non-conforming
concrete/asphalt items shall be further reviewed, as given below;
2.1.
Non-Conformance other than Strength or Finish
In the event that any requirement other than strength and standard of finish
is not met, then
the following procedure shall be followed:
1.
The contractor shall be notified without delay verbally, and
in writing by the following
means:
(a)
Return of the request for Inspection Form signed "not approved" with the reason
for rejection stated.
(b)
Issue of a
Site
Instruction
or
Site Works Order or
letter
stating the
facts and
confirming that the works are not approved.
98



======================================================================
PAGE 109 of 168
======================================================================
IRC:SP:57-2000
2.
Approval to carryout concreting/asphalting of a similar nature shall be withheld.
3.
The Contractor shall be asked for his proposals to rectify the non-compliance, which
may involve re-submission of materials, new trial mixes, revised method statement.
4.
,
'
The acceptance
or
rejection
of any
unapproved
concrete/asphalt work
shall
be
referred to the Engineer.
5.
When satisfied with the measures taken to ensure future compliance, the Engineer
shall confirm approval to continue concrete/asphalt for permanent works.
2.2.
Non-Conformance with Strength Requirements
1.
The
specification
strength/density
for
concrete/asphalt
recognises
the
statistical
possibility of cube failures and thus
limits of means, standard
deviation, minimum
values of strength are specified. The rejection criteria
is set out in the agreement.
2.
In the event of cube/density failures outside the provision of the Contract then the
non-compliance procedures described in the specification shall be followed:
(a) Approval of concreting/asphalting of similar works shall be withheld.
(b)
All aspects of concreting/asphalting shall be reviewed.
(c) The clause
of
failure
shall be
identified and measures taken
to remedy
the
problem.
:
^
5.
Various
repair/rectification
procedures
for commonly
arising/non-conformance
are
specified
in contract. The contractor shall furnish his exact proposals for rectification
under consideration.
"
4.
The fact of non-conformance and the proposed rectification procedure is conveyed to
the engineer/design
organization
of owner
(or design
consultant)
for review and
opinion about:
(i)
Acceptability of measure proposed by the contractor,
if any.
(ii)
Further non-destructive testing,
if any.
(iii)
Acceptability in case strength is achieved at a later age (e.g., 90 days)
(iv)
Acceptability
at
the
level
of
strength
achieved
for
the
stress
levels
in
concerned members.

IRC:SP:57-2000
(v)
Acceptance of repair/rectification/strengthening measures with modifications,
if required, or rejection.
5.
Rejection
in case the item does not pass modified acceptance limits after repairs.
2.3.
Non-Conformance with Finish Requirements
1.
Where the required
finish
is non-attained then the non-conformance procedure
for
repair/rectification as described
in the Specification shall be followed.
2.
In addition, the following procedures shall be followed:
/
(a) Approval of similar work shall be withheld.
(b)
All aspects of work shall be reviewed.
(c) The cause of poor finish shall be identified.
3.
Revised
specifications/instructions
to avoid
further recurrence of non-conformance
shall be issued.
2.3.1.
Non-conformance
in case of earthworks, base and other pavement coarse can be
treated as per guidelines under Section 2.1
, 2.2, and 2.3 0.0 applicable.
3.
Records
1.
It
is mandatory that
all instances of work outside the specification are recorded
in
writing and conveyed to the contractor.
This ensures that:
(a) The contractor is irrefutably informed.
(b) A record of non-compliance is built up to give a general guide to the contractor's
performance.
2.
The records of repair/rectification, retesting, inspection and acceptance shall be kept
as part of 'as-built' documentation.
3.
Record of all references to designers for concessions/rectification and approval given
by them shall be kept.
^
4.
Record of compliance to the modifications
in procedures, testing,
etc.,
if any shall be
kept.

2.
Example of Quality Audit Report
The scope and depth of the Quality Audits shall be determined by the Quality Assurance
Team responsible to the Management. The procedures for quality audit of concrete, asphalt and wet
mix macadam are given below for illustrating the principles.
3.
Quality Audit of Quality Systems
A modern
technique
for assessment
of the
index
of quality
of work, which
is based on
collectively evaluating the overall quality of work, has been in vogue recently on certain projects and
it
enables qualifying quality index. For each of the important item of work, certain attributes are listed
which contribute or affect the work quality of that item. Individual scores are then assigned to each of
these attributes on a scale of 0 to 5 depending on observations and scrutiny of that attribute of that
site. The sum
total
of the scores
of
all
attributes
for
particular
item
divided
by maximum score
achievable
is termed as quality index of that item. Generally, quality index of 66 per cent and above
may be accepted, but a score below that should call for detailed scrutiny and investigation about the
causes of lower quality index to enable necessary remedial measures.
It has to be noted that this index is only an adhoc yard stick to serve as a guide to gauge the
extent of Quality Assurance System being exercised at site.
It
is not to be related to any acceptance
criteria or payment to be made.
As this is relatively a new concept,
it may be necessary to periodically review the
list of
attributes and their relative weightages for measuring the quality index from time to time after gaining
actual experience for some time.

in dictionaries.
Some of the definitions taken from ISO:8402 of 1994 are given under sub-groups A2 and A3.
These terms have been further clarified
in these codes by additional notes for which reference may
be made to the code
itself.
The notes printed
in bracketed
in this section are added for clarifying the
applicability for road construction.
It
is also found necessary to define certain other general terms in order to clarify their usage
in the

Non=conformity and Corrective Actions
11.1.
Definition-
Non-conformity
is a
deficiency
in
charter,
procedure
or other requirement
which renders the
quality of an
item unacceptable with respect to some defined
criteria,
e.g.,
physical defects, test failures, incorrect procedures.
11.2.
Classification of Non-conformity and Corrective Action
It is proposed to classify non-conformities and procedure for dealing with non-conformities. As per
flow charts Figs. 11.2.1 and 11.2.2 which are self explanatory. Procedures will be evolved as per
the flow chart guidelines.
