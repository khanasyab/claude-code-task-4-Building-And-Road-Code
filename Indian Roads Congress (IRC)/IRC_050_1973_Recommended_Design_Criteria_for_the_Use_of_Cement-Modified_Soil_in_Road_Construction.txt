RECOMMENDED DESIGN CRITERIA FOR
THE USE OF CEMENT-MODIFIED SOIL
IN ROAD CONSTRUCTION
1.
INTRODUCTION
1.1.
Addition of cement to soils has been tried successfully to
improve their resistance to softening action of water, and other beha-
vioural properties.
As such, stabilisation with cement has been used
extensively in road construction.
The technique commends itself for
adoption
especially
in
areas
where
the
cost of conventional road
aggregates may be
high.
1.2.
Recommendations
in
this
Standard
cover
the use of
'cement-modified
soil'
for
sub-bases,
as distinct from
'soil-cement'
which
is a stronger material, reserved usually for base courses.
1.3.
This standard was initially prepared by tiie Soil
Engineer-
ing
Committee
(personnel
given
below).
It was
processed and
approved
by
the
Specifications
and
Standards Committee in their
meeting held on the 29th
and 30th September 1972.
Later this was
finally
approved
by the Executive Committee in their meeting held
on the
1 1th
March
1973 and by the Council in their 81st
meeting
held at Cochin on the 26th April
1973.

SCOPE
2.1.
The
extent
to
which
soil
properties
get modified by
cement
action
depends
greatly
on
the
concentration
of cement.
With cement
in
the
range
of 7 to 10 per
cent, depending on other
factors the mixture may develop considerable
compressive
strength.
The
strength
could be around 17.5 kg/cnr or more when tested on
cylindrical
specimens
after
curing
for 7 days.
A
material of this
nature is knovv'n as *'soii-cement" and has found wide usage
in many
countries
for
base
course
construction.
Soil-cement
is
usually
designed on the basis of unconfined compressive strength, or wet and
dry durability test, limits for which have been laid down in
specifica-
tions from these countries.
2.2.
On
the
other
hand,
considerable
advantage
could be
gained by
the limited improvement
of soil as a result of addition of
smaller quantities
of
cement, without necessarily improving the soil
to the level of soil cement.
A soil processed
with these objectives is
known as cement-modified soil.
Considerable amount
of work,
in
the laboratory as well as in the
field, has been
carried out
in
India
on the utilisation of this
material.
It has been shown that even with
small concentrations of cement, of the order of 2 to 3 per cent, a soil
could develop adequate strength to satisfy the requirements of a road
sub-base.
As
an
illustration,
the
strength developed by a typical
soil
with
different
concentrations
of
cement
is indicated
in
the
Annex lire.
2.3.
Recommendations
in the Standard are restricted
to the
use of cement-modified soil.
It is presupposed that the work will be
carried
out
fully
according
to
construction
specifications
with
requisite site supervision over the quality of materials and process of
construction.

3. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
3.1.
Soil Type
3.1.1.
Generally, granular soils free of high
concentrations
of
organic matter or deleterious salts are suitable for cement-stabilisation.
For checking the suitability of soil,
it would be advantageous to keep
the following criteria in view
:
(i)
Plasticity
modulus,
expressed
as
the
product of
PI of soil and per
cent
fraction
passing 425 micron sieve, should not exceed 250 and
(ii)
Uniformity
coeflicient
of soil
should be greater than
5 and prelera-
biy greater than 10.
3.1.2.
Soils not suitable for cement-stabilisation are
:
(i)
Hcav\
clays including black cotton soil having a PI greater than 30
(ii)
Soils having organic content higher than 2 per cent
(iii)
Highly micaceous
soils, and
(iv)
Soils with
soluble sulphate or carbonate
concentration
gicater
than
0.2 per cent.
3.3.
Concentration of Cement
3.3.1.
The amount of cement will depend on the type of
soil,
design requirements, and overall economic
considerations.
Because
of
difficulties
of uniform
mixing, however, cement content of even
2 per cent may be necessary
in the case of hand mixing.
3.3.2.
In
every
case, cement concentration must be expressed
as per cent by weight of the dry soil.
3.4.
Degree of Pulverisation
3.4.1.
For effective stabilisation,
it
is necessary
that the soil
must be in a well pulverised state bet ore cement
is added. The degree
of
pulverisation
should
be
such
that
at least 80 per cent of soil
passes
through 4.75 micron sieve and there are no lumps
larger than
25 mm.

3.5.
Strength
Criteria
3.5.1,
Cement-modified soil mixes should be designed
on
the
basis of their soaked CBR value.
3.5.2.
For
design
purposes,
field
CBR should be regarded
only as 45 to 60 per cent of that obtained in the
laboratory,
depen-
ding
on
the
efficiency
of mixing, placing, curing and other related
factors.
3.6.
Mix Design
3.6.1.
The proporations for cement-modified soil
mix
should
be determined in the laboratory.
The
following
procedure may be
adopted
for this
:
(i)
The
soil
should
be tested for
PI, sand fraction
sulphate/carbonate
concentration,
and
organic content, in order to assess
its suitability
for stabilisation (vide para 3.1.);
(ii)
Moisture-density relationship
for the soil
should
be
established
as
per IS: 2720 (P.ut VII)—1974;
(iii)
After pulverising
the
soil
to the degree indicated in
para. 3.4, CBR
specimens
with
varying percentages of
cement should be
prepared
at maximum dry density and optimum moisture
content
correspon-
ding
to
IS:
2720
(Part VIl)-1974.
The
specimens
should
be
initially
cured
for
3
days
followed
by soaking in water for 4 days
prior
to
their
testing
as per IS
: 2720 (Part XVI)— 1965.
At least
3 specimens should be tested for each cement concentration; and
(iv)
On
the
basis
of
strength
results,
the design
mix should be chosen
keeping in view the criteria set out in paras 3.3.
and 3.5.
