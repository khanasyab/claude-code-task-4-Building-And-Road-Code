2 SCOPE
The material shall consist of plant mixed readymade pothole patching bituminous mixture
composed
of mineral aggregate coated with bituminous
material. The
material
shall be
capable of being stocked for at least six months without stripping and shall be workable at
all times. Unless specified otherwise, this mix shall be supplied
in 50 kg plastic lined, sturdy
bags. This material is intended for patching potholes up to 75 mm deep. For deeper potholes,
patching mix shall be placed and compacted
in 75 mm thick layers. Details on preparation
of potholes, placing and compacting the mix in potholes are also given to ensure its effective
use. The readymade cold patching mix is suitable for patching potholes only and shall not be
used for patching long stretches of damaged road surfaces.
Medium Curing Cutback Bitumen MC-800 conforming
to
Indian Standards
Specification
IS:217 Specification for Cutback Bitumen shall be used
in preparing the patching mix and
shall be supplied by a certified manufacturer of this product. For proper mixing, the bitumen
shall be heated as specified in Section 4.
MC Cutback Bitumen shall be treated with a proper type and amount of an anti-stripping
agent by the approved bitumen
supplier so that when combined with the proposed job
aggregate the
resulting mix
shall pass the Wet Coating Test,
Static Immersion Test and

18:14982. The Contractor shall furnish the sample of the job aggregate each year to the
bitumen supplier for these coating and stripping tests and obtain a certificate that the bitumen
material has been treated to suit the job aggregate. This yearly certificate must be on file and
shall be available at the asphalt mix plant when required by the Engineer. The Contractor
shall also forward a copy to the Engineer. Under no circumstances, the Contractor or the
department shall be permitted to manufacture the MC Cutback by blending paving bitumen
and kerosene.
3.2
Coarse Aggregate
3.2.1
The coarse aggregate shall consist of crushed rock, crushed gravel or other hard

IRC:116-2014
water absorption of 1.0 or less shall be used. The amount of residual bitumen binder (total
cutback bitumen minus diluent such as kerosene)
in the mix shall be as shown
in Table 3.
The readymade patching mix shall be rejected
if
it does not meet the grading (especially the
0.075 mm sieve) and the minimum residual bitumen content. The produced mix shall be tested
by an independent approved testing laboratory before its acceptance by the Engineer.

Based on the characteristics of the aggregate and the performance of the mix, the Engineer
can specify amount of residual bitumen higher than that shown in Table 3.
The Contractor shall ascertain from the supplier of MC-800 as to how much residual bitumen
it contains. For example,
if the MC-800 contains 80 percent bitumen and 20 percent kerosene
and a total of 6.0 percent MC-800 is used by weight of the mix, the residual bitumen content
in the mix will be 4.8 percent.
4 PREPARATION AND STORAGE OF MIXTURE
The readymade patching mix
shall
preferably be produced
in a conventional batch type
hot mix
plant. However,
if a portable or stationary asphalt drum
plant
is used, under no
circumstances drying/heating of aggregates with a burner flame and mixing with MC-800
shall be carried out simultaneously because MC-800 containing volatile kerosene will catch
fire and pose a safety hazard. The Contractor and the Engineer shall ensure there is no open
flame inside or outside the drum when MC-800 is added for mixing.
The mix should be such that
it can be stocked, handled, placed, and finished without stripping
of the bitumen from the aggregate. To help prevent stripping and avoid heat buildup
in a
stockpile (which may burn the entire stockpile due to chimney effect), the mixed material
should not be stockpiled not higher than 1.5 m for the first 48 hours. The stockpile then can
4



======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 20
======================================================================
IRC:116-2014
be raised
in height and made conical
in shape. Unless specified otherwise, the readymade
cold mix shall be placed and sealed in plastic lined, sturdy 50 kg bags on cooling.
The mineral aggregate should be clean and surface dry before mixing. The temperature of
aggregate and bituminous material should comply with those shown
in Table 4.
Table 4 Temperature Ranges for Producing Stockpile Patching Mix
Bituminous Material
Aggregate Temperature, °C
Bitumen Temperature, °C
MC-800
25-65
75-95
Since
the range
of aggregate temperature
is
rather low and
the maximum aggregate
temperature
is restricted to 65°C,
it may not be possible to dry the aggregate within
this
temperature range. Therefore, the aggregate can be processed in a dryer at high temperatures
and allowed to cool before the bituminous binder is added. Pre-drying the aggregate at high
temperatures will also help in reducing the fines (material passing 0.075 mm sieve), which
will go into the bag house. The resulting mix then would have fines less than 2 percent as
required in the stringent gradation specifications.
High aggregate temperatures while mixing with the cutback bitumen
will
not only cause
excessive loss of kerosene from the cutback but will also pose a safety hazard
in the plant
pug mill. Proper and adequate venting of the pug mil!
is necessary. Under no circumstances
there shall be any open flame in the vicinity of MC-800 cutback because
it contains volatile
kerosene.
Since the mix contains volatile kerosene
it is not safe to store the loose mix or sealed bags
in a closed building/warehouse. Store under an open shed or in a well ventilated warehouse.
No open flame or smoking shall be allowed in the vicinity of the stored mix.
5 PREPARATION OF POTHOLES, PLACING AND COMPACTING OF
READYMADE POTHOLE PATCHING MIX
5.1
Preparation of Potholes
Pothole shall be cleaned with a stiff wire brush and
all loose material including dust shall be
removed with a soft brush. Pothole need not be dry. However, excess water shall be swept
off the pothole.
5.2
Placing
Mix in Potholes
The mix is intended for patching potholes up to 75 mm (3 inches) deep. For deeper potholes,
patching mix shall be placed and compacted in 75 mm thick layers.
If the pothole
is deep and extends to WMM or granular base,
it
is recommended to apply
a suitable tack coat or
prime coat as feasible before placing the patching mix.
If angular
aggregate (nominal size 25 mm) is used to partially
fill deep potholes, the aggregate should
5



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 20
======================================================================
IRC:116-2014
be compacted thoroughly and primed with MC-30 before placing the patching mix. At least
50 mm thick pothole patching mix shall be placed at the top.
5.3
Compacting the Mix
First the outside edge or periphery of the patch shall be compacted with a hand rammer/
small compactor and then compaction shall proceed inwards. To prevent initial pick up of the
loose mix by the hand rammer either continue to wet the hand rammer with water or place
empty plastic lined bags on the loose mix.
For deep
potholes,
place the
patching
mix and compact
in 75 mm
thick
layers.
After
compaction, the compacted patch
shall be slightly proud of
the existing road surface to
allow for further compaction by traffic.
If there are numerous closely spaced patches,
it is preferred to use a small roller rather than
a hand rammer.
If a roller is used, the mix shall be placed and spread slightly proud of the
surface so that after rolling the compacted surface shall be flush with the adjoining surface.
5.4
Applying Sand to Prevent Pick up by Traffic
Before opening the compacted patch
to
traffic,
sufficient amount of clean sand
shall be
sprinkled on the patch to prevent pick up by traffic.
6 QUALITY CONTROL AND ACCEPTANCE OF MIXTURE
The composition of the produced mix (gradation and bitumen content) shall be tested by
an independent, approved testing laboratory before acceptance by the Engineer. Before
conducting the bitumen extraction test to determine residual bitumen content in the patching
mix, the sample shall be cured completely to remove all kerosene. Curing shall be done as
follows. Place the loose mix in an open metal container and heat slowly on a hot plate with
frequent stirring until a constant weight is achieved.
The following two tests shall be performed by the Contractor (in presence of a department
representative) on the mixture, freshly prepared or taken from a stockpile or sealed bag at
any time during
its storage life (usually 6 months).
i)
Water Resistance Test (See Appendix
I, Test C)
ii)
Workability Test (See Appendix
I, Test D)
The water resistance test would indicate whether the patching mix has a potential for stripping
in the pothole
in presence of water.
If the mix fails this test,
it means a proper type and/or
amount of an anti-stripping agent has not been used in the bituminous binder.
If the mix fails in workability
it could be due to improper bitumen type, low bitumen content,
excessive fines or improper gradation. Even one-half percent lower bitumen content can
make the patching mix unworkable and useless.
6



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 20
======================================================================
IRC:116-2014
Stocked patching material may be rejected, at any time during tlie six months period
if, in the
opinion of the Engineer, the patching material has stripped (more than 10 percent uncoated
particles) or otherwise become unfit or unworkable for use.



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 20
======================================================================
IRC:116-2014
Appendix-I
(Refer Clause 3.1)
A
Wet Coating Test (Clause 3.1)
Heat the unwashed job aggregate, cutback bitumen and distilled water to 40°C in a suitable
oven. Weigh 100 g of dry aggregate
into a suitable mixing container (such as seamless
tin can, 16 oz capacity). Add 3 ml of distilled water. Mix thoroughly with a spatula
until the
aggregate particles are uniformly wetted. Add cutback bitumen equivalent to 5.0 +/ 0.2 g of
bitumen residue. Mix rigorously with the spatula
until
all aggregate
is coated, but not more
than 5 minutes. Transfer the contents
into a 400 ml beaker containing 150 ml of distilled
water (22
- 32°C). Let stand for 15 minutes and visually determine the percent of retained
coating, which should be at least 98 percent.
B
Static-Immersion Test (Clause 3.1)
The coated aggregate as prepared in the preceding Wet Coating Test shall remain immersed
in the beaker of distilled water (22 - 32°C) for 24 hours. At the end of this period, visually
determine the percent of retained coating while the sample remains immersed in water, which
should be at least 95 percent.
C
Water Resistance Test (Clause 3.1 and 6)
Fifty grams of patching mix, whether freshly prepared or taken from the stockpile or a sealed
bag, shall be heated at 120°C
in a laboratory oven for
1
hour, cooled to 95°C
in laboratory
air, and then placed
in 400 ml of boiling water in a 600 ml glass beaker and stirred with a
glass rod at the rate of
1
revolution per second for 3 minutes. The water shall be decanted
and the mix shall be spread on an absorbent paper for visual observation of the coating. The
aggregate shall be at least 90 percent coated with a bituminous film.
D
Workability Test (Clause 6)
Approximately 2.5 kg of the patching mix shall be cooled to -7°C in a freezer. After cooling,
the mixture shall be capable of being broken up readily with a spatula that has a blade
length of approximately 200 mm. This test shall be performed when the mix
is produced
and thereafter anytime during storage.
If the mix is not workable at -7°C,
it shall be rejected
and the composition of the mix shall be properly modified
(for example, by increasing the
bitumen content and/or gradation changes). This test
is also applicable
in areas with hot
climate because
it amplifies the workability characteristics of the mix by using a lower test
temperature.
