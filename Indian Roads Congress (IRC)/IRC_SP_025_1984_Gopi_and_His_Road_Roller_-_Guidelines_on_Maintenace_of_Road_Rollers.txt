Foreword
The
art
of compaction as the
key
to
increased
strength and improved perfor-
mance were know to man since early ages.
This technique has since been refined
and perfected with the use of road rollers.
Today in the field of road
construction,,
road rollers hold the key not only to quality construction but also improved
mainte-
nance, helping in the creation of durable assets.
To meet the growing needs
of
traffic,
there
is
a
persistent demand
to
add
new
lengths
to
our
existing road network and strengthen or widen the important
arterial routes.
The task is colossal and the funds inadequate calling
for the
high-
way engineers to utilise their ingenuity in meeting the demands.
Road
rollers
play
a vital role in accomplishing this task and in order to get the maximum return
from
the
existing
fleet of road rollers through systematic and timely maintenance under
well trained operators and mechanics is a must.
In
keeping
with
this need, the Indian Roads Congress through
its Highway Con-
struction
and
Mechanization Committee has prepared
guidelines with
essential
tips on
operation, maintenance and repair of road rollers.
These
guidelines were
approved by the Executive Committee and the Council in their meetings held on the
7th December, 1983 and the 8th January, 1984 respectively.
It is hoped that this document would
serve
as an
useful
guide
to the Highway
Engineers engaged in road construction.

Guidelines on Maintenance of Road Rollers
1
What
is a Road Roller
Different types and
capacities
of
road
rollers
are
required
for
different
job-specifications
depending
upon the type of soil, moisture content, lift thickness
and output.
These include smooth wheeled
rollers,
which
are
more commonly
used, pneumatic tyred
rollers,
vibratory
rollers,
tractamount
rollers
and
sheeps
foot
rollers.
Though
a
particular type may
have a few special features/components
like
pneu-
matic
tyres,
vibrating mechanism etc., most of them
have several common features like
:
prime mover (Generally diesel engine)
power
transmission
system
(clutch,
gear box,
differential, etc.)
control system
frame/chassis
As such, the general maintenance aspects to be con-
sidered
for
one
type
of roller are not very different
from others.

Guidelines on
Hullo
!
You are interested in putting extra life into your road
roller.
Thats why
you
have
started
reading
this
manual.
Well, thats half the battle won.
Now don't
put this down unless you have some urgent reason to
do so.
This is no ordinary compendium of facts and
figures.
It has been
specially
written
for
you,
an
overworked
operator,
for you, a tired technician, for
you, a harassed supervisor and you, a busy manager.
Much money has been spent on the purchase of your
roller.
If
it keeps
running, the investment is worth-
while.
If it is idle due to
any
reason, your
project
suffers.
If
it is damaged and idle, the
project suffers
even
more.
Repairs
are
always
costly
and
time
consuming.
Remember, neglect causes more failures
than honest wear.
We can
help
you
run
your
roller
without trouble,
without
tears
and
that
too, with no
extra effort.
Interested? Well, read on.

Do as You like -
But Do This
Do carry out the maintenance instructions.
Do read the engine maker's instruction book.
Do make sure you are using the correct grades
of
fuel and lubricating oils.
Do use clean fuel and lubricating oil.
Do keep the correct level
of engine
oil
in the
air
cleaner.
Do keep battery topped up to correct level.
Do check all oil levels and grease points regularly.
Do check adjustment of brakes, clutches and
fan-
belt regularly.
Do lock up starter switch when
leaving
roller un-
attended.

Guidelines on
Do as You like -
But Don't Do This
DON'T leave water in radiator or tank
during cold
weather,
if in freezing zone.
DON'T attempt to change gear unless clutch hand-
lever is in centre position.
DON'T leave

Maintenance of Road Rollers
5
Action - Every Morning
You start work each morning and
before the
roller
goes
for
duty,
it would
be time well spent
if you
ensure that these points are acted upon:
*
Check fuel oil,
fill up
tank,
bleed
fuel systems
if
aerated.
*
Check cooling water and fill.
*
Check lub oils in all reservoirs and top up
if
defi-
cient.
*
Start engine as per laid down procedure.
*
Check readings of all gauges.
*
Look for obvious leaks.
*
Check for any unusual noise or vibration.



======================================================================
PAGE 20 of 54
======================================================================
Guidelines on
Action - Every Evening
By the time you
finish work for
the
day, the
roller
would have operated
for
eight to ten hours.
Before
you go off duty,
it
is
essential that these points are
acted upon
:
*
Fill up fuel tank before parking.
*
Report defects noticed during operation.
*
Check for leaks.
*
Carry out frost precautions— if necessary.
*
Check all bolts, nuts and linkages for tightness.
*
Clean machine and lubricate all points.
*
Cover ports and exhaust pipe to avoid
rain, dew
entry.
*
Record
entries regarding hours run and
fuel/oil
consumed in log books and machine history card.

Maintenance of Road Rollers

Preventive Maintenance
just means Periodic Effort
Thats no exaggeration, believe us. The emphasis is on
periodicity, which
is every
:
*
8 hours
*
60 hours
*
125 hours
*
250 hours
*
500 hours
*
1000 hours
*
2000 hours
These could vary somewhat depending on the make
of the machine, but that is no
big worry.
Let's
look
at each of the Periodic Tasks.
Note
:
The hourly schedule of maintenance prescribed above
needs implementation and
it must be ensured.
A check
sheet
has been
provided at the
end
of
this
book
for
recording the same and should be checked by inspecting
officers.

Guidelines on
Storage of Fuel
It is necessary that diesel
oil
is stored
in a storage tank and all the sediments are
allowed to settle for 24 hours
before
it
is pumped
out
into
the fue
I tank of the
machine.
In case of
rollers,
the storage tank may
be 45 gallons barrels and the
pumping done with the help of semi-rotary hand pump with
filter
fitted near the
outlet.
In no case the buckets and funnels should be used for refuelling in the field.

Guide to Good Rolling
Now let us talk to the most important man on the compaction
job — yes, you, the
roller operator.
Remember, this manual
is compiled to help you fulfill your respon-
sibility
towards
greater
durability and better quality.
So read this you must, and
benefit you will, in the very vital task that you are required to perform.
Roads must be smooth, safe for traffic, durable, economical and provide a comfor-
table ride.
Materials and mixes alone do not guarantee quality and precision. What
is the use of good stone, of the
best
asphalt,
of
the
most
accurate
laboratory
technique,
of
the
most advanced mixing equipment if at the end, incorrect rolling
is applied and compaction
is
poor.
Therefore,
compact
correctly
with
suitable
rollers and apply proper
rolling procedures.
This will guarantee level and durable
surfaces.
Remember, everything depends on your skill and care when putting your
machine to work.
Before starting on a new job, think about the following
:
Number of passes ?
Rolling speed
?
Rolling pattern
?
Let's discuss each of the questions, turn by turn.
The number of passes will obviously depend upon the
material
to be compacted.
Sand
and
gravel
in base and sub-bases will require four to six passes.
For bitu-
minous work, this will depend upon the layer thickness.



======================================================================
PAGE 44 of 54
======================================================================
30
Guidelines on
25 to 50 mm will require 5 to 8 passes
50 to 100 mm will require 6 to 9 passes
100 to 150 mm will require 6 to 10 passes
The speed of rolling affects the degree of compaction.
For
a
particular
level
of
compaction,
the
higher
the
speed,
the more the number of passes required.
So
remember, the rolling speed will depend upon type of mix, thickness
of
layer, den-
sity
requirement,
surface
finish
and
number
of passes.
Normally rolling speed
would be 5 to 7 km per hr.
On a thin hot
layer
you may
run
faster—sometimes
upto 10 km per hr.
Tender mixes, on the
contrary, may
require
very
low
rolling
speeds.
On
thick
layers
on
harsh
mixes
a speed of 3 to 5 km per hr is recom-
mended.
Now let's come to the rolling pattern.
You must decide on this aspect carefully so
that uniform compaction is obtained over the entire width.
If you are rolling gravel, start from the edges and proceed towards the centre, with
an overlap of atleast half the width of roller in the longitudinal direction.
If you are rolling macadam, roll from edges with roller runnig forward and backward,
until the edges are firmly compacted.
The roller is then moved gradually from edge
to the centre, parallel to the centre line.
The overlapping
is
done
uniformly
with
rear
wheel
track by
half width and this is continued until the entire area
is rolled.
There should be no creeping of aggregates visible on rolling.
What follows next is the rolling of bituminous mixes.
Start by compacting the joints, first transverse, then
longitudinal.
Start by
rolling
the
lowest edge,
which
generally would also be the outside edge, and roll rest of
the pavement running forward and backward in parallel paths with 10 cm to 20 cm
overlap.



======================================================================
PAGE 45 of 54
======================================================================
Maintenance on Road Rollers
31
Follow the paver as closely as
possible, keep
running
forward
and
backward
in
same
rolling
lane.
Change
to
another rolling lane only on an already compacted
area.
Turning movements on a hot mix will leave
impressions
and
even
lead
to
cracks.
If
you
have
to
change
speed, do so smoothly.
And should you need a
break, never park the roller on hot mix—now that's obvious, don't you think ?
Well, rolling of joints requires special care and some
expertise.
Remember,
rolling
is always done in the direction of joints.
Unless manoeuvring space
prevents
transverse
rolling,
roll
transverse
to
the
driveway, the
roller so positioned that only 100 mm of the roller is on the uncom-
pacted mix.
The major portion of the roller runs on the already
finished
and
cold
pavement, going step by step in increments of 10 cm to 20 cm on the new mix until
the full width of the drive roll is on the new pavement.
For rolling longitudinal joints you have two options.
The joint could be compacted with the roller working on the
cold
lane and
with
a
10 cm to 20 cm overlap on the hot lane, or
The joint could be compacted with the roller working on the hot lane with
a
10 cm
to 20 cm
overlap on the cold lane.
This is specially suitable when traffic
is heavy
and space is restricted.
For finish rolling, run one or two passes on the
surface
after
the
asphalt
mix
is
cooled somewhat.
Finish
rolling
is performed
only to smooth out the last rolling
marks.
And now for some general tips.
Should you be on a slope, keep
front
roll
ahead.
You must see that during rolling, no interruption occurs due to any reason.
When
you change direction, let the roller glide to a final stop and then start smoothly into
the other direction without loss of time.



======================================================================
PAGE 46 of 54
======================================================================
32
Guidelines on
Let's now sum up all that has been said, with ten basic rules
:
1.
Follow the paver as closely as possible.
2.
The joints should be compacted first.
3.
Start compaction of the lane at the lowest edge.
4.
While rolling on steep slopes, keep front roll ahead.
5.
Change the rolling speed smoothly.
6.
Run forwards and backwards in the same rolling lane.
7.
Change rolling lanes on the cold side, avoid lane changes
where the mix is hot.
8.
Run in parallel rolling lanes.
Reverse at another section
than in adjacent rolling lanes.
9.
Keep the drums sufficiently wet to avoid pick-up,
but not more than necessary.
10.
Do not let the roller stand still on hot mixes.
