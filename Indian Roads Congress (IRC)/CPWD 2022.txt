FOREWORD
Over the years, the CPWD Works Manual has served as a guide book for CPWD. The Government
of India in the last few years has introduced several new provisions/ instructions on public procurement.
Some of these important changes include introduction of Central Public Procurement Portal (CPPP),
Government e-Marketplace (GeM), preferential market access for micro and small enterprises, preference
for domestic manufacturers, Contracts on EPC mode etc. The Department of Expenditure has also issued
General Financial Rules (GFR) 2017, "Manual for Procurement of Works 2019", -Manual for Procurement
of Goods 2017" and "Manual for Procurement of Consultancy and Other Services 2017".
With new emerging construction technologies gaining prominence and with the rising expectations
of various stakeholders for timely delivery of the projects, there is a need for transformative changes
requiring revision of the Works Manual to make it more nimble, effective and delivery oriented, rather than
being process centric.
This CPWD Works Manual 2022 has been issued covering various guidelines and circulars issued
during the period 2019 to June-2022. It is also in consonance with the fundamental principles of service
delivery, customer focus, efficiency, transparency, fairness, competition, economy and accountability.
Efforts have been made to cover all major aspects of construction and maintenance in a user-friendly
manner while having the necessary flexibility to quickly respond to the varying scale and complexities of
requirements of the clients.
I hope this updated version of CPWD Works Manual 2022 will benefit all the CPWD Officers and
other Stakeholders.
I would like to acknowledge the lead taken by Shri Vinayak Rai, Chief Engineer CSQ (Civil) and
dedicated efforts of Shri Vijay Prakash Sahu, SE(C&M), Shri Samsher Ali, Director (Finance), Shri R.K.
Singh EE (Manual), Shri A K. Sharma AE (Manual) CSQ and all other officers of CSQ under dynamic
leadership of Shri Dharmesh Chandra Goel, ADG (Tech.) and other units who have individually provided
their valuable inputs in revision of this Manual

All revenues received by Government, loans raised by it, and its receipts from recoveries of loans
granted by it form the Consolidated Fund. All expenditure of Government is met from the
Consolidated Fund, as authorised by the appropriate legislature. All appropriations granted by the
Parliament expire at the end of financial year and no deduction of unspent budget can be appropriated
for meeting the demands in the next financial year. Thus, all unutilized funds within the year ‘lapse’
at the end of the financial year.

respect of (b), the payments should be treated as refunds of revenue and adjusted as deduction
from the respective heads provided the original recoveries were treated as receipts and
adjusted under the receipt heads of accounts. Wherever the recoveries were adjusted as
deductions from expenditure, the refunds of such recoveries under the orders of the Court
etc. should be treated as ‘Charged expenditure’.
(3) Refunds of Security Deposits should be debited to ‘Public Accounts’ if the same is kept in
that account. On the other hand, if the deposit has been forfeited, the refund should be
treated as ‘Charged Expenditure’.
(4) In cases where an appeal is filed against the decree in the lower Court and the decreed
amount is deposited in the Court as security for staying the execution of decree, the same
should be kept initially as a ‘Deposit’ in the Public Accounts. Later on, if the amount is refunded
as a result of the Court’s order, then the expenditure will be charged in accordance with (1)
and (2) above.

CPWD WORKS MANUAL 2022 CHAPTER 2 : BUDGET AND RECONCILIATION OF ACCOUNTS
168 Years of CPWD's dedicated service to the Nation
2.20 Savings, Excesses and Supplementary Demands
2.20.1 Surrender of Savings
During the course of the financial year, it may be found that the expenditure under some of the
sub-heads is likely to be less than the provisions in the budget owing to one or more of the following
reasons:
(i) Actual postponement of expenditure.
(ii) Normal savings due to economy.
(iii) Normal savings due to original over estimating or administrative causes
(a) All anticipated savings noticed in a grant or allotment has to be surrendered sufficiently
in advance before the close of the financial year. The surrenders should be made
immediately as soon as the savings are foreseen without waiting till the end of the year,
unless these are required to meet increased demand under some other Head(s), which
can definitely be foreseen at that time.
(b) No savings are to be held in reserve for meeting possible excesses in future.
(c) Budget Division, Ministry of Finance has issued instructions on the need for the individual
Ministry/Department to put in place effective mechanism for realistically assessing
their requirement of funds in a way that would ward off the occurrence of unwarranted
surrender of savings at a later date. In this regard, Rule 62 of GFR 2017 may be
referred.
2.20.2 Supplementary Demands
Expenditure for which no provision has been made in the original Budget Estimates for the current
year cannot normally be incurred. If either owing to (i) an unforeseen emergency, or (ii) underestimating
or insufficient allowance for factors leading to the increase in expenditure, excess
expenditure on a particular item of the budget estimate is inevitable, action may be taken for
submission of an application for allotment of additional funds by re-appropriation or supplementary
grant, where it is not possible to get funds by re-appropriation.
If the amount authorized through appropriations for a particular service is found to be insufficient
for the purposes of that year or when a need has arisen during the current financial year for
supplementary or additional expenditure upon some new service not contemplated in the annual
financial statement for that year, a supplementary demands for grants proposal shall be made
before Parliament. However, if any money has been spent on any service during a financial year
in excess of the amount granted for that service and for that year, demand for such excess, as the
case may be is to be laid before both the Houses of Parliament for authorizing (subject to the
report of the Public Accounts Committee) the expenditure incurred in excess.
2.20.3 Supplementary Grant
As per Rule 66 of GFR, if savings are not available within the Grant to which the payment is
required to be debited, or if the expenditure is on “New Service” or “New Instrument of Service” not
provided in the budget, necessary Supplementary Grant or Appropriation in accordance with Article
115 (1) of the Constitution should be obtained before payment is authorized. Instructions issued
from the Budget Section of CPWD/ MoHUA from time to time are to be followed in this regard.

CHAPTER 2 : BUDGET AND RECONCILIATION OF ACCOUNTS CPWD WORKS MANUAL 2022
168 Years of CPWD's dedicated service to the Nation
2.20.4 Annexure to the Supplementary Demands
As recommended by the Public Accounts Committee, any order for re-appropriation, issued during
a financial year, which has the effect of increasing the budget provision under a sub-head or
standard object head by more than the limit specified in Budget Division’s OM or as mentioned in
the Delegation of Financial Power Rules, is required to be reported to Parliament along with the
final batch of the Supplementary Demands for Grants.
2.21 Appropriation Account
(1) Appropriation Account relating to the expenditure brought into account during a financial year is
required to be submitted to the Parliament. The Appropriation Account, thus, compares the total
grants (original, supplementary, etc.) made by the Parliament for any particular purpose with the
actual expenditure incurred by Government on that purpose. While making such comparison,
explanations should be given in the Appropriation Account for the variations between the final
grant and the actual expenditure under each sub-head, whether excesses or savings.
(2) The sub-heads in respect of which reason for variations both for savings and excesses are
required to be included are as follows:
(a) If the variation in a sub-head exceeds the prescribed limit - All variations, both savings
and excesses, irrespective of the percentage which the variation bears to the sanctioned
provision (original, or supplementary, or both taken together).
(b) If the variation in a sub-head does not exceed the prescribed limit.
(i) Where the variation is in excess
All cases in which the excess exceeds 10% of the total sanctioned provision or
as prescribed, whichever is higher - The total sanctioned provision in this clause
means the original provision (if there is no supplementary provision), supplementary
provision (if there is no original provision), and original and supplementary provision
taken together if they exist.
(ii) Where the variation is a saving
All cases in which the saving exceeds 10% of the original provision, or as
prescribed, whichever is higher, if in that sub-head there is no supplementary
provision in a sub-head either with or without any original provision - All cases, in
which the saving exceeds 10% of the supplementary provision will be included.
(c) If the grant/appropriation as a whole has been exceeded (i.e. where excess has occurred
in any of the four segments, viz. voted revenue, voted capital, charged revenue and
charged capital) - Only such sub-heads as involve an excess of over the prescribed
amount may be picked up. If, however, there is no individual subhead involving an excess
of over such prescribed amount, sub-heads which mainly account for the overall excess
may be included. However, the criteria laid down in (a) and (b) (ii) will also be followed.
2.22 Re-appropriation
(1) A transfer of fund from one primary unit of appropriation to another such unit may become
necessary. Such a transfer is termed “re-appropriation”, and can be sanctioned only by the
competent authority prescribed under DFPR and Orders of Ministry of Finance from time to
time..

CPWD WORKS MANUAL 2022 CHAPTER 2 : BUDGET AND RECONCILIATION OF ACCOUNTS
168 Years of CPWD's dedicated service to the Nation
(2) Transfer of funds within one primary unit of appropriation under the same grant and involving
two or more Zones does not amount to re-appropriation, and does not, therefore, attract the
provisions of Rule 10 of the Delegation of Financial Powers Rules, because Appropriation
Accounts are prepared on the basis of the total grant under a particular primary unit of
appropriation in all the CPWD Zones.
(3) Rule 65 of GFR 2017 regarding provisions relating to the Re-appropriation of Funds, relevant
rules under DFPR are given in SOP 2/4.
2.22.1 Restrictions on Appropriations/Re-appropriations
All Re-appropriation shall be done as per GFR 2017/ DFPR provisions and according to orders
issued by MoF from time to time.
2.23 Allotment of Funds
(1) After the budget grants are approved by the Parliament, the Ministry allocates the sanctioned
funds to the DG, CPWD. Director Finance, CPWD who functions as IFD of CPWD distributes
the allocated funds with the approval of competent authority among the concerned Heads of
Departments/Other Budget Controlling authorities in the field or to any subordinate offices,
as approved by the competent authority based on priority, urgency and specific need according
to their demands and availability of funds. The distribution of budget by the Head of Department/
subordinate offices shall be informed to the Director (Finance) of CPWD and Pay & Accounts
Officers for check against allocations.
(2) While preparing detailed statement showing the distribution of the funds, the following points
should receive the attention of the budget authorities:
(i) The statement should show the distribution of the final allotments by the budget controlling
officers in consultation with respective finance officers of the Zones/ Divisions which
are primary units of appropriation to cover a number of individual items or works. It
should also contain an abstract of the charges by the prescribed subheads.
(ii) Specific allotment should be made for each individual major work.
(iii) Provision for Voted and Charged items should be shown separately.
(iv) The amounts and details of the allotment/ ceilings intimated by the Ministry should be
strictly adhered to and on no account altered/ breached.
(3) The distribution statement, when issued, should be regarded as the authorised program of
expenditure. Any change required therein during the course of the year should be dealt with
under the Rules of Re-appropriation.
2.24 Review of Budget Allocations
(1) All budget controlling and monitoring officers should review every month the progress of
expenditure vis-a-vis physical progress against the funds placed at their disposal from time
to time. Physical as well as financial progress is important to be regularly monitored. Additional
demand or anticipated savings, if any, should be intimated to the Director (Finance) of CPWD
immediately. These statements should include all items and prepared separately for voted
and charged expenditure.

CHAPTER 2 : BUDGET AND RECONCILIATION OF ACCOUNTS CPWD WORKS MANUAL 2022
168 Years of CPWD's dedicated service to the Nation
(2) To ensure effective control of the expenditure against the appropriations made vis-a-vis
physical progress in the prescribed Proforma issued, a quarterly review of the expenditure
is conducted until the end of September and thereafter every month till the month of February
hence excess/savings must be reported to Director (Finance) of CPWD from time to time.
(3) Where the progress of expenditure is not even and upto the required standards, timely action
should be taken by the CE/SE/Budget controlling authorities/ Director (Finance) of CPWD to
accelerate the expenditure by the expenditure incurring units. According to the guidelines
issued by the MoF, last Quarter expenditures should not exceed 33% of BE and 15% in the
month of March of the financial year. Rush of expenditure in any month should be avoided
following guidelines of the MoF. FOs/SEs shall also watch the pace of expenditure vis-a-vis
physical progress of the works in their respective zones/circles. Director (Finance) of CPWD
should take corrective actions in view of imbalanced pace of expenditure and availability of
funds in form of budget reduction/ adjustment among zones/budget controlling units. The
units will not try to incur expenditure due to surplus funds at their disposal, merely to avoid
the lapses without following prescribed procedure and formalities.
2.25 Reconciliation of Accounts
(1) The Budget controlling authorities and concerned DDO/ Divisional Officer/AAO of divisions
are jointly responsible for the reconciliation of the figures given in the accounts maintained
by the Head of the Department with those appearing in the Pay and Accounts Office’s (here
in after called PAO) Accounts Officer’s books. Concerned ADG/SDG’s will oversee the
overall functioning of Accounting and Financial matters with help of senior most Account &
Finance officer available at their office and ensure that all divisions are performing their
function under stipulated time and the reconciliation should be made monthly, the initial
responsibility resting with the Accounts Officer. The detailed procedure for reconciliation of
expenditure incurred by Drawing and Disbursing Officers (DDO’s), including cheque drawing
DDO’s (Divisional Officers), and appearing in the books of the Pay and Accounts Officers
has been prescribed under CPWD Accounts Code and GFR 2017.
(2) The Chief Engineers/ Director General as Heads of Department would maintain consolidated
Zone-wise and grant wise records, i.e. Major Head, Minor Head, Sub- Head-wise expenditure
in Form no. GFR 12.
2.26 Regularization of Excess
2.26.1 Avoiding excess
(1) Excess over voted grants and appropriations and surrenders reflect on the effectiveness of
control over expenditure.
(2) In cases where the schemes are not fully worked out at the budget stage, and a realistic
estimate of the likely expenditure during the year is not found possible, provision for preliminary
expenses and immediate requirements need only be included in the budget as far as possible,
subject to review later on during the financial year on the basis of progress made in the
planning of and sanction of the schemes.
(3) Apart from the realistic estimation of the budget, adequate steps should be taken for effective
control over the progress of expenditure against the sanctioned grants, including expenditure
on account of book adjustments and payments for procurement of stores, supplies and
services.

CPWD WORKS MANUAL 2022 CHAPTER 2 : BUDGET AND RECONCILIATION OF ACCOUNTS
168 Years of CPWD's dedicated service to the Nation
2.26.2 Sanctions to Regularize Excesses
(1) A statement in Form no. 8 should be prepared annually for submission to the Ministry by the
end of December every year to show the causes of excesses and savings under different
sub-heads, alongwith reasons why steps were not taken in time to surrender the savings, or
to obtain necessary funds to cover the excesses before the end of the financial year however
excesses are not permissible in normal circumstances. Separate statements should be
prepared for each grant.
(2) If the grant has been exceeded, sanction should be obtained to the excess from the Ministry
of Finance in case of non-voted expenditure, or from the Parliament in the case of voted
expenditure.
(3) As voted and charged portions, and as also the revenue and capital sections of a grant/
appropriation are distinct, and re-appropriation inter-se is not permissible, an excess in any
one portion or section is treated as an excess in the grant/appropriation.
(4) Excess in the demands as a whole requires regularization by the Public Accounts Committee,
which generally takes a serious view of such excess, and insists upon satisfactory
explanations from the Department concerned.
(5) Similarly, savings and surrenders should also be avoided. The Public Accounts Committee
takes serious view of the same as in the case of excess. Large savings are indicative of
loose budgeting in the sense that these prove the inability of the Department to spend usefully
the funds to the extent anticipated.
2.27 Departmentalization of Accounts- AGs/ CAGs Inspection and Internal Audit by O/o CCA,
MoHUA
2.27.1 General
(1) Under the scheme of Departmentalization of Accounts, the Chief Accounting Authority

Accounting Authority i.e. Secretary MoHUA.
(2) The CGA prepares annual accounts including summary civil Appropriation Accounts, showing
under the respective heads, the annual receipts and disbursements for the purpose of Union
Government.
(3) The Divisional officers and higher officers should furnish the explanations as promptly as
possible, and ensure that these are concise, accurate and fully informative. The explanations
should indicate with sufficient clarity whether a variation or financial irregularity could not
have been foreseen.
(4) While submitting the Appropriation Accounts, the Divisional officers should take into
consideration the facts that the Public Accounts Committee, while scrutinizing the Accounts,

(4) In respect of works of inescapable nature, method will be followed as prescribed in Para 1.5
of Chapter 1. The quotation approving authority may decide the publicity period, except in
case of spot quotations, subject to minimum period of two working days.
4.2 Award of works to Registered Labour Co-operative Societies
(1) Works costing upto the limit fixed from time to time can be awarded to registered labour
Co-operative Societies at current market rates without call of tenders as per financial
powers delegated. EMD is exempted for works with estimated cost upto Rs 3 lakhs.
However, Security Deposit shall be deducted as prescribed by way of deduction from
their bills.
(2) Monthly running payments may be made if value of work executed is more than Rs. 50,000/-.
Such works awarded to Registered Labour Co-operative Societies shall not be counted
towards the annual ceiling for issue of work orders.
4.3 Award of work to Contractors belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
4.3.1 For works upto an estimated cost of Rs. 2.50 lakh, a price preference upto 5% (with reference to
the lowest valid price bid) may be allowed in favour of individual SC/ST contractor. In such cases
tender may be entertained even from non-registered contractors. No earnest money is required in
such cases.
4.3.2 For works beyond an estimated cost of Rs. 2.50 lakh and upto Rs. 5.75 lakh, tenders may be
obtained only from registered contractors. The price preference upto 5 % (with reference to the
lowest valid price bid) may be allowed in favour of individual SC/ST contractor. However, earnest
money at a reduced rate of ½% may be accepted in such cases.

Price Preference to Contractor belonging to SC/ST for Award of Contract” are as under:
G-28011/113/2022-IAB
1080429/2023/IAB
2070/3045

CPWD WORKS MANUAL 2022 CHAPTER 4 : MODES OF BIDDING SYSTEM
168 Years of CPWD's dedicated service to the Nation
Guidelines regarding “Operation of Price Preference to Contractor belonging to SC/ST for
Award of Contract”.
Example 1
Assuming Estimated Cost put to tender (ECPT) = Rs. 100/- ‘A’
Assuming % age quoted by the lowest valid = 10% above the ECPT
tenderer of General Category
Therefore, quoted amount by the lowest valid = Rs. 110/- ‘B’
tenderer
Price Preference allowed to individual SC/ST = Rs. 5.50
contractor is 5% i.e. 5% of ‘B’ = Rs. 5.50
Total = Rs. 110 +
Rs. 5.50
Rs. 115.50
Hence, if an individual contractor belonging to SC/ST category quotes his rates between 10%
above to 15.50% above and General Category lowest valid tenderer has quoted his rates at 10%
above the ECPT, then the work shall be awarded to the contractor belonging to SC/ST category at
his quoted rates. This is however, subject to provisions of CWPD Works Manual 2022 Para 5.1.6
i.e. Justification of Rates.
Example 2
Assuming Estimated Cost put to tender (ECPT) = Rs. 100/- ‘A’
Assuming % age quoted by the lowest valid = 10% below the ECPT
tenderer of General Category
Therefore, quoted amount by the lowest valid = Rs. 90/- ‘B’
tenderer
Price Preference allowed to individual SC/ST = Rs. 4.50
contractor is 5% i.e. 5% of ‘B’ = Rs. 4.50
Total = Rs. 90 +
Rs. 4.50
Rs. 94.50
Hence, if an individual contractor belonging to SC/ST category quotes his rates between 5.50%
below to 10% below and General Category lowest valid tenderer has quoted his rates at 10%
below the ECPT, then the work shall be awarded to the contractor belonging to SC/ST category at
his quoted rates. This is however subject to provisions of Para 5.1.6, i.e. Justification of Rates.
4.4 E-Tendering
(1) As per Rule 159 and 160 of GFR 2017, it is mandatory to e- publish all Tender enquiries,
Requests for Proposals, Requests for Expressions of Interest, notice for pre-qualification/
registration or any other notice inviting bids or proposals in any form, corrigenda thereon and
