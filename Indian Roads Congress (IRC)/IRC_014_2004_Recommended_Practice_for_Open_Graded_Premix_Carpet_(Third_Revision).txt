Storm or when the air temperature at the surface is below 10°C
or wind speed exceeds 40 km/h.
3.3.2.
Preparation of surface: The underlying surface
on which the bituminous surface is to be laid must be free from
dust, caked mud or any loose and extraneous matter and shall
be prepared and shaped
to
the
specified
profile. Where
the
existing surface
is potholed or rutted, these irregularities must
be
corrected
with premixed
chippings
or
coated macadam,
depending upon the depth of the depressions or pothole,
laid
after applying a tack coat of binder and well rammed, thereafter.
The surface should be swept clean by removing caked earth
and
other
foreign
matter with
wire
brushes
sweeping
with
brooms (mechanical broom) and
finally dusting with
air jet,
washing or other means approved by the Engineer-in-Charge.
On granular surface prime coat shall be applied as per IRC: 15.
3.3.3.
Application
of tack
coat:
Before
spreading of
premixed material, a tack coat should be applied on the prepared/
primed surface using a self propelled or towed pressure sprayer
at the specified rate. Hand spraying for small areas inaccessible
to the distributor can be done with the approval of the Engineer-
in-Charge. The range of spraying temperature for bituminous
emulsion shall be 20«C to 70°C. The tack coat shall be left to
cure until
all the volatiles have evaporated.
3.3.4.
Preparation
of premix: The bitumen
shall
be
heated in boilers of suitable design approved by the Engineer-
in-Charge,
to
the
temperature
appropriate
to
the
grade
of
bitumen. Aggregates shall be heated to the required temperature.
A mixer of appropriate
capacity and
type approved by
the
Eingineer-in-Charge, preferably, a hot-mix plant shall be used
for mixing
aggregates
and
binder.
It
shall
be
ensured
that
bitumen does not come
in direct contact with flame. Mixing

shall be thorough
to ensure
that
a homogeneous mixture
is
obtained in which the aggregates are coated uniformly.
It shall
be
ensured
that
the
difference
in
temperature
between
the
binder and aggregate at no time exceeds 15^C. The mix shall be
transported from hot mix plant or mixer to the point of use in
a suitable vehicle or wheelbarrows. The vehicle employed for
transport of mix shall be clean and the mix being transported
shall be covered in transit,
if so
felt essential and directed by
the Engineer-in-Charge. The temperatures for binder, aggregates,
and mixed
material
at

camber
and/making
due
allowance
for
any
extra
quantity
required to fill depressions, if any. Camber shall be checked by
means of a camber board and
irregularities
shall be levelled
out. Excessive use of blades or rakes should be avoided. The
temperature of mix
at laying
site
shall be within
the range
given in Table
7.
3.3.6.
Rolling:
As
soon
as
sufficient
length
(say
20-25 m) of the premix has been laid, rolling should commence
with 8-10 tonne smooth wheeled tandem type rollers or other
approved
roller.
Rolling should commence
at the edges and
progress towards the center longitudinally except in the case of
super-elevated
sections, where
this should commence
at the
inner edge and proceed towards the outer edge of the curve.
When the roller has passed once over the whole area, any high
spot or depression which become apparent should be corrected
by removing or adding the same premixed material. Rolling
shall then be continued until the entire surface has been rolled
and the roller marks eliminated. In each pass of the roller, the
preceding
track
shall be covered uniformly by
at
least
1/3
width. Excessive rolling
shall be avoided. Moisten the roller
wheels with minimum possible amount of water to prevent the
premix from adhering to the wheels and being picked up. In no
case
shall
fuel/lubricating
oils will be used for this purpose.
Excess use of water
for
this purpose
shall be avoided. The
rolling operation should be completed before temperature of
mix reaches the values given in Table 7.
3.3.7.
Application of seal coat: The seal coat shall be
applied immediately after laying the premix carpet and rolled.
Liquid seal coat shall be preferred.
3.3.7.1. Type A seal coat (liquid seal coat): The binder
shall be heated to the temperature appropriate to the grade of
10

bitumen given in Table 7 and sprayed on the dry surface in a
uniform manner preferably with
a
self-propelled mechanical
sprayer.
Immediately
after
the
application
of binder,
stone
chips, which shall be clean and dry, shall be spread uniformly
at the specified rate, on the surface preferably by means of a
self-propelled
or towed mechanical
grit
spreader
or by any
other suitable means as directed by the Engineer-in-Charge so
as
to cover the surface completely.
If necessary, the surface
shall be brushed to ensure uniform spread of chips. Immediately
after the application of the cover material, the
entire surface
shall be rolled with a 8-10 tonne smooth wheeled steel roller or
8-10 tonne static weight vibratory roller, as provided in Clause
3.3.6. While
rolling
is
in progress,
additional chips
shall be
spread by hand
in necessary
quantities required
to make-up
irregularities. Rolling shall continue until all aggregate particles
are firmly embedded in the binder and present a uniform closed
surface.
3.3.7.2. Type B seal coat (premixed seal coat): A mixer
of appropriate capacity and type approved by the Engineer-in-
Charge
shall be used
for preparation of the mixed material.
Preparation of the premix
shall be done
in accordance with
Clause
3.3.4. The binder
shall be heated
to the temperature
appropriate for the grade of bitumen. The aggregates shall be
dry and
suitably heated
to
a temperature shown
in Table 7
before these constituents are placed in mixer. Mixing of binder
with aggregates of the specified proportions shall be continued
until the latter are thoroughly coated with the former. The mix
shall be immediately transported from the mixer to the point of
use and
spread uniformly on
the bituminous
surface
to be
sealed.
As soon as a sufficient length has been covered with the
11



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 28
======================================================================
IRC: 14-2004
premixed
material,
the
surface
shall
be
rolled
with
an
8-10 tonne smooth-wheeled roller. Rolling shall be continued
until the premixed material completely seals the voids
in the
bituminous course and smooth uniform surface
is obtained.
3.3.8.
Surface finish and quality control: The finished
surface should be uniform and conform to the lines, grades and
typical cross-sections as specified. When tested with a 3 meter
straight edge,
the longitudinal profile of the finished surface
shall have no undulation greater than 8 mm for machine laid
premix
carpet and
10 mm
in case of manually
laid premix
carpet.
In any 300 m
length,
the number of maximum
size
undulations shall not exceed the value specified in IRC:SP:16
for various category of roads. The cross profile, when checked
with a camber template, shall not show a variation of more than
6 mm for machine
laid premix and 8 mm
for manually laid
premix carpet from the specified profile. The quality control
shall
be
carried
out
in
accordance
with
the
methods
and
procedures
described
in
IRC:SP:11
"Handbook
of Quality
Control for Construction of Roads and Runways".
3.4.
Opening to Traffic
No traffic shall be allowed on the road until the seal coat
has been laid. After the seal coat has been laid the road may be
opened to traffic in accordance with the following provisions.
In the case of Type B
seal coat,
traffic may be allowed
soon after final rolling when the premixed material has cooled
down to the surrounding temperature. In the case of Type A
seal
coat,
traffic
shall not be permitted to run on any newly
sealed area until the following day. In special circumstances,
however, the Engineer may open the road to traffic early, with
speed restriction of 16 km/h.

Weather and seasonal limitation: As per Clause
3.3.1.
4.3.2.
Preparation of surface: As per Clause 3.3.2.
4.3.3. Preparation of binder: Before opening, the cationic
bitumen emulsion drums shall be rolled at slow speed, to and
fro,
at
least
5
times,
for
a
distance of about
10
metres,
to
distribute any storage sedimentation.
4.3.4.
Preparation
of premix:
Premixing
of cationic
bitumen
emulsion
and
aggregates
can
be
carried
out
in
a
suitable mixer, such
as, cold mixing plant or concrete mixer.
Where
specified
in
the Contract
for
large works continuous
mixing operation
shall be done either in batch or continuous
cold mix plant suitable for preparation of emulsion mixes.
When
using
concrete mixer
for preparing
the premix,
0.135 cum
(0.09 cum of
13.2 mm
size and
0.045 cum
of
1 1 .2 mm size) of aggregate per batch shall be used to cover 5
sqm area of road surface with 20 mm average thickness. First
the coarse aggregate of 13.2 mm shall be placed into the mixer
followed by 4.5
to
5.5 kg of cationic bitumen emulsion and
then the
11.2 mm size aggregate
shall be added followed by
remaining quantity of emulsion. After the materials have been
mixed thoroughly, the mix shall be immediately transported to
14



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 28
======================================================================
IRC: 14-2004
the laying site in suitable vehicles. Too much mixing (exceeding
2 minutes) shall be avoided.
Where mixing
is done manually by shovels, 0.06 cum of
aggregates
can
be
conveniently
mixed
in
one
heap,
with
appropriate
quantity of emulsion,
with
the
approval
of the
Engineer-in-Charge.
It
is
preferable
to make
the
aggregates
damp before mixing as
it reduce the effort required for mixing
and also help to get better coating of aggregates. The 13.2 mm
size aggregates and half of the emulsion are mixed first followed
by 11.2 mm size aggregate and remaining quantity of emulsion.
4.3.5.
Spreading and rolling of premix: The premixed
material shall be spread within 10 minutes of applying the tack
coat.
The mix
should
be
spread
uniformly
to
the
desired
thickness, grades and cross fall (camber) making due allowance
for any extra quantity required to
fill-up depressions,
if any.
The cross
fall should be checked by means of camber boards
and
irregularities
levelled
out.
Too much
raking
is
to
be
avoided. The
rolling
shall
start immediately
after laying the
premix. A smooth wheeled tandem roller of 8-10 tonnes shall
be used unless the Engineer-in-Charge, based on the results of
laying
trials,
approves
other compaction equipment.
Rolling
operation
shall be carried out
in accordance with the Clause
3.3.6.
4.3.6.
Application of seal coat: Seal coat of Type A or
Type B shall be applied 4 to 6 hours after laying cold mixed
premix carpet. In case of seal coat Type A (liquid seal coat),
immediately after spraying emulsion, clean and washed stone
chips
shall be spread uniformly
at the specified
rate, on the
surface
preferably
by means
of
a
self-propelled
or towed
mechanical
grit spreader or by any
other
suitable means
as
directed by the Engineer-in-Charge so as to cover the surface

IRC: 14-2004
completely. If necessary, the surface shall be brushed to ensure
uniform spread of chips. Rolling with 8-10 tonnes roller should
start soon after spreading chips. The rolling operation shall be
as indicated in Clause 3.3.7.1
as far as practicable. In case of
seal coat Type B (premixed seal coat), grit of specified size and
quantity
shall be made wet with water before mixing with
required quantity of SS grade emulsion as specified in Clause
4.2.2. The mixing, spreading and rolling shall be carried out as
indicated in Clause 3.3.7.2 as far as practicable.
4.3.7.
Surface Hnish and quality control: The surface
finish of construction
shall conform
to
the requirements
of
Clause 3.3.8.
4.4.
Opening to Traffic
Traffic may be allowed over the premix carpet after 6 to
8 hours of laying the seal coat. However, in the case of single
lane roads,
traffic may be allowed after 4 hours or when the
mix is properly set and the speed is restricted to not more than
16 km/hour. If vehicle tyres pick-up any premix material, the
spot shall be filled-up by new mix. If traffic conditions permit,
the road shall not be opened until 24 hours after laying.
