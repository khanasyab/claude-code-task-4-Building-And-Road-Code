These Guidelines were approved by the Executive Committee on 27th October, 201 0 and by
the Council
in the 192nd meeting held at Nagpur on 11th November, 2010, subject to the
condition that the comments made thereon should be taken
into consideration by the
Convenor of Bridges Specifications & Standards Committee and authorised to make any
changes necessary in light of the comments made by the members of the Council.

SCOPE
These guidelines apply to the design, fabrication,
erection, and stripping of Formwork,
Falsework and Temporary Structures
built mostly from structural materials and used for
supporting different types of permanent concrete bridge structures during construction
till
they become self supporting or built to provide access for doing concrete work, the shoring
and scaffolding etc.
Compliance of these guidelines can not confer immunity from legal obligations in the event
of failures and casualties.

OBJECTIVES
The objective
is to design and construct safe and economical formwork and scaffolding
system that will support all loads imposed and provide the necessary rigidity to achieve the
lines, grades and shapes shown
in the working drawings. The basic parameters to be
considered as under:
2.1
Quality
2.1 .1
The forms and other structures are designed and built accurately so that the desired
shape, size, alignment and finish of the cast-concrete is achieved in terms of dimension and
strength.
The forms must be built to correct dimensions, must be sufficiently rigid under the construction
loads to maintain the designed shape of the concrete within permissible deflections and
tolerance limits, must be sturdy and strong enough to maintain large members in alignment,
and must be constructed so they can withstand handling and reuse, without losing their
dimensional integrity. The formwork must remain in place until the concrete is strong enough
to carry its own weight.
2.1 .2
The correct material should be chosen. The quality of surface finish of the concrete
is affected by the material of the form. A correct combination of form material and oil or other
parting compound can contribute in eliminating air holes or other surface imperfections in
the cast concrete.
2.2
Safety
Safety should be included in the planning and management of the project and procedures
that will assure safety for workmen and structure should be adopted. The following be ensured
that:
2.2.1
Forms, Falseworks and Temporary Structures are correctly designed
after
collection o' required data and making sufficient investigations, by rational analysis with
adequate safety margins and strong enough for the expected load.
These are supervised during erection and concreting by competent Supervisors who should
see that these are constructed exactly as designed, following a safe erection procedure so
that no members are temporarily overloaded.
2.2.2
No other loads are ever imposed on them
if these have been designed with no
allowance for unusual construction loads or eccentric loads due to placing sequence or any
such load.
-
2.2.3
Adequate work area or work platforms with proper method of access have been
provided.
2.2.4
Safety signs and barricades have been erected to keep unauthorized personnel
clear of areas in which erection or stripping is underway.

======================================================================
IRC:87-2011
2.3
Efficiency
The formwork, falsework and temporary works should be so planned and designed that these
can be handled
, erected and dismantled easily and used repeatedly to optimal limits.
2.4
Economy
Economy is one of the main concerns, since formwork cost may be more than 20-30 percent
of the cost of concrete structure. No attempt, however, should be made to achieve economy
at the cost of quality or safety.
2.4.1
The formwork falsework and temporary structures should be meticulously planned
and designed to cater for all the parameters of quality, safety and efficiency and the provisions
of codes and specifications such that these are time and cost effective.
2.4.2
Shortcut in design or construction of formwork may endanger quality and safety
and should not be attempted.
2.4.3
The design and erection of formwork/falsework should, whereever possible, form
an item
of contract so that the cost of this item
is correctly assessed, executed and
supervised.
2.4.4
Coordinated efforts between Engineer/Designer and Contractor can also result
in savings in the cost.
2.5
General Relationship and Responsibility
2.5.1
The responsibility of the designer, contractor, and the clients should be decided
without ambiguity and the interests and views of all the three should be considered while
deciding various parameters for design, specifications and erection with optimum utilization
of the skills
, knowledge and resources available at the site.
2.5.2
The system of designing, checking and approval of designs, erection systems
and construction methodology should be clearly defined and agreed by all the involved parties.
2.5.3
The various parameters for design,
its limitations and permissible tolerances
should be finalized after mutual consultation between the involved partied and described in a
Design brief to be prepared and agreed before taking up the work.

New Materials
In case any new material is intended to be used that is not specifically covered in the Indian
or International codes, but the use of which has been permitted elsewhere,
it would be
necessary to produce certification from the concerned authorities regarding the successful
performance of such materials for 5 repeated uses. Such a certificate shall be supported
with details of critical performance parameters and test results.
4.4
Formwork Accessories
For the design of form ties, form anchors and form hangers permissible stress shall conform
to the relevant standards as well as design data based on test evidence published by the
manufacturers.
4.4.1
Form ties
: A form tie is a tensile unit adopted for holding concrete forms against
the active pressure of freshly placed plastic concrete. Form ties, are also manufactured part
of proprietary system.
4.4.2
Form anchors
: Form anchors are devices used
in the securing of formwork to
previously placed concrete of adequate strength. The devices normally are embedded in the
concrete during placement. Actual load carrying capacity of the anchors depends on the
strength of concrete in which they are embedded, the area of contact between the concrete
and anchor and the depth of embedment. Manufacturers also publish design data and test
information to assist in the selection of proper form anchor devices.
4.4.3
Form hangers
: Form hangers are often used
to suspend formwork from a
supporting structure.

4.5
Form Coatings or Release Agents and Sealants for Formwork
4.5.1
Form coatings
: Form coatings or sealants are usually applied to contact surface
either during manufacture or in the field to serve one or more of the following purposes:
a)
To seal the contact surface and joints from intrusion of moisture or loss of
moisture and cement slurry
b)
To alter the texture of the contact surface
_
..
c)
To improve the durability of the contact surface
d)
To facilitate release of form from concrete during stripping
4.5.2
Release agents
: Form release agents are applied to form contact surfaces to
prevent bond and thus facilitate stripping. They may be applied permanently to form materials
during manufacture or in the field or may be applied to the form before each use. The release
agents shall be checked for compatibility with form surfaces,
plastic concrete including
admixtures and requirements for the application of further materials to the hardened concrete.
They shall be kept off construction joints surfaces and reinforcing steel by applying before
the reinforcement is laid. Care shall be taken to ensure that excessive application of release
agent does not cause staining of concrete surface or retard curing. Where exposed aggregate
work or other type of concrete surface finish
is desired, release agents may be designed
suitably.
4.5.3
Form insulation
: These are usually used for protection of concrete in cold weather.
These shall be used as per manufacturer's recommendations.
4.5.4
Sealants
: In order to get smooth concrete surface finish and prevent escape of
cement slurry, use of laminated tar paper or similar sealant can be permitted.
4.5.5
Manufacturer's recommendations
: Manufacturer's recommendations shall be
followed in the use of coatings, sealants and release agents, but independent investigation
of their performance is recommended before use.
5
INVESTIGATIONS
The following investigations should be done before starting the design and all other data as
made available should be verified with the site conditions.
5.1
All Topographical, Geographical and Climatic conditions should be investigated
as relevant to design.
5.2
Sufficient Hydraulic and Hydrological investigations should be done to cover the
river flow conditions, velocity of flow and discharge and water levels during different periods,
any abnormal or sudden discharge which may be released from any Irrigation works in the
upstream of construction site, any back flow conditions, tides or wave action, scour pattern
during different seasons and flood conditions, any debris or trees flowing in the river.
This needs to be monitored regularly and whereever there are irrigation works upstream
there should be continuous communication and alert system with them.

5.3
Adequate Geotechnical/sub soil investigations should be done at the locations of
ground support to ascertain the allowable bearing capacity and to decide the type of
foundation or support system after due consideration of the scours at those locations and
the permissible settlements. Depth of sub-soil water should also be determined.
5.4
Adequate investigations should be done to locate any underground or overhead
utility services which may foul with the foundation of the falsework/Temporary structures or
the erection/launching or casting systems.
5.5
Detailed investigations should be done to find out the limitations at site because
of space and movement restraints, headroom or clearances required, traffic regulation or
diversion proposals, lighting and warning signs, regulations for noise control, vibrations or
impact effects or environmental issues-pollution of air, soil or water etc.
5.6
Detailed investigations need to be done whenever there are any changes in any
of the conditions which will affect the design or the systems of erection etc. being used. The
designs/systems could be reviewed and
revised,
if necessary, adopting the changed
data/informations.
5.7
Falsework foundations in general are at a shallow depth. The subsoil investigations
should be done keeping this factor in mind.
5.8
Necessary investigation should be done to assess the severity of the seismic
effects to assess its implications on the design.

codes.
6.2.4
Careful attention shall be paid to the detailing of the support/connections and their

6.3
Loads
6.3.1
These structures shall be designed to cater for the vertical, horizontal and other
loads as specified in the subsequent clauses.
6.3.2
Vertical loads
: Vertical loads shall comprise of Dead load, superimposed load,
applicable live load and other loads as detailed below.
6.3.2.1
Dead loads
6.3.2. 1. 1
Dead load, generally static in nature, occur during the service life of these structures
such as, Self-weight of the formwork and falsework, any ancillary temporary work connected
to and supported by the falsework structure and permanent structure supported by the
falsework.
6.3.2. 1.2
Self-weight shall be determined according to Clause 205 of IRC:6 except for the
following items for which the unit weights given in the following clause shall apply.
6.3.2. 1.3 The following unit weights shall be adopted in the absence of actual measurements:

e)
Scaffold tube (40 NB)
.
45 N/m
6.3.2. 1.4
For falsework composed of scaffold tube fittings, the additional weight of fittings,
in absence of actual data may be accounted for by increasing the self-weight of the vertical
and horizontal members by
1 5 percent. Similarly, in the case of falsework built with fabricated
frames, the additional weight of fittings may be estimated at 5 percent of the total weight of
the frames and bracings.
6.3.2.2
Impact
: In absence of data, to cater for impact in precast construction the dead
load should be increased by minimum of 1 0 percent due to weight of precast concrete member.
For cast-in-place concrete construction, impact forces are covered under superimposed
loads.
6.3.2.3
Up
lift forces
: Reduction
in self-weight due to submerged portions of structure
should be considered in the calculations wherever applicable.

12



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:87-2011
c)
The static load of the moving item should be increased by 25 percent for
mechanically operated equipment, and by 10 percent when using
manually operated equipment.
d)
Stacking of materials
- This normally occurs from storage of materials
such as shutter plates, Reinforcement and concrete making materials on
the falsework prior to concreting. Stacking materials on falsework should
be avoided.
If
it is unavoidable, then the maximum permissible load should
be accounted for in the design and clearly indicated in the drawings.
e)
Prestressing loads - The forces and deformation thereof, of the structure
associated with prestressing are often transferred
to the supporting
falsework. Allowance shall be made in the falsework design to accommodate
either the force or the movement involved.
6.3.2.4.2
Depending upon seasonal, geographic and construction factors, snow can
accumulate and form into drifts on the permanent and temporary works causing additional
loading, this loading shall generally be within 0.75 kN/m^ and only in exceptional case will
this loading be exceeded.
6.3.2.4.3
Impact due to deposition
of Concrete
- This can be due to the deposition of
concrete of forms and secondary girders supporting the forms a design DDL of 3.6 KN/m^
shall be considered.
6.3.3
Lateral loads
: The lateral loads shall comprise of:
a)
Lateral pressure of fresh concrete
b)
Environmental loads - wind, water
c)

Density of concrete
b)
Rate of placing
c)
Vibrating
d)
Temperature of concrete
e)
Concrete Slump
f)
Method of discharge and compaction
g)
Width, depth & shape of section
h)
Vertical form height
i)
Constituent material of concrete like admixtures, aggregate, cementitious
material
6.3.3. 1.2 The design pressures may be calculated on the basis of standard literature such
as CIRIA report (enclosed in Annexure).
13



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:87-2011
6.3.3. 1.3 The design pressure for Self Compacting concrete will be different than for the
other concretes. Special literature should be referred to for calculating the pressure from
such concrete on the formworks.
6.3.3. 1.4
In general a minimum value of 20 kN/m^/m height shall be adopted in the design.
This value is valid for the rate of rise of concrete of
1 .0 m/h at 25-C and slump 40 mm without
admixtures.
6.3.3.2
Environmental loads
6.3.3.2. 1
Wind- In view of temporary nature of falsework
it may be designed for wind loads
as per IS 875 (Part-3)-1 987 but with a return period of 5 years.
6.3.3.2.2
Water- Where
it is necessary for falsework supports to be placed in flowing water,
the effect of the forces caused by the flow shall be considered. These will include-
a)
Water current forces with due consideration for scour, turbulent flow during
the construction period
b)
Flood
level occurring during the period
of erection and dismantling
of
temporary work 2 times the calculated scour will be considered.
c)
Increased frontal area, and head of water due to trapped debris-
Where there are successive rows of falsework members exposed to flowing
water
it
is possible that some shielding protection
is provided to the
downstream members by the upstream. The following factors will contribute
to the total force being applied to the falsework in the water
:
i)
The area of obstruction to the water flow presented by the first line of
falsework members;
ii)
Any further decrease in the width available for the passage of the
water as
it passes through the falsework.
iii)
The increase
in obstruction to the flow that would result from the
trapping of debris on the faces of the falsework.
6.3.3.2.3
Trapped debris effect
The accumulation of debris will produce a force on the falsework that may be calculated as
for that on a rectangular cofferdam. This force is given by the expression
:
F=
666 /\V
2
d
d
w
where,
A^=
Area of obstruction presented by the trapped debris and falsework
(in m^)
=
velocity of water flow (m/s)
F^=
force in N
This effect will be dependent up on the rate of flow, the amount and nature of the floating
debris, the nature of the obstruction and the depth of water.

IRC:87-2011
6.3.3.2.4
Wave action
- When falsework
is erected
in or adjacent to water,
it may be
subjected to wave forces.
In marine locations this
is a probability, but elsewhere
it
is a
possibility that should considered. For further information specialist
literature may be
referred to.
6.3.3.2.5
Earth pressure - Earth pressure shall be calculated as per IRC:6.
6.3.3.2.6
Earthquake forces
Earthquake forces shall be considered for structures in Zones IV and V Load combinations
and permissible stresses shall be as per IRC:6. Response reduction factor R shall be as per
IRC:6/Table 7 of IS
1 893 (Part
1 )-2002 and Importance factor (I) shall be taken as
1 .0.
6.3.3.2. 7 Any other load not covered in above. Other horizontal forces may result in from the
following cases and shall be catered for wherever appropriate.
a)
Movements of the permanent structures imposed on the falsework due to
effects like prestressing operations.
b)
External ties and anchorages.
c)
Plant and equipment
- Horizontal forces may result due to acceleration of
plant moving on falsework. The design should allow for a horizontal force in
any of the possible directions of movement equivalent to
1 0 percent of the
static load of the moving item.
d)
Horizontal forces may develop
if the pumped concrete pipe is supported by
falsework though surcharge
will usually be smaller. The pipes shall be
adequately anchored, specially at bends and the effect of blowing out the
line pipe shall also be considered.
The additional force due to the concrete pipeline, Fx (in N), applied to the falsework shall be
calculated from the expression:
F=
0.25 pA^
where,
p is the maximum pressure in the pipeline (in N/mm^).
is the cross sectional area of the pipeline (in mm^)
The maximum pressure in the pipeline, P, is dependent up on a number of
factors but the following pressures are not likely to be exceeded.
5 N/mm^, for mechanical pumps
0.7 N/mm^, for pneumatic placers
6.3.3.2.8
Design values of total lateral load
: Certain horizontal forces are
identifiable
and can be calculated but there may be others which may not either be foreseen or
estimated. As such, an amount equal
to
1
percent of the
total design vertical load
of
falsework in any direction shall be added to the calculated lateral loads to arrive at the design
load.
The design value of the total lateral load however shall not be less than 3.0 percent of the
total design vertical load. The point of application of the loading may be assumed at the
soffit of the formwork.

Timber
- The permissible stresses
in timber shall conform to IS 883 or
IS 3629.
b)
Steel
- The permissible stresses shall be those as recommended in IRC:24
as appropriate to the steel being used and the use to which
it is put.
c)
Tubular sections
- Permissible stresses in tubular sections shall be those

IRC:21.
f)
Other materials
- Where material chosen
is other than those mentioned
above, the permissible stresses may be those as recommended by the
manufacturer after tests based on relevant material codes. The permissible
stresses chosen may also be related to the ultimate strength or to other
physical characteristics, and
it will be necessary to choose which criteria is
critical in light of the form, extent and consequence of any possible failure.
6.3.5.1
Depending upon the condition of the material proposed to be used, suitable
reduction factors in the above permissible stresses shall be applied.
6.3.6
Over-turning
Factor of safety against over-turning for load combinations other than wind or seismic shall
be 1.33 min. For load combinations with wind or seismic or any other exceptional load,
same shall be 1.1 min.
6.3.7
Deflection limits

permanent works. In general, the calculated deflection of unsupported areas of form faces
shall not exceed 3 mm.

IRC:87-2011
6.4
Analysis
6.4.1
Load transfer systems: The system which transfers the loads to the falsework
shall be examined to ensure that all possible changes in the conditions of load transfer are
provided for. Relative deflections between the permanent structure and the falsework including
settlement of the foundations may cause high local concentrations of load.
Adjustable or non-adjustable distance pieces, including jacks and similar devices are often
used to transfer loads. Capacity of such members shall be checked for a minimum of 3 percent
of the vertical load acting horizontally at the load point.
6.4.2
Special loading conditions: The design or sequence
of construction
of the
permanent structure may give rise to special, or unusual loading conditions on the falsework.
Where this is so,
it shall be indicated clearly by the designer/user of such permanent works,
so that
it may be taken into account in the design of the falsework.
6.4.3
Reversal of loading: Reversal of moments and stresses may occur during erection
and dismantling of the falsework and shall be accounted for in the design.
6o5
Lateral and Diagonal Bracings
6.5.1
Diagonal bracings in both the longitudinal and lateral directions shall connect the
shores or props of the upper and lower bays of the scaffolding tubes at splice or joint as the
case may be.
i)
The bottom horizontal bracing shall be within 600 mm of the bottom.
ii)
Top horizontal bracing shall be within 600 mm from top.
iii)
The intermediate horizontal bracings shall be designed to suit the design
requirements.
iv)
The diagonal bracings shall be
at slope between 30- and 60- to the
horizontal.
6.5.2
The falsework system shall be designed to transfer all lateral loads to the ground
or to completed construction of adequate strength and stiffness in such a manner as to ensure
safety at all times. Diagonal bracing must be provided in vertical and horizontal planes for
falsework tubes not designed as self standing to provide stiffness and to prevent buckling of
individual members. A laterally braced system shall be anchored to ensure stability. Diagonal
bracing must be capable of resisting the overturning moment.
6.6
Shores
6.6.1
All shores shall have a firm bearing. Inclined shores shall be braced securely against
slipping or sliding. The bearing ends of shores shall be cut square and have a tight fit end
splices. Splices shall be secure against bending and buckling. Connections of shore heads
to other framing shall be adequate to prevent the shores from falling out when reverse bending
causes upward deflection of the forms.
18



======================================================================
PAGE 27 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:87-2011
6.6.2
Timber shores, where used, shall meet the following requirements
:
a)
The number of splicing
in any shore shall be kept to the minimum. The
matching ends of shores to be spliced shall be cut square, for proper seating.
Locations of splices should be staggered. The splicing members shall
ensure concentric force transfer.
b)
All splice fastening shall be adequate.
c)
Metal splice pieces of adequate size may be used in place of timber.
d)
Lap splice shall be prohibited.
6.7
Proprietary Items
When
proprietary forms, shoring
or components are used,
the manufacturers'
recommendations for safe working loads shall be supported by data sheets and test reports
for components by an approved testing organization. Necessary details required to be
furnished by the manufacturer are given in Appendix-1
.
6.8
Foundation of Falsework
6.8.1
Where the falsework rests directly on ground, or on permanent structure,
it shall
be ensured that load is transferred and distributed so as to ensure that total or differential
settlements are within acceptable limits. The details of the actual site conditions and the
safe bearing pressures for use in the design shall from part of design briefs. Safe bearing
capacity of soil shall be arrived based on available data/sound engineering practices.
6.8.2
Falsework supported on permanent structure - Where
it is intended to support the
falsework on permanent construction,
it is essential to determine limitations,
if any, which the
design
of permanent works imposes on the incidence and distribution of load from the
falsework.
It is essential to determine the strength of the permanent works to receive loading
based on the rate of gain of strength and maturity of concrete in the structure. Necessary
checks shall be made to ensure the safety of the permanent structure.
6.8.3
Falsework supported on the ground - The loads from the falsework shall be applied
to the ground through, distribution members which may be of timber, steel base plate or
precast sleepers to ensure proper contact with the ground. Shores of the falsework system
shall be centrally placed on the member. These distribution members shall be properly
designed for all possible load combinations.
6.8.4
Foundation supports comprising piles or other deep ground insertions shall be
designed and installed to specific designs and drawings. Where there is a likelihood of the
foundation becoming flooded, foundations shall be designed to safely withstand the direct
and indirect consequences of such flooding including scour, undermining or weakening of
ground strata.
6.8.5
The slope of the ground can cause stability problems and
it is recommended that
the slope of the surface on which the falsework rests should not exceed
1
in 6 unless approved
by a suitably qualified engineer specializing in geotechnics. The stability of the ground above
and below the falsework site should also be considered.
19



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 52
======================================================================
iRC:87=2011
6.8.6
Falsework foundations in general are set at a very shallow depth, compared with
those of permanent structures, which brings them within the zone affected by seasonal moisture
content changes, frost action, scour, etc. These effects should be duly considered in making
investigations as well as in the design.
6.9
Special Requirements for Prestressed Concrete
6.9.1
The structural designer shall indicate special requirements,
if any, for prestressed
construction. Where required,
it may be necessary to provide appropriate means of lowering
or removing the formwork before full prestress is applied to prevent damage due to upward
deflection of resilient formwork.
6.9.2
The restraint to shrinkage of concrete shall be kept to a minimum and the hogging
of members due to prestressing force and the elastic deformation of formwork or falsework
shall be considered in the design and removal of the formwork.
6.10
Common Deficiencies in Design
Some avoidable common design deficiencies leading or contributing to failure, are
a)
Lack of sufficient allowance in design for special loads as mentioned above.
b)
Inadequate/improper shoring.
c)
Improper positioning of shores at different levels where high/tall falsework
is involved. This may create reversal of stresses.
d)
Inadequate provisions (especially where beam hangers are used) to prevent
rotation or twisting of beam forms, particularly when slabs frame into them
on only one side or slabs of unequal spans frame into beams.
e)
Inadequate provision against uplift.
f)
Insufficient allowance
for unsymmetrical
or eccentric loading due to
placement sequence.
g)
Inadequate design of form ties or clamps.
h)
Inadequate protection against scour and
effect of Buoyancy where
applicable
1)
Poor foundation conditions of sites not accounted for in design.
j)
Lack of proper adjustment of shims and wedges during concreting.
k)
Neglecting horizontal and
inclined pressures
of concrete on
inclined
formwork
I)
Neglecting concrete buoyancy
m)
Not accounting the continuity of the members
n)
Omitting dead weight of void forms and Buoyancy effect.
o)
incorrectly assessing the effective length of support towers or struts, or
neglecting the possibility of torsion failure.
p)
Deformation/extensions of tension components such as ropes
, strands,
etc. to enable adequate load transfer.

SITE OPERATIONS, PROCEDURAL CONTROLS AND
PRECAUTIONS AND INSPECTIONS
8.1
Proper coordination and communication between the design, construction and
supervision agencies is needed to be ensured in respect of all aspects of formwork, falsework
or temporary structures at site. The preparation and erection of these activities requires the
same skill and attention to details as that of the permanent structure. These shall always be
regarded as a structure in their own right, the stability of which at all stages of construction is
paramount for safety of the permanent structure as well as for the personnel working at site.
8.2
Work on site should be subject to the careful direction, supervision and checks to
ensure that the Temporary structures are erected safely in accordance with the agreed design
with materials of agreed quality, and the structure is first loaded only when all checks have
proved satisfactory and then dismantled
in accordance with an agreed sequence and
procedure.
8.3
Multiplicity of actions normally
is required when Temporary Works are being
erected and put into service. Such activities may be widely separated in time and place and
it is therefore essential that lines of communication and responsibility are explicit and clearly
defined and known to all those involved
in the activity. A methodical approach should be
adopted and adequate records should be maintained.
8.4
Before starting any activity a comprehensive method statement should invariably
be prepared and got approved. The entire team should be briefed about this statement.
8.5
Constant emphasis should be laid upon attention to details.
8.6
For proper planning, implementation, monitoring, coordination and supervision of
this activity on major bridge projects a separate person should be identified/appointed as
Temporary Work Coordinator. Wherever necessary, he should be supplemented by
appointment of Temporary work Supervisors.

been accorded?
ii)
Whether the reinforcement and falsework have been checked?
iii)
Whether the forms are clean and free from wood-shavings, grit etc.?
iv)
Whether release agent to form surface has been applied? This should be
avoided for concrete surfaces to be plastered. On such surfaces whitewash
is desirable.
If release agent is applied
it should be checked that this is not
applied or splashed carelessly on the reinforcement or pre stressing tendon
and anchorages.
v)

======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:87-2011
xii)
The props and bracing shall be watched during the placement of concrete
and the vibrations. Any members which may tend to get loose or wedges
which get shifted should be attended to.
xiii)
System of communication between the man in charge of formwork and the
man
in charge
of concreting operations should be established so that
concreting can be stopped instantly
if at all
it becomes necessary to do so.
xiv)
Platforms for the movement of workers and mechanized concrete buggies
(used in large works) shall be separated.
It should not place load upon the
reinforcing steel.
If this is unavoidable, steel chairs shall be placed under
the reinforcement at adequate spacing
to prevent deformation
of the
reinforcement.
xv)
Arrangements for field adjustments and constant inspections of forms,
shores and foundations during placing of concrete both by supervising as
well as construction agency to be ensured (to stop leaks, tightening wedges
and clamps, to adjust shores and for timely action against disturbances,
etc).
xvi)
Adequatestandby equipment should be available.
Removal/Dismantling of Formwork
i)
The timing of formwork removal
is a very important subject. For efficient
use of formwork,
it is important to have options that allow them to be removed
as soon as possible without jeopardizing the structure's safety or damaging
the edge of concrete surfaces. But not before the concrete has reached a
strength at least twice the strength to which the concrete may be subjected
at the time of removal of formwork or as decided from design considerations.
The strength referred to shall be that of concrete using the same cement
and aggregates with the same proportions and cured under conditions of
temperature and moisture similar to those existing on the work where
possible. Proper precautions shall be taken to allow for the decrease in the
rate of hardening of concrete occurring during cold weather.
ii)
The dismantling plan prepared at the time of design or before the start of
construction should be strictly followed.
iii)
The procedure for Formwork removal for concrete wall, sides of beams
and columns
will also be controlled by the
possibility of damaging the
concrete while removing the forms and not simply by the concrete's capacity
to withstands its own weight.
27



======================================================================
PAGE 36 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:87-2011
iv)
All the factors, like temperature, age and admixtures used, that can affect
concrete strength shall be considered for calculation of stripping time.
For the formwork removal the stripping time can be determined by the use
of any reasonable method.
The number of props to be left under, their sizes and disposition shall be
such as to be able to safely carry the full dead load of the slab, beam or
arch, as the case may be, together with any live load likely to occur during
curing or further construction.
v)
Falsework shall be gradually and uniformly lowered in such a manner so as
to avoid any shock or vibration or injurious stresses
in any part of the
structure.
vi)
Immediately after removal of the formwork, the concrete shall be carefully
inspected. Defects
if any, shall be made good as soon as practicable.
vii)
Where the side shutter also support the flange of the T-Beam, such shutter
shall be removed only after the flange concrete attains sufficient maturity.
viii)
For pre-stressed units, the vertical side forms shall be released as early as
possible and the
soffit forms shall permit without restraint deformation/
,
shortening of the member when pre-stress is applied.
Form supports and soffit forms for cast-in-situ members shall not be removed
until sufficient pre-stress has been applied to carry the dead load, any
formwork supported by the member and anticipated construction loads.
ix)
Records of checks carried out should be maintained.
Checking shall be done timely. Such checking shall be based on a system
concept with check lists suitably standardized.

9 CAUSES OF FORMWORK FAILURES AND
POST FAILURE INVESTIGATIONS
Some of the causes for failures have been observed as follows
9.1
Inadequate Bracing Leading to Instability
a)
The more frequent causes of formwork failure are the effects that induce
lateral force components or displacement
of supporting members.
Inadequate cross bracing/diagonal bracing and horizontal bracing of shores
is one of the factors most frequently involved in formwork accidents.
b)
High shoring with heavy load at the top is vulnerable to eccentric or lateral
loading. Diagonal bracing improves the stability of such a structure.
c)
When a failure occurs at one
part, inadequate bracing may permit the
collapse to extend to a large portion of the structure and multiply the damage.
Adequate bracing will prevent a minor accident or failure from becoming a
disaster.
33



======================================================================
PAGE 42 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:87"2011
9.2
Vibrations
Forms sometimes collapse when their supporting shores, wedges or jacks are displaced by
vibration caused by:
•
Passing traffic
•
Movement of workers and equipment on the formwork
•
The effect of vibrating concrete to consolidate
it
•
Diagonal bracing can help prevent failure due to vibration
9.3
Vertical IVIembers Not in Piumb
Vertical members must be set plumb to avoid eccentric loading which may lead to failure.
9.4
Unstable Soil Under Mudsills, Undermining or Scouring Under Supports
Formwork should be safe
if
it
is adequately braced and constructed so that all loads are
carried to solid ground through vertical members. The ground must be able to carry the load
without permissible settlements.
Shores and mudsills must not rest on uncompacted ground; moisture and heat from the
concreting operations, or changing air temperatures, may thaw the soil and allow settlement
that overloads or shifts the formwork.
Site drainage must be adequate to prevent a washout of soil supporting the mudsills.
9.5
Inadequate Control of Concrete Placement
The temperature and
rate of increase
in height of concrete are factors influencing the
development of lateral pressures that act on the forms.
If temperature drops during construction operations, rate of concreting often has to be slowed
down to prevent a build up of lateral pressure overloading the forms.
If this
is not done,
formwork failure may result.
Failure to regulate properly the rate and order of placing concrete on horizontal surfaces
may produce unbalanced loadings and consequent failures of formwork.
9.6
Lack of Attention to Formwork Details
9.7
Improper Stripping and Shore Removal
Premature stripping
of forms, premature removal
of shores, and careless practices
in
re-shoring can cause failures.
34

PAGE 43 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:87-2011
9.8
There are some other Causes which can Cause Failure
:
i)
External causes like earthquake tremor, untimely floods and hailstorm etc.
ii)
Defective centering structures and joints
iii)
Unsuitable foundation support like earthen embankment
iv)
Subsoil flow in sandy bed
v)
Wrong sequence of construction or unbalanced horizontal forces as
in
arches
9.9
Post-Failure Investigations
The purpose of the false work failure investigation is to determine the reasons for failure and
to collect data and carryout analysis to provide suggestions on preventing
its recurrence.
The following steps may be followed
:
1)
The failure site should be inspected immediately by the Temporary Works
Coordinator or his authorized representative to ascertain by visual methods
the probable cause of failure, such as, hydraulic, geotechnical, improper
materials, design deficiency, erection or construction faults or supervision
negligence etc.
ii)
The area should be cordoned
off and
all safety precautions be taken
immediately so that no further damage is done.
iii)
An investigating team should be constituted to look into the matter which
should preferably consist of a representative from design, supervision staff
for the work and from the overall project management staff.
iv)
The team should collect all the relevant data, consult records and drawings
etc., take photographs, collect samples, test and investigate as may be
necessary for the purpose and prepare the report giving detailed findings,
lessons learnt, further precautions to be taken and preventive or remedial
measures to be adopted.

SPECIAL FORMWORKS
10.1
Slipforms
10.1.1
General
Slipforms can be used for vertical structures, such as beams, piers and wells etc. These
forms are usually moved by jacks riding on steel rods or pipes embedded in or attached to
35



======================================================================
PAGE 44 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:87-2011
the hardened concrete. The movement of forms may be continuous process until the structure
is completed or in a phased sequence of finite placements.
Slipforms shall be designed, constructed and the sliding operations carried out under the
supervision of persons experienced in slipform work.
Jacking rods or pipes may be left in place or withdrawn as conditions permit.
The design of the yokes must provide for adequate clearance to install horizontal reinforcing
bars and embedments.
Forms shall be of about one meter height and may be of timber, plywood or steel. Special
care must be taken in building the forms and arranging the jacks so that the forms will draw
straight without twist.
Forms shall be constructed with a slight batter so that they will be self-clearing as they slide.
A range of 6 mm to 8 mm in a height of
1 m of form is indicative of current practice.
10.1.2
Sliding operations
The
sliding speed
is determined by the
rate of setting and hardening
of the freshly
placed concrete, the rate at which the concrete can be supplied, placed and compacted,
and the
rate
at which reinforcement steel can be supplied and
fixed. When using
ordinary Portland cement, the average sliding speed
is in the range of 150 mm
- 300 mm
per hour.
Alignment and plumbness of the structure shall be checked at the beginning and at least
once in eight hours of operation.
10.2
Travelling Forms
10.2.1
Travelling forms consist
of formwork mounted on moveable frames
or
scaffolding called travellers. After the purpose of the formwork is served at one section of the
structure, the forms are released and moved along the structure to the next section to be
concreted.
10.2.2
Travelling forms are suitable for many types of bridges particularly where a
number of repetitions are involved. These forms can be used both for members of constant
cross-section and variable cross-section.
1 0.2.3
Each set of forms and travellers shall be designed for the particular job. Forms
are attached to the traveller mounted on wheels, skids, etc. Jacks are generally used for de-
shuttering and for adjustment to profile at the next section.

IRC:87-2011
10.2.4
Travelling cantilever formwork for cantilever bridges
is a particular example of
use of travelling forms for bridge deck construction. Such formworks, because of their
importance and large loads involved, are designed with the same care as that for a permanent
structure.
1 0.2.5
Cantilever formwork eliminates falsework all together. The deck is constructed as
a series of segments progressively cantilevering out of the pier. The forms are suspended
from a structural frame anchored
to the already concreted segment of the deck and
cantilevering out to sustain the forms for the next segment.
1 0.2.6
The cantilever forms shall be so arranged as to facilitate continuous concreting of
the entire segment in one operation. Necessary provision shall be made to enable adjustments
in profile to cater to the camber requirements of the bridge deck.
10.3
Caissons
General:
A hollow structure generally fabricated of structural steel having the dimension of the permanent
foundation like well that forms part of permanent foundation. Though
it generally forms part of
the permanent structure
it is not accounted for in the strength evaluations of the foundation.
Caissons are generally circular but may be rectangular in some cases.
It generally is a floating steel structure, fabricated on the shore/bank/floating barge, and then
lowered in water either by sliding or lifting.
It is towed to the location and sunk with ballast
added at its final location.
Height of Caisson:
While designing the caissons a detailed study for the various stages of construction shall be
carried out. The height of caissons at any given time shall be such that the C.G of the
completed stage shall always be below the top level by at least equal to diameter or smaller
plan dimension of the structure. The first stage construction is very critical as the triangular
shaped curb reduces the stability and hence this stage shall be planned for required height
till the time the C.G. is lowered by concreting of the structure. The fabricated structure shall
be checked against leakage at joint locations before floating. The structure shall be held in
position against untoward movement by wire ropes/chains, etc. using winches mounted on
stationary suitable platforms/ buoys or like anchoring systems. Anchoring in minimum three
directions shall be provided to prevent unacceptable longitudinal and lateral movement. The
system shall permit a small movement until the stage when the foundation
is just getting
grounded. Special care is necessary where variation in water level is frequent, e.g tidal zones.

======================================================================
iRC:87-2011
Height of cassion shall be planned to ensure that at any given time, at least one meter of the
shell shall be above water level of river. In case location has waves, the height shall be suitably
increased to avoid water spilling in to caisson
. In sandy/clayey soil, generally 3 to 5 meters
of additional height shall be built as
it may sink after grounding in bed even before the ballast
is provided. Simultaneous sinking and concreting is required to prevent cassion from tilting.
In sandy stratum especially with strong water current the bed is likely to scour locally when
the caisson nears the bed and even after grounding has taken place. Appropriate additional
height of caissons is necessary for this condition.
Design:
The shell shall be designed for water pressure from differential head, water current forces,
wet concrete etc.
it is likely to be subjected to. The minimum thickness of plate used shall be
4 mm for external face and 3. 1 5 mm for internal face. Thickness of plate shall be increased
for corrosion allowance
if exposure conditions are severe, at alternate wetting and drying
zone, subject to
1 mm minimum. The plates shall be stiffened using suitable structural elements.
Bracings both in transverse and vertical shall be provided
. A minimum element of 50 x 50 x 6
angle or equivalent
is recommended. Anchorage points and any other locations where
concentrated loads are expected shall be locally strengthened suitably. All joints shall be
continuously welded and shall be leak tight. The joints of shell shall preferably be located at
the face of stiffeners so that proper welding is achieved. In critical locations where no stiffener
support is available, use of 100 mm wide, 3.15 mm thick cover plate
is recommended at
such joint locations.
Precautions:
1)
Stability
of caissons during
sliding
into water,
in floating condition, during
transportation and during lowering in position shall be checked.
2)
The anchorage of the caissons shall be designed for the maximum water current
and wave effects expected with factor of safety of 3 minimum.
3)
A dewatering pump of adequate capacity shall be provided at caisson location
for emergency or routine leakage.
4)
The anchorage ropes shall have adequate slackness to allow vertical movement
of shell in tidal zones till grounding operations.
5)
Very large size caissons may be provided with compartments so that in the event
of any damage of shell, the quantity of gushing water is controlled.
Note:
This Chapter
is to be elaborated to include different types of special formworks and
falseworks or temporary structures such as cofferdams,
floating barges, access
bridges, high
rise platforms, launching girders,
trolleys, casting yards etc, including
the specific or additional design requirements,
if any.

SAFETY, HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT REGULATIONS
AND LEGISLATION
11.1
A comprehensive Safety, Health and Environment Management Guide/Manual
should be prepared at all construction sites and be a part of the Contract Documents.
This should define the
principal requirements
of the Safety,
Health and Environment
Management associated with the Employer
, Contractor/Sub-Contractor and any other agency
to be practiced at construction worksites at all time to ensure that adequate precautions are
taken to avoid accidents, occupational illness and harmful effects on environment during
construction.
1 1 .2
The document should cover all the requirements and compliance of the Local and
National Acts and Regulations on these aspects and ensure conformity to the guidelines
given in 0HSAS1 8001 -Occupational Health and Safety Management System and ISO 1 4001 -
Environmental Management Systems.
1 1 .3
Major part of safety concerns at any construction site is related to the preparation,
erection, dismantling, launching,
lifting, floating equipments etc. for formwork, false work
and also the temporary structures. The Safety, Health and Environment Guide/Manual should
adequately address all the issues related to them.
11.4
All and adequate measures should be taken for safe and sound construction. To
ensure safety sufficient precautions should be taken, all investigations be done thoroughly,
design and erection and dismantling should be as per design brief, all systems and procedures
should be tested and calibrated, and all regulations should be strictly followed.
11.5
A system of conducting Safety, Health and Environment inspections and other
risk management analysis on a periodical basis will be evolved and administered. All required
Safety Inspection Check
lists for all activities, operations and equipments conforming to
Indian Standards, Rules and Regulations and Employer's requirements, shall be prepared
and implemented.
1 1 .6
In India Safety and Health aspects at work or during construction are not adequately
regulated by any Rules or Acts as
in some other Countries. There
is need to identify the
scope of such acts to cover all the Safety and Health aspects by regulatory Acts through
legislation so that the careless and negligent attitude and approach of construction agencies
towards this important issue is curbed and lots of accidents and failures occurring on almost
all the construction sites could be avoided.
1 1 .7
The Regulations and Acts need to cover the following aspects during construction:
1 )
Safety and Health in Construction
2)
Work at Height
