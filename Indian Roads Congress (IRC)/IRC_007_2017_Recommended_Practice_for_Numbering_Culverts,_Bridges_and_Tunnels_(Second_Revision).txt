RECOMMENDED PRACTICE FOR NUMBERING CULVERTS, 
BRIDGES AND TUNNELS
IRC:7-1971 Recommended Practice for Numbering Bridges and Culverts was first published 
in 1959 and was first revised in 1971. The General Design Features (Bridges & Grade 
Separated Structures) Committee (B-1) felt the necessity to revise this document. The B-1 
Committee approved the draft document in its meeting held on 9th January, 2016 for placing 
before the Bridges Specifications & Standards Committee (BSS). The BSS Committee in its 
meeting held on 24th June, 2017 approved this document. The Council in its 212th meeting 
held on 14th & 15th July, 2017 at Udaipur (Rajasthan) approved the draft revision of IRC:7 
“Recommended Practice for Numbering Culverts, Bridges and Tunnels” after taking on board 
the comments offered by the Members.
The General Design Features (Bridges & Grade Separated Structures) Committee (B-1) of 
the Indian Roads Congress was constituted in 2015 with the following personnel:

1 INTRODUCTION
A uniform system of numbering of all the structures is essential for proper asset management. 
All culverts, minor bridges, major bridges, underpasses, flyovers, grade separators and tunnels 
on road shall be assigned separate numbers. This is a means for their easy identification of 
location and type of structure for the personnel for inspection and maintenance. 
2 SCOPE
2.1	
This document covers structures on all roads in the country.
2.2	
Structures shall include 
	
i)	
All culverts, including slab, box, hume pipes etc.
	
ii)	
All bridges 
	
iii)	
All underpasses
	
iv)	
All overpasses, pedestrian bridges etc.
	
v)	
ROB’s, flyovers and grade separator etc.
	
vi)	
Tunnels
	
vii)	
Any other structure
3 NUMBERING OF STRUCTURES
3.1	
All structures on a road shall be numbered in serial order, in each kilometer separately.
3.2	
The number shall be in the form of a fraction, the numerator denoting the number 
of kilometer in which the structure is situated and the denominator the km wise serial number 
of the structure. For instance, the 5th structure in the 4th km (i.e. between km stones 3 and 4) 
shall be designated as 4/5, and the 8th structure in 25th km as 25/8.
3.3	
For multi-lane carriageways, there should be either one combined structure or 
separate bridge structures. In case of one combined structure, the structure number shall be 
designated as in Sub-Clause 3.2 above. In case of separate bridge structures, the structure 
number shall be indicated as mentioned hereinafter. As the section progresses, the left hand 
side structure will have a suffix ‘L’ and the right hand side structure will have a suffix ‘R’. 
Similarly, the structures on service roads will have additional suffix ‘S’. For example:
Location of structures
Structure no.
2nd structure between km 280 and 281
i.
Left side structure on service road
281/2 LS
ii.
Right side structure on service road
281/2 RS
iii.
Left side structure on main carriageway
281/2 L
iv.
Right side structure on main carriageway
281/2 R

IRC: 7-2017
3.4	
If any new culvert bridge or structures are built subsequently, say between the 3rd. 
and 4th structure in km 375, the same shall be designated as 375/3/1, 375/3/2, etc.
4 SALIENT INFORMATION
For inspection and maintenance, it is useful to have mention of following salient information 
about structures:
	
a)	
Year of construction
	
b)	
Name of Channel / River / Crossing
	
c)	
Length
	
d)	
Span arrangement
	
e)	
HFL
	
f)	
Deck Level*1
	
g)	
Roadway
	
h)	
Type of structure [e.g. RCC/PSC, T-Beam and slab, Box girder, RCC/Stone 
Slab, Box culvert, tunnel feature, Arch, HP, Steel, Cable stayed, Extra-dosed].
These shall be provided on separate plate on the right hand side of the carriageway or the 
road.
5 INSCRIPTION OF STRUCTURE NUMBER
5.1	
The structure number shall be inscribed near the top left hand side parapet wall 
railing posts for end of crash barrier as seen by traffic in the end elevation when approaching 
the structure from each direction. These are illustrated in Figs.1, 2 and 3.
5.2	
In situations where instead of parapet walls, the structure is provided with railings, 
but having no end supporting pillars on which the number etc. could be inscribed, the number 
of the structure shall be indicated by means of a separate numbering plate of the size 
300 mm x 300 mm. There shall be two such numbering plates, one for each direction. The 
plates shall be welded or fixed securely on the left hand side facing the carriageway as close 
to entrance to the structure as possible. 
5.3	
In case of structures, such as pipe culverts, where there are usually no parapet 
walls or railings at the roadway level, two stone or R.C.C. marker posts, having a cross 
section of 150 mm x 150 mm and exposed height of at least 300 mm, shall be set up on the 
left side, one in each direction. Care shall be taken to locate the marker posts fully outside 
*1	
Deck Level shall indicate the level of bridge deck at the starting point of bridge as the section 
progresses, as under:
	
i)	
For 2-lane bridge – Deck Level at the road kerb (right side)
	
ii)	
For multi-lane carriageway – Deck Level at median

IRC: 7-2017
the prescribed roadway width. The culvert number shall be either engraved or painted. 
Alternatively, the number might also be inscribed at a suitable location on the head wall of 
the structure above the highest flood level.
6 INFORMATION PLATE
6.1	
The information of the structure shall be inscribed on two information plates one in 
each direction and fixed in the end elevation on a plate size near the top right hand side parapet 
wall / railing parts or end post of crash barrier etc. in the end elevation when approaching the 
structure. Information plate shall be of size 300 mm x 500 mm (for minor bridge and culverts) 
and 500 mm X 1000 m (for major bridges and other structures) Illustration is given in Fig. 4. 
The plate shall be fixed near the top right hand side.
6.2	
In situation where instead of parapet walls, the structure is provided with railings, 
but having no end supporting pillars on which information could be inscribed, the same shall 
be indicated on a separate information plate of size 300 x 500 m. There shall be two such 
information plates, one in each direction. The plates shall be welded or fixed securely on the 
right hand side facing the carriageway as close to the entrance to the structure as possible.
6.3	
In case of structures, such as pipe culverts where there are usually no parapet 
walls or rallings, at the roadway level, two stone or R.C.C. posts having a cross section of 
150 x 150 mm and exposed height of at least 500 mm, shall be set up on right side, one in 
each direction, on which an information plate of size 300 x 500 mm shall be fixed or welded 
securely. Care shall be taken to locate the posts and the plates fully outside the prescribed 
roadway width.
7 NUMERALS AND DETAILS
7.1	
The numerals used shall be 100 mm high and of international form conforming to 
IRC: 30-1968 Standard Letters and Numerals of Different Height for use on Highway Signs. 
These shall be painted on smooth panels as prescribed. In case of right hand panel the 
height shall be suitably adjusted so that it does not obstruct the visibility. The colour of the 
background shall be canary yellow, ISI Shade 309.
8 MAINTENANCE
8.1	
The structure numbers and information plate shall be updated whenever any 
change takes place affecting the existing position. They shall be kept clean well maintained 
and regularly painted.
