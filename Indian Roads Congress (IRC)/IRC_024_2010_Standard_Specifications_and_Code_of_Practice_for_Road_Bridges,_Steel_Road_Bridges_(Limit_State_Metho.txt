STANDARD  SPECIFICATIONS  AND  CODE  OF  PRACTICE
FOR  ROAD  BRIDGES
Section  V – STEEL  ROAD  BRIDGES
(LIMIT STATE METHOD)
INTRODUCTION
The Standard Specifications and Code of Practice for Road Bridges, Section V : Steel Road
Bridges (Second Revision), IRC : 24-2001 was published by the Indian Roads Congress in
2001. Since this Code was based on Working Stress Method (WSM) of design, it was felt
necessary to bring out a revised version of the Code based on the modern concept of Limit
State Method (LSM) of design in line with current International practice. LSM represents
definite advancement over WSM. It represents realistic and quantitative safety being based
on statistical and probability analysis. It uses a multiple safety factor format that intends to
provide adequate safety at ultimate loads (which could be collapse or elastic buckling or
fatigue fracture) as also adequate serviceability at service loads.
The work of revision of this Code was accordingly taken up by the Steel and Composite
Structures Committee (B-5) during its tenure from 2006. The draft was discussed at length
during various meetings and finalized in December 2008. The draft was discussed in the
Bridges Specifications and Standards Committee meeting held on 18 May 2009 and some
comments were made for consideration of the B-5 Committee. The Committee re-constituted
in 2009 consisting of the following personnel in its meeting on 11 July 2009 appointed a
Sub-Committee to finalise the document. The Sub-Committee considered the points raised
by IRC as well as other subsequent comments and finalized the draft which was approved by
B-5 Committee in its meeting held on 8 October 2009 for placing before the Bridges
Specifications and Standards (BSS) Committee. The names of the Personnel of Steel and
Composite Structures (B-5) Committee are given below:

The draft approved by Steel and Composite Structures Committee (B-5) was discussed by
Bridges Specifications and Standards (BSS) Committee in the meeting on 26 October 2009
and approved the same, subject to certain modifications. Subsequently, the draft was
approved by the Executive Committee on 31 October 2009. Finally the draft was approved
in the 189th Council meeting held at Patna on 14 November 2009.
The object of issuing the document is to establish a common procedure for design and
construction of road bridges in steel construction in India.
The revised publication is meant to serve as a guide to both the design and construction
engineers, but compliance with the rules therein does not relieve them in anyway of their
responsibility for stability and soundness of the structures designed and erected by them.
The design and construction of road bridges in steel construction require extensive and
thorough knowledge of the science and technique involved and should be entrusted only to
specifically qualified engineers and having adequate practical experience in bridge
engineering and capable of ensuring careful execution of work.

501 GENERAL
501.1
Scope
501.1.1
This Code deals mainly with the design of the structural steelwork of normal
road bridges (e.g. beams, plate girders, open web girders).
501.1.2
Provisions of this Code generally apply to riveted, bolted and welded
constructions using hot rolled steel sections only. Cold formed sections are not covered in
the Code.
501.1.3
IRC : 22 (Section VI) may be referred, wherever applicable in case of concrete
work composite with steel.
501.1.4
For loads and load combinations reference shall be made to IRC:6.
501.1.5
The present version of the Code embodies application of limit state principles
of design, which envisage that the structure will remain fit for use during its life with an
acceptable level of reliability. The principles of limit state design have been discussed in
greater details in Clause 503. The provisions of Limit State Method (LSM) of design in the
IS 800-2007 have been generally followed in this Code with appropriate changes, where
necessary. Certain formulae and tables have been adapted from this document.
501.1.6
Generally steel bridge structures shall be designed by limit state method.
Where limit state method cannot be conveniently adopted, working stress design method as
per Annex-G may be used at the discretion of the concerned authority.
501.2
Limitations
This Code generally applies to normal steel bridges. For the following types of bridges for
which there are special requirements for design, special literature may be referred to.
a) Curved bridges
b) Cable - stayed bridges
c) Suspension bridges
d) Temporary bridges
e) Pedestrian bridges
f)
Swing bridges
g) Bascule bridges
h) Box girder bridges

Prestressed steel bridges
j)
Arch bridges
This Code applies to such bridges to the extent where the special literature covering the
above areas refers to the provisions of the present Code. However, the design of structural
members and connections of all types of steel bridges may be done in accordance with the
provisions of this Code. Limitation of this Code is listed in Annex-A.
501.3
References
While preparing this Code, practices prevailing in this country in the design and construction
of steel bridges have been primarily kept in view. However, recommendations offered in the
following publications have also been considered :

501.4
Definitions
For the purpose of this Code, the following definitions shall apply :
Accidental Loads - Loads due to explosion, impact of vehicles, or other rare loads for which
the structure is considered to be vulnerable as per the user.
Accompanying Load - Live (Imposed) load acting along with leading imposed load but
causing lower effects and/or deflections.
Bearing Type Connection - A connection made using bolts in 'snug tight' condition, or rivets,
where the load is transferred by bearing of bolts and rivets against plate inside the hole.
Braced Member - A member in which the relative transverse displacement is effectively
prevented by bracing.
Buckling load - The load at which an element, a member or a structure as a whole, develops
excessive lateral deformation or instability.



======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 258
======================================================================
IRC:24-2010
5
Buckling Strength or Resistance - Force or moment, which a member can withstand without
buckling.
Camber - Intentionally introduced pre-curving (usually upwards) in a system, member or any
portion of a member with respect to its geometry. Frequently, camber is introduced to
compensate for deflections at a specific level of loads.
Characteristic Load - The value of specified load, above which not more than a specified
percentage (usually 5 percent) of samples of corresponding load is expected to be
encountered.
Characteristic Yield/Ultimate Stress - The minimum value of stress below which not more
than a specified percentage (usually 5 percent) of corresponding stresses (yield/ultimate) of
samples tested is expected to occur.
Compact Section - A cross-section, which can develop plastic moment, but has inadequate
plastic rotation capacity needed for formation of a plastic collapse mechanism of the member
or structure.
Constant Stress Range - The amplitude between which the stress ranges under cyclic
loading is constant during the life of the structure or a structural element.
Cumulative Fatigue - Total damage due to fatigue loading of varying stress ranges.
Cut-off Limit - The stress range, corresponding to the particular detail below which cyclic
loading need not be considered in cumulative fatigue damage evaluation (corresponds to
108 numbers of cycles in most cases).
Deflection - It is the deviation from the unloaded position of a member or structure caused
by load or change in the material properties.
Design Life - Intended time period for which a structure or a structural element is required to
perform its function, satisfying the criteria of performance as set out in this code.
Design Load/Factored Load - A load value obtained by multiplying the characteristic load
with a load factor.
Design Spectrum - Frequency distribution of the stress ranges from all the nominal loading
events during the design life, (stress spectrum).
Detail Category - Designation given to a particular detail to indicate the S-N curve to be
used in fatigue assessment.
Ductility - It is the property of the material or a structure indicating the extent to which it can

deform beyond the limit of yield deformation before failure or fracture. The ratio of ultimate to
yield deformation is usually termed 'ductility'.
Durability - It is the ability of a material to resist deterioration over long periods of time.
Edge Distance - Distance from the centre of a fastener hole to the nearest edge of an
element measured perpendicular to the direction of load transfer.
Effective Lateral Restraint - Restrain which produces sufficient resistance to prevent
deformation in the lateral direction.
Effective Length - Member length of a member between points of effective restraint or
effective restraint and free end,  multiplied by a factor to take account of the end conditions
in buckling strength calculations.
Elastic Critical Moment - The elastic moment, which initiates lateral-torsional buckling of a
laterally unsupported beam or girder.
Elastic Design - Design, which assumes elastic behaviour of materials throughout the service
load range.
Elastic Limit - It is the stress below which the material regains its original size and shape
when the load is removed. In steel design, it is taken as the yield stress/0.2 percent of proof
stress.
End Distance - Distance from the centre of a fastener hole to the edge of an element
measured parallel to the direction of load transfer.
Fatigue - Damage caused by repeated fluctuations of stress, leading to progressive cracking
of a structural element.
Fatigue Loading - Set of nominal loading events, cyclic in nature, described by the distribution

503 LIMIT STATE DESIGN
503.1
Basis of Design
503.1.1
In the limit state design method, the bridge structure shall be designed to
withstand safely all loads likely to act on it throughout  its design life. Also, the structure shall
remain fit for use during its design life. The acceptable limit for safety or serviceability
requirements before the failure occurs is called a limit state. In general, the structure shall be
designed on the basis of the most critical limit state and shall be checked for other limit
states. The probability of a limit state being reached during its lifetime should be very low.
503.1.2
Steel bridge structures are to be designed and constructed to satisfy the design
requirements with regard to stability, strength, brittle fracture, serviceability, fatigue and
durability such that they
a) shall remain fit with adequate reliability and be able to sustain all loads
and other influences experienced during construction and use,
b) have adequate durability under normal maintenance,
c) shall not suffer overall damage or collapse under accidental events like
fire hazards, explosions, vehicle impact, or due to consequences of human
error to an extent beyond local damage. The potential for catastrophic
damage shall be limited or avoided by appropriate choice of one or more
the following:
i)
Avoiding, eliminating or reducing exposure to hazards, which the
structure is likely to suffer.
ii)
Choosing structural forms, layouts and details, and designing such
that the structure has low sensitivity to hazardous conditions.
iii)
Introducing redundancy in the structural system, so that in the event
of failure of a member, the structure does not collapse, and suffers
only local damage.
iv)
Choosing suitable material, design and detailing procedure,
construction specifications, and control procedures for shop
fabrication and field construction.
v)
Providing adequate bracing system.
503.2
Limit State Design
503.2.1
Design shall be based on the characteristic values of material strengths
and applied loads, which take into account the probability of variations in the material



======================================================================
PAGE 37 of 258
======================================================================
IRC:24-2010
29
strengths and the applied loads. The characteristic values shall be based on statistical
data, if available. Where such data are not available, these shall be based on experience.
The design values, are derived from the characteristic values through the use of partial
safety factors both for material strengths and for loads. These factors are dependent on
the type of the material, the type of load and the limit state being considered. The reliability
of the design is ensured when :
Design load ≤ Design strength
503.2.2
Limit states are the states beyond which the structure no longer satisfies the
specified performance requirements. The limits states are classified as :
a) Limit State of Strength
b) Limit State of Serviceability
c) Limit State of Fatigue
503.2.2.1
Limit state of strength
Limit state of strength is associated with the failure (or imminent failure), under the action of
probable and most unfavourable combination of loads on the structure using the appropriate
partial safety factors, which may endanger the safety of life and/or property. The limit state of
strength includes:
a) Loss of equilibrium of the structure as a whole or any of its parts or
components
b) Loss of stability of the structure (including the effect of overturning)
c) Failure by excessive deformation (including buckling induced
deformation),  rupture of the structure or any of its parts or components.
d) Brittle fracture
503.2.2.2
Limit state of serviceability
Limit state of serviceability includes:
a) Deformation or deflection, which may adversely affect the appearance or
effective use of the bridge structure.
b) Vibration in the structure or any of its components causing discomfort to
the user or damages to the structure or which may limit its functional
effectiveness
c) Corrosion and durability

503.2.2.3
Limit state of fatigue
Limit state of fatigue is the state at which stress range due to application of live loads reaches
the limiting values as per Clause 511, corresponding to the number of load cycles and detail
configuration.
503.3
Design Loads
The loads specified in IRC:6 shall be considered along with the load factors.
503.4
Design Strength
The design strength, Sd is obtained as given below from ultimate strength, Su and partial
safety factors for materials, γ m (Table 1):
Sd = Su/ γ m
NOTE: Partial safety factor for materials ( γ m) account for the possibilities of :
a) unfavourable deviation of material strength from the characteristic
value
b) unfavourable variation of member sizes,
c) unfavourable reduction in member strength due to fabrication and
tolerances,
d) uncertain calculation of strength of the members.

Factors Governing Ultimate Strength
503.5.1
Stability - Stability shall be ensured for the structure as a whole and for each
of its elements. This should include, overall frame stability against overturning given below:
Stability Against Oveturning - The structure as a whole or any part of it shall be
designed to prevent instability due to overturning, uplift or sliding under factored load as
given below:
a) The loads shall be divided into components aiding instability and
components resisting instability.
b) The permanent and variable loads and their effects causing instability shall
be combined using appropriate load factors as per the Limit States
requirements to obtain maximum destabilizing effect.
c) The permanent loads and effects contributing to resistance shall be
multiplied by a partial safety factor 0.9 and added together with design
resistance (after multiplying by appropriate partial safety factor). Variable
loads and their effects contributing to resistance shall be disregarded.
d) The resistance effect shall be greater than or equal to the destabilizing
effect. Combination of imposed and dead loads should be such as to
cause most severe effect on overall stability.
503.5.2
Fatigue - Fatigue design shall be as per Clause 511 of this Code. When
designing for fatigue the partial safety factor for loads (f) shall be considered as 1.00 for
loads causing stress fluctuation and stress range.
503.6
Geometrical Properties
The geometrical properties of the gross and the effective cross-sections of a member or
part thereof, shall be calculated on the following basis:
a) The properties of the gross cross-section shall be calculated from the
specified size of the member or part thereof or read from appropriate
table.
b) The properties of the effective cross-section shall be calculated by
deducting from the area of the gross cross-section the following:
i)
The sectional area in excess of effective plate width, in case of
slender sections (Clause 503.7.2).
ii)
The sectional areas of all holes in the section except for parts in
compression. In case of punched holes, hole size 2 mm in excess of
the actual diameter may be deducted.

503.7
Classification of Cross-Sections
503.7.1
The local buckling of plate elements of a cross-section can be avoided before
the limit state is achieved by limiting the width to thickness ratio of each element of a cross-
section, subjected to compression due to axial force, moment or shear.
503.7.1.1
When plastic analysis is used, the members shall be capable of forming plastic
hinges with sufficient rotation capacity (ductility) without local buckling to enable the
redistribution of bending moment required before formation of the failure mechanism.
503.7.1.2
When elastic analysis is used, the member shall be capable of developing
the yield stress under compression without local buckling.
503.7.2
On the basis of the above, four classes of sections are defined as follows:
Class 1:
Plastic - Cross-sections, which can develop plastic hinges and have the
rotation capacity required for failure of the structure by formation of plastic
mechanism. The width to thickness ratio of plate elements shall be less than
that specified under Class 1 (Plastic) in Table 2.
Class 2:
Compact - Cross-sections, which can develop plastic moment of resistance,
but have inadequate plastic hinge rotation capacity for formation of plastic
mechanism, due to local buckling. The width to thickness ratio of plate
elements shall be less than that specified under Class 2 (compact), but greater
than that specified under Class 1 (Plastic) in Table 2.
Class 3 :
Semi-compact - Cross-sections, in which the extreme fibre in compression
can reach yield stress, but cannot develop the plastic moment of resistance,
due to local buckling. The width to thickness ratio of plate elements shall be
less than that specified under  Class 3  (Semi-compact), but greater than that
specified under Class 2 (Compact) in Table 2.
Class 4:
Slender - Cross-sections in which the elements buckle locally even before
reaching yield stress. The width to thickness ratio of plate element shall be
greater than that specified under Class 3 (Semi-compact) in Table 2.  In such
cases the effective sections for design shall be calculated by deducting width
of compression plate element in excess of the Semi-compact section limit.
The design of slender compression element is outside the scope of this code.
When different elements of a cross-section fall under different classes, the
section shall be classified as governed by the most critical element.
The maximum value of limiting width to thickness ratios of elements for different
classifications of sections are given in Table 2.

c) Any outstand of the added plates beyond the line of welds or fasteners
connecting it to original section to its own thickness.
504 GENERAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
504.1
Effective Span
The effective span shall be as given below :
a) For main girders - the distance between the centres of bearings
b) For cross girders - the distance between the centres of main girders or
trusses
c) For stringers - the distance between the centres of cross girders
NOTE:-
Where a cross girder or stringer terminates on an abutment or
pier, the centre of bearing thereon shall be taken as one end of
the effective span.
d) For pins in bending - the distance between the centres of bearings; but
where pins pass through bearing plates having thickness greater than half
the diameter of the pins, consideration may be given to the effect of the
distribution of bearing pressures on the effective span.
504.2
Effective Depth
The effective depth of plate or truss girder should be taken as the distance between the
centres of gravity of the upper and lower flanges or chords.
504.3
Spacing of Girders
The distance between centres of the main girders shall be sufficient to resist overturning or
over stressing due to lateral forces and loading conditions. Otherwise special provisions
must be made to prevent  this. This distance shall not be less than 1/20 of the span.
504.4
Depth of Girders
Minimum depth preferably shall not be less than the following :
a) For trusses : 1/10 of the effective span
b) For rolled steel joists and plate girders : 1/25 of the effective span
The effective depth of open web girders shall not be greater than three
times the distance between the centres of these girders.

504.5
Deflection of Girders
Deflection is to be checked by elastic analysis, using a partial safety factor for loads
as 1.0.
504.5.1
Rolled steel beams, plate girders or lattice girders, either simple or continuous
spans, shall be designed so that the total deflection due to dead load, live load and impact
shall not exceed 1/600 of the span. However, this restriction shall not apply if minimum in-
place precamber is provided to compensate for all dead and superimposed dead load
deflections.
Additionally, the deflection due to live load and impact shall not exceed of 1/800 of the span.
504.5.2
The deflection of cantilever arms at the tip due to dead load, live load and
impact shall not exceed 1/300 of the cantilever arm and deflection due to live load and impact
shall not exceed 1/400 of the cantilever arm.
504.5.3
Sidewalk live load may be neglected in calculating deflection.
504.5.4
When cross bracings or diaphragms of sufficient depth and strength are
provided between beams to ensure the lateral distribution of loads the deflection may be

505.1
General
Effects of design loads on a bridge structure and its members and connections shall be
determined by structural analysis using Elastic analysis
505.2
Elastic Analysis
505.2.1
Assumption- Individual members shall be assumed to remain elastic under
the effects of  factored design loads for all limit states.
505.2.2
The effect of haunching or any variation of the cross-section along the axis of
a member shall be considered, and where significant shall be taken into account in the
determination of the member stiffness.
505.2.3
Appropriate load combinations with corresponding load factors are to be used
to find out the maximum values of load effects on members.
505.2.4
In a first-order elastic analysis, the equilibrium of the frame in the undeformed
geometry is considered, the changes in the geometry of the frame due to the loading are not
accounted for, and changes in the effective stiffness of the members due to axial force are
neglected. The effect of these on the first order bending moments may be accounted for by
carrying out second order elastic analysis.
506 DESIGN OF TENSION MEMBERS

its length before the rupture load is reached, the member may become non-functional due to
excessive elongation. Plates and other rolled sections in tension may also fail by block shear
of end bolted riveted regions (See Clause 506.1.3).
The factored design tension T, in the members shall satisfy the following requirement :
T < Td
where
Td

Design Strength
507.1.1
Common hot rolled and built up steel members, used for carrying axial
compression, usually fail by flexural buckling. The buckling strength of these members is
affected by residual stresses, initial bow and accidental eccentricities of load. To account for
all these factors, the strength of members subjected to axial compression is defined by
buckling class a,b,c or d as given in Table 3 and 4.
507.1.2
The factored design compression P in the member due to external loads shall
satisfy the following requirement:
P < Pd
where
Pd
= design strength of the member as given below :

Effective Length
507.2.1
The effective length, KL is calculated from the member length, L, of the member,
considering the rotational and relative translational boundary conditions at the ends. The
member length shall be taken as the length from centre to centre of its intersections with the
supporting members in the plane of the buckling deformation. In the case of a member with
a free end, the free standing length from the centre of the intersecting member at the supported
end, shall be taken as the member length.
507.2.2
Where the boundary conditions in the plane of buckling can be assessed, the
effective length KL, can be calculated on the basis of Table 7.
507.2.3
In the case of bolted, riveted or welded trusses and braced frames, the
effective length, KL of the compression members should generally follow Clause 508 under
"Design of Trusses or Open-web Girders" of this code. In the case of members of trusses for
buckling in the plane perpendicular to the plane of the truss, the effective length, KL shall be
taken as the distance between the centres of intersection. The design of angle struts shall be
as specified in Clause 507.5.

507.3.2
Effective sectional area Ae - Except for Class 4 (slender section) in Clause
503.7.2 the gross sectional area shall be taken as the effective sectional area for all
compression members fabricated by welding, bolting and riveting so long as the section is
semi-compact or better. Holes not filled with rivets, bolts or pins shall be deducted from
gross area to calculate effective sectional area.
507.3.3
Eccentricity for columns
For the purpose of determining the stress in the section of a column, the reactions from the
connecting member or similar loads shall be assumed to be applied at an eccentricity of
100 mm from the face of the section or at the centre of bearing whichever dimension gives
the greater eccentricity, and with the exception of the following two cases :
a) In the case of cap connection, the load shall be assumed to be applied at
the face of the column section or at the edge of packing, if used towards
the span of the beam.
b) In the case of a truss bearing on a cap, no eccentricity need to be taken
for simple bearings without connections, capable of developing any
appreciable moment. In case of web member connection with face, actual
eccentricity is to be considered.
507.3.4
Splices
507.3.4.1
Where the ends of compression members are prepared for bearing over the
whole area, they shall be spliced to hold the connected members accurately in position, and
to resist bending or tension, if present. Such splices should maintain the intended member
stiffness about each axis. Splices should be located as close to the point of inflection as
possible. Otherwise their capacity should be adequate to carry moment (see Clause
510.3.2.2). The ends of compression members faced for bearing shall invariably be machined
to ensure perfect contact of surfaces in bearing.
507.3.4.2
Where such members are not faced for complete bearing, the splices shall
be designed to transmit all the forces to which the members are subjected.
507.3.4.3
Wherever possible, splices shall be proportioned and arranged so that the
centroidal axis of the splice coincides as nearly as possible with the centroidal axes of the
members being jointed, in order to avoid eccentricity: but where eccentricity is present in the
joint, the resulting stress shall be accounted for.
Wherever possible both surfaces of the parts spliced shall be covered or other means taken
to maintain the alignment of the abutting ends.

507.3.4.4
Splices in compression members located at or near effectively braced
panel points shall be designed to transmit design strength of the member. All other
splices in compression members shall have a sectional area 5 percent more than that
required to develop the design strength in the member. All cover materials shall, as far
as practicable, be so disposed with respect to the cross-section of the
member so as to transmit the proportional load of the respective parts of the section.
Rivets, bolts or welds shall develop the full strength in the cover material as defined
above.
507.3.4.5
Where flexural tension may occur in the member, the cover material shall be
designed to resist such tension.
507.4
Base Plates
507.4.1
General
507.4.1.1
Base plates of compression members should have sufficient stiffness and
strength to transmit axial force, bending moments and shear forces at the base of the
compression members to their foundation without exceeding the load carrying capacity of
the supports. Anchor bolts and shear keys should be provided wherever necessary. Shear
resistance at the proper contact surface between steel base and concrete/grout and bearing
pressure between the plate and support shall be determined and computed as per provisions
of IRC:78.
507.4.1.2
If the size of the base plate is larger than that required to limit the bearing
pressure on the base support, an equal projection, c, of the base plate beyond the face of
the compression member and gusset may be taken as effective in transferring the column
load as given in  Fig. 6, such that beam pressure at the effective area does not exceed
bearing capacity of concrete base.

Gusseted bases
In gusseted bases, the gusset plates, angle cleats, stiffeners, fastenings, etc. in combination
with the bearing area of the shaft, shall be sufficient to take the loads, bending moments and
reactions to the base plate without exceeding specified strength. All the bearing  surfaces
should be machined to ensure perfect contact.
507.4.2.1
Where the ends of the compression member and the gusset plates are not
faced for complete bearing, the welding, fastenings connecting them to the base plate shall
be sufficient to transmit all the forces to which the base is subjected.
507.4.2.2
Compression member and base plate connections-Where the end of the
compression member is connected directly to the base plate by means of full penetration
butt welds, the connection shall be deemed to transmit to the base all the forces and moments
to which the compression member is subjected.
507.4.3
Slab bases
Compression members with slab bases need not be provided with gussets, but sufficient
fastenings shall be provided to retain the parts securely in place and to resist all moments
and forces, other than direct compression, including those arising during transit, unloading
and erection.
507.4.3.1
The minimum thickness, ts of rectangular slab bases, supporting members

507.4.3.2
When the slab base does not distribute the load uniformly, due to
eccentricity of the load etc., special calculation shall be made to show that the base
is adequate to resist the moment due to the non-uniform pressure from below.

Bases for bearing upon concrete or masonry need not be machined on the
underside.
507.4.3.4
In cases where the cap or base is fillet welded directly to the end of the
compression member without boring and shouldering, the contact surfaces shall be machined
to give a perfect bearing and the welding shall be sufficient to transmit the forces as required
in Clause 507.4.3.  Where full strength but welds are provided, machining of contact surfaces
is not required.
507.5
Angle Struts
507.5.1
Single angle struts - The compression in single angles may be transferred
either concentrically to its centroid through end gusset or eccentrically by connecting one of
its legs to a gusset or adjacent member.

For double angle discontinuous struts, connected back to back, on opposite
sides of the gusset or a section, by not less than two bolts or rivets in line along the angles at
each end, or by the equivalent in welding, the load may be regarded as applied axially. The
effective length, KL, in the plane of end gusset shall be taken as between 0.7 and 0.85 times
the distance between intersections, depending on the degree of the restraints provided. The
effective length, KL, in the plane perpendicular to that of the end gusset, shall be taken as
equal to the distance between centres of intersections. The calculated average compressive
stress shall not exceed the values based on Clause 507.1.2. The angles shall be connected
together over their lengths so as to satisfy the requirements of Clauses 507.6 and 512.
507.5.2.2
Double angle discontinuous struts connected back-to-back, to one side of a
gusset or section by one or more bolts or rivets in each angle, or by the equivalent in welding,

together over their lengths so as to satisfy the requirements of Clauses 507.6 and 512.
507.5.3
Continuous members: Double angle continuous struts such as those forming
the chords or ties of trusses or trussed girders, or the legs of towers shall be designed as
axially loaded compression members, and the effective length shall be taken in accordance
with Clause 508.
507.5.4
Combined stresses: In addition to axial loads, if the struts carry loads, which
cause transverse bending, the combined bending and axial stresses shall be checked in
accordance with Clause 510 of this code.

strut. Where welded lacing bars overlap the main component, the amount of lap shall be not
less than four times the thickness of the bar or four times the mean thickness of the flange of
the component to which the bars are attached, whichever is less . Welding shall be provided

shall be such that the slenderness ratio of the lesser main component over this distance shall
not be greater than 50 or 0.7 times the ratio of slenderness of the member as a whole about
its axis parallel to the battens. In case it is  more than 0.8 times the ratio about the axis
parallel to the battens, the spacing of battens between centre to centre of end fastenings
shall be such that slenderness ratio of the lesser main component over this distance shall not
be greater than 50 or 0.7 times of slenderness ratio of the member as a whole about it

508 DESIGN OF TRUSSES OR OPEN-WEB GIRDERS
508.1
General
Trusses or open web girders are defined as triangulated skeletal girders. The design of
individual members and connections should be made in accordance with this Clause in
conjunction with Clauses 506, 507, and 512 as appropriate.
508.2
Analysis
For analysis of trusses the following assumption may be made unless rigorous rigid frame
analysis is adopted :
a) All members are frictionless pin jointed.
b) All members are straight and free to rotate at the joints.
c) All loads including self weight of members are applied at the joints
Stipulations made in this section are not applicable for design of stiffening
trusses of suspension bridges.
508.3
Intersection at Joints
For triangulated trusses designed on the assumption of frictionless pin jointed connections,
members meeting at a joint should, where practicable, have their centroidal axes meeting
at a point, and wherever practicable the centre of resistance of a connection shall lie on
the line of action of the load so as to avoid an eccentricity moment on the connections.
If, at a joint, the centroidal axes of the adjacent members do not meet at a single point, the
resulting flexural stresses in the members should be taken into account as secondary stress.
Where loads are not applied at truss joints, account should be taken of the
following:
a) resulting stresses where load is applied to a member in the plane of a
truss other than at a joint
b) torsion and lateral flexure effects when the applied load is not in the
plane of the truss. Where the load is applied to a cross-member, the
effect of interaction between the cross-member so loaded and the truss
and adjacent cross-member should be taken into account.
508.4
Effective Length of Compression Members
508.4.1
In riveted, bolted or welded trusses the compression members act in a complex
manner and the effective lengths KL of such members shall be taken as given in Table 9 for

507.1.2 in which effective length "KL" is the length of the strut, centre-to-centre of fastenings
at each end and 'r' is the minimum radius of gyration.
508.4.3
For single angle discontinuous struts intersected by, and effectively connected
to another angle in cross bracing, the effective length in the plane of bracings shall be taken
as in Table 9 and normal to the plane of bracing the effective lengths shall be taken as the
distance along the bracing members between the points of intersection and the centroids of

appropriate rectangular axis shall be taken for buckling normal to the plane of the bracing
and the least radius of gyration for buckling in the plane of the bracing.

For simply supported trusses with ends restrained at the bearings against torsion, the effective
length of the compression chord for buckling normal to the plane of the truss shall be taken

b) With compression chords supported by U frames, where there is no lateral

forming U frames provide lateral restraints:

nearest mid span of the truss, taken as the horizontal deflection. This
deflection shall be computed assuming that the cross-member is free to
deflect vertically and that the tangent to the deflection curve at the centre
of its span remains parallel to the neutral axis of the unrestrained cross-
member.

509 DESIGN OF BEAMS AND PLATE GIRDERS
509.1
General
509.1.1
Beams are defined as members with solid webs (or with openings in
accordance with Clause 509.1.4), including members of rolled and hollow section, and plate
girders subjected primarily to bending.
509.1.2
Beams shall satisfy the deflection limitation presented in Clause 504.5 of this
Code.
509.1.3
The effective span of a beam shall be taken as the distance between the
centres of the supports.
509.1.4
Openings
509.1.4.1
Any openings in webs or compression flanges should be framed and the
stiffened section designed for local load effects, including secondary bending.  Alternatively,
openings in webs may be unstiffened provided that they meet the provisions of Clause 509.2.
All corners should be rounded with a radius of at least one-quarter of the least dimension of
the hole.
509.1.4.2
Openings in a web may be unstiffened provided that:
a) the overall greatest internal dimension does not exceed one-tenth of
the depth of the web, nor, for longitudinally, stiffened webs, one-third
of the depth of the panel containing the opening;
b) the longitudinal distance between the boundaries of adjacent openings
is atleast three times the maximum internal dimension;
c) not more than one opening is provided at any cross-section.

509.2
Design Strength in Bending (Flexure)
The design bending strength of beam, adequately supported against lateral torsional buckling
(laterally supported beam) is governed by the yield stress (Clause 509.2.1). When a beam is
not adequately supported against lateral buckling (laterally unsupported beams) the design
bending strength may be governed by lateral torsional buckling strength (Clause 509.2.2).
The factored design moment, M at any section in a beam due to external loads shall satisfy
the following requirement :
M < Md
where, Md = design bending strength of the section, calculated as given in
Clause 509.2.1.2.
509.2.1
Laterally supported beam
A beam may be assumed to be adequately supported provided the compression flange
has full lateral restraint and nominal torsional restraint at supports suitably imparted by
web cleats, partial depth end plates, fin plates or continuity with the adjacent span. Full
lateral restraint to compression flange may be assumed to exist, if the frictional or
other positive restraint of a structural  connection to the compression flange of the
member is capable of resisting  a lateral force not less than 2.5 percent of the maximum
force in the compression flange of the member. This may be considered to be uniformly
distributed along the flange, provided gravity loads constitute the dominant loading on
the member and the deck construction is capable of resisting this lateral force.
The design bending strength of a section which is not susceptible to web buckling under
shear before yielding (where d/tw≤67ε  ) shall be determined according to Clause  509.2.1.2.
509.2.1.1
Section with web susceptible to shear buckling before yielding - When the
flanges are plastic, compact or semi-compact but the web is susceptible to shear buckling
before yielding  (i.e. d/tw≤67ε ), the design bending strength shall be calculated using one of
the following methods:
a) The bending moment and axial force acting on the section may be assumed
to be resisted by flanges only and the web is designed only to resist shear
(Clause 509.4).
b) The bending moment and axial force acting on the section may be
assumed to be resisted the whole section. In such a case, the web



======================================================================
PAGE 87 of 258
======================================================================
IRC:24-2010
79
shall be designed for combined shear and normal stresses using
simple elastic theory in case of semi-compact webs and simple plastic
theory in the case of compact and plastic webs.
509.2.1.2
When the factored design shear force does not exceed 0.6 Vd, where Vd is the
design shear strength of the cross-section (Clause 509.4), the design bending strength, Md,
shall be taken as
Md = 
0

ρ
β
γ

Z f
To avoid irreversible deformation under serviceability loads, Md shall be less than 1.2 Ze fy /γm0

β b
= 1.0 for plastic and compact sections.
β b

509.2.1.3
When the design shear force (factored), V, exceeds 0.6 Vd , where Vd is the
design shear strength of the cross-section (Clause 509.4), the design bending strength, Md
shall be taken as :
Md = Mdv
where  Mdv = design bending strength under high shear as defined in Clause 510.2.
509.2.1.4
Holes in the tension zone
a) The effect of holes in the tension flange, on the design bending strength
need not be considered if
(Anf / Agf) ≥ (fy/fu) (γ ml / γ m0)/0.9
where
Anf / Agf
=
ratio of net to gross area of the flange in tension
fy/fu
=
ratio of yield and ultimate stress of the material
γ ml /γ m0
=
ratio of partial safety factors against ultimate to yield stress
(Clause 503.4)

When Anf/Agf does not satisfy the above requirement, the reduced effective
flange area, Aef satisfying the above equation may be taken as the effective
flange area in tension, instead of Agf.
b) The effect of holes in the tension region of the web on the design flexural
strength need not be considered, if the limit given in (a) above is satisfied
for the complete tension zone of the cross-section, comprising the tension
flange and tension region of the web.
c) Fastener holes in the compression zone of the cross-section need not
be considered in design bending strength calculation, except for
oversize and slotted holes, or holes without any fastener.
509.2.1.5
Shear lag Effects - The shear lag effects in flanges may be disregarded
provided:
a) For outstand elements (supported along one edge) , b0 ≤Lo /20
b) For internal elements (supported along two edges), bi ≤Lo /10
where
Lo
= length between points of zero moment (inflection) in the span
b0
= width of the flange with outstand
bi
= width of the flange as an internal element
When these limits are exceeded, the effective width of flange for design
strength may be calculated using specialist literature, or conservatively taken
as the value satisfying the limit given above.
509.2.2
Laterally unsupported beams
Resistance to lateral tortional buckling need not be checked separately (member may be
treated as laterally supported (Clause 509.2.1) in the following cases:
a) Bending is about the minor axis of the section;
b) Section is hollow (rectangular/tubular) or solid bars;
c) In case of major axis bending, λLT (as defined below) is less than 0.4

shall be taken as the length of the relevant segment in between the lateral restraints. The
effective length shall be equal to 1.2 times the length of the relevant segment in between the
lateral restraints.
Restraints against torsional rotation at supports in these beams may be provided by:
a) web or flange cleats, or
b) bearing stiffeners acting in conjunction with the bearing of the beam, or
c) lateral end frames or external supports providing lateral restraint to the
compression flanges at the ends
509.3.2
For beams, which are provided with members giving effective lateral restraint
to the compression flange at intervals along the span, in addition to the end torsional restraint
required in Clause 509.3.1, the effective length for lateral torsional buckling shall be taken as
the distance, centre-to-centre, of the restraint members in the relevant segment under normal
loading condition and 1.2 times the distance, where the load is not acting on the beam
at the shear centre and is acting towards the shear centre so as to have destabilizing
effect during lateral torsional buckling deformation.
509.3.3
For cantilever beams of projecting length, L, the effective length LLT to be
used in Clause 509.2.2.1 shall be taken as in Table 13 for different support conditions.
509.3.4
Where a member is provided with intermediate lateral supports to improve
the lateral buckling strength, these restraints should have sufficient strength and stiffness to
prevent lateral movement of the compression flange at the point, relative to the end supports.
The intermediate lateral restraints should be either connected to an appropriate bracing
system capable of transferring the restraint force to the effective lateral support at the ends
of the member, or should be connected to an independent robust part of the structure capable
of transferring the restraint force. Two or more parallel members requiring such lateral restraint
shall not be simply connected together assuming mutual dependence for the lateral restraint.
The intermediate lateral restraints should be connected to the member as close to
the compression flange as practicable. Such restraints should be closer to the shear
centre of the compression flange than to the shear centre of the section. However, if
torsional restraint preventing relative rotation between the two flanges is provided,
the intermediate lateral restraint may be connected at any appropriate level.
For beams which are provided with members giving effective lateral restraint at intervals
along the span, the effective lateral restraint shall be capable of resisting a force of
2.5 percent of the maximum force in the compression flange taken as divided equally between
the points at which the restraint members are provided. Further, each restraint point should
be capable of resisting 1 percent of the maximum force in the compression flange.

(Clause 507) and for open holes occurring in a plane perpendicular to the direction of stress
at the section being considered (Clause 509.2.1.4).
The effective sectional area of tension flanges shall be the gross sectional area with deductions
for holes as specified in Clause 509.2.1.4.
The effective sectional area for parts in shear shall be taken as specified in Clause 509.4.1.1.
509.6.3
Flanges
509.6.3.1
In riveted or bolted construction, flange angles shall form as large a part of the
area of the flange as practicable (preferably not less than one-third) and the number of flange
plates shall be kept to a minimum.



======================================================================
PAGE 108 of 258
======================================================================
IRC:24-2010
100
In exposed situations, where flange angles are used, at least one plate of the top flange shall
extend over the full length of the girder, unless the top edge of the web is machined flush with
the flange angles. Where two or more flange plates are used, tacking rivets shall be provided,
if necessary to comply with the requirements of Clause 512.
Each flange plate shall extend beyond its theoretical cut-off point, and the extension shall
contain sufficient rivets, bolts or welds to develop in the plate, the load calculated for the
bending moment on the girder section (taken to include the curtailed plate) at the theoretical
cut-off point.
The outstand of flange plates, that is the projection beyond the outer line of connections to
flange angles, channel or joist flanges, or, in the case of welded constructions, their projection
beyond the face of the web or tongue plate, shall not exceed the values given in
Clause 503.7.2 (Table 2).
509.6.3.2
In welded construction, the use of curtailed flange plates shall be avoided as
far as possible, local strengthening being provided by other means such as inserting by butt
welding a thicker and or wider plate. The heavier section plate shall be suitably tapered to
the lighter plate. If, in welded construction the use of curtailed flange plates cannot be avoided,
the end of the plate shall be tapered in plan to a rounded end and all welds shall be continuous
round the ends.
509.6.3.3
Flange splices
Flange splices preferably should not be located at points of maximum stress. Where splice
plates are used, their area shall not be less than 5 percent in excess of the area of the flange
element spliced; their centre of gravity shall coincide, as nearly possible, with that of the
element spliced. There shall be enough bolts, rivets or welds on each side of the splice to
develop the load in the element spliced plus 5 percent but in no case should the strength
developed be less than 50 percent of the effective strength of the material spliced. In welded
construction, flange plates shall be joined by complete penetration butt welds, wherever
possible. These butt welds shall develop the full strength of the plates.
509.6.3.4
Connection of flanges to web
The flanges of plate girders shall be connected to the web by sufficient rivets, bolts or
welds to transmit the maximum horizontal shear force resulting from the bending moment
gradient in the girder, combined with any vertical loads which are directly applied to the
flange. If the web is designed using tension field method as given in Clause 509.4.2.2(b),
then the weld should be able to transfer the tension field stress, fyw, acting on the web.
509.6.3.5
Bolted/riveted construction
For girders in exposed situations and which do not have flange plates for their entire length,
the top edge of the web plate shall be flush with or above the angles, and the bottom edge of
the web plate shall be flush with or set back from the angles.

509.6.3.6
Welded construction
The gap between the web plates and flange plates shall be kept to a minimum and for fillet
welds, shall not exceed 1 mm at any point before welding.
509.6.4
Webs
509.6.4.1
Effective sectional area of web of plate girder - The effective cross-sectional
area shall be taken as the full depth of the web plate multiplied by the thickness.
NOTE :
Where webs are varied in thickness in the depth of the section by the use of
tongue plates or the like, or where the proportion of the web included in the flange
area is 25 percent or more of the overall depth, the above approximation is not
permissible and the maximum shear stress shall be computed based on theory.
509.6.4.2
Splices in webs
Splices and cut-outs for service ducts in the webs preferably should not be located at points
of maximum shear force and heavy concentrated loads.
Splices in the webs of the plate girders and rolled sections shall be designed to resist the
shears and moments at the spliced section.
In riveted or bolted construction, splice plate shall be provided on each side of the web. In
welded construction, web splices shall preferably be made with complete penetration butt
welds. Where this is not possible, splice plates on both sides should be used (Refer to
Clause 512).
509.6.4.3
Where additional plates are required to augment the strength of the web, they
shall be placed on each side of the web and shall be equal in thickness. The proportion of
shear force, assumed to be resisted by these plates shall be limited by the amount of horizontal
shear which they can transmit to the flanges through their fastenings, and such reinforcing
plates and their fastenings shall be carried up to the points at which the flange without the
additional plates is adequate (Refer to Clause 512).
509.7
Design of Stiffeners
509.7.1
General
509.7.1.1
When the web of a member acting alone (that is without stiffeners) proves
inadequate, stiffeners for meeting the following requirements should be provided.
a) Intermediate transverse web stiffeners - To improve the buckling strength
of a slender web due to shear (Clause 509.7.2).



======================================================================
PAGE 110 of 258
======================================================================
IRC:24-2010
102
b) Load carrying stiffener - To prevent local buckling of the web due to
concentrated loading (Clauses 509.7.3 and 509.7.5).
c) Bearing stiffener - To prevent local crushing of the web due to concentrated
loading (Clauses 509.7.4 and 509.7.6).
d) Diagonal stiffener - To provide local reinforcement to a web under shear
and bearing (Clause 509.7.7).
e) Tension stiffener - To transmit tensile forces applied to a web through a
flange (Clause 509.7.8).
f)
Torsion stiffener - To provide torsional restraint to beams and girders at
supports (Clause 509.7.9).
The same stiffeners may perform more than one function and their design should comply
with the requirements of all the functions designed for.
509.7.1.2
Outstand of web stiffeners - Unless the outer edge is continuously stiffened,
the outstand from the face of the web should not exceed 20tqε .
When the outstand is between 14tqε   and 20tqε , then the stiffener design should be on the
basis of a core section with an outstand of 14tqε .
where
tq
= thickness of the stiffener
509.7.1.3
Stiff bearing length - The stiff bearing length of any element b1, is that length
which cannot deform appreciably in bending. To determine b1 the dispersion of load through
a steel bearing element should be taken as 450 through solid material, such as bearing plates,
flange plates etc. (Fig. 10)
509.7.1.4
Eccentricity - Where a load or reaction is applied eccentric to the centre line
of the web or where the centroid of the stiffener does not lie on the centre line of the web, the
resulting eccentricity of loading should be accounted for in the design of the stiffener.
509.7.1.5
Buckling resistance of stiffener - The buckling resistance Fqd, should be based
on the design compressive stress fcd (Clause 507.1.2.1) of a strut (curve c), the radius of
gyration being taken about the axis parallel to the web. The effective section is the full area
or core area of the stiffener (Clause 509.7.1.2) together with an effective length of web on
each side of the centre line of the stiffeners, limited to 20 times the web thickness. The
design strength used should be the minimum value obtained for buckling about the web or
the stiffener.



======================================================================
PAGE 111 of 258
======================================================================
IRC:24-2010
103
The effective length of intermediate transverse stiffeners used in calculating the buckling
resistance, Fqd should be taken as 0.7 times the length, L, of the stiffener.
The effective length for load carrying web stiffeners used in calculating the buckling resistance,
Fxd, assumes that the flange through which the load or reaction is applied is effectively
restrained against lateral movement relative to the other flange, and length should be taken
as:
a) KL = 0.7 L when flange restrained against rotation in the plane of the
stiffener (by other structural elements)
b) KL = L when flange not so restrained
where
L
= length of the stiffener
If the load or reaction is applied to the flange by a compression member, then
unless effective lateral restraint is provided at that point, the stiffener should
be designed as part of the compression member applying the load, and the
connection between the compression member and the beam flange shall be
checked for the effects of the strut action.
509.7.2

509.7.2.1
General - Intermediate transverse stiffeners may be provided on one or both
sides of the web.

Outstand of Stifferers - The outstand of the stiffeners should comply with
Clause 509.7.1.2.
509.7.2.4
Minimum stiffeners -  Transverse web stiffeners not subject to  external loads
or moments should have a second moment of area, Is about the centreline of the web (if
stiffeners are on both sides of the web) and about the face of the web (if single stiffener on
only one side of the web is used) such that:

509.7.2.5
Buckling check on intermediate transverse web stiffeners - Stiffeners not
subjected to external loads of moments should be checked for a stiffener force:
Fq = V–Vcr / 
0
m
γ
≤Fqd
where
Fqd
= design resistance of the intermediate stiffeners
V
= factored shear force adjacent to the stiffener
Vcr
= shear buckling resistance of the web panel designed without using tension
field action Clause 509.4.2.2(a).
Stiffeners subject to external loads and moments should meet the conditions for load carrying
web stiffeners in Clause 509.7.3. In addition they should satisfy the following interaction
expression.

Connection of intermediate stiffeners to web - Intermediate transverse
stiffeners not subject to external loading should be connected to the web so as to
withstand a shear between each component of the stiffener and the web (in kN/mm) of
not less than
t2
w / (5bs )
where

= outstand width of the stiffener (in mm)
For stiffeners subject to external loading, the shear between the web and the stiffener due to
such loading has to be added to the above value.
Stiffeners not subject to external loads or moments may terminate clear of the tension flange
and in such a situation the distance cut short from the line of the weld should not be more
than 4tw.

compressive forces applied through a flange by loads or reactions exceed the buckling
strength, Fcdw, of the unstiffened web, calculated using the following:
The effective length of the web for evaluating the slenderness ratios is calculated as in Clause
509.7.1.5. The area of cross section is taken as

509.7.6
Design of bearing stiffeners
Bearing stiffeners should be designed for the applied load or reaction less the local capacity
of the web as given in Clause 509.7.4. Where the web and the stiffener material are of
different strengths the lesser value should be  assumed to calculate the capacity of the web
and the stiffener. Bearing stiffeners should project nearly as much as the overhang of the
flange through which load is transferred.
509.7.7
Design of diagonal stiffeners
Diagonal stiffeners should be designed to carry the portion of the applied shear and bearing
that exceeds the capacity of the web.

= maximum thickness of compression flange in the span under consideration
KL
= laterally unsupported effective length of the compression flange of the beam
ry
= radius of gyration of the beam about the minor axis
509.7.10
Connection of load carrying and bearing stiffeners to web - Stiffeners, which
resist loads or reactions applied through a flange, should be connected to web by sufficient
welds or fasteners to transmit a design force equal to the lesser of:
a) The tension capacity of the stiffener
b) The sum, of the forces applied at the two ends of the stiffener when they
act in the same direction or the larger of the forces when they act in opposite
directions.
Stiffeners, which do not extend right across the web, should be of such length that the shear
stress in the web due to the design force transmitted by the stiffener does not exceed the
shear strength of the web. In addition, the capacity of the web beyond the end of the stiffener
should be sufficient to resist the applied force.

flange transmitting the load by continuous welds or non-slip fasteners.
509.7.11.2
In compression - Stiffeners required to resist compression should either be
fitted against the loaded flange or connected by continuous welds or non-slip fasteners.
The stiffener should be fitted against or connected to both flanges when:
a) a load is applied directly over a support; or

transverse stiffeners, they shall be as follows :
a) One longitudinal stiffener shall be placed on the web at a distance from
the compression flange equal to 1/5 of the distance from the compression
flange angle, plate or tongue plate to the neutral axis when the thickness
of the web is less than the limit specified in Clause 509.6.1. The stiffener
shall be designed so that Is is not less that 4ctw
3 where Is and tw are as
defined in Clause 509.7.2.4 and c is the actual distance between the
transverse stiffeners.
b) A second longitudinal stiffener (single or double) shall be placed at the
neutral axis of the girder when the thickness of the web is less than the
limit specified in Clause 509.6.1. This stiffener shall be designed so that

Detailing requirements
a) Load bearing stiffeners should be in pairs (that is two legs of plates, angles
etc.) placed symmetrically at both sides of the web. When the condition is
not met the effect of the resulting eccentricity should be considered.
b) The ends of the load bearing stiffener should be closely fitted or adequately
connected to both flanges. They should be shaped to allow space for any
root fillet or weld connecting the web to the flange, with a clearance not
exceeding five times the thickness of the web.
c) Load bearing stiffeners shall not be joggled and shall be solidly packed
throughout.

d) Outstanding legs of each pair of load bearing stiffeners shall be so
proportioned that the bearing stress on that part of their area in contact
with the flange and clear of the root of the flange or flange angles or clear
of the flange welds, does not exceed the design bearing strength.
e) Load bearing stiffeners consisting of two legs shall be designed as struts
assuming the section to consist of the pair of stiffeners together with a
length of web on each side of the centre line of the stiffeners equal to
twenty times the web thickness (but limited to the edge distance of the
web and half the distance of the adjacent stiffener).
In case of bearing stiffeners consisting of four or more legs, the effective
stiffener section should be taken to comprise the stiffeners, the web plate
between the two outer legs and a portion of web plate not exceeding the
length of the web as specified for single leg stiffeners on the outer sides
of the outer legs.
f)
The load bearing stiffeners shall be provided with sufficient rivets, bolts
or welds to transmit to the web the whole of the load in the stiffeners.
g) In no case shall the greater unsupported clear dimension of a web panel
exceed 270 t  nor the lesser unsupported clear dimension of the same
panel exceed 180 t  where t is the thickness of the web plate.
h) Where transverse stiffeners are required, they shall be provided throughout
the length of the girder at a distance apart not greater than 1.5 d1 and not
less than 0.33 d1, where d1 is the depth as defined in clause 509.8.  Where
longitudinal stiffeners are provided d1 shall be taken as the clear distance
between the horizontal stiffener and the farthest flange ignoring fillets.
NOTE :
If the thickness of the web is made greater, or the spacing of stiffener made smaller
than that required by the standard, the moment of inertia of the stiffener need not
be correspondingly increased.
Intermediate transverse stiffeners, when not acting as load bearing stiffeners, may be joggled
and may be single or in pairs placed one on each side of the web. Where single stiffeners
are used, they should preferably be placed alternatively on opposite sides of the web. The
stiffeners shall extend from flange to flange. They can be connected or fitted to, or kept well
clear of the flanges.

511 FATIGUE
511.1
General
This section applies to the design of structures and structural elements subject
to loading which could lead to fatigue failure. This shall, however, not cover the following :
a) Corrosion fatigue

b) Low cycle (high stress) fatigue
c) Thermal fatigue
d) Stress corrosion cracking
e) Effects of high temperature (>150oC)
f)
Effects of low temperature (< brittle transition temperature)
511.1.1
For the purpose of design against fatigue, different details (of members
and connections) are classified under different fatigue class. The design stress ranges
corresponding to various numbers of cycles, are given for each fatigue class. The
requirements of this Clause shall be satisfied with, at each critical location of the
structure subjected to cyclic loading, considering relevant number of cycles and
magnitudes of stress range expected to be experienced during the life of the structure.
511.2
Design
511.2.1
Reference design conditions
The Standard S-N curves for each detail category are given for the following conditions:
a) The detail is located in a redundant load path, wherein local failure at
that detail alone will not lead to overall collapse of the structure.
b) The nominal stress history at the local point in the detail is estimated/
evaluated by a conventional method without taking into account the
local stress concentration effects due to the detail.
c) The load cycles are not highly irregular.
d) The details are accessible for and subject to regular inspection.
e) The structure is exposed to only mildly corrosive environment as in normal
atmospheric condition and suitably protected against corrosion (pit depth
<1 mm).
f)
The transverse fillet or butt weld connects plates of thickness not greater
than 25 mm.
g) As far as possible, holes should preferably be avoided in members and
connections subjected to fatigue.



======================================================================
PAGE 126 of 258
======================================================================
IRC:24-2010
118
Fatigue need not be investigated if condition in Clauses 511.2.2.3, 511.5.1, or 511.6 is
satisfied.
The values obtained from the standard S-N curve shall be modified by a capacity reduction
factor μ r, when plates greater than 25 mm in thickness are joined together by transverse
fillet or butt welding, as given by :
μ r = (25/tp)0.25 ≤1.0
where
tp
= actual thickness in mm of the thicker plate being joined.
No thickness correction is necessary when full penetration butt weld reinforcements are
machined flush and proved free of defect through non-destructive testing.
511.2.2
Design spectrum
511.2.2.1
Stress evaluation - The design stress shall be determined by elastic analysis
of the structure to obtain stress resultants and the local stresses may be obtained by a
conventional stress analysis method. The normal and shear stresses shall be determined
considering all design loads on the members, but excluding stress concentration due to the
geometry of the detail. The stress concentration effect is accounted for in detail category
classification (Table 19). The stress concentration, however, not characteristic of the detail
shall be accounted for separately in the stress calculation.
In the fatigue design of trusses made of members with open sections in which the end
connections are not pinned, the stresses due to secondary bending moments shall be
taken into account unless the slenderness ratio, (KL/r), of the member is greater than 40.
In the determination of stress range at the end connections between hollow sections,
the effect of connection stiffness and eccentricities may be disregarded, provided:
a) The calculated stress range is multiplied by appropriate factor given in
Table 16 in the case of circular hollow section connections and Table 17
in the case of rectangular hollow section connections.
b) The design throat thickness of fillet welds in the joints is greater than the
wall thickness of the connected member.
511.2.2.2
Design stress spectrum - In the case of loading events producing
non-uniform stress range cycle, the stress spectrum may be obtained by a rational method.

Partial safety factors
511.2.3.1
Partial safety factor for loads and their effects (γ fft) - Unless and otherwise
the uncertainty in the estimation of the applied loads and their effects demand a higher value,
the partial safety factor for loads in the evaluation of stress range in fatigue design shall be
taken as 1.0.
511.2.3.2
Partial safety factor for fatigue strength (γ mft) - Partial safety factor for strength
is influenced by consequences of fatigue damage and level of inspection capabilities.
511.2.3.3
Based on consequences of fatigue failure, component details have been
classified as given in the Table 18 and the corresponding partial safety factor for fatigue
strength shall be used.
a) Fail-safe structural component/detail is the one where local failure of one
component due to fatigue crack does not result in the failure of the structure
due to availability of alternative load path (redundant system).
b) Non-fail-safe structural component/detail is the one where local failure of
one component leads rapidly to failure of the structure due to its non-
redundant nature.

512 CONNECTIONS
512.1
General
512.1.1
The term "connection" applies to all joints between different components of a
structural member, joints between separate structural members and splices in members.
The term "fasteners" applies to bolts, rivets and pins.
512.2
Basis of Design
512.2.1
All connections should satisfy the provisions of Clause 512 for the ultimate
limit state.
512.2.2
The fatigue consideration should be in accordance with the recommendations
of Clause 511 of this Code.
512.2.3
The connections in a structure shall be designed so as to be consistent with



======================================================================
PAGE 139 of 258
======================================================================
IRC:24-2010
131
the assumptions made in the analysis of the structure and comply with the requirement
specified in this Clause. Connections shall be capable of transmitting the calculated design
loads and moments communicated by the members.
512.2.4
Where members are connected to the surface of a web or flange of a section,
the ability of the web or flange to transfer the applied forces locally should be checked and
local stiffening provided where necessary.
512.2.5
Ease of fabrication and erection, as also subsequent inspection and
maintenance should be considered in the design of connections.
512.2.6
In general, use of different forms of fasteners to transfer the same force shall
be avoided. However, in any connection which is made with more than one type of fastening,
only rivets and turned and fitted bolts may be considered as acting together to share the
load. In all other connections sufficient number of one type of fastening shall be provided to
transmit the entire load for which the connection is designed.
512.2.7
The partial safety factor in the evaluation of design strength of connections
shall be taken as given in Table 1.
512.3
Alignment of Members
The centroidal axes of members meeting at a joint or at a splice should preferably meet at a
point. When this is not the case, the moment on the connection due to any eccentricity should
be taken into account.
512.4
Welded Connections
512.4.1
Welds shall conform to IS 816 and IS 9595 as appropriate.
512.4.2
Types of welds
The following types of welds can be used :
a) Continuous full penetration or partial penetration butt welds.
b) Continuous or intermittent fillet welds,
c) Plug welds
Intermittent butt welds shall not be used.
Partial penetration butt welds shall not be used for transmitting tensile forces or bending
moments along longitudinal axis of the welds. Plug welds shall not be used for transmitting
loads or moments and shall be used only to prevent the buckling or separation of lapped
parts or to joint components of built-up members.

512.4.3
Strength of weld
512.4.3.1
Butt weld
The strength of a full penetration butt weld shall be taken as equal to the strength of the
weaker of the parts joined provided the yield stress of the weld metal is atleast equal to that
of the parent metal.
The strength of a partial penetration butt weld together with its reinforcing fillet weld, if any,
shall be calculated as for a full penetration fillet weld. The throat thickness shall be taken as
a) the depth of weld preparation where this is of the J or U type.
b) the depth of weld preparation minus 3 mm where the preparation is the V
or bevel type.
512.4.3.2
Fillet weld
The strength of a fillet weld shall be based on the effective throat thickness and the effective
length.
The effective throat thickness shall be considered as the height of a triangle that can be
inscribed within the weld and measured perpendicular to its outer side.
The effective length shall be considered as the actual length minus twice the leg length. In
case of fillet welds with end returns as per Clause 512.4.4.1 the effective length shall be
considered as the actual length.

formation of rust pockets. Where the connection is protected from weather, e.g. in the interior
of box sections, intermittent fillet welds are permitted.

Where two parts connected by welding are separated by packing having thickness less than
the leg length of a weld necessary to transmit the force, the required leg length will be
increased by thickness of the packing.  The packing shall be trimmed flush with the edge of
the part which is to be welded. Where two parts connected by welding are separated by

the same grade of steel but may be of different cross-sections.
2)
Bolted or riveted splices
Where bolted or riveted splice plates are used to obtain a splice
in a flange the sum of their areas shall be at least equal to the
area of the flanges as spliced. The centres of gravity of the
sections on either side of the splice shall coincide as far as
practicable. The splice plates and connections on each side of
the splice shall be capable of transmitting at least the greater
of -

ii)
0.80 times the maximum capacity of the weaker
flange, considering appropriate safety factor
(Table 1), the net section being used for tension
flanges and the gross section for compression flanges.
c) Web splice
A splice in the web of a plate girder or rolled section used as a beam shall
be designed to resist the shearing forces and the portion of the design
moment  in the web, and for the moment due to the eccentricity of shear
introduced by the splice connection, computed from factored loads.
Web plates shall be spliced symmetrically by plates on each side. The
splice plates shall extend as far as practicable for the full depth of the

All members shall, where possible, be so connected that the load is
appropriately distributed over their cross-section.
If this is impracticable, consideration shall be given to the way in which
the stresses at the joint are distributed to those parts of the cross-section
of the member which are not directly connected at the joint. For this purpose
the angle of distribution of stress may be taken as 450.
Gusset plates shall be capable of sustaining 1.05 times the design loads
and moments transmitted by the members. If an unsupported edge of a

type
Such splices shall be made symmetrical about the gravity axes of the
members as far as is practicable.
Bolted/riveted splices shall be designed for any applied moment computed

In bearing type splices in a compression member, the ends of the members
shall be machined and assembled to be in close contact with each other.
For a bearing splice it may be assumed that the machined faces transmit
50 percent of the compressive force in the member. The splice plates
and connection shall be however designed to transmit
60 percent of the factored compressive force in the member and the
factored moment, if any.
NOTE :
Before specifying bearing splices the designer shall, however, satisfy himself that
such facilities for machining are available in the particular project.

thickness of the thinner outside element.
3)
The distance between centres of two consecutive bolts or rivets
in a line along the direction of stress shall not exceed 16t or 200
mm in tension members, and 12t or 200 mm in compression
members. In the case of compression members transferring forces

thinner outside plate.
d) Rivets with counter sunk head
For countersunk rivets, half of the depth of the counter sinking shall be
neglected in calculating the length of the rivet in bearing. As far as possible
rivets in tension shall be avoided. However, when rivets with counter sunk
heads are in tension, the tensile value of the rivets shall be reduced by
331/3 percent. No reduction is needed in shear
e) Long rivets
The grip of rivets carrying calculated loads shall not exceed 8 times the
diameter of the holes.  Where the grip exceeds 6 times the diameter of
the hole, the number of rivets required by normal calculations shall be
increased by not less than half percent for each additional millmetre of

f)
Rivets or bolts through packing
Number of rivets or bolts carrying calculated shear through a packing shall
be increased above the number required by normal calculations by
2.5 percent for each 2 mm thickness of packing, except that, for packing
having a thickness of upto 6 mm, no increase need be made.  For double
shear connections packed on both sides, the number of additional rivets
or bolts required shall be determined from the thickness of the thicker
packing.  The additional rivets or bolts shall be placed in an extension of
the packing.

Bearing type bolts
512.5.5.1
Effective areas of bolts
Since threads can occur in the shear plane, the effective area Aeb for resisting shear should
normally be taken as the net tensile stress area, Anb of the bolts. For bolts where the net
tensile stress area is not defined, Anb shall be taken as the area at the root of the threads.

approved drawings and after a thorough survey of foundations and other related structural
work. In case of work of magnitude, maximum mechanization is to be adopted.
514.5.7
The structure should be divided into modules, as per the scheme. This should
be pre-assembled in a suitable yard/platform and its matching with members of the adjacent
module checked by trial assembly before erection.  Such assembled Girders may be tested
with simulated loads in case of erection on difficult terrain.
514.5.8
The structure shall be set out to the required lines and levels. The steelwork
should be erected, adjusted and completed in the required position to the specified line and
levels with sufficient drifts and bolts. Packing materials are to be available to maintain this
condition. Organized "Quality Surveillance" checks need to be exercised frequently.
514.5.9
The method of erection, as also the drawing of temporary work and the use of
erection equipment, shall be subject to the approval by the Engineer.
514.5.10
Joints
Any connection to be riveted or bolted shall be secured in close contact by service bolts or
specified No. of permanent bolts before final connection. Service bolts are to be fully tightened
and kept as such by torque wrenches when the joint is assembled. Joints shall be made by
filling not less than 50 percent of the holes with service bolts and drifts in the ratio of 4:1.
Connections are to be completed by close tolerance bolts or as specified.
514.5.11
Any connection to be site welded shall be securely held in position by approved
means to ensure accurate alignment, camber and position before welding is commenced.

ANNEX-B
[Clause 504.6.2 (b)]
RULES FOR CAMBERING OPEN WEB GIRDER SPANS
B1.
Preparation of Camber Diagram
B1.1
Contract drawings are dimensioned for the main girder without camber and in order
to ensure that its fabrication and erection shall be such as to eliminate deformation stresses
in the loaded span, a camber diagram shall be prepared on which shall be clearly indicated
the amounts by which the nominal lengths (i.e. the lengths which will not give camber) of
members shall be increased or decreased in order that the outline of the girder under full
load (dead load & 75 percent live load without impact), shall be the nominal outline.  A further
change as indicated in clause B1.4 may be made when the outline of the girder shall be
normal outline, enlarged (1 + K) times in the case of a through span and reduced (1 - K)
times in the case of a deck span (See clause B1.4 below for definition of K).
B1.2
The stress camber change in each member shall be equal to the change of length of
member due to the above loading, but of opposite sign.
B1.3
For the purpose of calculating the change in length of members under stress, the
modulus of elasticity for both high tensile and mild steel shall be taken as specified in Clause
502.2.4.1. The effective length shall be taken between the theoretical intersection points of
adjacent members.
B1.4
To ensure that the length of the floor system of a span shall be constructed to its
nominal dimensions, i.e., to avoid changes in lengths of floor and loaded chord lateral system
a further change in length shall be made in the lengths of all members equal to :
Loaded chord extension or contraction
x length of member  = K x L
Loaded chord length
In through spans this change will be an increase in the lengths of all members while in the
case of deck spans it will be a decrease in the lengths of all members.
B1.5
The nominal girder lengths altered in accordance with clauses B1.1 and B1.4 give a
girder correctly stress cambered but with the loaded chord length identical with that shown
on the contract drawings, thus requiring no modifications to floor and loaded chord lateral
systems.
B1.6
The nominal lengths and camber lengths shall be rounded off to the nearest half a
millimeter.



======================================================================
PAGE 182 of 258
======================================================================
IRC:24-2010
174
B1.7
The difference between nominal lengths and camber lengths thus modified is the
practical camber changes.
B1.8
The ordinates corresponding to the required camber at nodes may be obtained either
by drawing a Williot Mohr Diagram or any other acceptable method.
B1.9
Adjustments of the lengths shall be made to top lateral bracing members to suit
camber lengths of the top chords in the case of through girder spans and to the bottom
lateral bracing members in the case of deck spans. The average value of the cambered
length of top or bottom lateral member, as the case may be, shall be adopted throughout.
B2.
Fabrication
B2.1
The actual manufactured lengths of the members are to be the lengths "with camber"
given on the camber diagram.
B2.2
The positions and angular setting out lines of all connection holes in the main gussets
and also the positions of the connection holes in the chord joints and the machining of the
ends shall be exactly as shown on the contract drawings. This will permit the butts in the
chord segments to be exactly as shown on the contract drawings.
B2.3
The groups of connection holes at the ends of all the members are to be as shown on
the contract drawings, i.e., without any allowance for camber but the distance between the
groups at the ends of each member shall be altered by the amount of the camber allowance
in the member.
B3.
Erection
B3.1
The joints of the chords shall be drifted, bolted and preferably riveted to their geometric
outline.
B3.2
All other members are to be elastically strained into position by external forces, so
that as many holes as possible are fair when filled with rivets.
B3.3
Drifting of joints shall be avoided as far as possible, and when necessary, should be
done with great care and under close expert supervision. Hammers not exceeding one kg. in
weight should be used with turned barrel drifts and a number of holes drifted simultaneously,
the effect of the drifting being checked by observation of adjacent unfilled holes.
B3.4
The first procedure during erection consists of placing camber jacks in position on
which to support the structure. The camber jacks should be set with their tops level and with
sufficient run out to allow for lowering of panel points except the centre by the necessary
amounts to produce the required camber in the main girders. It is essential that the camber
is accurately maintained throughout the process of erection and it should be constantly



======================================================================

checked. The jacks shall be spaced so that they will support the ends of the main girders and
the panel points. The bottom chord members shall then be placed on the camber jacks,
carefully leveled and checked for straightness and the joints made and riveted up.
B3.5
The vertical and diagonal web members, except the posts, shall then be erected in
their proper positions on the bottom chords. It is recommended that temporary top gussets,
the positions of the holes in which are corrected for the camber change of length in the
members, should be used to connect the top ends of the members; this will ensure that the
angles between the members at the bottom joints are as given by the nominal outline of the
girders. The vertical and diagonal shall then be riveted to the lower chords.
B3.6
All panel points, except the centre, shall now be lowered by amounts to produce the
correct camber in the main girders as shown on the camber diagram.
B3.7
The top chord should be erected piece by piece working symmetrically from the
centre outwards, and the joint made by straining the members meeting at the joint and bringing
the holes into correct registration.
B3.8
The temporary gussets, if used, shall be replaced by the permanent gussets in the
same sequence as the erection of the top boom members.
B3.9
The end posts shall be erected last. The upper end connection should preferably be
made first and if there is no splice in the end raker, the final closure made at the bottom end
connection. If there is a splice, the final closure should be made at the splice.
B3.10
When cantilever method of erection is used, the above procedure does not apply.

ANNEX-D
DURABILITY
D1.
General
A durable steel structure is one that performs satisfactorily the desired function in the working
environment under the anticipated exposure condition during its service life, without
deterioration of the cross sectional area and loss of the strength due to corrosion. The material
used, the detailing, fabrication, erection and surface protection measures should all address
the corrosion reduction and durability requirements.
D2.
Requirements for Durability
D2.1
Shape, size, orientation of members, connections and details
The design, fabrication and erection details of exposed structures should be such that good
drainage of water is ensured. Standing pool of water, moisture accumulation and rundown of
water for extended duration are to be avoided.
The details of connections should ensure that
a)
All exposed surfaces are easily accessible for inspection and maintenance.
b)
All surfaces not so easily accessible are completely sealed against ingress of
moisture.
D2.2
Exposure condition
D2.2.1 General environment - The general environment, to which steel structure is exposed
during its working life, is classified into five levels of severity, as given in Table D.1.
D2.2.2 Abrasion - Specialist literature may be referred for durability of surfaces exposed to
abrasive action.
D2.2.3 Exposure to sulphate attack
Appropriate coatings may be used when surfaces of structural steel are exposed to
concentration of sulphates (SO3) in soil, ground water etc.
When exposed to very high sulphate concentrations, of more than 2 percent in soil and
5 percent in water, some form of lining such as polyethylene, polychloroprene sheet, or surface
coating based on asphalt, chlorinated rubber, epoxy or polymethane material should be used
to completely avoid access of the solution to the steel surface.

183
D2.4.
Surface Protection
D2.4.1 In the case of mild exposure, a coat of primer after removal of any loose mill scale
may be adequate. As the exposure condition becomes more critical more elaborate surface
preparations and coatings become necessary.  In case of extreme environmental
classification, protection shall be as per specialist literature. Table D-2 gives guidance to
protection of steelwork for different desired lives.
D2.4.2 Steel surfaces shall be provided with atleast one coat of primer immediately after its
surface preparations, such as sand blasting to remove all mill scale and rust to expose steel.
D2.4.3 Steel without protective coating shall not be stored for long duration in out door
environment.
D2.4.4 Surfaces to transfer forces by friction as in HSFG connections shall not be painted.
However it shall be ensured that moisture is not trapped on such surfaces after pretensioning
of bolts by proper protective measures.
D2.4.5 Member to be assembled by welding shall not be prepainted at the adjacent to the
location of such welds.  However, after welding appropriate protective coatings shall be
applied in the region as required by the exposure conditions.  If the contact surfaces cannot
be properly protected against ingress of moisture by surface coating, they may be completely
sealed by appropriate welds.
D2.4.6 Prepainted members shall be protected against abrasion of the coating during
transportation, handling and erection.
D2.5
Special steels - Steels with special alloying elements and production process to
obtain better corrosion resistance may be used as per Specialist literature.

POST - CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION
AND PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE GUIDELINES
E1.
General
Bridge structures, permanently exposed to atmosphere are subjected to effect of adverse
environmental conditions. Investment made in the structural facility can be protected by well
programmed, monitored-inspection and maintenance schedule adopted for its designed
life. Such systems ensure structural safety by recording the state of the structure periodically
and providing feed back information to designers while identifying actual and potential sources
of trouble and taking remedial measures in time.
This section lays down the desired inspection procedure for determining physical condition
and programming maintenance needs of the bridges. Systematic periodical inspection
required for various elements and the responsibilities of the inspection group have been
specified. The scope of maintenance work involved does not include correcting measures
for known deviations introduced during construction stage and no attempt has been made in
this direction. It is necessary to understand that, for proper inspection of various components
of the bridge structure in-built facilities should be developed at the detailing and construction
stage, for accessibility to important areas.
E2.
Inspection
Bridge inspection is done by use of well tried and established techniques required for
assessing the physical condition of the structure. IRC Special Publication 35 : "Guidelines
for inspection and maintenance of bridges" may be referred in this connection.
E2.1
Personnel
E2.1.1 The in-charge for bridge inspection and reporting shall posses the following
qualifications :
a)
Be a qualified engineer or equivalent with adequate experience in Bridge
Inspection
or
b)
Have a minimum of 10 years experience in bridge inspection assignments in a
responsible capacity.
E2.1.2 He/she shall be responsible for a methodical and thorough field inspection, the
detailed analysis of all observations recorded, arrive at findings to recommend rectification
of defects, imposition of speed restriction or load limitations and any other measures as
necessary.



======================================================================
PAGE 196 of 258
======================================================================
IRC:24-2010
188
E2.1.3 The problems encountered in this work are varied and complex; as such matured
judgment is often required for evaluation of the recordings.
E2.1.4 He/She must be thoroughly familiar with design and construction features of the bridge
so as to make a correct interpretation and be capable of determining the safe load carrying
capacity of the existing structure. He should be capable of recognising any deficiency in the
structure, assess the seriousness and suggest appropriate remedial measures to ensure
safety. His experience and knowledge to recognise problem areas (actual and potential)
and to ensure preventive maintenance is an important requisite.
E2.1.5 He/She should be able to utilise the expert knowledge and skills of associate
engineers in respect of structural design, construction methods, material, hydro dynamics,
equipment, soil technology, maintenance methods for permanent and emergency measures
etc. and should have access to resources and expert systems.
E2.1.6 Definite guidelines should be given to ensure availability of technical assistance
from other agencies/ where regular staff is not available. In case of specialised structure
consultation with expert bodies is a necessity.
E3.
Training
Bridge management requires extensive team work involving various levels of responsibility
and skills. Training programmes need be framed in order to develop expertise. Training
facilities may be set up at central level for training of trainees and at local level for actual
imparting training to field staff. Workshop on topical interest may be held regularly to acquaint
the concerned people with accepted technical methods and their correct application.
E4.
Frequency of Inspection
E4.1
Detailed inspection
E4.1.1 The details and frequency to which Bridges are to be inspected will depend on such
factors as age, traffic characteristics, state of the structure and vulnerability and known history
of deteriorating condition. Evaluation of these factors will be the responsibility of the individual
in-charge of the inspection programme.
E4.1.2 Each bridge has to be inspected in detail at regular intervals not exceeding 5 years.
E4.2
Periodic routine inspection
Certain items in each bridge have to be inspected at definite intervals of time, at least once
a year, irrespective of whether anything alarming has taken place or not.

Inspection Procedure
E5.1
General
E5.1.1 The field inspection of a bridge should be conducted in a systematic and organised
manner and observation recorded on a format to ensure that no item is overlooked. Notes
must be clear and detailed to the extent that they can be interpreted at a later date when



======================================================================
PAGE 198 of 258
======================================================================
IRC:24-2010
190
report is prepared. Sketches and photographs should be included in an effort to record actual
conditions.
E5.1.2 As far as possible the inspecting officer should schedule bridge inspection in those
periods of the year which offer the most favourable conditions. Inspections during temperature
extremes should be made at bearing, joints etc. Inspection should not be confined only to
search for defects which exist, but for conditions of anticipatory nature and marking those
zones. Preventive maintenance is equally important to corrective ones.
E5.2
Inspection items
Inspection of all items such as approaches, waterways, basic floor conditions, substructure
which may affect the safety of the steel superstructure need be done like other types of
bridges.
E6.
Main Structure
E6.1
Steel girders and stringers in the deck structure should be examined for signs of
corrosion, cracks along the flanges around rivet or bolt heads, its contact surfaces and where
water enters and stands or debris may collect at the ends.
E6.2
Flanges and webs shall be checked for any damage or misalignment. Web-stiffeners
are to be examined for signs of deformation due to buckling. Unusual vibration or excessive
deflection under passage of heavy loads should be noted and cause investigated.
E6.3
All end connections should be inspected to make sure that they are secure.
E6.4
Weld areas should be inspected to check crack. Special care should be exercised
to inspect corners, curved, sections and areas where there is an abrupt change in the size of
metal or in configuration which may produce an area of concentrated stress or in areas
where vibration or movement could produce stress concentration. Damages or deformation
caused to the main-structural members due to vehicular impact should be particularly watched.
Fatigue failure in welded joints being a cause of concern in bridge structures with age such
structures need more careful check and watch.
E6.5
Creep - The longitudinal movement of a girder is termed as creep. This point should
be checked and girders pulled back if necessary to the proper position.
E6.6
Distortion- With variation of temperature, the girder is likely to have longitudinal
movement due to expansion and contraction. Absolute freedom of movement is impracticable
and there remains a residual force which develops internal stresses, causing tendency to
distort.



======================================================================
PAGE 199 of 258
======================================================================
IRC:24-2010
191
E6.7
Lateral bracing
Normally a span of a bridge consists of two or more girders braced together with lateral
bracings. These bracings should be thoroughly checked for corrosion on loose rivets and
deformity viz. bracing distortion etc.
E6.8
Loose rivets
Rivets are to be examined for looseness. This is caused due to running traffic and consequent
vibratory effect and corrosion around the rivets. A joint with loose rivets should not be touched
unless more than 20 percent rivets in the joint are loose.
E6.9
Bearings
E6.9.1 All bearing devices should be examined to ascertain that they are functioning properly.
Changes in other parts of the structure such as piers/abutments settlement and tilt may be
reflected in the bearings. Bearings should be seated properly on their bed plates and provided
with gaps at both ends. Bearing assembly should be checked for possible cracks by
magnifying glass after removal of paint cover in doubtful cases. In case of roller bearing, the
relative position of the top castings, bottom castings and rollers and variation due to the
temperature shall be noted. Longitudinal movement of the free-end shall be recorded under
moving load. After unusual occurrences bearings and support pads must be examined for
cracks, etc. Lateral shear keys in skew bridges also need special check.
E6.9.2 Lubrication of bearings
Oiling and greasing of the bearings is done periodically once in 3 years. Improper and failure
in timely lubrication may lead to corrosion of bearings, resulting in reduction in strength and
consequent damages.
Where bearings are encased in oil baths and stay submerged in recommended brand of
lubricating oil the level of oil should be maintained by checking every year.  It should be
ensured that the oil baths are always sealed.
E6.9.3 Elastomeric bearings
The physical conditions of elastomeric bearing pads should be inspected for observing any
abnormal flattening, bulging or splitting which may indicate overloading or excessive unequal
distribution of loading, Shifting from original position should be checked particularly.
E6.9.4 Condition of bed-block & H.D. Bolts
Bed blocks receive the full load from the bearings of the bridge and distribute  and transmit



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:24-2010
192
the same to the masonry below. Restriction of free movement in superstructure may result
in:
1)
Development of transverse cracks in piers/abutments
2)
Failure of bed blocks joints leading to shaking bed blocks
3)
Shearing of holding down bolts (Particular importance due to introduction of
greater longitudinal forces)
It must be ensured that the anchor bolts are well secured.
E7.
Trusses
E7.1
Camber of the trusses should be checked and the ambient temperature recorded at
the time of detailed inspection. A camber diagram should be made in the inspection register.
Loss of camber may be assessed from comparative readings.
E7.2
All truss members should be checked. The compression members should be checked
for straightness absence of kink or bows and the connections are undisturbed. (Tension
members should not show signs of cracking).
E7.3.1 The truss should be checked against damage due to collision with vehicular traffic;
portal bracings and sway bracings are usually the most restrictive to overload movements
and consequently susceptible to damage.
E7.3.2 The condition of pins at the connections and rivets, bolts should be checked to see
that none are loose, worn-out or sheared. Particular care to be given to following locations :
a)
Connections of stringers to cross girders
b)
Connections of cross girder to main girder
c)
End connection of bracings
d)
Chord joints & web-member connection
E8.
Corrosion and Painting
Steel structure is sensitive to the atmospheric moisture and vehicular smoke and therefore
should be protected by paints or anti-corrosive measures. The condition of the members
should be examined and the extent of corrosion recorded. The portions of steel work where
water is likely to stagnate or which are subjected to alternate wetting or drying need special
care. Deformation in riveted or bolted multiple sections should be examined to check if
moisture has entered and corroded the contact surfaces of the plates causing them to be
pushed apart. The exact location and area of the affected portion should be recorded. This



======================================================================
PAGE 201 of 258
======================================================================
IRC:24-2010
193
area should be got cleaned, thoroughly scraped, old paint, rust, scaling removed and repainted
and appropriate remedial measures taken up immediately.
E9.
Decks
E9.1
Steel decks should be checked for corrosion and unsound welds. It is important to
maintain an impervious surface over a steel plate deck to protect against corrosion in
aggressive environmental condition.
E9.2
It is necessary to have effective drain holes to prevent collection of water on the
deck.
E10.
Expansion Joints
E10.1
Maintenance of these joints need special attention and should be carefully examined.
The joint should be clear of debris and be able to have free thermal expansion as designed.
E10.2
Finger type joints and sliding plate joints should be checked for loose anchorage,
cracking or separation of welds or other defects. Such defects cause structural deformation
and is hazardous to traffic. Deck adjacent to expansion joints should be carefully examined
for voids and cracks. Underside of expansion joints also need careful inspection. Systematic
documentation of the movement of expansion joints need to be kept to judge proper functioning
of the bridge structure.
E11.
Railings and Safety Barriers
E11.1
Handrails are to be examined for unusual damage, deformation, corrosion and
paintings. The embedment of posts to be checked for rust stains, which are signs of rusting.
Extent of corrosion need to be checked when signs exist on the surface.
E11.2
All handrails are to be checked for any damage for traffic. The vertical and horizontal
alignment are to be maintained.
E12.
Services
The number and types of utilities, such as pipelines, cables etc. must be inspected and
observations kept for record with the details suitably displayed. Special care need be kept
for hazardous utilities, Regular joint inspection in such case with suitable guidelines is a
necessity.
E13.
Special Structures
E13.1
Moveable bridges
The most common type of moveable bridge are the swing span, vertical lift Bascule



======================================================================

IRC:24-2010
194
(Single or double leaf). Inspection of the trusses, floor system, and other structural
elements will require inspection procedures suitably modified as per guidelines
mentioned in the Code. Ensuring proper seating of the girder after operation is an
absolute necessity.
E13.2
In case of other structures like suspension Bridges, Cable stayed Bridges detailed
inspection manuals should be prepared and staff trained to observe the same.
E14.
Documentation
E14.1 The most important function of bridge maintenance unit is to prepare a complete,
methodical and current record for each bridge on the system. Much of the usefulness
of the information obtained from field investigation depend upon its reliability and
availability on a concise format. The record must be preserved systematically and
readily available.
E14.2
Records should provide a full history of the structure including all recommendations
for strengthening and restoration works undertaken and the behaviour of the structure
thereafter. This record should indicate clearly the load carrying capacity of the structure with
supporting document showing calculations.
E14.3
Complete record in an usable format is vital for the continued service ability of the
bridge. It is essential that computerised data system is introduced as soon as practicable.
E14.4
A sample record sheet is shown in Table E-1.
E15.
Standard Tools
A list of standard tools required for inspection is given in Table E-2 as guide.
E16.
Signs
E16.1 All signs required to indicate restrictive load limit, reduced speed or impaired
clearance should be inspected to ascertain they are visible and located in proper
places. This inspection is to include sign at or on the structure and any advance warning
sign. Examination should include that indications are legible and sign posts are well
secured.
E16.2
For bridges over navigable, channels, it is necessary to inspect if the navigational
signs for water-traffic are in place and secured. Navigational lights and serial obstructional
lights should be inspected often to ensure that these are operating efficiently.
E17.

ANNEX-F
DESIGN ASSISTED BY TESTING
F1.
Need for Testing
Testing of structures, members or components of structures is not required when designed
in accordance with this standard. Test may be accepted as an alternative to calculation or
may become necessary in special circumstances.
Testing on of a structural system, member or component may be required to assist the design
in the following cases:
a)
When the calculation methods available are not adequate for the design of a
particular structure, member or component, testing shall be undertaken in place
of design by calculation or to supplement the design by calculation;
b)
Where rules or methods for design by calculation would lead to uneconomical
design, experimental verification may be undertaken to avoid conservative
design;
c)
When the design or construction is not entirely in accordance with sections of
this standard, experimental verification is recommended;
d)
When confirmation is required on the consistency of production of material,
components, members or structures originally designed by calculations or
testing;
e)
When the actual performance of an existing structure capacity is in question,
testing shall be used to confirm it;
F1.1
Testing of structural system, member or component shall be of the following categories :
a)
Proof testing - The application of test loads to a structure,
sub-structure member or  connection to ascertain the structural characteristics
of only that specific unit.
b)
Prototype testing - Testing of structures, sub-structures, members or
connections is done to ascertain the structural characteristics of a class of such
structures, sub-structures members or connection, which are nominally identical
to the units tested.
F2.
Types of Test
F2.1
Acceptance test - This is intended as a non-destructive test for confirming structural
performance. It should be recognized that the loading applied to certain structures might



======================================================================
PAGE 205 of 258
======================================================================
IRC:24-2010
197
cause permanent distortions. Such effects do not necessarily indicate structural failure in
acceptance test. However, the possibility of their occurrence should be agreed to before
testing.
The load for acceptance test  Ftest,a shall be determined from Ftest,a = (1.0 x self weight) + (1.15
x remainder of the permanent load) + (1.25 x variable load).
The assembly shall satisfy the following criteria:
a)
It shall demonstrate substantially linear behaviour under test loading.
b)
On removal of the test load, the residual deflection should not exceed 20 percent
of the maximum-recorded deflection.
If the above criteria are not satisfied the test may be repeated one more time only, when the
assembly shall satisfy the following criteria :
a)
It shall demonstrate substantially linear behaviour on this second application of
test loading.
b)
The corresponding recorded residual deflection in the second test shall not
exceed 10 percent of the maximum deflection during the test.
F2.2
Strength test - Strength test is used to confirm the calculated resistance of a structure
or component. Where a number of items are to be constructed to a common design, and one
or more prototypes are tested to confirm their strength, the others may be accepted without
any additional test, provided they are similar in all relevant respects to the prototype.
Before carrying out the strength test, the specimen should first be subjected to and satisfy
the acceptance test. Since the resistance of the assembly under test depends on the material
properties, the actual yield strength of all the steel materials in the assembly shall be
determined from coupon tests (test piece as defined in IS 1608). The mean value of the yield
strength, fym, taken from such tests shall be determined with due regard to the importance of
each element in the assembly.
The strength test load Ftest,s (including self weight) shall be determined from
Ftest, s = γ mi Fd (fym / fy)
where
fy
= characteristic yield stress of the material as assumed in the design
Fd
= factored design load for the ultimate limit state, and
γ mi
= partial safety factor for the type of failure, as prescribed in this
Standard  Specification



======================================================================
PAGE 206 of 258
======================================================================
IRC:24-2010
198
At this load there shall be no failure by buckling or rupture of any part of the Standard structure
or component tested. On removal of the test load, the deflection should decrease by at least
20 percent of the maximum deflection at Ftest.s.
F2.3
Test to failure (ultimate strength test) - The objective of a test to failure is to determine
the design resistance from the ultimate resistance. In this situation it is still desirable to carry
out the acceptance and strength tests, before test to failure.
Not less than three test shall be carried out on nominally identical specimens An estimate
should be made of the anticipated ultimate resistance as a basis for such tests. During a
test to failure, the loading shall first be applied in increments upto the strength test load.
Subsequent load increments shall then be determined from consideration of the principal
load deflection plot. The test load resistance, Ftests R shall be determined as that load at
which the specimen is unable to sustain any further increase in load. At this load, gross
permanent distortion is likely to have occurred and in some cases such large gross
deformation may define the test limit. If the deviation of any individual test result exceeds
10 percent, of the mean value obtained for all the three tests, atleast three more tests
shall be carried out. When the deviation from the mean does not exceed 10 percent of
the mean, the design resistance may be evaluated as given below:
a)
When the failure is ductile, the design resistance, Fd, may be determined from
Fd = 0.9 Ftest.min (fy / fym) / γ m0
where
Ftest.min = minimum test result from the tests to failure
fym
= average yield strength as obtained from the material tests
fy
= characteristic yield stress of the grade of steel
b)
In the case of a sudden (brittle) rupture type failure, the design resistance may
be determined from :
Fd = 0.9 Ftest.min (fu / fum) / γ m0
where
fu
= characteristic ultimate stress of the grade of steel used
fum
= average ultimate tensile strength of the material obtained
from tests



======================================================================
PAGE 207 of 258
======================================================================
IRC:24-2010
199
c)
In the case of a sudden ("brittle") buckling type failure, the design resistance
shall be determined from :
Fd = 0.75 Ftest.min (fy / fym) / γ m0
d)
In ductile buckling type failure in which the relevant slenderness   can be reliably
assessed, the design resistance may be determined from:
Fd = 0.9 Ftest.min ( χ fy / χ m fym) / γ m0
where
χ
= reduction factor for the relevant buckling curve
χ m
= value of χ  when the yield strength is fym
F2.4
Check tests - Where a component or assembly is designed on the basis of strength
tests or tests to failure and a production run is carried out of such items, an appropriate
number of samples (not less than two) shall be selected from each production batch at random
for check tests.
F2.4.1 The samples should be carefully examined to ensure that they are similar in all respects
to the prototype tests, particular attention being given to the following:
a)
Dimensions of components and connections
b)
Tolerance and workmanship
c)
Quality of steel used, checked with reference to mill certificates
F2.4.2 Where it is not possible to determine either the variations or the effect of variations
from the prototype, an acceptance test shall be carried out as a check test.
F 2.4.3 In this check test, the deflections shall be measured at the same positions as in the
acceptance test of the prototype. The maximum measured deflection shall not exceed 120
percent of the deflection recorded during the acceptance test on the prototype and the residual
deflection should not be more than 105 percent of that recorded for the prototype.
F3.
Test Conditions
a)
Loading and measuring devices shall be calibrated in advance
b)
The design of the test rig shall be such that
i)
The loading system adequately simulates the magnitude and distribution
of the loading.
ii)
It allows the specimen to perform in a manner representative of service
conditions,



======================================================================

iii)
Lateral and torsional restraint, if any should be representative of those in
service,
iv)
The specimen should be free to deflect under load as per the service
condition,
v)
The loading system shall be able to follow the movements of the specimen
without interruption or abnormal restraints.
vi)
Inadvertent eccentricities at the point of application of the test loads and
at the supports are avoided
c)
The test load shall be applied to the unit at a rate as uniform as practicable.
d)
Deflections should be measured at sufficient points of high movements to ensure
that the maximum value is determined.
e)
If the magnitude of stresses in a specimen is to be determined, the strain at the
desired location may be measured and the corresponding stress calculated.
f)
Prior to any test, preliminary loading (not exceeding the characteristic values
of the relevant loads) may be applied and then removed, in order to set the test
specimen on to the test rig.
F4.
Test Loading
F4.1
Where the self-weight of the specimen is not representative of the actual permanent
load in service, allowance for the difference shall be made in the calculation of test loads to
be applied.
F4.2
On the attainment of maximum load for either acceptance or strength tests, this load
shall be maintained for at least 1 hour. Reading of load and deflection shall be taken at
intervals of 15 minutes and the loading shall be maintained constant until there is no significant
increase in deflection during a 15 minutes period or until at least 1 hour has elapsed.
F4.3
The test load shall be equal to the design load for the relevant limit state in proof
testing.
F4.4
The test load in prototype testing shall be equal to the design load for the relevant
limit state as multiplied by the appropriate factor given in Table F.1.
F5.
Criteria for Acceptance
F5.1
Acceptance for strength - The test structure, sub-structure, member or connection
shall be deemed to comply with the requirements for strength if it is able to sustain the strength
test load for atleast 15 minutes.

ANNEX-G
WORKING STRESS DESIGN
(Based on IRC:24-2001)
G1.
General
In this method structural members are designed so that the unit stress caused by the design
loads does not exceed a pre-defined permissible stress. The permissible stress is defined
as the yield stress multiplied by a factor of safety. This factor of safety caters for the
uncertainties in loads, material strength, behaviour of the structure, corrosion,
fatigue etc.
In the working stress method, apart from structural strength, serviceability requirements such
as deflection etc also need to be considered and properly checked.
G2.
Loads and Stresses
G2.1
Combinations
G2.1.1
Main effects
For the purpose of computing stresses, the classifications (column 1) and combinations
(column 2) as given in Table G.1 will be followed. For legend of symbols under Combination
(column 2) refer to Clause 202.1 of IRC:6.
G2.1.2
Other effects
G2.1.2.1
Secondary Effects (Fs) shall include, where applicable, the effects due to creep
and shrinkage of concrete for composite deck and warping for box girder sections.
G2.1.2.2
Erection effects shall include the loads and forces arising out of construction
equipment and the effects of wind/ seismic.
G2.2
Permissible increase in stress
G2.2.1
Increase
The permissible increase (percent) in stress in the various members covered by this code
due to combination stated in Clause G2.1 shall be as given under Increase (column 3) of

G2.7
Stress Analysis
G2.7.1
General
The global analysis of the structure should be done using an elastic method. For structures in
which the load effects are not proportional to the loads and/or the secondary effects due to
deformation are significant, the method  of analysis should be suitable for treatment of non-
linear behaviour.
G2.7.2
Sectional properties
The sectional properties to be used in global analysis should generally be calculated for
the gross section assuming the specified sizes. For beams or trusses on  flexible supports
account should however be taken of its influence of shear lag on their stiffenesses. The
effect of shear lag should also be taken into account in analysis of conditions during
erection of continuous girders of box construction or with integral decks.
G2.7.3
Longitudinal stresses in beams
The distribution of longitudinal stress between the flanges and web or webs of a beam may
be calculated on the assumption that plane section remains plane, but using effective widths
of the flanges and the effective thickness of a deep web in accordance with the provisions of
Clause G4, no further account need be taken of deformation of the plate out of its plane.
G2.7.4
Shear stress
The design values of shear stress in webs of rolled or fabricated I, box or channel sections
may be calculated in accordance with the provisions of Clause G4. Shear stresses in other
sections should be computed from the whole cross-section having regard to the distribution
of flexural stress across the section.
G2.8
Stresses
G2.8.1
Primary stresses
In the design of triangulated structures, axial stresses in members are usually calculated on
the assumption that :
-
all members are straight and free to rotate at the joints;
-
all joints lie at the intersection of the centroidal axes of the members
-
all loads, including the weight of the members, are applied at the
joints.
These stresses are defined as primary stresses.



======================================================================
PAGE 217 of 258
======================================================================
IRC:24-2010
209
G2.8.2
Secondary stresses
In practice these assumptions are not realised and consequently members are subjected
not only to axial stress but also to bending and shear stresses. These stresses are defined
as secondary stresses and fall into two groups :
i)
Stresses which are the result of eccentricity of connections and off-joint
loading generally (i.e. loads rolling directly on chords, self weight of
member and wind loads on member)
ii)
Stresses which are the result of the elastic deformation of the structure
and the rigidity of the joints. These are known as deformation stresses.
G2.8.2.1
Structures shall be designed, fabricated and erected in such a manner as  to
minimise as far as possible secondary stresses.
G2.8.2.2
Secondary stresses which are the result of eccentricity of connections and of
off-joint loading [under Clause G2.8.2 (i) above], shall be computed and combined with the
coexistent axial stresses in accordance with appropriate clause, but secondary stress due
to the self weight and wind on the member shall be ignored in this case.
NOTE :
In computing the secondary stress due to loads being carried direct by a chord, the
chord may be assumed to be a continuous girder supported at the panel points, the
resulting bending moments, both at the centre and at the supports being taken as
equal to 3/4 of the maximum bending moment in a simply supported beam of span
equal to the panel length. Where desired, calculations  may be made and the
calculated bending moments may be taken. In computing such bending moments,
the impact allowances shall be based on a loaded length equal to one panel length.
G2.8.2.3
Secondary stresses which are the result of the elastic deformation of the structure
(under Clause G2.8.2 (ii) above) shall be either computed or assumed in accordance with
Clause G2.8.3 below and combined with the coexistent axial stresses.
G2.8.3
Deformation stresses
In order to minimize the deformation stresses in girder, the ratio of the width of the members
in the plane of distortion to their length between centre  of intersections shall preferably be
not greater than 1/12 of the chord members and 1/24 of  web members. In the absence of
calculations the deformation stresses shall be assumed to be not less than 16
2
3  percent of
the dead load and live load stresses including impact.
G2.8.3.1
All open web girders of effective spans greater than 50 m may properly be
cambered. Recommended procedure for cambering such girders is given in Annex–B.  For
such girders, deformation stresses (under Clause G2.8.3) above may be ignored.

Design of Beams

cross-section with the neutral axis taken at the centroid of that section. In computing the
maximum stresses, the stresses calculated on this basis shall be increased in the ratio of
the gross to the effective area of the flange section. For this purpose the flange sectional
area in riveted or bolted construction shall be taken to be that of the flange plates, flange
angles and the portion of the web and side plates, if any, between the flange angles. In
welded construction, the flange sectional area shall be taken to be that of flange plates and
of the tongue plates (i.e. the thick vertical plates connecting flange to web) if any, upto a
depth of the tongue plate equal to eight times its thickness, which shall not be less than twice

G4.4.3
Beams with laterally supported compression flanges
When a compression flange is provided with effective discrete lateral restraints effective
length l should be taken as the greatest distance centre-to-centre  of restraint members
between a restraint and a support. Where such restraint is provided by interconnecting
bracing, consideration should be given to the possibility of lateral instability of the combined
cross-section.
G4.4.4
Cantilever beams without intermediate lateral support
When a cantilever beam is not provided with lateral support between its support and tip, l
may be taken from Table G.4 where L is the length of cantilever.

G4.7.2
Average shear stress
The average shear stress in a member calculated on the cross section of the web shall not
exceed the maximum permissible average shear stress τ vaas follows :-
a)
For unstiffened webs : appropriate permissible stress in Table. G.2
b)
For stiffended webs : the values given in Tables G.9, G.10 and G.11 as
appropriate yield stress values 250, 340 and 400 MPa respectively.
NOTE :
The allowable stresses given in Tables G.9, G.10 and G 11 apply provided any
reduction of the web cross-section is due only to rivet/bolt holes etc. where large
apertures are cut in the web, a special analysis shall be made to ensure that the
maximum permissible average shear stresses laid down in this standard are not
exceeded.
G4.8
Curtailment of Flange Plates
Each flange plate shall be extended beyond its theoretical cut-off point adequately. The
extension shall contain sufficient rivets, bolts and welds to withstand  the forces developed at
the theoretical cut off point.
In welded construction, the use of curtailed flange plates shall be avoided as far as possible,
local strengthening being provided by other means such as inserting by butt welding a
thicker and or wider plate. The heavier section plate shall be suitably tapered to the lighter
plate. If, in welded construction the use of curtailed flange plates cannot be avoided, the
end of the plate shall be tapered in plan to a rounded end and all welds shall be continuous
round the ends.
G4.9
Connection of Flanges to Web
The flanges of plate girders shall be connected to the web by sufficient rivets, bolts or welds
to transmit the horizontal shear force combined  with any vertical loads which are directly
applied to the flange. In welded construction, where the web is in close contact with the
flange before welding,  vertical loads causing compression may be deemed to be resisted
by the bearing between the flange and the web.
G4.10
Dispersion of Load through Flange to Web
Where a load is directly applied to a flange, it shall be considered as dispersed uniformly
through the flange and the web at an angle of 45º.

For single angle discontinuous struts connected to gussets or to a section either
by riveting or bolting by not less than two rivets or bolts in line along the angle at each end, or
by their equivalent in welding, the eccentricity of the connection with respect to the centroid
of the strut may be ignored and the strut designed as an axially loaded member

For single angle discontinuous struts intersected by, and effectively connected
to another angle  in cross bracing, the effective length in the plane of bracings shall be taken
as in Table G.13 and normal to the plane of bracing the effective lengths shall be taken as

of the main member. In calculating the ratio of slenderness, the radius of gyration about the

Effective length of unbraced compression chords
For simply supported trusses with ends restrained at the bearings against torsion, the effective
length l of the compression chord for buckling normal to the plane of the truss shall be taken
as follows :
a)
With no lateral support to compression chord; where there is no lateral
bracing between compression chords and no cross frames:
l = span
b)
With compression chords supported by U frames, where there is no lateral
bracing of the compression chord but where cross members and verticals
forming U frames provide lateral restraints:
l = 2.5 x 4 EIaδ
but not less than "a"
where
E
= Young's modulus
I
= maximum moment of inertia of compression chord about the axis lying in the
plane of the truss.
a
= distance between frames, and
δ
= the virtual lateral displacement of the compression chord at the frame nearest
mid span of the truss, taken as the horizontal deflection. This deflection shall
be computed assuming that the cross member is free to deflect vertically
and that the tangent to the deflection curve at the centre of its span remains
parallel to the neutral axis of the unrestrained cross member.
When δ  is not greater than
