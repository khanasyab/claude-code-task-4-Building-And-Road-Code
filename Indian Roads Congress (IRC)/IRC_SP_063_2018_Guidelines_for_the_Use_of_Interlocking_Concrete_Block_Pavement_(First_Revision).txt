GUIDELINES FOR THE USE OF INTERLOCKING 
CONCRETE BLOCK PAVEMENT
Background
The Guidelines for Interlocking Concrete Block Pavements (ICBP) was first published in 
October 2004, since then the uses of Interlocking Concrete Block Pavements have increased 
sharply and the technology for ICBP construction has undergone considerable changes. A 
need was felt that some special requirements, like repair, drainage system, abrasion value of 
blocks, grade of concrete for casting of blocks etc. need to be incorporated in the document. 
For incorporating these aspects it was decided to update the Guidelines.
The revised draft was prepared by the subgroup of Rigid Pavement Committee (H-3) 
comprising of Shri J.B. Sengupta, Shri R.K. Jain, Shri Ram Avtar, and Shri Binod Kumar. 
Other than the H-3 Committee members, valuable inputs were received from the officers of 
S&R Zone of the Ministry. The Rigid Pavement Committee (H-3) deliberated on the document 
in a series of meetings and finalized it in its meeting held on 27th May, 2017. The revised 
draft was placed before the Highways Specifications and Standards Committee (HSS) in 
its meeting held on 24th October, 2017. The HSS Committee approved the draft subject to 
the consideration of the observations of members. The draft document after carrying out 
the necessary modifications was considered and approved by the Executive Committee of 
IRC in its meeting held on 2nd November, 2017 for placing before the Council of IRC. The 
Council in its meeting held on 3rd November, 2017 at Bengaluru considered and approved the 
document for printing subject to incorporation of comments of members.

1 SCOPE
1.1	
These guidelines cover the design and construction of interlocking concrete block 
pavements giving the suggested applications, design catalogues, construction practices and 
specifications for their use.
1.2	
The use of interlocking concrete block pavement is not recommended for 
Expressways, National Highways, State Highways and Major District Road. However, if an 
MDR or State Highways passes through an habitation, their use is permitted.
1.3	
The Constituent materials, products requirements and test methods for solid, 
unreinforced precast cement concrete paver blocks shall be as per IS:15658 “Precast 
Concrete Blocks for Paving Specification”.
2 APPLICATIONS
2.1	
Interlocking Concrete Block Pavements have been found to have applications in 
several situations. Such as :
	
1.	
Footpaths and Side-walks

2.2	
Advantages and Limitations of Interlocking Concrete Block Pavements
2.2.1	
Advantages
	
(i)	
Since the blocks are prepared in the factory, they are of a very 
high quality, thus avoiding the difficulties encountered in quality control in the 
field.
	
(ii)	
Concrete block pavements restrict the speed of vehicles to about 60 km per 
hour, which is an advantage in city streets and intersections.
	
(iii)	 Because of the rough surface, these pavements are skid-resistant.
	
(iv)	 The block pavements are ideal for intersections where speeds have to be 
restricted and turning stresses are high.
	
(v)	
The digging and reinstatement of trenches for repairs to utilities is easier in 
the case of block pavement.
	
(vi)	 These pavements are unaffected by the spillage of oil from vehicles, can 
perform better at bus stops, bus depots and parking areas.
	
(vii)	 They are preferred in heavily loaded areas like container depots and ports 
as they can be very well designed to withstand the high stresses induced 
there.

(viii)	 In India, the laying of concrete block pavements can be achieved at a low 
cost because of the availability of cheap labour.
	
(ix)	 Since the concrete blocks are grey in colour, so their visibility at night is 
better than that of flexible pavement.
	
(x)	
The cost of maintenance is much lower than a bituminous surface.
	
(xi)	 Block pavement does not need in-situ curing and so can be opened to traffic 
soon after completion of construction.
	
(xii)	 Construction of block pavement is simple and labour-intensive, and can be 
done using simple compaction equipment.
	
(xiii)	 Maintenance of block pavement is simple and easy. Also, the need for 
frequency of maintenance is low as compared to bituminous pavement.
	
(xiv)	 Structurally sound blocks can be reused many times over.
	
(xv)	 Unlike concrete pavements, block pavement does not exhibit very 
deterioratory effect due to thermal expansion and contraction, and are free 
from the cracking phenomenon.
	
(xvi)	 Use of permeable block pavement in cities and towns can help replenish 
depleting underground sources of water, filter pollutants before they reach 
open water sources, help reduce storm water runoff and decrease the 
quantum of drainage structures.
2.2.2	
Limitations
	
(i)	
Concrete block pavements cannot be used for high speed facilities.
	
(ii)	
The riding quality is reasonably good for low-speed traffic, but is inferior to 
that observed on a machine laid bituminous or concrete pavement.
	
(iii)	 The noise generated is higher than bituminous and cement concrete 
pavements.
	
(iv)	 A very good attention to pavement drainage is needed because the water 
can seep through the joints.
	
(v)	
These Specifications are not recommended for Expressways and National-
Highways.
3 TYPES AND SHAPES OF BLOCKS
The blocks can be interlocking horizontally and vertically, as shown in Fig 1.
Present day interlocking blocks have evolved in shape after observing their performance. 
The three phases in the changing of the shape of the blocks are shown in Fig. 2.



======================================================================

IRC:SP:63-2018

The rectangular shape shown in Fig. 2(i) is the shape which was intended for imitating the 
stone set blocks. The shape shown in Fig. 2(ii) is an improved version with many dentated 
faces for better contact between adjoining blocks thus enhancing the interlocking effect and 
friction between them. This helps in increasing the shear strength of the block system and 
thus the load dispersal capacity. The block shown in Fig. 2(iii) is a further improvement over 
dentated rectangular block. The block shown in Fig. 2(iv) gives still better interlock and is 
suitable for fully mechanized paving. 
The dentated blocks further can be grouped as shown in Fig. 3 into three categories as 
under:
Category A: Dentated units are designed to key into each other on all four faces and 
which, by their plan geometry when keyed together, resist the widening of the joint. These 
blocks are generally capable of being laid in Herringbone Bond Pattern (as explained in 
Section 8).
Category B: These blocks are dentated on only two sides. Their dimensional accuracy 
of laying helps in bringing about the interlock effect on other faces. Generally, with some 
exceptions, these blocks can only be laid in Stretcher Bond, as explained in Section 8.
Category C: These are not dentated type but depend on dimensional accuracy for interlocking 
effect.
These blocks can be laid only in a stretcher bond.
The overall dimension of blocks used in various parts of the world ranges as under :
Top surface area : 5,000 to 60,000 mm2
Horizontal dimension not exceeding : 280 mm
Thickness : Between 60 to 140 mm
Length/Thickness : ≥ 4
In addition to regular blocks described above, supplementary blocks of half size would be 
required for paving purpose. In the case of rectangular blocks, more number of half blocks 
would be generally required than other category of blocks.

Fig. 3 Different Categories of Blocks
Special Grass Blocks
For improving aesthetic looks of paved areas, architects have been making use of block 
pavement extensively. The numerous paving blocks and their joints mellow down the 
harshness created by large transverse joints formed in conventional concrete pavement.
For improving aesthetics further, grass blocks have been developed. These when constructed 
in a grid formation allow space in the pavement for growing grass as shown in Fig. 4. These 
are best suited for walkways, driveways, etc. Coloured blocks also add to the aesthetic beauty.
4. COMPOSITION OF BLOCK PAVEMENT
4.1	
General
Except for the top wearing part of the pavement, the base and sub-base layers are similar to 
the conventional flexible or rigid pavement. Depending upon the load coming on them, the 
composition of the pavement differs.
4.2	
Typical Pavement Composition
A few typical composition normally used are given in Figs. 5 and 6.
4.3	
Block Thickness
Interlocking concrete blocks come in different thicknesses. These blocks serve as wearing 
surface but at the same time help in reducing the stresses imposed on subgrade and also 
help in resisting pavement deformation and elastic deflections similar to the base course of 
a flexible pavement.

Fig. 5 A Typical Cross Section of Block Pavement used in  
Sidewalks/Footpaths/Car-Parks/Cycle Tracks
Fig. 6 A Typical Cross Section of Block Pavement for Medium and Heavily Trafficked Roads 
except National-Highways, Expressways, State Highways and MDR
For light traffic, such as, pedestrians, motor cars, cycles, etc., a block thickness of 60 mm is 
adequate; for medium traffic, a thickness of 80 mm is generally used; for heavily trafficked 
roads, blocks of the thickness 100-120 mm are used. Thick blocks are best suited where high 
volumes of turning movements are involved. 
Non-uniformity in thickness of blocks affects the evenness of the surface. A block pavement 
which is initially paved to a levelled surface will settle unevenly with the movement of vehicles, 
as shown in Fig. 7. In view of this, all blocks should be of the same thickness, with a maximum 
allowable tolerance limits of ± 2 mm. Similarly, variations in length and width of blocks should 
be limited to ± 2 to ± 3 mm for ensuring uniform joint width and avoiding staggering effect. 
4.4	
Sand Bedding and Jointing
A layer of sand bedding is provided between block pavement and base/sub-base for the 
following reasons:
	
(i)	
To provide a cushion between the hard base and the paving blocks.
	
(ii)	
The base or sub-base will have some permitted surface unevenness. By 
providing a layer of sand bed, the paved block can be levelled perfectly.



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:SP:63-2018
11
	
(iii)	 The sand bed acts as a barrier and does not allow propagation of cracks 
formed in base/sub-base.
	
(iv)	 The sand also helps to keep lower part of the joint filled with sand and 
provides added interlocking effect.
Fig. 7 Effect of Thickness Variations in Paving Blocks
The sand bed should not be too thick lest it would be difficult to control the surface level of 
the blocks. A layer thickness of 30 ± 5 mm is found to be satisfactory.
For block pavement to perform satisfactorily, it is necessary that the lower layers are profiled 
to proper level and finish and that the bedding sand layer is of uniform thickness. Varying 
thickness of sand bed ultimately results in uneven surface of the pavement.
The grading and quality of sand is very important for the block pavement to perform 
satisfactorily. The sand used should be free from plastic clay and should be angular type. It 
should not be of degradable type for e.g., sand produced from lime stone, etc. is likely to get 
powdered under the loading.
Joints between blocks are filled by fine sand. Normally, the bottom 20 to 30 mm of the joint 
gets filled with bedding sand, whereas, the remainder space has to be filled with jointing sand 
by brooming it from the top. The joints are normally 2 - 4 mm wide.
4.5	
Base and Sub-base Layers
These layers are the important structural layers of a block pavement. The materials used 
for base construction consist of either bound material like lean concrete or soil-cement or 
bituminous layers or unbound materials like wet mix macadam or WBM. The sub-bases are 
generally of granular material. The sub-base can function as drainage layer as well, provided 



======================================================================
PAGE 20 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:SP:63-2018
12
proper disposal arrangement for water is made. The base course layer is normally provided 
where heavy vehicular traffic is likely to ply on the pavement.
Besides intensity of loading, the type of soil encountered determines the type and thickness 
of base and sub-base. For weak subgrade soils like clays, where ground water table is 
shallow, bound bases are preferred.
4.6	
Edge Restraint Blocks and Kerbs
Concrete blocks on trafficked pavements tend to move sideways and forward due to braking 
and manoeuvring of vehicles. The tendency to move sideways has to be counteracted at 
the edges by special edge blocks and kerbs. The edge blocks should be designed such that 
the rotation or displacement of blocks is resisted. These are to be made of concrete of high 
strength to withstand the traffic wheel loading without getting damaged. These members 
should be manufactured or constructed in-situ to have at least a 28 day compressive strength 
of 30 MPa or flexural strength of 3.8 MPa. As far as possible the edge blocks should have 
vertical face towards the inside blocks. A few typical edge blocks are also shown in Fig. 8.
Fig. 8 Edge Restraints



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:63-2018

The road kerbs provided on the edge of the road also serve the purpose of edge blocks as 
shown in Fig. 8. In case the kerbs are not provided, it has to be replaced by edge strips.
5 STRUCTURAL DESIGN OF CONCRETE BLOCK PAVEMENT
5.1	
Suggested Design Procedure
It is recommended that the catalogue of design as given in Table 1 may be used.
5.2	
Lightly Trafficked Pavements
Pedestrian side-walks, footpaths, cycle tracks, car parks and malls are lightly trafficked. In 
such situations, the pavement can consist of blocks 60 mm thick laid over a sand bedding 
30 ± 5 mm and a base course 200 mm thick. The base course can be in WBM/WMM/crushed 
stone/soil-cement. This design can be adopted for the range of subgrade soils met within 
India. A typical cross-section is given in Fig. 5.
5.3	
Block Pavements Subjected to Commercial Traffic
City streets and highway (except National-Highways and Expressways) sections subjected 
to commercial traffic (trucks and buses) require a heavier section. Though design methods 
based on empirical approach and mechanistic behaviour are available, enough work has not 
been done in India to evolve the country’s own design procedure. In the absence of such 
knowledge, the ad-hoc design catalogues based on international experience as given in 
Table 1 are suggested for adoption. A design life of 20 years can be considered for determining 
the repetitions of standard axles. 
5.4	
For block pavements for industrial applications like container yard and port wharf 
and roads and warehouses the following thickness is recommended:
Block	
	
100 -120 mm
Sand Bedding	
30 ± 5 mm
Cement bound base	
300 mm
Granular sub-base (out of which 
the bottom 150 mm is a drainage layer)	
300 mm

6 MATERIALS
6.1	
General
The quality of materials, cement concrete strength, durability and dimensional tolerances, 
etc. are of great importance for the satisfactory performance of block pavements. These 
aspects and the block manufacturing process itself, which immensely influences the quality 
of paving blocks, are broadly outlined in the subsequent paragraphs. The desired engineering 
properties of bedding/joint filling sand layer beneath the block, the base course and sub-base 
materials are also described.

Salient Mix Design Aspects
The commonly used processes for the manufacture of pre-cast cement concrete paving units 
require dry, low-slump mixes. The desired characteristics of the mix are as under:
Water/cement ratio
Water content of the mix
Quantity of cement in mix
0.34 to 0.38
5 to 7% by weight of total mix
Generally not less than 380 kg/m3 depending on the equipment 
being used for block making. Upper limit of cement shall not 
be more than 450 kg/m3. Flyash also can be used in the mix, 
replacing Ordinary Portland Cement to an extent of 35 per cent 
by weight of cementitious material. The above values are for 
general guidance only. The actual mix design has to be made 
to suit each individual requirement.
Aggregate/cement ratio
Aggregate
3:1 to 6:1
Aggregates should conform to IS:383. The proportion of 
coarse aggregate in the mix is typically 40 per cent and the fine 
aggregate (sand) 60 per cent. The size of coarse aggregate 
should lie between 6 mm and 12 mm and the gradation should 
be in the recommended range for cement concrete mixes in 
general.
Strength 
In general terms, the paving block must have adequate 
strength to withstand handling, construction stresses and 
effects of traffic. It is suggested that the minimum compressive 
strength of a single block should be above 30 MPa and blocks 
of compressive strength of 40 MPa for commercial traffic of 
less than 20 msa and 50 MPa for commercial traffic more than 
20 msa.
Abrasion Resistance
Abrasion Resistance test shall be performed with rolling disc 
machine as per ASTM C779 procure-A. The depth of wear 
after 60 minute should not be more than 1.5 mm in case of 
M-30 Grade blocks,1.25 mm in case of M-40 Grade blocks 
and 1 mm in case of M-50 Grade of blocks.

Addition of Pigments
To provide the desired colour to paving blocks, appropriate 
type and amount of pigments are added during mixing, in the 
form of powder or slurry. Although organic pigments render 
brighter colours than inorganic pigments, the former are 
adversely affected by the alkaline environment of concrete 
and do deteriorate with time. Inorganic pigments, mostly metal 
oxides, are more durable and hence preferred for consistency 
and purity. Saturation of colour takes place with a pigment 
volume of around 5 to 9 per cent of cement content. Pigments 
should be finer than cement (fineness value between 2 and 
15 m2/gm). For the same slump, addition of pigments requires 
increase in mixing water, which in some cases may lead to 
lowering of flexural and compressive strength of concrete; 
therefore, suitable adjustments in mix proportions may 
become necessary.
Other Additives 
Under special circumstances, super-plasticizers at around 
0.4 per cent of cement by weight, may be added for better 
workability. Water repellent admixtures of calcium stearate are 
sometimes used to reduce water absorption. Air entraining 
agents, when added to the mix, cause some reduction in the 
needed amount of cement. Further reduction is achieved by 
substituting part of the cement with blast-furnace slag (50%) 
or pozzolanas like flyash (35%); besides reducing cost, these 
also control “efflorescence” (surface deposition of salts as a 
result of water movement upwards).
6.3	
Manufacture of Paving Blocks
The method of manufacture of paving blocks has an important bearing on the quality, durability 
and level of finish - dimensional tolerance, etc. all of which reflect on the ultimate performance 
of the block pavement during service. At the very outset, therefore, it is to be emphasized 
that hand-casted concrete blocks are unacceptable for use and that an appropriate plant with 
high frequency hydraulic press machine should be used. It would make it possible to apply 
high pressure together with controlled vibration. Adaptation of production facilities designed 
for high quality hollow masonry blocks, though feasible, is not as economical and as efficient 
as the use of purpose designed machinery for paving block manufacture. Essentially, the 
manufacturing process involves compacting concrete, in a steel mould clamped to a vibrating 
table, by hydraulic pressure.
Concrete is fed into the mould from a hopper by a drawer - if a second hopper is added, a 
block can be made of two kinds of concrete having “backing” and “facing” surfaces. In the 
“facing” of the block, the top 5 mm has greater amounts of cement and sand to make it more 
durable and skid resistant, and extra pigment is added for the coloured face vis-a-vis the rest 
of the block. In the first stage of compaction, pre-vibration is effected by running the vibrators 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:63-2018
17
attached to the vibratory table, the frequency generally being in the range of 50 to 100 Hz. 
In the second stage of compaction, compression pressure is applied to the tamper heads, 
also fitted with vibrators for a high level of surface finish. Blocks are extruded from mould by 
forcing down the tamper heads, after the vibrating table is disengaged from the mould. The 
blocks thus prepared are stacked either in a single layer or multiple layers for curing.
6.4	
Dimensional and other Requirements of Paving Blocks
For normal paving work, the length of a paving block should ordinarily be not greater than 
twice the mean width; the thickness is a minimum of 60 mm; the maximum length generally 
not exceeding 280 mm; the width generally is in the range 75 to 140 mm with a chamfer in 
the range 3-5 mm. The sides of the block should be perpendicular.
To the top and bottom faces except that the top edge may be chamfered. The blocks should 
have the following dimensional tolerances: 
Plan dimensions	
±	
2 mm
Thickness		
	
±	
2 mm
To ensure durability, the average water absorption in a block should not exceed 5 per cent; 
and for cold regions in a standard freeze-thaw durability test, the weight loss should not 
exceed 1 per cent.
In situations, where parts of blocks are to be used e.g., around manholes, the block should 
be purpose-cut at site. 
It is to be recognized that variations in the thickness of blocks used for a paving job can be 
a major cause for the loss of surface profile, as shown in Fig. 7 on an exaggerated scale. In 
the interest of maintaining a good surface profile, the block thickness should be controlled 
carefully; this can be done to advantage by adopting multi-layer method of manufacture of 
paving blocks, which reduces the variation in block thickness. 
Annexure give suggested technical specifications for laying block pavements.
6.5	
Bedding and Joint Filling Sand
6.5.1	
Bedding sand
It is well established that if proper attention is not paid to the quality of bedding sand, and if 
the thickens of the bedding sand layer is not uniform enough, serious irregularities in surface 
profile can result; excessive differential deformation and rutting can occur early in service life 
of the block pavement. The desired gradation of bedding sand should be as per Annexure I.
Care should be taken to see that single-sized or gap graded sands or sands with excessive 
amount of fines or plastic fines should not be used. The shape of sand particles should 
preferably be sharp rather than rounded, since the sharp sands possess higher strength and 
resist the migration of sand from under the block to less frequently trafficked areas. Even 



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:SP:63-2018
18
though sharp sands are relatively more difficult to compact than rounded sands, the use of 
sharp sands should be preferred for the more heavily trafficked pavements. The bedding 
sand should be free of deleterious materials.
6.5.2	
Joint filling sand
The gaps in between two paving blocks (typically about 2-3 mm wide) need to be filled by 
sand, relatively finer than the bedding sand. The desired gradation for the joint filling sand is 
as under: 
IS Sieve Size
Per cent Passing
2.36 mm
100
1.18 mm
90-100
600 micron
60-90
300 micron
30-60
150 micron
15-30
75 micron
0-10
It is necessary to restrict the fines (silt and/or clay) to 10 per cent, since excessive fines make 
joint filling very difficult. Similarly, it is not advisable to use cement in the joint filling sand 
which will not only make it difficult to completely fill the joints but would also adversely affect 
the desired flexibility characteristics of the paving block layer. The joint filling sand should 
be as dry as possible; otherwise complete filling of joints will be difficult. To overcome the 
problem of efflorescence on the surface of paving block layer, the joint filling sand should be 
washed to remove soluble salts.
6.6	
Base Layer
The engineering properties of base layer, which include load spreading properties to reduce 
stresses on the subgrade and desired drainage characteristics, have an important bearing on 
the performance of a block pavement. Although, local availability and economics generally 
dictate the choice of base material at the design stage, the commonly used materials 
considered suitable for base courses are unbound crushed rock, water-bound macadam, wet 
mix macadam, cement bound crushed rock/granular materials, and lean cement concrete. 
For heavy duty block pavement, lean concrete base must be provided.
In broad terms, wherever the subgrade is weak (having a CBR value below 5) use of bound 
granular materials, like, cement treated crushed rock, requiring a relatively thinner base, 
should be preferred while for high strength subgrades, unbound crushed rock can be used. 
The climatic and environmental factors also need to be considered during the choice of a 
base material.
6.7	
Sub-base Layer
Generally, a sub-base is warranted where commercial traffic is expected. The quality of 
subbase material is inferior to the base materials and includes natural gravels, cement treated 



======================================================================
PAGE 27 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:SP:63-2018
19
gravels and sands and stabilized subgrade materials. The quality of sub-base materials 
should be in conformance with IRC:37 or MoRTH Specifications.
7 DRAINAGE
Block pavement with joints filled with sand is not a waterproof layer and hence care has 
to be taken to drain out the surface water seeping through the joints in initial stage of the 
construction. This water can find way to sand bed below, base, sub-base and subgrade 
layers. Unless these layers are free draining, appropriate drainage arrangement has to be 
provided. The drainage provided generally consists of subsurface drains surrounded by filter 
material or a geotextile/geocomposite, which would allow the water to pass through and at 
the same time prevent the escape of bedding jointing sand. Typical subsurface drainage 
arrangement used in block pavement is shown in Figs. 9, 10 and 11. It is a drainage system 
with pervious concrete provided below the sand bed. The water collected is to be taken 
through 80 mm diameter perforated pipe.

pavement should be at least 5 mm above the manholes, side drains, etc: 
8 CONSTRUCTION
8.1	
General
The construction of block pavement involves preparation of subgrade, sub-base and base 
course layers, bedding sand and finally the laying of blocks. The block paving can be done 
entirely by manual labour. However, for efficient construction work, the work force has to 
be properly trained for this specialised job. Paving can also be done by mechanical means. 
Technical specifications for laying concrete paving blocks is given in Annexure-I and 
specification for controlled low strength material for repair work is given in Annexure-II.
8.2	
Preparation of Subgrade
This is the foundation layer on which the block pavement is constructed. Like in conventional 
pavements the water table should be at a minimum depth of 600 mm below the subgrade. 
Subgrade should be compacted in layers of 150 or 100 mm thickness as per IRC:36/MoRTH 
Specifications.
8.3	
Base and Sub-base Course
Base and sub-base courses are constructed in accordance with standard procedures as per 
MoRTH Specifications.



======================================================================
PAGE 29 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:SP:63-2018

When cement bound base are proposed it may be constructed using dry lean concrete as 
per IRC:SP:49. The quality control specified in IRC:SP:112 shall apply, in case of repair work 
where compaction is not possible CLSM may be used as under.

For cars and light vehicles 	
	
	
4 MPa
	
iii.	
For heavy vehicles	
	
	
	
6 MPa	
Constructing the layers to proper level and grade is very essential to maintain the level and 
surface regularity of the block pavement. In small widths where compaction of GSB, WBM, 
and WMM may not be done adequately it is recommended that 75 mm to 100 mm thick DLC 
be provided over these granular layers to maintain the level and surface regularity.
8.4	
Placing and Screeding of Bedding Sand
The thickness of the sand bed after compaction should be in the range of 30 ± 5 mm, 
whereas, in the loose form it can be 30 to 50 mm. It is preferable to restrict the ‘compacted 
thickness to 30 ± 5 mm to reduce the risk of any localized precompaction, which would affect 
the final block surface level. Bedding sand should not be used to fill-up local depressions on 
the surface of a base or sub-base. The depressions should be repaired in advance before 
placing sand.
Sand to be used should be uniformly in loose condition and should have a uniform moisture 
content. Best moisture content is that when sand is neither too wet nor too dry and have a 
value of 6 to 8 per cent. Requirement of sand for a day’s work should be prepared and stored 
in advance and covered with tarpaulin or polythene sheets.
The processed sand is spread with the help of screed boards to the required thickness. The 
screed boards are provided with nails at 2-3 m apart which when dragged gives the desired 
thickness. The length of nail should take into account the surcharge to be provided in the 
uncompacted thickness. Alternatively, the screed can be dragged on edge strips kept on both 
sides as guide. Asphalt paver can be employed in large projects. The sand is subsequently 
compacted with plate vibrators weighing 0.6 tonnes or more. Level checks shall be carried 
out on a grid pattern to establish that the desired level is achieved. Local correction can be 
done either by removing or adding extra sand followed by levelling and compacting the layer. 
There will be some settlement of sand after the blocks are placed and compacted, which 
must be allowed for, while fixing the level of sand bed.
The effect of undulating surface of base or sub-base on the profile of block pavement is 
explained in Fig. 12. The blocks will settle after trafficking in such a manner that the surface 
profile becomes parallel to base/sub-base profile. Sand bed assumes uniform thickness 
under moving loads.
8.5	
Laying of Blocks
Blocks can be laid generally by manual labour but mechanical aids like hand-pushed trolleys 
can expedite the work.



======================================================================

======================================================================

22
Normally, laying should commence from the edge strip and proceed towards the inner side. 
When dentated blocks are used, the laying done at two fronts will create problem for matching 
joints in the middle. Hence, as far as possible, laying should proceed in one direction only, 
along the entire width of the area to be paved.
While locating the starting line, the following should be considered:
On a sloping site, start from the lowest point and proceed uphill on a continuous basis, to 
avoid downhill creep in incomplete areas.
In case of irregular shaped edge restraints or strip, it is better to start from straight string line 
as shown in Fig. 13.

8.6	
Bonds or Patterns of Laying Blocks
The blocks can be placed to different bonds or patterns depending upon choice. Some 
popular bonds commonly adopted for block paving are:
	
(i)	
Stretcher or running bond
	
(ii)	
Herringbone bond
	
(iii)	 Basket weave or parquet bond
The typical layout of these bonds are given in Fig. 14.
8.7	
Establishing the Laying Pattern
In relation to the starting line, the blocks should be placed at the correct angle to achieve the 
final orientation as required by the laying pattern. If the edge restraint is straight and suitably 
oriented, the first row of blocks can abut it. For irregular-shaped and unfavourably oriented 
edge restraints, a string line should be established a few rows away to position the first row. 
With the help of gauges, the joint width specification (2 to 3 mm) should be checked in 
the first few square metres, where it should be ensured that the block alignment is correct. 
The laying patterns and face should be established (Fig. 15) to permit fast and easy laying 
without the necessity of forcing a block between previously positioned blocks. To start with, 
full blocks should be used; only subsequently, cutting and in-filling at edges be permitted. 
Under no circumstances should the blocks be forced or hammered into the bedding sand 
at this stage of laying. For cutting paving blocks, hydraulic or mechanical block cutters, or 
power saws are used. Cut units less than 50 mm minimum dimension should not be used, 
as these are difficult to cut accurately and can be dislodged under traffic. Where space does 
not permit use of a larger segment, use premixed concrete or a sand-cement mortar instead. 
The control over alignment, laying pattern and joint widths can be maintained by the use of 
chalked string lines, at about 5 m intervals. 
8.8	
Methods of Construction of Block Pavement
8.8.1	
Manual methods
In the traditional manual method, the sand is roughly screeded and a skilled worker (called a 
pavior) levels the sand and then embeds the block using a hammer; he works backwards so 
as to have a continuous view of the completed pavement in order to obtain a good finish. A 
pavior, along with an assistant, can lay 50 to 75 m2 of paving per day.
An alternative to the above method, the block layers (generally unskilled labourers) work on 
the completed surface, moving forward. 
For optimum output, it is advantageous to select an easy fitting block shape, with the desirable 
size being that which can be easily accommodated in the worker’s hand; in addition, the 
blocks should be chamfered for easy handling and their weight should preferably be less 
than 4 kg.

The output of finished pavement varies widely with training of workmen, over a wide range 
from a low of 20 to a high of 120 m2/man-day. The higher outputs being for industrial hard 
standings where intrusion like manholes, etc. are minimal. To keep up the speed of work, it 
is important to maintain an adequate supply of paving blocks to the laying site for manual 
paving. Ordinarily, hand pushed trolleys are adequate for the purpose, but for large projects 
employing a number of laying teams, use of powered trolleys is preferable.
Care must be taken to see that paving blocks are not tightly butted against each other, 
otherwise there could be non-uniformity in the laying patterns and the blocks may spall or 
even crack. Joint widths of 2 to 3 mm can be maintained if, when laying a paving unit, it is 
held lightly against the face of an adjacent laid unit and allowed to vertically slide into position. 
Since each workman may produce slightly different joint widths, it is desirable to rotate 
workmen along the workface, and also periodically interchange the personnel laying and 
transporting blocks. 
The average joint width can be measured and checked, by determining statistically the 
representative values of average length and breadth of blocks at the project site and then 
obtaining average distance between joints, say 40 blocks apart; or it can be done by measuring 
joint widths directly, using a calibrated, hardened steel mandrel which is forced into joints at 
a series of randomly selected location, to obtain a statistically representative figure. 
8.8.2	
Mechanised methods
Mechanised laying requires the use of specialised equipment for transporting and placing 
clusters of paving blocks. The size of paving block cluster suitable for paving, is usually 0.3 
to 0.5 m2 in area for hand-operated equipment. For fully mechanised equipment, the cluster 
surface area can be upto about 1.2 m2. These clusters are designed to maintain a joint space 
of about 3 mm between blocks, when clamped together (Fig. 16).
Since the blocks are placed in separate clusters, there exists the possibility of damage if 
joints between adjacent clusters run uninterrupted throughout the pavement. To overcome 
this problem, clusters may be arranged so that the joints are periodically staggered both along 
and across the cluster axis or link blocks are installed by hand across these joints (Fig. 17).
Mechanised laying must be coordinated with the manufacturer, so that the blocks are delivered 
stacked on pallets in the required pattern; in some cases, spacing ribs may be cast on the 
sides of blocks to preserve the required joint spacing.
8.8.3	
Compaction
For compaction of the bedding sand and the blocks laid over it, vibratory plate compactors 
are used over the laid paving units; at least two passes of the vibratory plate compactor are 
needed. Such vibratory compaction should be continued till the top of each paving block 
is level with its adjacent blocks. It is not good practice to leave compaction till end of the 
day, as some blocks may move under construction traffic, resulting in the widening of joints 
and corner contact of blocks, which may cause spalling or cracking of blocks. There should 



======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:SP:63-2018
27
be minimal delay in compaction after laying of the paving blocks to achieve uniformity of 
compaction and retention of the pattern of laying; however, compaction should not proceed 
closer than 1 m from the laying face, except after completion of the pavement.

28
Fig. 17 Staggered Installation of Block Clusters
During vibratory compaction of the laid blocks, some amount of bedding sand will work its way 
into the joints between them. The extent of sand getting worked up into the joints will depend 
on the degree of pre-compaction of sand and the force applied by the block compactor. 
Standard compactors may have a weight of about 90 kg, plate area of about 0.3 m2 and apply 
a centrifugal force of about 15 kN, while heavy duty compactors may weigh 300-600 kg, 
have a plate area of about 0.5-0.6 m2 and apply a centrifugal force of 30-65 kN. Where the 
bedding sand has been pre-compacted and for heavily trafficked block pavements, heavy 



======================================================================
PAGE 37 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:SP:63-2018
29
duty compactors should be used. After compaction by vibratory plate compactors, some 2 
to 6 passes of a vibratory roller (with rubber coated drums or those of static weight less than 
4 tonnes and nominal amplitude of not more than 0.4 mm) will further help in compaction of 
bedding sand and joint filling.
8.8.4	
Joint filling
The importance of complete joint filling cannot be over-emphasised. Unfilled or partially filled 
joints allow blocks to deflect, leading to loose blocks, possibly spalling the edges and a 
locally disturbing bedding sand layer, as shown in Fig. 18. 
After the compaction of the bedding sand has been completed and some bedding sand 
has been forced up in the joints between blocks, the joints should be completely filled with 
sand meeting the desired specifications, as given in Section 6. The joint filing sand should 
be stockpiled at suitable locations for convenience. There should be minimum delay in joint 
filling; the process should in any case, be completed by the end of the day’s work.
Fig. 18 Need for Complete Filling of Joints



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:63-2018
30
The operation of joint filling comprises of spreading a thin layer of the joint filling sand on the 
block surface and working the sand into each joint by brooming. Following this, a few passes 
of heavy plate compactor are applied to facilitate fine sand to fill the joints. The sand should 
be broomed or spread over the surface with a small surcharge. 
Dry sand and dry blocks are best for the filling of joint, as damp sand tends to stick at the 
very top of the joints; also, if the block is wet and the sand dry, the sand will again stick at 
the joint top. Hence, if either the blocks or sand are wet, one may get a false impression of 
the joints being full, but the next rain will reveal that they are actually hollow. If the weather 
does not allow sand and blocks to be dry, the joint filling sand should be washed in by light 
sprinkling of water. In this case, several cycles of application of sand, water-sprinkling and 
plate compaction will be necessary to completely fill the joints. 
8.8.5	
Opening to traffic
Until all the joints are completely filled, no traffic should be permitted over the block pavement. 
In case of lime or cement treated layers in the pavement, it must be ensured that these 
are given at least 14 and 7 days respectively to cure, before traffic is permitted. The block 
pavement should be inspected frequently, to ensure that any incompletely filled joints, 
exposed by traffic and/or weather are promptly filled. Such frequent inspection should be 
continued till dust and detritus from the roadway tightens the surface of the joints.

8.8.7	
Detailing block pavements
Essentially, there are three important aspects in detailing. These are
	
(i)	
Curves
	
(ii)	
Treatment of intrusions
	
(iii)	 Changes in alignment
8.8.7.1	
Curves
It is necessary to cut the paving units to fit the edge restraints. Rectangular blocks of a similar 
or contrasting colour as an edging have been used to minimise the visual effects of small 
errors in block cutting. To avoid unsightly and potentially weak construction joints, it is often 
preferable to change the laying pattern at the curve. For example, as shown in Fig. 19, the 
curve itself can be installed in herringbone bond and yet the pavement can revert to stretcher 
bond on the approaches.

8.8.7.2	
Pavement intrusions
On some pavements, like in city streets, there could be several intrusions, like, manholes, 
drainage gulleys, etc. Where meeting these intrusions with the pavement is desirable. Fig. 
20 shows how this should be done around a manhole.
Around intrusions, it is good practice to lay along both sides of the intrusion simultaneously 
so that closure is made away from the starting workface, rather than carrying the pavement 
around the intrusion to return to the original laying face (Fig. 20) to avoid accumulation of 
closing error.
Fig. 20. Laying Block Paving Around a Manhole
8.8.7.3	
Changes in alignment
Changes in alignment of a road pavement can some times be achieved by the use of special 
blocks. However, it is generally easier to choose a block that can be installed in herringbone 
bond and simply cut the blocks to fit the edge restraints. Where aesthetic requirements or 
shape of the paving unit dictate the use of stretcher bond, then only a 90° shape change 
in alignment can be achieved without cutting the blocks (Fig. 21). At intersections, if a 
herringbone bond laying pattern is adopted, the paving can proceed without the need for 
construction joints (Fig. 22). An alternative to this is to install a shoulder (support) course 
of rectangular paving units between the main roadway and the side streets; this permits 
different laying patterns to be used in the two roadways.

9. MAINTENANCE
9.1	
General
Like any other road work, block pavement also required to be maintained to get long service. 
The maintenance requirement of block pavement is minimal. The block pavement requires 
initial maintenance soon after its laying, say after a week or two for checking sand in the 
joints. Subsequently, the maintenance is in the form of replacing any damaged block/blocks 
or raising the settled section, if any. Repair especially after laying a cable duct is much 
simpler in the case of block pavements. The cut area can be reinstated without any blemish. 
9.2	
Initial Maintenance
After about a week of laying the blocks there is a need to inspect the surface to check for any 
loss of sand at joints. Wherever sand level has dropped down it should be reinstated. This 
type of inspection should continue for two to three months till the sand level is stabilized and 
topping up is no more required. With time the joints receive fine dust and detritus thus making 
them waterproof. During rains these joints may allow weeds to grow but these normally 
should get eliminated with the traffic. In case it does not get eliminated these may have to be 
controlled by spraying herbicide or by manual removal. Annual inspection, however, will be 
required.
9.3	
Storage of Blocks
For the purpose of reinstating damaged blocks it is necessary to stockpile a small percentage 
of blocks from the lots used in the construction. The size and colour of the blocks may be 
difficult to obtain at a later date matching with the original blocks. For important projects, it is 
normal to stockpil blocks from 1 per cent to 3 per cent of initial supply for subsequent use.

9.4	
Coating and Cleaning
As part of preventive maintenance, blocks can be sealed using compounds, like, silicone, 
acrylics and silica fluorides for enhancing the colour, reducing absorptive nature of the blocks 
and for improving surface toughness. These coating have life of 1 to 3 years and hence they 
have to be repeated as per the requirement. The most durable of these chemicals is solvent-
borne acrylics which are abrasion resistant and also minimize chemical effects of spillage 
even at 60°C.
Cleaning of block pavement can be done by mechanical brooms, compressors or even by 
manual means. For removing certain stains, chemicals, like, oxalic, acetic and phosphoric 
acids etc. are used. Sometimes it may be expedient to replace the blocks where stains have 
penetrated to a greater depth.

pavement. However after the laying of services the reinstatement is not done properly 
resulting into undulated surface leading to public inconvenience, WMM and GSB is generally 
provided as base and subbase, under block pavement, but these layers get disturb during 
trenching for laying utilities. Reconstruction of these layers after laying utility is not done 
properly. As a result settlement and undulation occur causing failure and inconvenience it is 
recommended that a layer of DLC or Controlled Low Strength Material (CLSM) be provided 
above well compacted GSB & WMM layers. Specification of CLSM are given in Annexure II.
CLSM-Controlled Low Strength Material is self compacting, cementations material. The 
properties of CLSM are between Soil and Concrete. CLSM is manufactured from material 
similar to those used to produce concrete and is place from equipment in a fashion similar to 
that of concrete. Guidance should be taken from Report on Controlled Low Strength Material,

Annexure-II
SPECIFICATION FOR CONTROLLED LOW STRENGTH MATERIAL (CLSM)
1 Introduction
CLSM- Controlled Low Strength Material is self compacting, cementations material. The 
properties of CLSM are between soil and concrete. CLSM is manufactured from material 
similar to those used to produce concrete and is placed from equipment in a fashion similar to 
that of concrete. Guidance should be taken from Report on Controlled Low Strength Material, 
American Concrete Institute, ACI 1229 R-13, which was referred for drafting this specification.
2 Applications
2.1	
General
The primary application of CLSM is as a structural fill or as a base pavement. Since freshly 
mixed CLSM is in fluid form, it is self levelling and needs no compaction. It is ideal for use 
in restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult e.g. refilling trenches, 
spaces behind walls, around manholes etc.
The strength of the hardened fill material is measured by unconfined compressive strength, 
by the method similar to soil testing of remoulded specimen. The size of test specimen can 
be 38 mm diameter to 150 mm diameter cylinder having length 2 to 2.5 times the diameter. 
Test can also be performed on cubes 100 mm size or 150 mm size. Normally diameter of the 
test specimen should be about 8 times the largest particle with size in the mix. The strength 
has to be specified with size of test specimen to be used, and may change with size of 
specimen and its aspect ratio. Refer IS 2720 part 10 for unconfined compressive strength of 
remoulded soil specimen. The strength of CLSM can generally be in range of 1.5 to 5.0 MPa, 
though fills having strength 0.5 to 8 MPa are possible.
3 Materials
3.1	
Controlled Low Strength Material (CLSM) is a mixture of water, Portland cement, 
sand, fly ash Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) and aggregate. For lower 
strength (say below 2.5 MPa) natural soil, available material excavated from road crust, 
recycled aggregates, marginal or low aggregates (not conforming to IS 383) can also be used. 
Selection of material should be based on required characteristics of the mixture including 
flow- ability and strength. Trial mixes can be done to arrive at proper quality of CLSM.

IRC:SP:63-2018

3.2	
Cement
The cement used shall be any of the following types selected for the intended use.
	
(i)	
Ordinary Portland Cement, IS 269-2015 (OPC)
	
(ii)	
Portland-Pozzolana Cement, IS 1489 Part 1-2015 (PPC)
	
(iii)	 Portland Slag Cement, IS 445-2015(PSC)
	
(iv)	 Composite cement, IS 16415-2015 (blended with granulated slag & flyash) 
Cement can additionally be mixed with more supplementary cementitious 
materials with multiple blending.
The cement content varies from 60 to 120 kg/m3.
3.3	
Supplementary Cementitious Materials:
Coal combustion fly ash or Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBFS) can be used. 
The quantity used from 50 to 750 kg/m3.
3.4	
Aggregates
Aggregates are the major constituent of CLSM mixtures. The type, grading and shape 
of aggregates can affect the physical properties such as flow ability and comprehensive 
strength. Generally aggregates sizes 10 mm down are utilized. Quarry waste of this size 
could be utilized. The sand shall be river sand of required gradation. Silty sand could be 
used. However, sand with clayey fines should not be used. The quantity of total aggregates 
used could be from 1500 to 1700 kg/m3.
3.5	
Admixtures
Air entraining admixtures and foaming agents can be a useful constituent for the CLSM. The 
inclusion of air in CLSM can help to provide improved workability and reduced shrinkage, 
less bleeding, minimum segregation and lower unit weights.
The CLSM mixtures are pumpable but require higher pump pressures. To prevent extended 
setting times, extra cement or an early setting admixture may be added if required. In such 
cases Pretesting should be performed to determine acceptability by providing trial stretches. 
This can give opportunity to effect minor modification in the design.
3.6	
Water
Water that is acceptable for normal concrete mixture is acceptable for CSLM mixtures. 
(Potable water is generally considered satisfactory for mixing of CLSM). Water used is from 
150 to 400 kg/m3.

4 Properties
CLSM can be successfully delivered by conventional concrete pumping equipment or by 
locally preparing in concrete mixers. Proportioning of the mixture is critical. Voids must be 
adequately filled with particles to provide adequate cohesiveness for transport through the 
pump line under pressure without segregation. Hardening time is mainly dependent on the 
type and quantity if cementations material used in CLSM.
Wet density of normal CLSM in place is in the range of 1840 kg/m3 to 2300 kg/m3. 
A CLSM mixture with only fly ash, cement and water should have a density between 1440 to 
1600 kg/m3.
The ability to excavate CLSM in required in future is an important consideration for road 
shoulder work. In general CSLM can be excavated by pickaxes or with light excavating 
equipment. However, the limits for excavability are some what arbitrary, depending upon the 
CLSM mixtures.
CLSM is compatible with Polyethylene materials which are mainly used as protection for the 
underground utilities or as the conduits themselves. As with any back fill care must be taken 
to avoid damaging the protective coating of under ground utility lines.
4.1.1	
Flow Ability
Flow ability is the property that distinguishes CLSM from other fill materials. It enables the 
materials to be self levelling flow into small size excavated portion and readily fill a void and is 
a self compacting without the need for conventional placing and compacting equipment. This 
property represents a major advantage of CLSM compared with conventional fill materials 
that need mechanical placement and need compaction.
4.1.2	
Hardening Time
Hardening Time is the approximate period of time required for CLSM to go from fluid state to 
a hardened state with sufficient working strength. Generally it takes 24 hours under normal 
conditions without admixtures. With admixtures this time is required to brought between 2 
to 4 hours. Broadly speaking, a personal should be able to walk over the laid CLSM within 
about 2 to 4 hours.
Following are the factors affecting the grading time:
	
1.	
Type and quantity of cementations material
	
2.	
Moisture content of CLSM
	
3.	
Permeability and degree of saturation of surrounding materials that is in 
contact with CLSM
	
4.	
Proportioning of CLSM
	
5.	
Mixture and surrounding temperature 
	
6.	
Humidity
	
7.	
Method of filling

5 Mixture Proportioning and Procedure 
Different proportioning of mixes for CLSM have been prescribed in ACI. But trail mixes and 
stretches can be prepared with different proportion to achieve the CLSM, which hardens 
sufficiently in 2 to 4 hours. To achieve required strength of M2 i.e 20 kg/cm2 mixes with 
1 cement and 60 parts of sand/grit/flyash combination is usually required. Trails are, however, 
necessary to fix actual proportions.
Following is the procedure that can be adopted for mixing:
	
1.	
Add 70 to 80% of water required
	
2.	
Add 50 % of the aggregate filler
	
3.	
Add all cement and fly ash required 
	
4.	
Add balance of aggregates
	
5.	
Add balance water 
Generally about 15 min is required to produce a homogenous slurry.
6 Mixing transporting and Placing
6.1	
Mixing
CLSM can be mixed by several methods including ready mix through batching plant conveyed 
by RMC Trucks. It can be also done by concrete mixers etc.
6.2	
Placing
6.3	
The placing of CLSM can be done thorough, conveyor, buckets or pumps depending 
upon the application and its accessibility. As mentioned internal vibration or compaction is not 
required since the CLSM gets considered essential for CLSM.
7 Quality Control
The extent of a quality control of CLSM can vary as per experience, application and basic 
materials utilized and level of quality desired. Quality control of CLSM can be as simple as 
a visual check of the completed work, where standard pretested mixtures are being used. 
Mould cubes should be taken and tested as for normal concrete.
