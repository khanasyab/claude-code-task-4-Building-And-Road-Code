PAVEMENT CONSTRUCTION
1.
INTRODUCTION
1.1.
A large variety of
equipment,
tools and
appliances
is
needed for bituminous pavement
construction.
Modern
construc-
tion techniques need sophisticated equipment and even the specifica-
tions
which
permit
manual
mixing and laying involve the
use
of
smaller tools
and appliances.
As such some guidance
is necessary
for
field
engineers regarding the use and proper upkeep of different
items of equipment, tools and appliances. This will help in systematic
procurement,
planning
and
execution
of works
and
to
exercise
requisite quality control in the field.
1.2.
It is with the
above
objective
that
this
Recommended
Practice has been prepared by the Bituminous Pavements Committee
(personnel given below).
It was then
processed and
approved
by
the
Specifications and
Standards
Committee in their meeting held
on 21st December,
1977.
Later
it
was
finally
approved
by
the
Executive Committee in their meeting field on the 22nd
April,
1978
and by the Council in their 93rd meeting held on the 3rd June 1978.

IRC
: 72-1978
In view of the above
inherent
advantages
of bulk
supply
of
bitumen,
it is envisaged that this supply method
will become increas-
ingly popular in the country.
10.2.2.
Where the demand for bitumen is fairly large,
it would
be desirable to establish bitumen storage depots which would receive
and
store
bulk
bitumen
and
distribute
it to individual customers.
Suggested layouts for storage depots are given in Figs. 3 and 4. These
layouts should be considered as illustrative and may need alterations
depending upon the actual site conditions.
10.2.3.
Bitumen tankers:
Bulk bitumen lorries
are
intended
to transport bulk bitumen either directly from the refineries or
from
the bulk storage depots to the
points
of
actual
consumption.
The
lorries are fitted with tanks of 5,000 to 15,000 litre capacity
and
are
used to operate within economic distance from the refineries and
the
storage depots.
They are equipped with
arrangements
to
maintain
temperature of bitumen during
transit.
Oil
fired
heaters
are used
for this purpose.
Unloading of the lorries
is usually carried
out by
compressed air or gear pumps.
A sketch of the bulk bitumen
lorry
is given in Fig.
5.
10.2.4.
Bitumen
boilers:
Bitumen
boilers
are
available
in
100-10,000 litre capacity range. These are portable and are generally
fired by oil, coal or fire-wood.
The Indian
Standard
IS: 2094-1974
"Specification for Heaters for Tar and Bitumen" lays down
the
re-
quirements of such boilers.
The
following nominal capacities
have
been prescribed in the above standard:
100, 300, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 5000, 7500
and
10,000
litres.
10.2.5.
Arrangement
for
lifting
asphalt drums:
Where bitu-
men
is
supplied
through
packed
steel-drums, an arrangement for
lifting the drums to the inlet of bitumen boilers
becomes
necessary.
This normally consists of a chain-pulley system.
The arrangement,
if it is an adjunct to the boiler, should be so designed that the
boiler
is
stable
under
all
normal
working conditions.
A small oil fired
bitumen boiler with the chain pulley arrangement for
lifting
drums
is depicted in Fig. 6.
10.3.
Bitumen Spraying Equipment
10.3.1.
Bitumen
pressure
distributors:
This
is
a mechanical
equipment for spraying bitumen for surface dressing or grouting spe-
cifications, and
is convenient to use in conjuntion with bulk bitumen

Fig. 6.
An arrangement for lifting bitumen drums
supply.
It consists of a pneumatic tyred lorry on which
is mounted
an insulated tank or a tank with a heating system, usually
oil
fired
burners, with direct heating from the flues passing through the
tank.
A power driven pump or a compressed air pump designed to handle
bitumen is usually fitted to the vehicle.
A spraybar unit with
nozz-
les is fitted at the rear of the tank through which bitumen
is
applied
under
pressure
on
to
the road surface.
The quantity of bitumen
flow is controlled by a metering
device.
The
speed
at
which
the
vehicle
is
operated
controls
the
rate
of
spread
of
the bitumen.
Indian
Standard,
IS:2093-1974
" Specification
for Distributors for
Hot Tar and Bitumen" deals with the requirements of this equipment.
The following sizes are listed in the I.S.:
.
1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 5000, 7500, & 10,000 litres.
10.3.2.
Bitumen hand spraying equipment:
For
small
works
not warranting the
induction
of a bitumen pressure distributor, the
usual
method
of
spraying
bitumen on
the
road
surface
is
by
small
pumps attached
to
the
bitumen boiler itself.
These pumps
may
be
either
mechanically
operated
or
hand-operated.
The
equipment
assembly
consists
of
the
pump,
a
strainer
attached

on the pump suction pipe, a flexible pipe, a spray lance, and a spray
nozzle.
The rate of application of the bitumen on the road
surface
can
be
varied
according
to
the
height
of
the
nozzle
above the
ground.
Uniformity of spraying is controlled by the angle at which
the spray bar
is kept.
An angle of 45° ensures uniform spraying.
10.4.
Mixing Equipment
10.4.1.
Hand operated drum mixers:
For small
premix
jobs
and in situations where mixing plant is not available, hand
operated
drum mixers are usually employed.
The drum mixers can either be
of improvised
type
(using
second-hand
oil
drums)
or
a specially
manufactured unit.
Sketch of an improvised drum mixer is given in Fig.

portable by
providing
wheels with castors and a draw bar for
being
pulled by a tractor or
the suitable arrangement.
10.4.2.
Cold mixing plants:
Cold mixing plant is
used where
cold
mixing
is
permitted
by
the
specification.
Indian
Standard
IS:5435-1969,
"Specification
for
Cold
Asphalt Macadam Mixing
Plants" covers the requirements of such plants.
The
plant
consists
of an
aggregate
feeder,
a
mixing
unit
with
elevator and bitumen
heating and storage unit.
10.4.3.
Small capacity hot-mix plants:
Small capacity mixing
plants which do not have elaborate system for heating the aggregates
are used for premix work such as open graded carpets
and
bitumen
macadam.
Such plants have an arrangement for drying the aggrega-
tes either in a separate drier unit or in the mixing drum
itself.
The
former type is covered by
IS:5890-1970,
"Specification
for Mobile
Hot Mix Asphalt Plant, Lignt Duty".
This standard requires that a
separate provison be made for a drier unit and in no case
shall
the
mixing
be
carried
out
in
the
drier
drum.
The capacity of such
plant
as
standardized
by
the
IS
is
either
3-5 tonnes/hr.
or 6-10
tonnes/hr.
Light duty plants where the mixing drum contains
burners
for
drying the aggregates are also available in the country.
10.4.4.
Large
capacity
hot-mix
plants:
Hot mix
plants are
required for major bituminous works
such
as
bituminous macadam
and asphaltic concrete.
The Indian Standard IS:3066-1965
"Specifi-
cations for Hot Asphalt Mixing Plants" covers
the
requirements
of
such plants.
The capacities of the plant as listed below are indicated
in the above Indian Standard:
20-30 tonnes/hour
30-45 tonnes/hour

These plants can be either mobile or static.
Further, these can
be of the continuous type or batch type.
The important components
of the plant are
:
(i) Arrangement for cold feed
(ii) Drier unit for heating the aggregates
(iii) Screens and bins for separating and storing
(iv) Bitumen heating and storage tank
(v) Arrangement
for
accurately
proportioning

Equipment for Transport of Bituminous Mix
10.5.1.
Wheel barrows for
small
scale
work:
The
premixed
material
is
conveyed
from
the
mixer
to the place where
it is to be
laid by means of wheel
barrows.
Wheel
barrows
can
either be of
single
wheel
type
or
two
wheel
type.
The former
is covered by
IS: 2431-1963 "Specification for Steel Wheel Barrows (Single
Wheel
type)' and the latter by IS:4184-1967 "Specification for
Steel
Wheel
Barrows (with two Wheels)".
They are
normally
available
in
the
following nominal
capacities:
Single-wheel wheel barrows
:
60 and 85 litre
Two-wheel wheel barrows
:
75, 85, 110 and 140
litre
10.5.2.
Tipper
trucks:
For
large
scale
bituminous
work,
especially in conjunction with hot mix
plants,
it
is
necessary to use
tipper trucks for conveying
bituminous
mixtures
from
the
asphalt
plants
to
paver
finishers.
These
tipper
trucks
can conveniently
empty the bituminous mixtures
into
the
hoppers
of
paver finishers
directly.
Trucks
of 5-7.5
tonne
capacity
are generally used.
The
parts of the truck which come in contact with the bituminous mixture
should
be
clean,
smooth
and
free
from
cracks and holes so as to
prevent the liquid bitumen from flowing out.
The
trucks
should be
provided
with
tarpaulins
to
prevent
loss
of heat from bituminous
mixture during transit in winter.
Double-walled trucks are also used
for this purpose.
10.6.
Equipment for Spreading Stone Chips (Gritters)
For
large
scale
bituminous
work
involving the spreading of
aggregates,
it is convenient to use some form of mechanical spreader
also known as gritter.
There
are
two
types of aggregate spreaders
available
:
(i) Towed hopper type in which a large hopper with the spreading mech-
anism
is towed by the bitumen distributor
(ii) Tail board type aggregate spreader which spreads
the
aggregates
as
they are discharged from a
lorry
travelling
in reverse.
This is illus-
trated in Fig.
1.1.
10.7.
Equipment for Spreading and Laying Bituminous Courses
10.7.1.
For
efficient
spreading
and
laying
of bituminous
courses modern specifications require the use of paver
finishers.
A
schematic diagram of a paver finisher is given in Fig.
12.
IS:3251-1965,
"Specification
for
Asphalt
Paver
Finisher"
covers the
requirements
for
this
item
of equipment.
The paver
finisher has a hopper into which the bituminous mix is dumped.

Aggregate spreader
Fig. 12.
Paver finisher
hopper has an adjustable opening at the
bottom through which
the
mix can flow out on to the road surface as the paver moves forward.
The equipment has a
screed
board
attached to
it
which strikes off
and imparts
compaction
to the
mix.
In order to prevent the
mix
from sticking to the screed plate,
arrangement is also
provided
for
heating the same at the start of the operations on a cold day.

Equipment for manual spreading:
When paver finishers
are not available for laying the
bituminous course,
manual method
of laying is resorted to.
A drag spreader can be used
with advant*
age for hand spreading.
A sketch of
suitable
drag broom is given
in Fig. 13.
Small tools such as camber board,
templates,
shovels, spades
and
rakes
are
also
needed
for
hand
spreading.

Equipment for Mastic Asphalt
A mastic
cooker
is
needed to
prepare mastic asphalt.
This
cooks the aggregate and bitumen mixture to
temperatures of 170 to
180 degrees centigrade.
An
arrangement
for
agitating the mix
is
provided
inside
the
cooker.
The
period
of
cooking
is
generally
about three hours for ensuring a thorough mix.

CARE IN OPERATION AND UPKEEP OF EQUIPMENT
11.1.
The efficient operation of equipment and tools and their
longevity
depends
to
a
large
extent
on
observing
set rules and
procedures for handling and maintaining them.
While
suppliers
of
equipment normally indicate detailed procedures for the maintenance
and operation of equipment, a few simple
rules for the guidance
of
the field engineers are set forth below
:
11.2.
Bitumen Boilers
(i) When the boiler is empty,
it should be thoroughly cleaned
of all foreign matter before
it
cools down
and
the
. thin
bitumen
sets
and
becomes
hard.
This
procedure
for
cleaning should be followed every day.
(ii) The
portable
boilers
should
be
handled
very carefully
while being
towed
especially when loaded.
They should
not be towed by fast moving vehicles.
(iii) The wheels and the pivoting carriage should be oiled daily.
(iv) Before starting to
heat
the boiler in
the morning, the in-
side should be inspected
for
the
presence
of any
water
which might have collected during the
night.
If water
is
present, the same should be dried before bitumen is poured
in.
The fire in the fire box should be
lit only when
there
is at least some quantity of bitumen in the
boiler.
26



======================================================================
PAGE 31 of 40
======================================================================
IRC
: 72-1978
(v) Boiler should never be completely filled with bitumen. The
bitumen level should be always at least 15 cm lower.
(vi) The bitumen
should
be stirred from time to
time with a
long pole to ensure even distribution of heat.
11.3.
Bitumen Hand Spraying Equipment
(i) The strainers inside the bitumen boilers should be
inspec-
ted to see that they are not blocked.
If so, they should be
cleaned with a blow-lamp and kerosene.
(ii) The sprayer nozzle
should
be
cleaned
before
and
after
each day's work.
(iii) Pumping should
be
started
only
after
the
bitumen
has
reached the appropriate application temperature.
(iv) The flexible hose connecting
the
heater
with
the
nozzle
should be
inspected
for any
obstruction.
The best way
of clearing the obstruction
is to blow hot
air
through
the
hose.
(v) The spray
lance should
be
checked for cleanliness
and
if it
is blocked with bitumen,
it
should
be
cleaned
with
kerosene.
(vi) As soon as pumping is stopped, the hose and
the
spraying
parts should be hung up
in
a
vertical
position
so that
bitumen is drained out.
(vii) Under no circumstances should the hose
pipe
be
discon-
nected if there is any pressure registered on
the
pressure
gague as this may result in bitumen being splashed out and
somebody being burnt.
(viii) As soon as spraying commences, the fire should
be made
low.
Otherwise there is danger of
overheating
the
bitu-
men and also burning the plates of the heater.
(ix) Once every month the whole pumping unit should be taken
out and thoroughly cleaned with kerosene and the
glands,
gaskets and washers examined and replaced, if necessary.
11.4.
Hand
Operated Drum Mixers
(i) The drum
mixers
should
not
be towed by
fast moving
vehicles.

inside
the
mixer
should
be checked periodically for tightness.
The hinges
of
the
door of the mixer should
be
examined and
lubricated, if
necessary.
11.5.
Mixing Plants of Small Capacity
(i) Adequate attention should be paid for lubricating
the
dri-
ving shafts, bearings, chains, hinged joints and all moving
parts.
(ii) Lubricating oils and grease
should
be
replaced
periodi-
cally.

(iv) The mixer plates should be examined and
it should be en-
sured that the bolts are in tight position.
(v) The sliding door should be examined
for
case
of opera-
tion
and any sticking bitumen.
It should be cleared
peri-
odically.
(vi) The gear wheels provided for mobility
of
the
equipment
should be checked and lubricated periodically.
(vii) The mixer
box
must
be
cleaned
thoroughly
after
each
working day.
(viii)
If a burner
is provided inside the mixing drums,
the
same
should be cleaned before and after each day's work. Noz-
zles should not be tampered with.
(ix) The burner should always be kept free of dust.
