STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS AND CODE OF
PRACTICE FOR ROAD BRIDGES
IRC:6-2014
INTRODUCTION
The brief history of the Bridge Code given in the Introduction to Section
I "General Features of
Design" generally applies to Section
1
1 also. The draft of Section
1
1 for "Loads and Stresses", as
discussed at Jaipur Session of the Indian Roads Congress in
1 946, was considered further in
a number of meetings of the Bridges Committee for finalisation.
In the years 1957 and 1958,
the work of finalising the draft was pushed on vigorously by the Bridges Committee.
In
the Bridges Committee meeting
held
at Bombay
in August
1958,
all
the comments
received
till then on the different clauses of this Section were disposed
off finally and a
drafting Committee consisting of S/Shri S.B. Joshi, K.K. Nambiar, K.F. Antia and S.K. Ghosh
was appointed to work in conjunction with the officers of the Roads Wing of the Ministry for
finalising this Section.
This Committee
at
its meeting
held
at New Delhi
in September 1958 and
later through
correspondences finalized Section
II of the Bridge Code, which was printed
in 1958 and
reprinted in 1962 and 1963.
The Second
Revision
of Section
II
of the
IRC:6 Code
(1964
edition)
included
all
the
amendments, additions and alterations made by the Bridges Specifications and Standards
(BSS) Committee in their meetings held from time to time.
The Executive Committee of the Indian Roads Congress approved the publication of the
Third Revision in metric units in 1966.
The Fourth Revision of Section
II of the Code (2000 Edition) included
all the amendments,
additions and alterations made by the BSS Committee
in their meetings held from time to
time and was reprinted
in 2002 with Amendment No.1, reprinted
in 2004 with Amendment
No. 2 and again reprinted in 2006 with Amendment Nos. 3, 4 and 5.
The Bridges Specifications and Standards Committee and the IRC Council at various meetings
approved certain amendments
viz. Amendment No. 6 of November 2006 relating to Sub-
Clauses 218.2, 222.5, 207.4 and Appendix-2, Amendment No. 7 of February 2007 relating to
Sub-Clauses of 213.7, Note 4 of Appendix-I and 218.3, Amendment No. 8 of
January 2008
relating to Sub-Clauses 214.2(a), 214.5.1.1 and 214.5.2 and new Clause 212 on Wind load.
As approved by the BSS Committee and IRC Council in 2008, the Amendment No. 9 of May
2009
incorporating changes to Clauses 202.3, 208, 209.7 and 218.5 and Combination of
Loads for limit state design of bridges
has been
introduced
in Appendix-3, apart from
the
new Clause 222 on Seismic Force for design of bridges.
The Bridges Specifications and Standards Committee
in
its meeting held on 26th October,
2009 further approved
certain modifications to Clause 210.1, 202.3, 205, Note below Clause
208,
209.1, 209.4, 209.7, 222.5.5, Table 8, Note below Table 8, 222.8, 222.9, Table
1 and
deletion of Clause 213.8, 214.5.1.2 and Note below para 8 of Appendix-3. The Convenor
of B-2 Committee was authorized to incorporate these modifications
in the draft for
Fifth
Revision of IRC:6, in the light of the comments of some members. The Executive Committee,

SCOPE
IRC:6-2014
The object of the Standard Specifications and Code of Practice
is to establish a common
procedure for the design and construction of road bridges in India. This publication
is meant
to serve as a guide to both the design engineer and the construction engineer but compliance
with the rules therein does not relieve them
in any way of their responsibility for the stability
and soundness of the structure designed and erected by them. The design and construction
of road bridges require an extensive and through knowledge of the science and technique
involved and should be entrusted only to specially qualified engineers with adequate practical
experience in bridge engineering and capable of ensuring careful execution of work.
201 CLASSIFICATION
201.1
Road bridges and culverts shall be divided into classes according to the loadings
they are designed to carry.
IRC Class 70R Loading: This loading
is to be normally adopted on
all roads on which
permanent bridges and culverts are constructed. Bridges designed for Class 70R Loading
should be checked for Class A Loading also as under certain conditions, heavier stresses
may occur under Class A Loading.
IRC Class AA Loading: This loading is to be adopted within certain municipal limits, in certain
existing or contemplated industrial areas, in other specified areas, and along certain specified
highways. Bridges designed for Class AA Loading should be checked for Class A Loading
also, as under certain conditions, heavier stresses may occur under Class A Loading.
IRC Class A Loading: This loading is to be normally adopted on all roads on which permanent
bridges and culverts are constructed.
IRC Class B Loading: This loading is to be normally adopted for timber bridges.
For particulars of the above four types of loading, see Clause 204.
201.2
Existing bridges which were not originally constructed or later strengthened to take
one of the above specified I.R.C. Loadings will be classified by giving each a number equal
to that of the highest standard load class whose effects
it can safely withstand.
Annex A gives the essential data regarding the limiting loads
in each bridge's class, and
forms the basis for the classification of bridges.
201.3
Individual bridges and culverts designed to take electric tramways or other special
loadings and not constructed to take any of the loadings described
in Clause 201.1 shall be
classified in the appropriate load class indicated
in Clause 201.2.

======================================================================
IRC:6-2014
Notes
:
i)
The snow loads may be based be based on actual observation or past records in the
particular area or local practices,
if existing.
ii)
Temperature effects (F^^) in this context is not the frictional force due to the movement
of bearing but forces that are caused by the restraint effects.
iii)
The wave
forces
shall
be
determined
by
suitable
analysis
considering
drawing
and
inertia forces
etc. on single structural members based on
rational methods or
model studies.
In case of group of piles,
piers
etc., proximity effects
shall also be
considered.
iv)
For bridges built in grade or cross-fall, the bearings shall normally be set level by varying
the thickness of the plate situated between the upper face of the bearing and lower
^
face of the beam or by any other suitable arrangement. However, where the bearings
are required to be set parallel to the inclined grade or cross-fall of the superstructure,
an allowance shall be made for the longitudinal and transverse components of the
vertical loads on the bearings.
202.2.2
All mennbers shall be designed to sustain safely most critical combination of various
loads, forces and stresses that can
co-exist and
all
calculations
shall tabulate
distinctly
the various combinations of the above loads and stresses covered by the design. Besides
temperature, effect of environment on durability shall be considered as per relevant codes.
202.3
Combination of Loads and Forces and Permissible Increase in Stresses
The load combination shown
in Table
1
shall be adopted
for working out stresses
in the
members. The permissible increase of stresses in various members due to these combinations
are also indicated therein. These combinations of forces are not applicable for working out
base pressure on foundations for which provision made in relevant IRC Bridge Code shall be
adopted. For calculating stresses in members using working stress method of design the load
combination shown in Table 1 shall be adopted.
The
load
combination
as shown
in Annex B
shall
be adopted
for
limit
state
design
approach.
203 DEAD LOAD
The dead load carried by a girder or member shall consist of the portion of the weight of the
superstructure (and the fixed loads carried thereon) which
is supported wholly or in part by
the girder or member including its own weight. The following unit weights of materials shall be
used in determining loads, unless the unit weights have been determined by actual weighing
of representative samples of the materials
in question,
in which case the actual weights as
thus determined shall be used.

4)
The gradient effect due to temperature is considered
in the load combinations MB and
I MB. The reduced live load (Q)
is indicated as 0.5.
Its effects (F^, F^, and FJ are also
shown as 0.5, as 0.5 stands for the reduced
live load to be considered
in this case.
However for F^
it is shown as
1
, since
it has effects of dead load besides reduced live
load. Q.^ being a factor of live load as shown as
1
. Whenever a fraction of live load 0.5
shown
in the above Table under column Q
is specified, the associated effects due to
live load {Q.^,
F^,
F^, F^and FJ shall be considered corresponding to the associated
fraction of live load. When the gradient effect is considered, the effects,
if any, due to
overall rise or fall of temperature of the structure shall also be considered.
5)
Seismic effect during erection stage
is reduced to half in load combination IX when
construction phase does not exceed 5 years.
6)
The load combinations (VIII and IX) relate to the construction stage of a new bridge. For
repair, rehabilitation and retrofitting, the load combination shall be project-specific.

For bridges classified under Clause 201.1, the design
live load
shall consist of
standard wheeled or tracked vehicles or trains of vehicles as illustrated
in Figs.
1 to 3 and
Annex A. The trailers attached to the driving unit are not to be considered as detachable.
204.1.2
Within the kerb to kerb width of the roadway, the standard vehicle or train shall be
assumed to travel parallel to the length of the bridge and to occupy any position which will
produce maximum stresses provided that the minimum clearances between a vehicle and
the roadway face of kerb and between two passing or crossing vehicles, shown in Figs. 1 to
3, are not encroached upon.
204.1.3
For each standard
vehicle or
train,
all
the axles
of a
unit of vehicles
shall be
considered as acting simultaneously in a position causing maximum stresses.

check for congestion of vehicular live load on the carriageway shall be considered.
In the
absence of any stipulated value, the congestion factor, as mentioned
in Table 3 shall be
considered. This factor shall be used as a multiplying factor on the global effect of vehicular
live load only. Under this condition, horizontal force due to braking/acceleration, centrifugal
action and temperature gradient effect need not be included, but the effect of live load impact

205 REDUCTION
IN THE LONGITUDINAL EFFECT ON
BRIDGES ACCOMMODATING MORE THAN
TWO TRAFFIC LANES
Reduction
in the longitudinal effect on bridges having more than two traffic lanes due to the
low probability that all lanes will be subjected to the characteristic loads simultaneously shall
be in accordance with the Table shown below:
Number of lanes
Reduction in longitudinal effect
For two lanes
No reduction
For three lanes
10% reduction
For four lanes
20% reduction
For five or more lanes
20% reduction
Notes:
1 )
However,
it should be ensured that the reduced longitudinal effects are not less severe
than the longitudinal effect, resulting from simultaneous loads on two adjacent lanes.
Longitudinal effects mentioned above are bending moment, shear force and torsion in
longitudinal direction.
2)
The above Table
is applicable for individually supported superstructure of multi-laned
carriageway.
In the case of separate sub-structure and foundations, the number of lanes
supported by each of them is to be considered while working out the reduction percentage.
In the case of combined sub-structure and foundations, the total number of lanes for both
the carriageway is to be considered while working out the reduction percentage.
206 FOOT OVER BRIDGE, FOOTWAY, KERB, RAILINGS,
PARAPET AND CRASH BARRIERS
The horizontal force specified for footway, kerb,
railings, parapet and crash barriers
in this
section need not be considered for the design of main structural members of the bridge.
However, the connection between kerb/railings/papapet, crash barrier and the deck should
be adequately designed and detailed.

206.1
For
all parts of bridge floors accessible only to pedestrians and animals and for
all footways the loading shall be 400 kg/m^. For the design of foot over bridges the loading
shall be taken as 500 kg/m^. Where crowd loads are
likely to occur, such as, on bridges
located near towns, which are either centres of pilgrimage or where large congregational fairs
are held seasonally, the intensity of footway loading shall be increased from 400 kg/m^ to
500 kg/m^. When crowd load
is considered, the bridge should also be designed for the case
of entire carriageway being occupied by crowd load.
206.2
Kerbs, 0.6 m or more in width, shall be designed for the above loads and for a local
lateral force of 750 kg per metre, applied horizontally at top of the kerb.
If kerb width
is less
than 0.6 m, no live load shall be applied in addition to the lateral load specified above.
206.3
In bridges designed for any of the loadings described
in Clause 204.1, the main
girders, trusses, arches, or other members supporting the footways shall be designed for the
following live loads per square metre for footway area, the loaded length of footway taken in
each case being, such as, to produce the worst effects on the member under consideration:
a)
For effective span of 7.5 m or less, 400 kg/m^ or 500 kg/m^ as the case may be,
based on Sub-Clause 206.1.
b)
For effective spans of over 7.5 m but not exceeding 30 m, the intensity of load
shall be determined according to the equation
:
P = pi_ M0L-3Q0
9
J
c)
For effective spans of over 30 m, the
intensity of load
shall be determined
according to the equation
:
4800^ M6.5-W^
P =
P^-260 +
where,
15
J
= 400 kg/m^ or 500 kg/m^ as the case may be, based on Sub-Clause 206.1 .When
crowd load
is considered for design of the bridge, the reduction mentioned
in
this clause will not be applicable.
P
= the live load in kg/m^
-
L = the effective span of the main girder, truss or arch in m, and
W = width of the footway in m
206.4
Each part of the footway shall be capable of carrying a wheel load of 4 tonne, which
shall be deemed to include impact, distributed over a contact area 300 mm
in diameter; the
permissible working stresses shall be increased by 25 percent to meet this provision. This
provision need not be made where vehicles cannot mount the footway as
in the case of a
footway separated from the roadway by means of an insurmountable obstacle, such as, truss
or a main girder.
Note
; A footway kerb shall be considered mountable by vehicles.

206.5
The Pedestrian/Bicycle Railings/Parapets
The pedestrian/bicycle railings/parapets can be of a large variety of construction. The design
loads for two basic types are given below:-
i)
Type:
Solid/partially filled
in parapet continuously cantilevering along
full length from
deck level.
Loading: Horizontal and vertical load of 150 kg/m acting simultaneously on the top level
of the parapet.
ii)
Type:
Frame type with discrete vertical posts cantilevering from the curb/deck with
minimum two rows of horizontal
rails
(third row bring the curb
itself, or curb
replaced by a low level
3'"^ rail). The rails may be simply supported or continuous
over the posts.
Loading: Each horizontal
railing designed for horizontal and vertical load of 150 kg/m,
acting simultaneously over the
rail. The
filler portion, supported between any
two horizontal rails and vertical rails should be designed to resist horizontal load
of 150 kg/m^. The posts to resist horizontal load of 150 kg/m X spacing between
posts in metres acting on top of the post.
206.6
Crash Barriers
Crash barriers are designed to withstand the impact of vehicles of certain weights at certain
angle while travelling at the specified speed. They are expected to guide the vehicle back
on the road while keeping the level of damage to vehicle as well as to the barriers within
acceptable limits.
Following are the three categories for different applications:
Category
Application
ContaDnment for
P-1: Normal Containment
Bridges carrying expressway, or
equivalent
15 kN vehicle at 110 km/h, and
20° angle of impact
P-2: Low Containment
All other bridges except bridge
over railways
15 kN vehicle at 80 km/h and
20° angle of impact
P-3: High Containment
At hazardous and high risk
locations, over busy railway lines,
complex interchanges, etc.
300 kN vehicle at 60 km/h and
20° angle of impact
The barriers can be of rigid type, using cast-in-situ/precast reinforced concrete panels, or of
flexible type, constructed using metallic cold-rolled and/or hot-rolled sections. The metallic
type, called semi-rigid type, suffer large dynamic deflection of the order of 0.9 to
1 .2 m impact,
whereas the
'rigid' concrete type suffer comparatively negligible deflection. The efficacy of
the two types of barriers
is established on the basis of
full size tests carried out by the
laboratories specializing in such testing. Due to the complexities of the structural action, the
value of impact force cannot be quantified.
21



======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 94
======================================================================
IRC:6-2014
A certificate from such laboratory can be the only basis of acceptance of the semi-rigid type,
in which case all the design details and construction details tested by the laboratory are to be
followed
in toto without modifications and without changing relative strengths and positions
of any of the connections and elements.
For the rigid type of barrier, the same method is acceptable. However, in absence of testing/test
certificate, the minimum design resistance shown in Table 4 should be built into the section.

Vehicle Barriers/Pedestrian Railing between Footpath and Carriageway
Where considerable pedestrian traffic
is expected, such as, in/near townships,
rigid type of
reinforced concrete crash barrier should be provided separating the vehicular traffic fronn the
same. The design and construction details should be as per Clause 206.6. For any other type
of rigid barrier, the strength should be equivalent to that of rigid RCC type.
For areas of low intensity of pedestrian traffic, semi-rigid type of barrier, which suffers large
deflections can be adopted.
207 TRAMWAY LOADING

When a road bridge carries tram
lines, the
live load due to the type of tram cars
sketched
in Fig. 4 shall be computed and shall be considered to occupy a 3 m width of
roadway.

208.5
The span length to be considered for arriving at the impact percentages specified in
Clause 208.2 and 208.3 shall be as follows:
a)
For spans simply supported
or continuous or for arches
the effective span on which the load
is placed.
b)
For bridges having
cantilever arms without suspended spans
the effective overhang of the cantilever arms reduced by 25 percent for loads
on the cantilever arms and the effective span between supports for loads on
the main span.
c)
For bridges having cantilever arms with suspended span
the
effective
overhang
of
the
cantilever arm
plus
half
the
length
of
the
suspended span
for loads on the cantilever arm, the effective length of the
suspended span
for loads on
the suspended span and
the
effective span
between supports for load on the main span.
Note
:
For individual members of a bridge, such as, a cross girder or deck slab, etc. the value of
L mentioned
in Clause 208.2 or the spans mentioned
in clause 208.3 shall be the effective
span of the member under consideration.
208.6
In any bridge structure where there
is a filling of not less than 0.6 m including the
road crust, the impact percentage to be allowed
in the design shall be assumed to be one-
half of what is specified in Clauses 208.2 and 208.3.
208.7
For calculating the pressure on the bearings and on the top surface of the bed
blocks,
full value of the appropriate impact percentage shall be allowed. But, for the design
of piers abutments and structures, generally below the level of the top of the bed block, the
appropriate impact percentage shall be multiplied by the factor given below:
a)
For calculating the pressure at the
bottom surface of the bed block
....

208.8
In the design of members subjected to among other stresses, direct tension, such
as, hangers
in a bowstring girder bridge and
in the design of member subjected to direct
compression, such
as, spandrel columns or walls
in an open spandrel
arch, the impact
percentage shall be taken the same as that applicable to the design of the corresponding
member or members of the floor system which transfer loads to the tensile or compressive
members in question.
208.9
These clauses on impact do not apply to the design of suspension bridges and foot
over bridges.
In cable suspended bridges and
in other bridges where live load to dead load
ratio is high, the dynamic effects such as vibration and fatigue shall be considered. For long
span foot over bridges (with frequency less than 5 Hz and 1.5 Hz in vertical and horizontal
direction) the dynamic effects shall be considered,
if necessary, for which specialist literature
may be referred.
209 WIND LOAD
209.1
This clause
is applicable to normal span bridges with individual span length up to
150 m or for bridges with height of pier up to 100 m. For
all other bridges including cable
stayed bridges, suspension bridges and ribbon bridges specialist literature shall be used for
computation of design wind load.
209.1.1
The
wind pressure
acting on a bridge depends on the geographical
locations,
the terrain of surrounding area, the fetch of terrain upwind of the
site
location, the
local
topography, the height of bridge above the ground, horizontal dimensions and cross-section
of bridge or
its element under consideration. The maximum pressure
is due to gusts that
cause local and transient fluctuations about the mean wind pressure.
All structures shall be designed for the wind forces as specified
in Clause 209.3 and 209.4.
These forces shall be considered to act in such a direction that the resultant stresses in the
member under consideration are maximum.
In addition to applying the prescribed loads in the design of bridge elements, stability against
overturning, uplift and sliding due to wind shall be considered.
209.2
The wind speed at the location of bridge shall be based on basic wind speed map as
shown
in Fig. 6. The intensity of wind force shall be based on hourly mean wind speed and
pressure as shown
in Table 5. The hourly mean wind speed and pressure values
given
in
Table 5 corresponds to a basic wind speed of 33 m/s, return period of 100 years, for bridges
situated in plain terrain and terrain with obstructions, with a flat topography. The hourly mean
wind pressure shall be appropriately modified depending on the location of bridge for other

obstructions having height up to 10 m. Terrain with obstructions refers to a terrain with
numerous closely spaced structures, forests or trees upto 10 m
in height with few
isolated
tall structures or terrain with large number of high closed spaced obstruction
like structures, trees forests etc.
3)
For other values of basic wind speed as indicated
in Fig.
6, the hourly mean wind
speed shall be obtained by multiplying the corresponding wind speed value by the
ratio
of basic wind speed
at the
location
of bridge
to the value corresponding
to
Table 5,
(i.e., 33 m/sec.)
^
4)
The hourly mean wind pressure at an appropriate height and terrain shall be obtained by
multiplying the corresponding pressure value for base wind speed as indicated
in Table 5
by the ratio of square of basic wind speed at the location of wind to square of base wind
speed corresponding to Table 5 (i.e., 33 m/sec).
5)
If the topography
(hill,
ridge escarpment or
cliff)
at the
structure
site can cause
acceleration or tunneling
of wind, the wind pressure
shall be further increased by
20 percent as stated in Note 4.
6)
For construction stages, the hourly mean wind pressure shall be taken as 70 percent
of the value calculated as stated
in Note 4 and 5.
7)
For the design of foot over bridges in the urban situations and in plain terrain, a minimum
horizontal wind load of 1.5 kN/m^ (150 kg/m^) and 2 kN/m^ (200 kg/m^) respectively
shall be considered to be acting on the frontal area of the bridge.

209.3
Design Wind Force on Superstructure
209.3.1
The superstructure
shall be designed
for wind induced
horizontal forces (acting
in the transverse and longitudinal direction) and
vertical loads acting simultaneously. The
assumed wind direction shall be perpendicular to longitudinal axis for a straight structure or
to an axis chosen to maximize the wind induced effects for a structure curved in plan.
209.3.2 The transverse wind force on a bridge superstructure shall be estimated as specified
in Clause 209.3.3 and acting on the area calculated as follows:
a)
For a deck structure:
The area of the structure as seen
in elevation including the floor system and
railing,
less area
of perforations
in hand
railing
or parapet walls
shall be
considered. For open and solid parapets, crash barriers and railings, the solid
area in normal projected elevation of the element shall be considered.
b)
For truss structures:
Appropriate area as specified in Annex C shall be taken.
c)
For construction stages
The area at all stages of construction shall be the appropriate unshielded solid
area of structure.
209.3.3 The transverse wind force
(in N) shall be taken as acting at the centroids of the
appropriate areas and horizontally and shall be estimated from:
^
F^ = P^xA^xGxC^
where,
is the hourly mean wind pressure in N/m^ (see Table 5),
is the solid area in m^
(see Clause 209.3.2), G
is the gust factor and
is the drag coefficient depending on the
geometric shape of bridge deck.
For highway bridges up to a span of 150 m, which are generally not sensitive to dynamic
action of wind, gust factor shall be taken as 2.0.
The drag coefficient for slab bridges with width to depth ratio of cross-section,
i.e b/d > 10
shall be taken as 1.1.
For bridge decks supported by single beam or box girder,
C,^ shall be taken as 1.5 for b/d
ratio of 2 and as 1.3
if b/d > 6. For intermediate b/d ratios C^ shall be interpolated. For deck
supported by two or more beams or box girders, where the ratio of clear distance between
the beams of boxes to the depth does not exceed 7, C^ for the combined structure shall be
taken as
1 .5 times C^ for the single beam or box.
For deck supported by single plate girder
it shall be taken as 2.2. When the deck is supported
by two or more plate girders, for the combined structure C^ shall be taken as 2(1 +c/20cy), but
not more than 4, where c is the centre to centre distance of adjacent girders, and d
is the
depth of windward girder.
For truss girder superstructure the drag coefficients shall be derived as given in Annex C.
For other type of deck cross-sections
shall be ascertained either from wind tunnel tests or,
if available, for similar type of structure, specialist literature shall be referred to.

PAGE 40 of 94
======================================================================
IRC:6-2014
209.3.4 The longitudinal force on bridge superstructure
(in N) shall be taken as 25 percent
and 50 percent of the transverse wind load as calculated as per Clause 209.3.3 for beam/
box/plate girder bridges and truss girder bridges respectively.
209.3.5 An upward or downward vertical wind load
(in N) acting at the centroid of the
appropriate areas, for all superstructures shall be derived from:
F^= P^xA^xGxC^
where
is the hourly mean wind pressure in N/m^ at height H (see Table 5)
is the area in plan in m^
is the
lift coefficient which shall be taken as 0.75 for normal type of slab, box,
l-girder and plate girder bridges. For other type of deck cross-sections
shall
be ascertained either from wind tunnel tests or,
if available, for similar type of
structure. Specialist literature shall be referred to.
G
is the gust factor as defined in 209.3.3
209.3.6. The transverse wind load per unit exposed frontal area of the
live load
shall be
computed using the expression
given
in Clause 209.3.3 except that
against shall
be taken as
1 .2. The exposed
frontal area of
live load
shall be the entire length
of the
superstructure seen
in elevation
in the direction of wind as defined
in clause
or any part of
that length producing critical response, multiplied by a height of 3.0 m above the road way
surface. Areas below the top of a solid barrier shall be neglected.
The longitudinal wind load on live load shall be taken as 25 percent of transverse wind load
as calculated above. Both loads shall be applied simultaneously acting at 1.5 m above the
roadway.
209.3.7
The bridges shall not be considered to be carrying any
live load when the wind
speed at deck level exceeds 36 m/s.
209.3.8
In case of cantilever construction an upward wind pressure of P^ x C^x G N/m^ (see
Clause 209.3.5 for notations) on bottom soffit area shall be assumed on stabilizing cantilever
arm in addition to the transverse wind effect calculated as per Clause 209.3.3.
In addition to
the above, other loads defined
in Clause 218.3 shall also be taken into consideration.
209.4
Design Wind Forces on Substructure
The
substructure
shall
be designed
for wind
induced
loads
transmitted
to
it from
the
superstructure and wind loads acting directly on the substructure. Loads for wind directions
both
normal
and skewed
to
the
longitudinal
centerline
of the
superstructure
shall
be
considered.
F^ shall be computed using expression
in Clause 209.3.3 with
taken as the solid area
in
normal projected elevation of each pier. No allowance shall be made for shielding.
For piers,
shall be taken from Table 6. For piers with cross-section dissimilar to those
given
in Table
5, C
shall be ascertained either from wind tunnel tests
or,
if available, for

210.3
The value of
in the equation given
in Clause 210.2 shall be assumed to vary
linearly from zero at the point of deepest scour to the square of the maximum velocity at
the free surface of water. The maximum velocity for the purpose of this sub-clause shall be
assumed to be V2 times the maximum mean velocity of the current.
Square of velocity at a
height X from the point of deepest Scour =
=
where
V
is the maximum mean velocity.
210.4
When the current strikes the pier at an angle, the velocity of the current shall be
resolved into two components - one parallel and the other normal to the pier.
a)
The
pressure
parallel
to
the
pier
shall
be
determined
as
indicated
in
Clause 21 0.2 taking the velocity as the component of the velocity of the current
in a direction parallel to the pier.
b)
The pressure of the current, normal to the pier and acting on the area of the
side elevation of the pier, shall be calculated similarly taking the velocity as the
component of the velocity of the current in a direction normal to the pier, and the
constant K as 1.5, except in the case of circular piers where the constant shall
be taken as 0.66
210.5
To provide against possible variation of the direction of the current from the direction
assumed in the design, allowance shall be made in the design of piers for an extra variation in
the current direction of 20 degrees that is to say, piers intended to be parallel to the direction
of current shall be designed for a variation of 20 degrees from the normal direction of current
and piers originally intended to be inclined at 6 degree to the direction of the current shall be
designed for a current direction inclined at (20±e) degrees to the length of the pier.
210.6
In case of a bridge having a pucca floor or having an inerodible bed, the effect of
cross-currents shall in no case be taken as less than that of a static force due to a difference
of head of 250 mm between the opposite faces of a pier.
210.7
When supports are made with two or more piles or trestle columns, spaced closer
than three times the width of piles/columns across the direction of flow, the group shall be

treated as a solid rectangle of the same overall length and width and the value of K taken
as
1.25 for calculating pressures due to water currents,
both
parallel and normal
to the
pier.
If such piles/columns are braced, then the group should be considered as a solid pier,
irrespective of the spacing of the columns.
211 LONGITUDINAL FORCES
211.1
In
all road bridges, provision shall be made for longitudinal forces arising from any
one or more of the following causes:
a)
Tractive effort caused through acceleration of the driving wheels;
b)
Braking effect resulting from the application of the brakes to braked wheels;
and
c)
Frictional resistance offered to the movement of free bearings due to change of
temperature or any other cause.
NOTE
. Braking effect is invariably greater than the tractive effort.
211.2
The braking effect on a simply supported span or a continuous unit of spans or on
any other type of bridge unit shall be assumed to have the following value:
a)
In the case of a single lane or a two lane bridge
: twenty percent of the first
train load plus ten percent of the load of the succeeding trains or part thereof,
the train loads
in one lane only being considered for the purpose of this sub-
clause.
Where the entire
first train
is not on the
full span, the braking force
shall be taken as equal to twenty percent of the loads actually on the span or
continuous unit of spans.
b)
In the case of bridges having more than two-lanes: as in (a) above for the
first two lanes plus five per cent of the loads on the lanes in excess of two.
Note
: The loads in this Clause shall not be increased on account of impact.
211.3
The force due to braking effect shall be assumed to act along a line parallel to the
roadway and
1 .2 m above
it.
While transferring the force to the bearings, the change in the
vertical reaction at the bearings should be taken into account.
211 .4
The distribution of longitudinal horizontal forces among bridge supports is effected by
the horizontal deformation of bridges, flexing of the supports and rotation of the foundations.
For spans
resting on
stiff supports, the
distribution may be assumed as given below
in
Clause 211.5. For spans resting on flexible supports, distribution of horizontal forces may be
carried out according to procedure given below in Clause 211.6.

bearing shall be designed to withstand the full seismic and design braking/tractive force.
211.5.1.2
In case
of simply supported small spans upto
10 m

full
seismic and design braking/tractive force.
211.6
Simply Supported and Continuous Spans on Flexible Supports
211 .6.1
Shear rating of a support is the horizontal force required to move the top of the support
through a unit distance taking into account horizontal deformation of the bridges, flexibility of
the support and rotation of the foundation. The distribution of 'applied' longitudinal horizontal
forces (e.g., braking, seismic, wind etc.) depends solely on shear ratings of the supports and
may be estimated in proportion to the ratio of individual shear ratings of a support to the sum
of the shear ratings of all the supports.
39



======================================================================
PAGE 48 of 94
======================================================================
IRC:6-2014
211.6.2
The distribution of self-induced horizontal force caused by deck movement (owing
to temperature, shrinkage, creep, elastic shortening, etc.) depends not only on shear ratings
of the supports but also on the location of the 'zero' movement point in the deck. The shear
rating of the supports, the distribution of applied and self-induced horizontal force and the
determination of the point of zero movement may be made as per recognized theory for
which reference may be made to publications on the subjects.
211.7
The effects of braking force on bridge structures without bearings, such as, arches,
rigid frames,
etc., shall be calculated
in accordance with approved methods of analysis of
indeterminate structures.
211.8
The
effects of the
longitudinal forces and
all other horizontal forces should be
calculated upto a
level where the resultant passive earth resistance of the
soil below the
deepest scour
level
(floor
level
in case
of a
bridge having pucca
floor) balances these
forces.
212 CENTRIFUGAL FORCES
212.1
Where a road bridge is situated on a curve,
all portions of the structure affected by
the
centrifugal action of moving vehicles are to be proportioned to carry safely the stress
induced by this action in addition to all other stress to which they may be subjected.
212.2
The centrifugal force shall be determined from the following equation:
127R
where,
C
=
Centrifugal force acting normally to the traffic (1) at the point of action of the
wheel loads or (2) uniformly distributed over every metre length on which a
uniformly distributed load acts,
in tonnes.
W
=
Live load
(1)
in case of wheel loads, each wheel load being considered as
acting over the ground contact length specified
in Clause 204,
in tonnes, and
(2) in case of a uniformly distributed live load,
in tonnes per linear metre.
V
-
The design speed of the vehicles using the bridge in km per hour, and
R
-
The radius of curvature in metres.
212.3
The centrifugal force shall be considered to act at a height of
1 .2 m above the level
of the carriageway.
212.4
No increase for impact effect shall be made on the stress due to centrifugal action.
40



======================================================================
PAGE 49 of 94
======================================================================
IRC:6-2014
212.5
The overturning effect of the centrifugal force on the structure as a whole shall also
be duly considered.
213 BUOYANCY
213.1
In the design of abutments, especially those of submersible bridges, the effects of
buoyancy shall also be considered assuming that the
fill behind the abutments has been
removed by scour.
213.2
To allow for
full buoyancy, a reduction
shall be made
in the gross weight of the
member affected by reducing
its density by the density of the displaced water.
Note:
1 )The density of water may be taken as
1 .0 t/m^
2) For artesian
condition, HFL or actual water head, whichever
is
higher,
shall be
considered for calculating the uplift.
213.3
In the design of submerged masonry or concrete structures, the buoyancy effect
through pore pressure may be limited to 15 percent of full buoyancy.
213.4
In case of submersible bridges, the full buoyancy effect on the superstructure shall
be taken into consideration.
214 EARTH PRESSURE
214.1
Structures designed to retain earth
fills shall be proportioned to withstand pressure
calculated
in accordance with any rational theory. Coulomb's theory shall be acceptable,
subject to the modification that the centre of pressure exerted by the backfill, when considered
dry,
is located at an elevation of 0.42 of the height of the wall above the base instead of 0.33
of that height. No structures shall, however, be designed to withstand a horizontal pressure
less than that exerted by a fluid weighing 480 kg/m^
All abutments and return walls shall be
designed for a live load surcharge equivalent to
1 .2 m earth
fill.
214.2
Reinforced concrete approach slab with 12 mm dia 150 mm c/c
in each direction
both at top and bottom as reinforcement in M30 grade concrete covering the entire width of
the roadway, with one end resting on the structure designed to retain earth and extending for
a length of not less than 3.5 m into the approach shall be provided.
214.3
All designs shall provide for the thorough drainage of backfilling materials by means
of weep holes and crushed rock or gravel drains, or pipe drains, or perforated drains.
214.4
The pressure of submerged soils (not provided with drainage arrangements) shall
be considered as made up of two components:
a)
Pressure due to the earth calculated in accordance with the method laid down
in Clause 214.1
, the unit weight of earth being reduced for buoyancy, and
b)
Full hydrostatic pressure of water

215 TEMPERATURE
215.1
General
Daily and seasonal fluctuations
in shade
air temperature,
solar radiation,
etc. cause the
following:
a)
Changes
in the overall temperature of the bridge, referred to as the effective
bridge temperature. Over a prescribed period there will be a minimum and a
maximum, together with a range of effective bridge temperature,
resulting
in
loads and/or load effects within the bridge due to:
1)
Restraint offered
to the associated expansion/contraction by the form
of
construction
(e.g.,
portal
frame,
arch,
flexible
pier,
elastomeric
bearings) referred to as temperature restraint; and
ii)
Friction
at
roller
or
sliding
bearings
referred
to
as
frictional
bearing
restraint;
b)
Differences in temperature between the top surface and other levels through the
depth of the superstructure, referred to as temperature difference and resulting
in associated loads and/or load effects within the structure.
Provisions
shall
be made
for
stresses
or movements
resulting
from
variations
in
the
temperature.
215.2
Range of Effective Bridge Temperature
Effective
bridge temperature
for the
location
of the
bridge
shall be estimated from the
isotherms of shade air temperature given on Figs. 8 and 9. Minimum and maximum effective
bridge temperatures would be lesser or more respectively than the corresponding minimum
and maximum shade air temperatures
in concrete bridges.
In determining load effects due
to temperature
restraint
in
concrete
bridges
the
effective
bridge temperature when
the
structure is effectively restrained shall be taken as datum
in calculating the expansion up to
the maximum effective bridge temperature and contraction down to the minimum effective
bridge temperature.

The bridge temperature when the structure
is effectively restrained shall be estimated as
follows:
Bridge location having difference between
maximum and minimum air shade temperature
Bridge temperature to be assumed when the
structure is effectively restrained
>20°C
Mean of maximum and minimum air shade
temperature ± 10°C whichever is critical
< 20°C
Mean of maximum and minimum air shade
temperature ± 5°C whichever is critical
For metallic structures the extreme range of effective bridge temperature to be considered in
the design shall be as follows
:
1)
Snowbound areas from - 35°C to + 50°C
2)
For other areas (Maximum
air shade temperature + 15°C) to (minimum
air shade
temperature - 10°C). Air shade temperatures are to be obtained from Figs. 8 and 9.
215.3
Temperature Differences
Effect of temperature difference within the superstructure
shall be derived from
positive
temperature differences which occur when conditions are such that solar radiation and other
effects cause a gain in heat through the top surface of the superstructure. Conversely, reverse
temperature differences are such that heat is lost from the top surface of the bridge deck as
a result of re-radiation and other effects. Positive and reverse temperature differences for
the purpose of design of concrete bridge decks shall be assumed as shown
in Fig. 10 (a).
These design provisions are applicable to concrete bridge decks with about 50 mm wearing
surface. So far as steel and composite decks are concerned, Fig. 10 (b) may be referred for
assessing the effect of temperature gradient.

Permissible Increase in Stresses and Load Combinations
Tensile stresses resulting from temperature effects not exceeding in the value of two third of
the modulus of rupture may be permitted in prestressed concrete bridges.
Sufficient amount
of non-tensioned steel shall, however, be provided to control the thermal cracking.
Increase
in stresses shall be allowed for calculating load effects due to temperature restraint under
load combinations.

is defined as the bending stress
in any member of an open

in a manner such
that the deformation stresses are reduced to a minimum.
In the absence of calculation,
deformation stresses shall be assumed to be not less than 16 percent of the dead and live
loads stresses.

217 SECONDARY STRESSES
217.1
a)
Steel structures: Secondary stresses are additional stresses brought into play
due to the eccentricity of connections, floor beam loads applied at intermediate
points in a panel, cross girders being connected away from panel points, lateral
wind loads on the end-posts of through girders etc., and stresses due to the
movement of supports.
b)
Reinforced Concrete structures: Secondary stresses are additional stresses
brought into play due either to the movement of supports or to the deformations
in the geometrical shape of the structure or its member, resulting from causes,
such as,
rigidity of end connection or loads applied at intermediate points of
trusses or restrictive shrinkage of concrete floor beams.
217.2.
All bridges shall be designated and constructed in a manner such that the secondary
stresses are reduced to a minimum and they shall be allowed for in the design.
217.3
For reinforced concrete members, the shrinkage coefficient for purposes of design
may be taken as 2 X 10 ^.
218 ERECTION STRESSES AND CONSTRUCTION LOADS
218.1
The effects of erection as per actual loads based on the construction programme
shall be accounted for in the design.
This shall also include the condition of one span being
completed in all respects and the adjacent span not in position. However, one span dislodged
condition need not be considered in the case of slab bridge not provided with bearings.
218.2
Construction loads are those which are
incident upon a
structure or any of
its
constituent components during the construction of the structures.
A detailed construction procedure associated with a method statement shall be drawn up
during design and considered in the design to ensure that all aspects of stability and strength
of the structure are satisfied.

Applicability
219.1.1
All bridges supported on piers, pier bents and arches, directly or through bearings,
and not exempted below
in the category (a) and
(b), are to be designed for horizontal and
vertical forces as given in the following clauses.
The following types of bridges need not be checked for seismic effects:
a)
Culverts and minor bridges up to 10 m span in all seismic zones
b)
Bridges
in seismic zones
II and
ill
satisfying both
limits
of total
length
not
exceeding 60 m and spans not exceeding 15 m
219.1.2
Special investigations should be carried out for the bridges of following description:
a)
Bridges more than 150 m span
b)

Notes for special investigations:
1)
In
all seismic zones, areas covered within 10 km from the known active faults
are classified as 'Near Field Regions'. For all bridges located within 'Near Field
Regions', except those exempted
in Clause 219.1.1,
special
investigations
should be carried out. The information about the active faults should be sought
by bridge authorities for projects situated within 100 km of known epicenters as
a part of preliminary investigations at the project preparation stage.
2)
Special investigations should include aspects such as need for site specific
spectra, independency of component motions, spatial variation of excitation,
need to include soil-structure interaction, suitable methods of structural analysis
in view of geometrical and
structural
non-linear effects,
characteristics and
reliability of seismic isolation and other special seismic resistant devices, etc.
3)

Components of Seismic Motion
The characteristics of seismic ground motion expected
at any location depend upon the
magnitude of earthquake, depth of focus, distance of epicenter and characteristics of the path
through which the seismic wave travels. The random ground motion can be resolved in three
mutually perpendicular directions. The components are considered to act simultaneously, but
independently and their method of combination is described in Clause 219.4. Two horizontal
components are taken as of equal magnitude, and vertical component is taken as two third
of horizontal component.
In zones IV and V the effects of vertical components shall be considered for all elements of
the bridge.
The effect of vertical component may be omitted for all elements
in zones
II and
III, except
for the following cases:
a)
prestressed concrete decks
b)
bearings and linkages
c)
horizontal cantilever structural elements
d)
for stability checks and
e)
bridges located in the 'Near Field Regions'
219.4
Combination of Component Motions
1)
The seismic forces shall be assumed to come from any horizontal direction.
For this purpose two separate analyses shall be performed for design seismic
forces acting along two orthogonal horizontal directions. The design seismic
force resultants
(i.e. axial force, bending moments, shear forces, and torsion)

219.5
Computation of Seismic Response
Following methods are used
for computation
of seismic response depending upon
the
complexity of the structure and the input ground motion.
1)
For most
of the
bridges,
elastic seismic acceleration method
is adequate.
In this method, the
first fundamental mode of vibration
is calculated and the
corresponding acceleration
is read from Fig. 13. This acceleration
is applied to
all parts of the bridge for calculation of forces as per Clause 219.5.1
2)
Elastic Response Spectrum Method: This
is a general method,
suitable
for
more complex structural systems (e. g. continuous bridges, bridges with large
difference
in
pier heights,
bridges which are curved
in
plan,
etc),
in which
dynamic analysis of the structure
is performed
to obtain the
first as well as
higher modes of vibration and the forces obtained for each mode by use of
response spectrum from Fig. 13 and Clause 219.5.1. These modal forces are
combined by following appropriate combinational rules to arrive at the design
^
forces. Reference is made to specialist literature for the same.

structure as a whole, shall be computed as follows:

method

(E^^) as per
IRC:112, and considering moment of inertia of cracked section which can be taken
as 0.75 times the moment of inertia of gross uncracked section,
in the absence of
rigorous calculation. The fundamental period of vibration can also be calculated by
method given in Annex D.

219.5.1.1
Seismic importance factor (I)
Bridges are designed
to
resist design
basis earthquake (DBE)
level,
or other higher or
lower magnitude of forces, depending on the consequences of their
partial or complete
non-availability, due to damage or failure from seismic events. The
level of design force
is obtained by multiplying
(Z/2) by factor T, which represents seismic importance of the
structure. Combination of factors considered
in assessing the consequences of failure and
hence choice of factor T,- include inter alia,
a)
Extent of disturbance to traffic and possibility of providing temporary diversion,
b)
Availability of alternative routes,
c)
Cost of repairs and time involved, which depend on the extent of damages,
-
minor or major,
d)
Cost of replacement, and time involved in reconstruction in case of failure,
e)
Indirect economic loss due to its partial or full non-availability, Importance factors
are given in Table 8 for different types of bridges.

Note
:
While checking for seismic effects during construction, the importance factor of 1 should be
considered for all bridges in all zones.
219.5.2
Live load components
1)
The seismic force due to live load shall not be considered when acting
in the
direction of traffic, but shall be considered
in the direction perpendicular to the
traffic.
ii)
The horizontal seismic force in the direction perpendicular to the traffic shall be
calculated using 20 percent of live load (excluding impact factor).
iii)
The
vertical seismic force
shall be calculated using 20 percent of
live load
(excluding impact factor).
Note
:
The reduced percentages of live loads are applicable only for calculating the magnitude of
seismic design force and are based on the assumption that only 20 percent of the live load
is present over the bridge at the time of earthquake.

219.5.3
Water current and depth of scour
The depth of scour under seismic condition to be considered for design shall be 0.9 times the
maximum scour depth. The flood level for calculating hydrodynamic force and water current
force is to be taken as average of yearly maximum design floods.
For river bridges, average
may preferably be based on consecutive 7 years' data, or on local enquiry in the absence of
such data.
219.5.4
Hydrodynamic and earth pressure forces under seismic condition
In addition to inertial forces arising from the dead load and
live load, hydrodynamic forces
act on the submerged
part of the structure and are transmitted
to the foundations. Also,
additional earth pressures due to earthquake act on the retaining portions of abutments. For
values of these loads reference is made to IS 1893. These forces shall be considered in the
design of bridges in zones IV and V.
The
modified
earth pressure forces described
in the preceding paragraph need
not be
considered on the portion of the structure below scour level and on other components, such
as wing walls and return walls.
219.5.5
Design forces for elements of structures and use of response reduction factor
The forces on various members obtained from the elastic analysis of bridge structure are
to be divided by Response Reduction Factor given
in Table 9 before combining with other
forces as per load combinations given
in Table

Notes
:
i)
Those parts of the structural elements of foundations which are not in contact with soil
and transferring load to
it, are treated as part of sub-structure element.
ii)
Response reduction factor
is not to be applied
for calculation
of displacements of
elements of bridge and for bridge as a whole.
iii)
When elastomeric bearings are used to transmit horizontal seismic forces, the response
reduction factor (R) shall be taken as
1 .5 for RCC substructure and as
1 .0 for masonry
and PCC substructure.
219.6
Fully Embedded Portions
Parts of structure embedded in soil below scour level need not be considered to produce any
seismic forces.
219.7
Liquefaction
In loose sands and poorly graded sands with
little or no fines, the vibrations due to earthquake
may cause liquefaction, or excessive total and differential settlements. Founding bridges on such
sands should be avoided unless appropriate methods of compaction or stabilisation are adopted.
Alternatively, the foundations should be taken deeper below liquefiable layers,
to firm
strata.
Reference should be made to the specialist literature for analysis of liquefaction potential.
219.8
Foundation Design
For design
of foundation,
the seismic loads should be taken as
1.25 times the forces
transmitted
to
it by substructure, so as to provide sufficient margin to cover the possible
higher forces transmitted by substructure arising out of its over strength.
219.9
Ductile Detailing
Mandatory Provisions
i)
In zones IV and V, to prevent dislodgement of superstructure, "reaction blocks"
(additional safety measures
in the event of failure of bearings) or other types
of seismic
arresters
shall be
provided and designed
for the seismic force
(F
/R). Pier and abutment caps shall be generously dimensioned, to prevent
dislodgement of severe ground-shaking. The examples of seismic features
shown in Figs. 14 to 16 are only indicative and suitable arrangements will have
to be worked out in specific cases.
ii)
To improve the performance of bridges during earthquakes, the bridges
in
Seismic Zones
III, IV and V may be specifically detailed for ductility for which
IRC:112 shall be referred.
Recommended Provisions
i)
In order to mitigate the effects of earthquake forces described above, special
seismic devices such as Shock Transmission
Units, Base
Isolation, Seismic
Fuse,
Lead
Plug,
etc, may
be
provided
based
on
specialized
literature,
international practices, satisfactory testing etc.

ii)
Continuous
superstructure
(with fewer number
of bearings and expansion
joints) or integral bridges (in wiiich the substructure or superstructure are made
joint less,
i.e. monolithic),
if not unsuitable otherwise, can possibly provide high
ductility leading to bvetter behaviour during earthquake.
iii)
Where elastomeric bearings are used, a separate system of arrester control in
both directions may be introduced to cater to seismic forces on the bearing.

220 BARGE IMPACT ON BRIDGES
220.1
General
1)
Bridges crossing
navigable channels
of
rivers, creeks and canals as well as the
shipping channels
in
port areas and open seas shall be provided with "navigation
spans" which shall be specially identified and marked to direct the waterway traffic
below them. The span arrangement, horizontal clearances between the inner faces
of piers within the width of the navigational channel, vertical clearances above the
air-draft of the ships/barges upto
soffit of deck and minimum depth of water
in the
channel below the maximum laden draft of the barges shall be decided based on the
classification of waterways as per Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) or the
concerned Ports and Shipping Authorities.
2)
Bridge components
located
in a navigable channel
of rivers and canals
shall be
designed for barge impact force due to the possibility of barge accidentally colliding
with the structure.
3)
For
bridges
located
in
sea,
and
in waterways
under
control
of
ports,
the
bridge
components may have to be designed for vessel collision force, for which the details
of the ships/barges shall be obtained from the concerned authority. Specialist literature
may be referred for the magnitudes of design forces and appropriate design solutions.
4)
The design objective for bridges
is to minimize the risk of the structural failure of a
bridge component due to collision with a plying barge in a cost-effective manner and
at the same time reduce the risk of damage to the barge and resulting environmental
pollution,
if any.
Localized
repairable damage
of substructure and
superstructure
components is permitted provided that
:
59



======================================================================
PAGE 68 of 94
======================================================================
IRC:6-2014
a)
Damaged structural components can be inspected and repaired
in a relatively
cost effective manner not involving detailed investigation, and
b)
Sufficient ductility and redundancy exist in the remaining structure to prevent
consequential progressive collapse,
in the event of impact.
5)
The
Indian waterways have been
classified
in
7 categories by
IWAI. The vessel
displacement tonnage for each of the class of waterway is shown in Table 10. Barges
and their configurations which are
likely to
ply,
their dimensions, the Dead Weight
Tonnage (DWT), the minimum dimensions of waterway in lean section, and minimum
clearance requirements are specified by IWAI. The
latest requirements (2009) are
shown in Annex E.

Note:
The
total displacement tonnage of self propelled vehicle (SPV) equals the weight of the
barge when empty plus the weight of the
ballast and cargo (DWT) being
carried by the
barge. The displacement tonnage for barge tows shall equal the displacement tonnage of the
tug/tow barge plus the combined displacement of number of barges in the length of the tow as
shown
in Annex E.
6)
In determining barge impact loads, consideration shall also be given to the relationship
of the bridge to
:
a)
Waterway geometry.
b)
Size, type, loading condition of barge using the waterway, taking into account
the available water depth, and width of the navigable channel.
c)
Speed of barge and direction, with respect to water current velocities
in the
period of the year when barges are permitted to ply.
d)
Structural response of the bridge to collision.
7)
In navigable portion of waterways where barge collision is anticipated, structures shall
be
:
a)
Designed to resist barge collision forces, or
b)
Adequately protected by designed fenders, dolphins, berms,
artificial islands,
or other sacrificial devices designed to absorb the energy of colliding vessels
or to redirect the course of a vessel, or
c)
A combination of (a) and (b) above, where protective measures absorb most of
the force and substructure
is designed for the residual force.
8)
In non-navigable portion of the waterways, the possibility of smaller barges using these
portions and likely to cause accidental impact shall be examined from consideration of
the available draft and type of barges that ply on the waterway. In case such possibility
60



======================================================================
PAGE 69 of 94
======================================================================
IRC:6-2014
exists, the piers shall be designed to resist a lower force of barge impact caused by
the smaller barges as compared to the navigational span.
9)
For navigable waterways which have not been classified by IWAI, but where barges
are plying, one of Class from
I & VI should be chosen as applicable, based on the local
survey of crafts plying
in the waterway. Where reliable data
is not available minimum
Class-I shall be assigned.
220.2
Design Barge Dimensions
A design barge shall be selected on the basis of classification of the waterway. The barge
characteristics for any waterway shall be obtained from IWAI (Ref. Annex E).
The dimensions of the barge should be taken from the survey of operating barge. Where no
reliable information
is available, the same may be taken from Fig. 17.

Checking
in Dimensional Clearances for Navigation and Location of Barge
Impact Force
Fig. 18 shows the position of bridge foundations and piers as well as the position of the barge
in relation to the actual water level. The minimum and maximum water levels within which
barges are permitted to ply are shown schematically. These levels should be decided by the
river authorities or by authority controlling the navigation.
The minimum navigable level will be controlled by the minimum depth of water needed for the
plying of barges. The maximum level may be determined by the maximum water velocity in
which the barges may safely ply and by the available vertical clearances below the existing
(or planned) structures across the navigable water.

Design Barge Speed
The speed at which the barge collides against the components of a bridge depends upon
to the barge transit speed within the navigable channel limits, the distance to the location of
the bridge element from the centre line of the barge transit path and the barge length overall
(LOA). This information shall be collected from the IWAI.
In absence of any data, a design
speed of 6 knots
(i.e.
3.1 m/sec) for unladen barge and 4 knots
(i.e. 2.1 m/sec) for laden
barge may be assumed for design for both upstream and downstream directions of traffic.

Location & Magnitude of Impact Force in Substructure & Foundation, 'P^'
All components of the substructure, exposed to physical contact by any portion of the design
barge's hull or bow, shall be designed to resist the applied loads. The bow overhang, rake,
or flair distance of barges shall be considered in determining the portions of the substructure
exposed to contact by the barge. Crushing of the barge's bow causing contact with any
setback portion of the substructure shall also be considered.
Some of the salient barge dimensions to be checked while checking for the navigational
clearances are as follows
:
63



======================================================================
PAGE 72 of 94
======================================================================
IRC:6-2014
The design impact force for the above cases
is to be applied as a vertical line load equally
distributed along the barge's bow depth, H2 defined with respect to the reference water level,
as shown
in Fig. 18. The barge's bow
is considered to be raked forward
in determining the
potential contact area of the impact force on the substructure.
220.9
Protection of Substructures
Protection may be provided to reduce or to eliminate the exposure of bridge substructures to
barge collision by physical protection systems, including fenders, pile cluster, pile-supported
structures, dolphins, islands, and combinations thereof.
Severe damage and/or collapse of the protection system may be permitted, provided that
the protection system stops the Barge prior to contact with the pier or redirects the barge
away from the pier.
In such cases, the bridge piers need not be designed for Barge Impact.
Specialist literature shall be referred for design of protection structures.
Flexible fenders or other protection system attached to the substructure help to
limit the
damage to the barge and the substructure by absorbing part of impact (kinetic energy of
collision). For the design of combined system of pier and protection system, the design forces
as obtained from Clause 220.7 shall be used in absence of rigorous analysis.
220.10
Load Combination
The barge collision load shall be considered as an accidental load and load combination shall
conform to the provisions of IRC:6. Barge impact load shall be considered only under Ultimate
Limit State. For working load/allowable stress condition, allowable stress may be increased by
50 percent.
The probability of the simultaneous occurrence of a barge collision together with the maximum
flood need not be considered. For the purpose of load combination of barge collision, the
maximum flood
level may be taken as the mean annual flood level of previous 20 years,
provided
that the permissible maximum
current
velocities
for the barges
to
ply are
not
exceeded.
In such event maximum
level may be calculated backward from the allowable
current velocities. The maximum level of scour below this flood level shall be calculated by
scour formula
in Clause 703.3.1
of IRC:78. However, no credit for scour shall be taken for
verifying required depth for allowing navigation.
221 SNOW LOAD
The snow load of 500 kg/m^ where applicable shall be assumed to act on the bridge deck
while combining
with
live
load
as
given
below.
Both
the
conditions
shall
be checked
independently:
a)
A snow
accumulation
upto
0.25 m
over
the
deck
shall
be
taken
into
consideration, while designing the structure for wheeled vehicles.
b)
A snow
accumulation
upto
0.50 m
over
the
deck
shall
be
taken
into
consideration, while designing the structure for tracked vehicles.
c)
In case of snow accumulation exceeding 0.50 m, design shall be based on the
maximum recorded snow accumulation (based on the actual site observation,
including the effect of variation in snow density). No live load shall be considered
to act along with this snow load.

222 VEHICLE COLLISION LOADS ON SUPPORTS OF BRIDGES,
FLYOVER SUPPORTS AND FOOT OVER BRIDGES
222.1
General
222.1.1
Bridge piers of wall type, columns or the frames built in the median or in the vicinity of
the carriageway supporting the superstructure shall be designed to withstand vehicle collision
loads. The effect of collision load shall also be considered on the supporting elements, such as,
foundations and bearings.
For multilevel carriageways, the collision loads shall be considered
separately for each level.
222.1 .2 The effect of collision load shall not be considered on abutments or on the structures
separated from the edge of the carriageway by a minimum distance of 4.5 m and shall also not
be combined with principal live loads on the carriageway supported by the structural members
subjected to such collision loads, as well as wind or seismic load. Where pedestrian/cycle
track bridge ramps and
stairs are structurally independent of the main highway-spanning
structure, their supports need not be designed for the vehicle collision loads.
Note
:
The tertiary structures, such as lighting post, signage supports etc. need not be designed
for vehicle collision loads.
222.2
Increase in Permissible Stress
The permissible stresses in both steel and concrete shall be increased by 50 percent and the
safe bearing capacity of the founding strata increased by 25 percent when considering the
effect of collision loads.
222.3
Collision Load
222.3.1
The nominal loads given
in Table
11
shall be considered
to act horizontally as
Vehicle Collision Loads.
Supports shall be capable of resisting the main and residual load
components acting simultaneously. Loads normal to the carriageway below and loads parallel
to the carriageway below shall be considered to act separately and shall not be combined.

IRC:6-2014
222.3.2
The loads indicated in Clause 222.3.1
, are assumed for vehicles plying at velocity of
about 60 km/hour.
In case of vehicles travelling at lesser velocity, the loads may be reduced
in proportion to the square of the velocity but not less than 50 percent.
222.3.3
The bridge supports
shall be designed
for the
residual
load component
only,
if
protected with suitably designed fencing system taking
into account
its
flexibility, having a
minimum height of
1 .5 m above the carriageway level.
223 INDETERMINATE STRUCTURES AND COMPOSITE
STRUCTURES
Stresses due to creep, shrinkage and temperature, etc. should be considered for statically
indeterminate structures or composite members consisting for steel or concrete prefabricated
elements and cast-in-situ components for which specialist literature may be referred to. Creep
and shrinkage produce permanent stresses and hence no relaxation
in permissible stresses
shall be allowed.

(Clause 201.2)
IRC:6-2014
HYPOTHETICAL VEHICLES FOR CLASSIFICATION OF VEHICLES
AND BRIDGES (REVISED)
NOTES FOR LOAD CLASSIFICATION CHART
1)
The possible variations
in the wheel spacings and tyre sizes, for the heaviest
single axles-cols,
(f) and
(h), the heaviest bogie axles-col.
(j) and also for the
heaviest axles of the train vehicle of cols, (e) and (g) are given
in cols,
(k),
(I),
(m) and (n). The same pattern of wheel arrangement may be assumed for all
axles of the wheel train shown in cols, (e) and (g) as for the heaviest axles. The
overall width of tyre in mm may be taken as equal to [150+(p-1) 57], where "p"
represents the load on tyre in tonnes, wherever the tyre sizes are not specified
on the chart.
2)
Contact areas of tyres on the deck may be obtained from the corresponding
tyre loads, max. tyre pressures (p) and width of tyre treads.
3)
The
first dimension of tyre size refers to the overall width of tyre and second
dimension to the rim diameter of the tyre.
Tyre tread width may be taken as
overall tyre width minus 25 mm for tyres upto 225 mm width, and minus 50 mm
for tyres over 225 mm width.
4)
The spacing between successive vehicles shall not be less than 30 m.
This
spacing
will be measured from the rear-most point of ground contact of the
leading vehicles to the forward-most point of ground contact of the following
vehicle
in case of tracked vehicles. For wheeled vehicles,
it will be measured
from the centre of the rear-most axle of the leading vehicle to the centre of the
first axle of the following vehicle.
5)
The classification of the bridge shall be determined by the safe load carrying
capacity of the weakest of all the structural members including the main girders,
stringers (or load bearers), the decking, cross bearers (or transome) bearings,
piers and abutments, investigated under the track, wheel axle and bogie loads
shown for the various classes. Any bridge upto and including class 40 will be
marked with a single class number-the highest tracked or wheel standard load
class which the bridge can safely withstand. Any bridge over class 40 will be
marked with a single class number
if the wheeled and tracked classes are the
69



======================================================================
PAGE 78 of 94
======================================================================
same, and with dual classification sign showing both T and W load classes
if
the T and W classes are different.
The calculations determining the safe load carrying capacity shall also allow for
the effects due to impact, wind pressure, longitudinal forces, etc., as described
in the relevant Clauses of this Code.
The distribution of load between the main girders of a bridge is not necessarily
equal and shall be assessed from considerations of the spacing of the main
girders,
their
torsional
stiffness,
flexibility
of the
cross
bearers,
the
width
of roadway and the width
of the
vehicles,
etc., by any
rational method
of
calculations.
The maximum single axle loads shown
in columns
(f) and
(h) and the bogie
axle loads shown
in column
(j) correspond to the heaviest axles of the trains,
shown in columns (e) and (g) in load-classes upto and including class 30-R.
In
the case of higher load classes, the single axle loads and bogie axle loads shall
be assumed to belong to some other hypothetical vehicles and their effects
worked out separately on the components of bridge deck.
The minimum clearance between the road face of the kerb and the outer edge
of wheel or track for any of the hypothetical vehicles shall be the same as for
Class AA vehicles, when there is only one-lane of traffic moving on a bridge.
If
a bridge is to be designed for two-lanes of traffic for any type of vehicles given
in the Chart, the clearance may be decided
in each case depending upon the
circumstances.

Combination
of Loads
for the
Verification
of Equilibrium and
Structural
Strength under Ultimate State
Loads are required to be combined to check the equilibrium and the structural strength under
ultimate limit state. The equilibrium of the structure shall be checked against overturning, sliding
and uplift.
It shall be ensured that the disturbing loads (overturning, sliding and uplifting) shall
always be less than the stabilizing or restoring actions. The structural strength under ultimate
limit state shall be estimated in order to avoid internal failure or excessive deformation. The
equilibrium and the structural strength shall be checked under basic, accidental and seismic
combinations of loads.
3
Combination Principles
The
following
principles
shall
be
followed
while
using
these
tables
for
arriving
at
the
combinations:
i)
All loads shown under Column
1
of Table 3.1 or Table 3.2 or Table 3.3 or
Table 3.4 shall be combined to carry out the relevant verification.
ii)
While working out the combinations, only one variable load shall be considered
as the leading load at a time. All other variable loads shall be considered as
accompanying loads.
In case
if the variable loads produce favourable effect
(relieving effect) the same shall be ignored.
iii)
For accidental combination, the traffic load on the upper deck of a bridge (when
collision with the pier due to traffic under the bridge occurs) shall be treated as
the leading load. In all other accidental situations the traffic load shall be treated
as the accompanying load.
iv)
During construction the relevant design situation shall be taken into account.
v)
These combinations are not valid for verifying the fatigue limit state.
4
Basic Combination
4.1
For Checking the Equilibrium
For checking the equilibrium of the structure, the
partial safety factor for loads shown
in
Column No. 2 or 3 under Table 3.1 shall be adopted.
4.2
For Checking the Structural Strength
For checking the structural strength, the
partial safety factor for loads shown
in Column
No. 2 under Table 3.2 shall be adopted.
5
Accidental Combination
For checking the equilibrium of the structure, the
partial safety factor for loads shown
in
Column No. 4 or 5 under Table 3.1 and for checking the structural strength, the partial safety
factor for loads shown in Column No. 3 under Table 3.2 shall be adopted.
73



======================================================================
PAGE 82 of 94
======================================================================
IRC:6-2014
6
Seismic Combination
For checking the equilibrium of the structure, the
partial safety factor for loads shown
in
Column No. 6 or 7 under Table 3.1 and for checking the structural strength, the partial safety
factor for loads shown in Column No. 4 under Table 3.2 shall be adopted.
7
Combination of Loads for the Verification of Serviceability Limit State
Loads are required to be combined to satisfy the serviceability requirements. The serviceability
limit state check shall be carried out in order to have control on stress, deflection, vibration,
crack width, settlement and to estimate shrinkage and creep effects.
It shall be ensured that
the design value obtained by using the appropriate combination shall be less than the limiting
value of serviceability criterion as per the relevant code. The rare combination of loads shall
be used for checking the stress
limit. The frequent combination of loads shall be used for
checking the deflection, vibration and crack width. The quasi-permanent combination of loads
shall be used for checking the settlement, shrinkage creep effects and the permanent stress
in concrete.
7.1
Rare Combination
For checking the stress limits, the partial safety factor for loads shown in Column No. 2 under
Table 3.3 shall be adopted.
7.2
Frequent Combination
For checking the deflection, vibration and crack width
in prestressed concrete structures,
partial safety factor for loads shown in column no. 3 under Table 3.3 shall be adopted.
7.3
Quasi-permanent Combinations
For checking the crack width
in RCC structures, settlement, creep effects and to estimate
the permanent stress in the structure, partial safety factor
for loads shown in Column No. 4
under Table 3.3 shall be adopted.
8
Combination for Design of Foundations
For checking the base pressure under foundation and to estimate the structural strength
which includes the geotechnical loads, the partial safety factor for loads for 3 combinations
shown in Table 3.4 shall be used.
The material safety factor for the soil parameters, resistance factor and the allowable bearing
pressure for these combinations shall be as per relevant code.

Annex C
(Clause 209.3.3)
IRC:6-2014
Wind Load Computation on Truss Bridge Superstructure
C-1.1 Superstructures without
live load: The design transverse wind load
sliall be
derived separately for the areas of the windward and leeward truss girder and deck elements.
Except that
need not be derived considering the projected areas of windward parapet
shielded by windward truss, or vice versa, deck shielded by the windward truss, or vice versa
and leeward truss shielded by the deck.
The area
for each truss, parapet etc. shall be the solid area in normal projected elevation.
The area
for the deck shall be based on the full depth of the deck.
C-1.2 Superstructures with live load: The design transverse wind load shall be derived
separately for elements as specified
in C-1 and also for the live load depth. The area A^ for
the deck, parapets, trusses etc. shall be as for the superstructure without live load. The area
A^ for the live load shall be derived using the appropriate live load depth.
C-1 .3 Drag Coefficient
for All Truss Girder Superstructures
a)
Superstructures without live load: The drag coefficient
for each truss and for
the deck shall be derived as follows:
For a windward truss
shall be taken from Table C-1
. For leeward truss of a superstructure
with two trusses, drag coefficient shall be taken as t/C^. Values of shielding factor
rj are given
in Table C-2. The solidity ratio of the truss is the ratio of the effective area to the overall area
of the truss.
Where a superstructure has more than two trusses, the drag coefficient for the truss adjacent
to the windward truss shall be derived as specified above. The coefficient for all other trusses
shall be taken as equal to this value.
For Deck Construction, the drag coefficient shall be taken as
1 .1
.
b)
Superstructure with live load: The drag coefficient
for each truss and for the
deck shall be as for the superstructure without live load.
for the unshielded parts
of the live load shall be taken as
1 .45.
