The B-6 Committee decided that a document be prepared on 'Guidelines on Quality Systems for
Road Bridges' using reinforced, prestressed and composite concrete construction, keeping in view current
international practice.
In July, 1993 the Committee appointed a Group with the following personnel, for
preparation of draft guidelines:
Shri N.V. Merani
Convenor
Shri S.G. Joglekar
Member-Secretary
Shri A.G. Borkar
Member
Shri S.A. Reddi
Member
Shri P.Y. Manjure
Member
Shri Shitala Sharan
Member
The draft guidelines prepared by the Group were discussed by B-6 Committee and were approved
on 14th February 1996.
These were further considered and approved by the Bridge Specifications and
Standards Committee
in their meeting held at New Delhi on 2.12.96.
Later on,
these guidelines were
approved by the Executive Committee during its meeting held at New Delhi on 21 .1 2.96 and by the Council
during
its meeting held
at Nagpuron 13.1.97.
1 .2.
Need for Guidelines in Quality Systems
In order to achieve the aim of building safe, serviceable, durable and economic concrete bridges,
the structural elements should meet certain requirements.
The characteristics that a structure should



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 104
======================================================================
IRC:SP:47-1998
possess to fulfil these requirements have to be specified. The codes of practice and the contract documents
strive to achieve this by way of defining design criteria, practical rules, technical specifications, testing and
acceptance
criteria and workmanship.
All these strategies
implicitly depend upon human
skill for their
successful and reliable application which, eventually, determines the quality of the bridge. The basic desire
to produce quality work is essential in the minds of all those connected with bridge projects.
In order to achieve the required level of quality of the final product, as specified by engineering
science,
it is necessary to have a strategy for management of human skills by way of Quality System defining
quality policy, quality assurance plan and quality audit. Apart from this,
it is also necessary to explicitly define
'Quality'
itself, which
is expected
to be achieved through the Quality System.
These guidelines have,
therefore, been evolved to facilitate preparation of appropriate Quality System for individual bridge projects.
Use and application of these guidelines will inculcate, in all those involved in bridge building activity, an ability
to provide the product or services expected of them consistently, thereby, assuring the users and instilling
confidence in the users.
In
drafting these
guidelines,
an
attempt has been made
to achieve compliance
with
the
international codes
of ISO 9000
series
on
Quality Systems,
published by
International Standards
Organisation.
Compliance
with
the
present
guidelines
will be a step towards
obtaining ISO
Quality
Certification, enabling Indian designers and contractors to compete internationally.
1.3.
Scope
These
guidelines cover quality systems
for
activities
of bridge construction
using concrete
elements. These include project preparation, design and drawing, construction and supervision, contract
management, quality of materials and equipment used
in construction, and workmanship. The guidelines
also cover the organisational requirement for adoption of quality system by suppliers, purchasers, owners,
approving authorities and consultants.
These guidelines will enable
:
compliance with codal requirements of quality control.
setting up of internal quality systems for each of the organisations dealing with various aspects
of bridge construction.
setting up
of
external
quality systems by the
supplier,
to ensure conformance to specified
requirements
:
a)
at final inspection or,
b)
during production and installation, or
c)
during
several stages such
as design/development,
production,
installation and
maintenance

SECTION
2
GENERAL APPROACH
2.1.
Concept
The term 'quality' has been defined as the totality of features and characteristics of a product or
services
that bear on
its
ability
to
satisfy stated
or
implied
needs.
In
the
contractual
environments
needs/requirements are specified, whereas
in other environments implied needs/requirements should be
identified and defined.
The code of practice endeavours to meet the requirements by a three pronged
strategy.
Firstly,
it specifies the acceptable materials of construction outlining the various tests of acceptance;
secondly,
it define various design criteria practical rules and sound engineering
practices for guiding the
designers in arriving at appropriate structural solutions; and thirdly,
it deals with the workmanship and other
aspects of construction which ensure that the design intents are realised in actual construction. The contract
documents and technical specifications define the inter-relation of various parties to the contract as well as
the requirements of quality.
All these strategies implicitly depend upon human skill for their successful and
reliable application.
The total system of policy, management responsibility, internal and external control, testing and
quality control, acceptance criteria, corrective action, and documentation is covered in the quality system.
It
also encompasses the
overall organisational
structure,
responsibilities, procedures and processes
for
implementing quality management. The aspect of overall management functions that determines the quality
policy and implements
it by such means as quality planning, quality control and quality assurance within
its
quality system, is referred to as 'Quality Management'.
The terms used
in
the
field
of
quality management have acquired
specific meanings and
applications, different from the generic definitions found in dictionaries.
Internationally accepted definitions
and terminology have been included in Annexure, which also gives corresponding usage in relation to bridge
projects. The 'purchaser' or 'customer' is the term used for those who place order for the 'product' or 'service'
and the term 'supplier' for those who undertake to procure/produce/supply the same. The quality of the
product (or service)
is ensured and maintained by following a documented 'Quality Plan' which sets out
specific quality practices, including 'Quality Control' which are operational techniques of controlling quality.
'Quality Assurance' (QA)
includes all those planned actions necessary to provide adequate confidence that
the product (or service) will meet the requirements, and is essentially a system of planning, organising and
controlling human skills to assure quality.
Quality Assurance Plan sets out the planned actions required for
quality assurance. The continuous monitoring and verification of the status of QA activity to ensure that
it is
being followed
is called
'Quality Surveillance'.
'Quality
Policy'
is a formally documented statement
of
management's intentions and directions as regards quality.
'Quality Audit'
is a managerial tool used for
reviewing the whole or a part of the quality system by internal or external agencies not connected with the
operation of QA plan.
'Total Quality Management' brings to these concepts a long term global management
strategy to achieve and improve quality and calls for the participation of all members of the organisation for
the benefit of the organisation itself,
its members,
its customers and society as a whole.
2.2.
Principal Components of Quality System
Implementation of quality system involves the following principal components
:
i)
Supplier's Quality Policy
Commitment of the management of supplier to achieve and sustain quality of the product or
service to meet purchaser's stated or implied needs, whether contractually required or not.
ii)
Purchaser's Quality Policy
Commitment of the management of the purchaser to obtain quality product or service to meet
his stated or implied needs. This includes quality plan of the purchaser to satisfy himself about
the quality of end product.
3



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 104
======================================================================
IRC:SP:47-1998
iii)
Internal Quality Systems
Internal
quality systems
of
all concerned organisations
including
quality
plan,
quality
assurance, control of non-conforming products, quality audits and corrective actions.
iv)
Inspection and Audit
Inspection and audit of internal quality systems, mutually conducted quality control tests, or
independently conducted testing by third party and certification, so as to give confidence to
purchaser or his appointed agent, when required by contract.
2.3.
Requirements of Quality System
The requirements of quality system as given below are aimed primarily at achieving owners
satisfaction by preventing non-conformity.
i)
Management Responsibility
The supplier's management shall be responsible for quality policy.
This will include resource
mobilisation,
organisation
of personnel
defining
clearly the
responsibility,
authority and
inter-relation for performance, management and verification functions, lines of reporting, control
of non-conforming product and review and updating.
ii)
Quality System
The supplier shall establish, document and maintain a quality system including quality plans,
quality manual and procedures.
iii)
Contract Review
Supplier
shall
establish and maintain procedures
for contract review
to ascertain
that the
requirements are adequately specified
and understood and differences are
resolved and
recorded. He shall also ensure that he has the capability to meet the contractual requirements.
iv)
Design Control
Supplier (Designer) shall establish and maintain documented procedures to control and verify
the design to ensure that specified requirements are met.
These should cover the aspects of
design input, design activity, design output, design review, design verification, design changes,
and design validation.
v)
Document and Data Control
The supplier shall establish and maintain documented procedures to control all documents and
data which relate to the requirements of these guidelines.
This
control
shall ensure

that servicing meets the
specified
requirements.
xx)
Statistical Techniques
Where appropriate, the supplier shall establish procedures for identifying need for statistical
techniques required for controlling and verifying process capability and product characteristics.
Quality Assurance (QA) is defined as all the planned and systematic activities implemented within
the Quality System and demonstrated as needed, to provide adequate confidence that an entity will fulfill the
requirements.
A
Quality Assurance Manual
provides a base document
outlining
policy,
procedures,
responsibilities, compliance, acceptance criteria and documentation.
It should be prepared and accepted
by all parties concerned before start of project.
It should generally cover the following
:
a)
Identification of all parties involved in QA and their inter-relationship.
b)
Internal QA system of each party.
c)
Levels
of
cross-checking/verification
in case
of
multiple
verifications/controls,
systems of inspection and audit, wherever applicable.
including
d)
Organisation of personnel, responsibilities and lines of reporting for QA purposes.
e)
Criteria
for acceptance/rejection,
including
identification
of proper
authorities
decisions.
for such
f)
Inspection at the end of defect liability period.
g)
Items to be covered in maintenance manual.
h)
All formats for documentation.
Though several parties may be involved in enforcing quality assurance for any particular item of
work or a product, the ultimate responsibility of compliance with QA Manual and of achieving required quality
generally rests with one party. When process and/or product control is carried out by the supplier/producer
or his agent,
it is termed as internal control or 'one level' control.
For important items of work, independent
parallel checks/supervision are carried out by one or more agencies, either on full scale or on sample basis.
This is normally carried out as external control or second level control.
In some cases, third level of control
may also be required such as that by a regulatory body or by insurance agency. These levels of control
should be clearly defined in the Quality Assurance Manual. The Manual should also identify the responsible
parties, their functions and inter-relation between them.
2.5.
Classes of Quality Assurance for Bridges
Depending upon the levels of checking/cross-checking and controls, required to provide adequate
confidence, four classes of quality assurance are mentioned below
:

======================================================================
!RC:SP:47-1998
Since the degree of requirement of confidence for bridge construction
is very high, nominal QA
i.e. Class Q-1 shall not be permitted in bridge construction. Thus there will be only three classes of QA for
bridge construction, namely Q-2, Q-3 and Q-4.
A consistent set
of
quality assurance
activities adopted
for different operations
will
lead
to
achievement of one of the three classes mentioned above. The detailed description of the controls falling in
the above three QA classes for various activities are given in Section 3. Once a desired overall quality class
is chosen for a bridge project, the minimum degree (level) of controls
in various activities should be as
indicated in Section 3 for the respective class. This, however, does not preclude raising the degree of controls
for some
of the items only (thereby
partially adopting a higher class
for such
items),
if the
particular
upgradation is considered necessary. For simplicity of classification, however, such partial upgradation shall
not be deemed to increase the overall class of QA.
2.6.
Guidelines for Selection of QA Class for Bridge Projects
Prior to the commencement of 'project preparation' stage, one of the three QA classes should be
tentatively chosen for the project. This classification should be reviewed depending on site specific problems
and types of solutions being evolved. At this stage, the final selection of the overall QA class of the project
should be made.
Simultaneously decision regarding upgradation of class for some of the activities,
if found
necessary, should also be made.
The following guidelines are given for selection of appropriate QA class for bridges.
The word
'bridges' includes flyovers, culverts and all such structures carrying road traffic.
1)
No bridge should have QA below class Q-2.
2)
Q-2 class of QA can be adopted for following categories of bridges
a)
Bridges upto 60 m length and having individual span length not exceeding 20 m.
b)
Bridges having deck area upto 480 sq.m.
c)
Construction materials: Plain or Reinforced Concrete.
In order to cater to specific problems, some of the activities may be raised to Q-3 class.
3)
Q-3 class of QA can be adopted for following categories of bridges
a)
Bridges having spans exceeding 20 m.
b)
Bridges having lengths more than 60 m, having individual span lengths not exceeding 45
m.
c)
Bridges having deck area exceeding 480 sq.m.
d)
Construction materials: Plain Concrete, Reinforced Concrete or Prestressed Concrete.
For bridges across
rivers which are shifting
in nature or which present some problems
of
stability, and/or those having special foundation problems, some of the activities may be raised
to higher class.
4)
Q-4 class of QA can be adopted for following categories of bridges
a)
Bridges built with innovative design/construction/materials such as those using very large
spans, cable stay concept,
high performance concrete, new prestressing systems
etc.
Separate
quality assurance manual
as appropriate
to cover such
design,
materials/construction techniques should be prepared and defined in the tender document.
b)
Bridges at locations where no alternative routes are available nearby, or where disruption
to
traffic
over
long
period
is
unacceptable, and where
repair/replacement
cost
are
considered very high.

2.7.
Quality Assurance Manual for Bridges
2.7.1
.
The owner, consultant, approving authority, main contractor, material supplier, manufacturers of
items
to be
incorporated
in
the
structures,
specialist/nominated
sub-contractors and equipment
manufacturers are the parties involved in the overall QA system for bridge construction.
Typical organisational structure for various parties involved in design and construction (owners
as well as contractors) are given in Figs. 2.1, 2.2 & 2.3.
2.7.2.
Various activities on a bridge project can be classified under three major groups
:
i)
ii)
iii)
Design
Construction
Manufacturing
2.7.2.1.
In design
activity, purchaser
is the authority who places the order for design and/or project
preparation.
It may be either the owner of the bridge as in the case of preparation of detailed design, or the
contractor, as in the case of 'design and construct' contracts.
Supplier is the consultant who undertakes to
prepare the design.
The design, drawings and tender documents are the end products.
The QA manual
should cover those requirements of Quality System, which primarily concern 'services' or 'expertise'.
2.7.2.2.
In construction
activity, purchaser is the authority who places the order for construction of bridge.
Supplier is the contractor who undertakes to construct the bridge. The bridge itself is the end product.
2.7.2.3.
The manufacturing activity falls in the following two categories:
The
first category consists
of factory manufactured
items
of general use such as cement,
reinforcing
steel,
prestressing
steel,
admixture and
the
like.
Quality assurance
of the
manufacturing
processes of those items need not be covered under the quality assurance manual for bridges.
However,
the requirements
of quality system
pertaining
to the specifications
of
quality,
testing and acceptance
procedure, procurement, storage, traceability and such other relevant items, which are to be carried out by
owner/designer/contractor, should be covered therein.
The second category of manufactured items cover prestressing anchorages, bearings, expansion
joints, hand rails and the like, which are manufactured by specialist suppliers and are purchased and used
as a finished product in the bridge by the contractor. The quality assurance manual should cover the quality
assurance of the manufacturing of such items.
2.7.3.
Main aspects of activities which affect the quality of a bridge are highlighted below
Activity
Project
Preparation
(Data
collection,
selection
of
suitable
options,
project
document)
Main Aspects Affecting Quality
i)
Adequacy and accuracy of data, and
surveys (including materials survey);
reliability
of data and source; and
documentation.
ii)
Solutions based on codes and
practices,
taking
into account
for
relevant
local and
past
experience,
and documentation.
iii)
Documentation
of
all
alternatives
considered.
iv)
Review before finalisation.

SECTION
3
QUALITY ASSURANCE
REQUIREMENTS OF
DIFFERENT CLASSES
OF
QUALITY
3.1.
General
This section contains detailed guidelines indicating requirements of different classes of quality for
bridge projects. The selection of a class for projects is discussed in Section 2. The requirements of quality
control and level (degree) of control are given in Table 3.1 under six sub-heads, as follows:
1)
Project Preparation
2)
Design and Drawings
3)
Contractual Aspects
4)
Construction Organisations
5)
Materials
6)
Workmanship
Aspects of project preparation as well as designs and drawings have been covered briefly, and
are indicative of the general approach.
However, the aspects of construction affecting quality are covered
in greater detail.
3.2.
Project-Specific QA Plan
The contents of the table provide broad check list of various activities for a typical bridge project.
Based on this table and QA class chosen
in accordance with Section 2 a detailed 'project-specific' quality
assurance plan shall be prepared in each case.
All relevant factors must be considered in detail before finally
choosing the overall quality assurance class for a particular project or even for particular activities within the
project itself, taking into account the consistency of the QA requirements for all critical components of the
bridge. Such QA plan is normally prepared by the owner, or by construction agency, and when prepared by
the latter,
it
is scrutinized and approved by the owners or the consultants to the project. The QA plan shall
be documented in the form of QA Manual. The QA plan/manual so prepared should form part of the contract
agreement. A typical QA plan for construction activities is illustrated in Section 4.
3.3
Implementation
Implementation of quality assurance plan may be carried out by the following methods
:
1 )
Internal control by the construction agency
2)
External control either by the owners or by the third party inspection agency.
The choice of agency for enforcement of quality assurance plan should preferably be spelt out in
the tender documents.

SECTION 4
TYPICAL QUALITY ASSURANCE PLAN FOR CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN
4.1.
Introduction
Quality Planning to assure quality of product has been adopted over the last few decades for
special and complex projects.
However, in case of bridge engineering and construction, some efforts in this
regard are visible only in the recent few years.
As a result of continuing efforts,
it has become possible to
evolve appropriate methods and level of documentation for Quality Assurance Plan for bridge projects.
Surveillance of project implementation
if well organised into a quality assurance plan, contributes
towards the
quality.
For
this,
step by step procedures, which would help
in achieving consistent and
comprehensive methods of checking and approval of works at every stage, need to be established and
documented. These procedures should be reviewed periodically, amended as found necessary, and revised
documents prepared.
All parties involved
in the QA plan should have their internal QA systems clearly defined in form
of a specific Quality Assurance Manual (QAM) tor the respective purposes, such as, QAM for Design (by the
Design Organisation), GAM for construction (by the contractor), QAM for manufactured products (by the
manufactures or suppliers).
It is also necessary for owner/purchaser to have his own internal QA plan. QAM
for bridge projects as a whole integrating all these plans shall be prepared/or approved by the owner and/or
approving authority,
if any. Each vendor (i.e. supplier, designer, contractor, manufacturer) will thus have its
own internal QA procedures which are required to be agreed upon,
in advance, with the purchaser of the
respective activity. As bridge building
in India
is mostly undertaken by Govt, agencies,
it is necessary that
the contractor/designer obtains concurrence of their QAM from the concerned Government Department
('Department').
The Guidelines provided
in Sections 2 and 3 should be used by the respective parties
in
evolving their internal QA Systems.
As an illustrative example, this Section 4 deals with the structure and
contents of the operational QAM to be agreed between the contractor and the Department for adoption at
site.
Quality assurance plan for a bridge construction project, documented in quality assurance manual,
would essentially comprise the following aspects
:
—
Organisation
—
Control of data and documentation, both product (bridge) related documents, and quality related
records together with control documents
—
Q.A. procedure tor setting out of works and temporary works
—
Methodology ot working
—
Controi of materials
—
Control of workmanship aspects
—
Protection during construction stage
—
Non-conforming products
—
Quality audit
4.2.
Organisation
In most of the cases, the management of the constructor shall be responsible for jointly reviewing
the requirements of the project with the owner, and structuring the appropriate organisation for the same.
This project specific organisation
is headed by Project Engineer.
The duties, among the staff below him
could be generally on the following functional lines
:
a)
Planning Engineer
Covering
all aspects of work planning, resource requirements of both materials and labour,
progress review and internal interface activities.

4.3.2.
Quality Related Records and Documents
For quality assurance of work,
it is essential to document each and every operation and activity
connected with the work and maintain the record of inspections, approvals/non-approvals and other statistical
day to day information about the progress of work. These are normally recorded in the standard forms (to be
specially evolved for each activity) and they constitute an important component of the Quality Assurance
Manual. Each activity or operation could be broadly categorised as under
:
a)
Method Statement
The method statements give detailed proposals of the constructing agency which are approved
by the 'Engineer' (owner's Engineer in-charge of the project).
These method statements are
written in form of various steps in a particular sequence supplemented by suitable sketches to
be self-explanatory.
No change shall be carried out from the procedures prescribed
in the
method statements without first obtaining approvals to such changes from the 'Engineer'.
b)
Inspection Proforma
These are used for the purpose of seeking approvals from the 'Engineer' or his representative
before commencing every
operation, such
as,
pour cards
for concrete,
approval
to
reinforcement, approval to formwork, approval to setting out, approval to prestressing, approval
to grouting, etc. These are usually supplemented by standard checklist which have to be verified
by the 'Engineer' and after he is satisfied about the various points, the approval is then accorded
on that form.
c)
Test Results
This set
of proformae
is meant
for recording the
results
of day-to-day tests carried out
in
accordance with the requirements or specifications. The proformae are usually maintained in
two forms; one is loose leaf system for recording the various observations during each test and
second is for recording the summary of test results in a register form to facilitate later analysis.
d)
Daily Diary of Work and Quantity Records
Elaborate registers are required to be maintained at site to record the day-to-day operations,
activities and events taking place at the site of work such as equipment deployed, manpower
deployed, activities carried out, different types of materials consumed, detailed observations
of the activities at site (foundation strata,
tilts, shifts, etc.), stressing, grouting, visits by senior
level engineers and follow-up of their instructions. These records will enable preparation of the
completion
report as
well as investigating any unusual observations which come to notice
afterwards.
e)
Non-conforming Products
Detailed statements have to be prepared describing the procedures to be followed as soon as
any result not conforming to the requirements
(or unusually better results)
is obtained. Such
statements
deal
with
the
(i) procedures
to be adopted
for
rectification
of
the
particular
component where such result has been noticed,
(ii) the long term corrective action, and
(iii)
immediate preventive actions
in other similarly affected activities
till the long term corrective
actions are implemented.
f)
Quality Audit
A separate set of proformae with detailed instructions are laid down for facilitating the audit of
the quality assurance by an independent unit at periodical intervals.

4.7.
Control of Workmanship Aspects
To achieve the desired workmanship
at various stages
of work,
it
is necessary to carry out
inspection in a regular and systematic manner. The Constructor shall devise an appropriate system for such
inspections and get
it approved from the 'Engineer'.
Following points should be considered for inspection of
various components/operations:
—
Method statements including tolerances
—
Request forms for inspection
—
Inspection proformae
—
Authority levels for inspection
—
Inspection procedures (preliminary, periodic and on completion checks)
—
Check lists to systematise the inspections
—
Record inspection.
The above points should be considered for the various activities involved in construction such as
formwork, reinforcement, concreting, prestessing, grouting, finishing, etc.
In order to produce a quality end product,
it is necessary to lay down procedures for preventing
any damage or deterioration of the various materials brought to site as well as the works partially completed
or fully completed
till the completion of the entire job.
These procedures will have to be laid down in respect of the following
:
a)
Storage of materials
like cement, rebars, prestressing steel, bearings, expansion joints
etc.,
and their protection
till use.
b)
Protection of the partially completed components of the bridge, both from the point of view of
structural
stability
(including
the
hydraulic
factors) and from
the adverse
effects
of the
environment.
Particular attention needs to be paid to exposed reinforcement, strands etc.
c)
Prevention of accidents to the structure as well as
all personnel working on the project due to
incomplete work, or works in progress.
d)
Servicing of some of the components particularly in case of projects being carried out over a
long period of time such as oiling and greasing of bearings,
filling of the joints and expansion
joints, etc.
If any deterioration
is noticed inspite of protective measures, the same shall be rectified before
taking up subsequent operations.
For quality assurance of the finished work,
it is necessary for the materials and workmanship to
fully comply with the work requirement.
Non-conforming work shall be rejected.
Special situations, however, arise such as strength of concrete where non-conformance may only
be known after sometime, e.g. after 28 days. Therefore, separate detailed procedures should be laid out for
dealing with such non-conforming concretes, (Refer proforma E-1 for further guidance).
4.10.
Quality Audit
The Quality Assurance Manager of constructor and 'Department' shall establish documents and
programme for an independent quality audit, which shall objectively evaluate the extent of compliance with
the quality systems and their effectiveness. The audit shall include the process and product quality audit as
well as the assessment of adequacy of systems as laid out in QA Manual.

======================================================================
PAGE 55 of 104
======================================================================
IRC:SP:47-1998
The audit programme shall assign qualified personnel to perform such audits and define the
procedures and frequency of audits, the method of reporting the findings and recommendations and the
means for corrective actions and their re-audit.
4.11.
Design Aspects
It is assumed in the earlier sub-section that the design is not the contractor's responsibility and is
separately finalised by the Department. However, where the contractor is also to supply the design, the QAM
should include the agreed procedures for the items listed below to achieve QA in design:
a)
Organisation and Functional Responsibilities (Including Personnel Qualifications)
Responsibilities for ensuring
quality by persons in-charge
of design, and assuring that the
stipulated quality indeed has been achieved (assurance function of QA team) need to be clearly
defined.
b)
Design basis report for development of design
This includes
:
—
Requirements of project/client
—
Preliminary drawings and
data:
Source,
responsibilities
of supply and methods
of
verification
—
Design approach, applicable codes, special design specifications
—

Proformae of Quality Records
As mentioned earlier, exhaustive and detailed proformae will have to be evolved and prescribed
for the above purpose for each of the major bridge to suit its special requirements, which form a part of the
Quality Assurance Manual for that bridge. However, certain typical proformae which have been adopted on
some of the work sites in India, are attached for each of the category to give an idea of the structure of these
forms. These are not complete in themselves and they need to be modified, augmented or supplemented
according to the needs of a particular work.

SECTION 5
TYPICAL PROFORMAE
Note:
Typical proformae which have been adopted on some of the work sites in India are attached to give
an idea of the structure of these proformae.
These are indicative and may be modified, augmented or
supplemented according to the needs of a particular work. The proformae are divided into categories
:
Category A:
Planning Proformae
Category B:
Inspection Proformae
Category C:
Surveillance Proformae
Category D:
Proformae for Registers and Records
Category E:
Proformae for Procedural Guidelines of QA System

GUIDELINES FOR NON-CONFORMING WORKS
1.
GENERAL
In broad terms, for the Quality Assurance of the finished work
it is necessary for the materials and
workmanship to conform with the Contract requirements.
Ideally, non-conforming work shall be rejected.
The Statement above
is true
in general terms but special difficulties arise in the case of concrete,
where the non-conformance may only be known after 28 days cube results become available, in which period
work has progressed further.
In some of the situations, acceptance after repair/review for adequacy
is
feasible. Therefore, separate procedures are laid out for some of the non-conforming situations.
In case the
item does not meet the requirements after such repair/review, the non-conforming item should be rejected.
2.
CONCRETE WORKS
The primary means by which Quality Assurance shall be achieved
is by the procedures described
in relevant material qualification and workmanship method statements. The non-conforming concrete items
shall be further reviewed, as given below
:
2.1
Non-conformance Other than Strength or Finish
In the event that any requirement other than strength and standard of finish
is not met then the
following procedure shall be followed:
1
.
The Contractor shall be notified without delay verbally and
in writing by the following means:
a)
Return of the Request for Inspection Form signed "not approved" with the reasons for rejection
stated
b)

These terms have been further clarified
in these codes by additional notes for which
reference may be made to the code itself. The notes printed in bracketed italics in this section
are added for clarifying the applicability for bridge construction.
It
is also found necessary to define certain other general terms in order to clarify their usage
in the quality field. Additional terms have been defined which have special context
in bridge
engineering industry. These are included under sub-group A2.0.
A2.0.
Sub-group of General Terms/Bridge Industry Terms
