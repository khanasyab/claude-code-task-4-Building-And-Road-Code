INTRODUCTION
Recognizing
the
need
for
expeditious
development
of Access
Controlled
Facilities
simultaneously ensuring safe and high speed travel which interalia improves the productivity
of road transport system,
it was decided by the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways and the
Planning Commission through a series of meetings during December 201 2 and January 201
3
that a standard Manual of Specifications and Standards for Expressways should be brought
out by the Indian Roads Congress (IRC). Accordingly, the IRC formulated the proposal and
the task for the same was entrusted to IRC by the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways on
11*^ February, 2013. An Expert Group comprising of following experts was constituted by IRC
for the preparation of the Manual:-
1.
Shri S.C. Sharma
Team Leader
2.
Shri DP. Gupta
Member
3.
Shri R.S. Sharma
Member
4.
Dr. L.R. Kadiyali
Member
5.
Shri Kiyoshi Dachiku
Member
6.
Ms Neha Vyas
Member
The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways constituted a Peer Review Group under the
Chairmanship of Director General (Road Development) & Special Secretary having members
representing all categories of stakeholders.
The Expert Group prepared a Technical Note on Critical Issues which was discussed during
the Workshop organized
by the MORTH on
22''^
February, 2013 and
also
in
Planning
Commission on 6'^ March, 2013. The Critical Issues were deliberated, discussed and frozen
during these two meetings, which enabled the Expert Group to move forward.
It was decided that the Manual should be structured on the lines of the existing Manual of
Specifications and Standards for Four-laning of Highways published by IRC. The expressways
need
to be planned as
fully access controlled highways where entry and
exit points are
provided
at pre-determined
locations.The Manual
is intended mainly
for new/green
field
expressways projects. This Manual
is not applicable for design of expressways
in urban
areas andin
hilly terrain. Due consideration has been given to conservation of material and
environmental aspects as
well. As a departure from the
existing guidelines,
the Manual
professes near ground level expressways in the plain terrain and with moderate cutting and
fillings in the rolling terrain.
The design considerations require that this type of expressways is constructed where flood,
drainage or water table do not pose any problem and due care is taken from drainage point
of view while keeping the expressway level close to the existing ground level.
The side approach roads should invariably cross over the expressway facility to maintain the
sanctity of access controlled features.

IRC:SP:99-2013
1.12
General considerations for Planning, Design and Construction
The Project Expressway shall be planned as a "fully access controlled highway" where entry
to and exit from the Expressway shall be provided only at pre-determined locations through
properly designed entry/exit ramps and/or from interchanges. In doing so, the Concessionaire
shall take measures to overcome the physical and operational constraints and plan, design
and construct the Project Expressway using appropriate methods, management techniques
and technologies. General considerations shall, without being limited to, be as follows:
i)
Carriageway provision and future widening
The number of lanes to be provided for the Project Expressway shall be
specified in Schedule-B of the Concession Agreement.
It shall be developed
in accordance with the typical cross-sections given in Para 2. 1 6 of Section-2.
Where only four lane (2x2) or six lane (2x3) carriageway is specified initially
with depressed median, placement of the divided carriageway shall be as
shown
in the
typical cross-sections
(Fig.
2.1(a) and
Fig.
2.1(b)).
In
this
situation, the width of median shall be increased by multiple of 3.75 m for
each additional lane to allow widening of the carriageway on the right side
of the inside lane to achieve the ultimate eight lane carriageway (with 15 m
wide depressed median) as and when required in future.
In the case of flush median, future widening shall be done on outer side.
ii)
Safety of design
The Project Expressway shall be designed to provide for high level of safety
and operational efficiency for the movement of large volumes of traffic at high
speed. Alignment design, geometries, cross-sectional features, structures,
road signage, markings, advance information system, and other traffic safety
and management features and tolling system shall be designed to conform
to the best standards and international practices to achieve a consistent,
safe and efficient design to cater for highest safety to the user and meet
the intended functions of the Project Expressway. Interchanges, exits and
entrances should be tested for ease of operation and for route continuity
from a driver's point of view.
All designs shall be structurally safe to ensure that the Project Expressway
or any
part thereof
(for example embankment,
pavement,
interchanges,
retaining
structures,
bridges,
culverts,
etc.)
does
not
collapse
(global
stability) nor
its serviceability/performance
(for example settlement,
riding
quality, undulations, deflections, etc.) deteriorates below acceptable level as
prescribed
in Schedule-K of the Concession Agreement.
iii)
Durability
The Project Expressway shall not only be safe but also durable. This would
mean that the deteriorating effects of climate and environment (for example
6



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 160
======================================================================
IRC:SP:99-2013
wetting and drying, freezing and thawing,
rainfall, temperature differences,
aggressive environment leading to corrosion, etc.)
in addition to the traffic
shall be duly considered
in design and construction
to make the
Project
Expressway durable.
iv)
Mitigating disruptive effects of construction
The planning, design and construction of the Project Expressway shall be
such that its construction does not have adverse impact on the environment,
ecology and does not disrupt the lives and business activities of the people
living close to the Project Expressway. Appropriate measures shall be taken
as specified in Section-14 of this Manual.
1.13
Safety during Construction and Operation & iViaintenance
1.13.1
The Concessionaire shall develop, implement and administer a surveillance and safety
programme for providing a safe environment on or about the Project Expressway, and shall comply
with the safety requirements set forth
in the Concession Agreement.
1.13.2
Before taking up any construction or maintenance operation/work, the Concessionaire
shall prepare a Traffic Management Plan for each work zone and furnish
it to the Independent Engineer
for comments duly incorporating the following:
i)
Designate a Site Safety Team headed by a qualified Safety Officer.
ii)
Traffic safety devices as per IRC:SP:55.
iii)
Sprinkling
of water for dust control
at work zones,
haul roads and plant/camp
sites.
iv)
Noise/Pollution suppression measures at work zones, haul roads and plant/camp
sites.
v)
Mechanical, electrical and fire safety practices.
vi)
Safety measures like PPE (Personal Protection Equipment) for workers engaged.
vii)
First Aid and Emergency Response Arrangements
i.e.
First Aid Box, Ambulance,
paramedical staff, alarms, etc.
viii)
Safety training/awareness programmes.
ix)
Formats
to maintain the accident records/emergency response provided
during
accidents.
1.14
Field Laboratory
The Concessionaire shall set up field laboratory for testing of materials and finished products
as stipulated in Clause 1 20 of MORTH Specifications. He shall make necessary arrangements
for additional/confirmatory testing
of any materials/products
at a government accredited
laboratory, for which facilities at site laboratory are not available.

including provision of noise barriers, etc. for review and comments of the IE, and undertake
implementation of the proposals in consultation with the IE.
1.16
Utilities
The details of the new utilities which are to be constructed or provided for along or across the
Project Expressway shall be as specified
in Scheduie-B of the Concession Agreement. No
utility should be situated under any part of the roadway, except where the utility crosses the
Expressway. Such utilities shall cross through a culvert.
1.17
Review and Comments by the Independent Engineer
In cases where the Concessionaire
is required to send any drawings or documents to the
Independent Engineer
for review and comments, and
in
the event such comments are
received by the Concessionaire,
it shall duly consider such comments in accordance with the
Concession Agreement and Good Industry Practice for taking appropriate action thereon.

2.1
General
i)
This Section
lays down the standards
for geometric design and general
features for expressways. The application
of geometric standards should
aim at achieving safety, mobility and efficiency in traffic operation.
ii)
The
geometric design
of the
Project Expressway
shall
conform
to
the
standards set out
in this Section as a minimum. The Concessionaire shall
ensure that liberal geometric standards are followed to the extent feasible
within the given Right of Way.
iii)
As
far as
possible,
uniformity
of design
standards
shall
be
maintained
throughout the length of the Project Expressway.
In case of any change,
it
shall be effected
in a gradual manner to conform to driver expectations.
iv)
The geometric design should address environmental concerns and provide
positive guidance to the driver to travel safely.
2.2
Design Speed
2.2.1
The
design speeds
given
in
Table
2.1
shall
be adopted
for various
terrain
classifications. (Terrain is classified by the general slope of the ground across the Expressway
alignment).
Table 2.1 Design Speed

Rolling
Between 10 and 25 percent
100
2.2.2
Short stretches (say less than
1 km) of varying terrain met with on the alignment
shall not be taken into consideration while deciding the terrain classification for a given section
of the Project Expressway. Where an intervening stretch
is classified as hilly/mountainous
stretch and
it may not be expedient from economic and environmental consideration to adopt
even standards applicable to rolling terrain, a lower design speed of 80 km/h consistent with
the topography and driver expectancy may be adopted and
in such stretches speed
limit
signs shall be posted.
2.3
Right-of-Way
2.3.1
The Right-of-Way
(the ROW) for the Project Expressway shall be as given
in
Schedule-A of the Concession Agreement. The Authority would acquire the additional land
required,
if any. The land to be acquired shall be indicated in Schedule-A of the Concession
Agreement. The recommended minimum Right ofWay in Plain/Rolling terrain for expressways
is given in Table 2.2.

Vertical Alignment
'
2.9.4.1
General
The vertical alignment should provide for a smooth longitudinal profile. Grade changes shall
not be too frequent as to cause kinks and visual discontinuities in the profile. Desirably there
should be no change in grade within a distance of 150 m. The directions given in IRC:73 and
IRC:SP:23 should be complied.
Decks of small cross drainage structure (i.e. culverts or minor bridges) shall follow the same
profile as the flanking road section, without any break in the grade line.
The aspect of efficient drainage shall be kept into consideration while designing vertical profile
and cross-sections of the Project Expressway as stipulated in IRC:SP:42 and IRC:SP:50.
The
vertical alignment shall be coordinated with the horizontal alignment as indicated
in
Section 2.9.5.
2.9.4.2
Gradients
The ruling and limiting gradients are given in Table 2.9.

Ruling gradient shall be adopted as far as possible. Limiting gradients shall be adopted only
in very difficult situations and for short lengths.
In cut-sections, minimum gradient for drainage considerations is 0.5 percent (1
in 200)
if the
side drains are lined; and 1.0 percent (1
in 100)
if these are unlined.

2.9.4.3
Vertical curves
Long sweeping vertical curves shall be provided at all grade changes. Summit curves and
Valley curves shall be designed as square parabolas. The length of the vertical curve
is
controlled by sight distance requirements, but desirably curves with longer length shall be
provided from aesthetic considerations. The minimum grade change requiring vertical curve
and the minimum length of vertical curve shall be as given in Table 2.10.

2.9.5
Coordination of horizontal and vertical alignment
The
overall appearance
of an expressway can be enhanced
considerably by judicious
combination of the horizontal and vertical alignments. Plan and profile of the road shall not
be designed independently but in unison, so as to produce an appropriate three-dimensional
effect. Proper co-ordination in this respect will ensure safety, avoid visual discontinuities and
contribute to overall aesthetics.
Vertical curvature superimposed upon horizontal curvature gives a pleasing effect. As such
the vertical and horizontal curves shall coincide as far as possible and their length shall be
more or less equal.
If this
is difficult for any reason, the horizontal curve shall be somewhat
longer than the vertical curve. Short vertical curve superimposed on long horizontal curve
and vice versa gives distorted appearance and shall be avoided. Sharp horizontal curves
shall be avoided at or near the apex of pronounced summit/sag vertical curves from safety
considerations.
The designer shall check profile design in long continuous plots to help avoid a roller-coaster
profile.
2.10
Lateral and Vertical Clearance at Underpasses
Wherever a cross road
is proposed to be taken below the Project Expressway, minimum
clearances at underpasses shall be as follows:
2.10.1
Lateral clearance
1)
Full roadway width of the cross road shall be carried through the underpass.
For Vehicular Underpass, the lateral clearance shall not be less than 12 m
(7 m carriageway + 2 x 2.5 m shoulder width on either side) or as indicated
in Schedule-B of the Concession Agreement.

Access Control
2.12.1
Access
Project Expressway shall be designed for fast motorized
traffic with
full control of access.
Access to the Expressway shall be provided with grade separators at location of intersections.
Parking/standing, loading/unloading of goods and passengers and pedestrians/animals shall
not be permitted on the Expressway.
2.12.2
Location of interchange
The
locations
of
individual
interchanges
are
determined
primarily
to
reduce
detour
considering regional network and nearness to places of importance. Location of interchange
is guided by the following situations:
i)
At crossing
or nearest points
of other Expressways,
National Highways,
State Highways and important arterial roads.
ii)
At crossing or nearest points of major roads
to important
ports,
airports,
material transport facilities, commercial and industrial areas, and places of
tourist interest.
The
interchanges
shall
be
provided
at
the
locations
specified
in Schedule-B
of
the
Concession Agreement.
2.12.3
Connecting roads

======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 160
======================================================================
IRC:SP:99-2013
be terminated and are required to be continued across the Project Expressway. For such
intersections where
parallel cross roads are located within 2 km distance crossings may
be designed as a staggered crossing by connecting parallel cross roads and taking them
across
the
Project Expressway through
a
vehicular underpass/overpass. The
vehicular
underpasses/overpasses shall be so located that no vehicle
is required to travel more than
2 km on connecting road for crossing over.
The structure may be either an underpass or an overpass depending upon the nature of
terrain,
vertical
profile of road,
availability of adequate
right of way,
etc. Unless otherwise
specified
in Schedule-B of the Concession Agreement, the Project Expressway shall be
carried at the existing level and the entire cost involved in raising or lowering the road would
be included
in the cost of the Project Expressway. Decision whether the cross road or the
Project Expressway will be carried at the existing level will be taken at the time of preparing
the feasibility report and would be based on considerations of drainage, land acquisition,
provision of ramps for the grade separated facility, height of embankment and project economy
etc.
In
built up areas, the Project Expressway shall be elevated on via duct as specified
in
Schedule-B of the Concession Agreement.

Clear Zone
A clear zone is the unobstructed traversable area provided beyond the edge of the through
carriageway for the recovery of errant vehicles. A clear-zone width of 9-11 m for design
speed of 1 00-1 20 km/hour for the errant vehicles leaving the through carriageway to recover
be provided. Embankment slopes of 1V:4H or flatter are recoverable slopes and
if
it
is not
feasible to provide the suggested clear-zone distance from the edge of the carriageway,
a crash
barrier should form
part of the clear-zone distance. The concept
is
illustrated
in
Fig. 2.3 (adapted from AASHTO Roadside Design Guide).

SECTION -3
GRADE SEPARATORS AND INTERCHANGES
3.1
Introduction
The intersections to be provided shall be one of the following types:
i)
Grade Separators (Grade separated Intersections without ramps)
ii)
Interchanges
The types and locations of Grade Separators (Grade-separated Intersections without ramps)
and
Interchanges
shall be based on requirements
stipulated
in MORTH
Guidelines
for
Expressways. These shall be specified in Schedule-B of the Concession Agreement.
3.2
Grade Separators
3.2.1
The access from the Project Expressway to the cross roads
in case of Grade
Separators shall be through the nearest interchange.
3.2.2
Geometric standards for design
The geometric design standards for various elements of Grade Separators shall be as given in
MORTH Guidelines for Expressways except as otherwise indicated in this Manual. Gradient
for approaches shall not be steeper than 2.5 percent (1
in 40).
3.2.3
Design of structures
Design of structures shall conform to Section-6 of this Manual. Minimum length of viaduct
required to be provided shall be specified in Schedule-B of the Concessionaire Agreement.
3.3
Interchanges
3.3.1
Types of Interctianges
'
-
There are two broad categories of Interchanges, based on traffic exchange:
i)
Service Interchanges
: This refers to an interchange of the Expressway
with a road less in importance than Expressway.
For
this category,
it
is considered
that Expressway
shall be a
toll
road,
and the other intersecting road shall be a "non-tolled" road or a road with
open system of tolling with the
toll plaza on the other road minimum 2 km
away. This requires the consideration of tolling system which considers a
barrier system as well as toll booths on the interchange ramps. This requires
provision of appropriate deceleration and acceleration lanes and operating
speed limitations in the interchange areas.
25



======================================================================
PAGE 36 of 160
======================================================================
IRC:SP:99-2013
ii)
System
Interchanges
:
This
refers
to
an
interchange
between
two
Expressways
For this category, since both the
intersecting routes are
toll roads under
closed system,
toll booths on ramps are not required. The system needs
to cater for high speed operation. The
toll collection arrangements need to
be considered on integrated basis between the two involved expressway
stretches. The modalities need to be suitably addressed.
3.3.2
Service interchanges
Generally, Trumpet-type and T-type
Interchanges are
the
preferred
configuration. The
advantages are;
i)
Suitable for three way junction with no weaving,
ii)
Limited requirement of ROW area,
iii)
Single point toll plaza,
Diamond and Cloverleaf Interchanges require a number of toll plazas on entry/exit ramps,
whereas Trumpet-type or T-type Interchanges require single toll plaza.
3.3.3
System interctianges
System interchanges are to handle high volume of traffic. The connecting ramps can be
directional, semi-directional and large radius loops as well. The aspect of toll sharing between
adjacent concessionaires shall be integrated. The basic forms may comprise of three legs or
four legs.
For Three Leg Interchanges, the T-type configuration would require larger loops and semi
directional ramps of larger radius based on traffic volumes. This may also require catering
for frontage road.
For Four Leg Interchanges, the forms may be Diamond, clover leafs directional and semi
directional
interchanges and composite interchanges
requiring combinations
of
straight,
curved or with loops and weaving. These configurations generally require multi-level structures.
Fig. 3.1 presents illustrative service and system interchanges.
3.3.4
Ramp types
Ramps are provided at interchanges for desired turning movements. Based on movement
requirements, the connecting ramps may be classified as Direct, Semi-direct and Loop ramps
(Fig. 3.2).
3.3.5
Spacing between interctianges
Interchange spacing
is based upon demand
for access from the important cross roads,
adequate
distance
to
provide
for signing and weaving and
permit
sufficient lengths
of
speed change lanes for respective adjacent interchange to operate safely and
efficiently
26



======================================================================
PAGE 37 of 160
======================================================================
IRC:SP:99-2013
at a desired
level of service. For expressways, a spacing
of 3 km
is absolute minimum
from deceleration, weaving and acceleration consideration. For spacing less than 3 km, both
the interchange shall be considered as a combined one. For expressways, a spacing
of
20-30 km is desirable.
3.3.6
Ramp design speed
Recommended design speeds for interchange ramps are given in Table 3.1.

3.3.7
Ramp width and cross-section
The ramp shall have two lanes. The ramp cross-section showing carriageway width and
shoulder (both paved and earthen) is given in Fig. 3.3 for two way two lane ramps on tangent
alignment. The width of paved and earthen shoulders considered here are for interchange
ramp design only. Applicable extra wide carriageway shall be provided, as needed from ramp
radius consideration.
3.3.8
Acceleration/deceleration lanes
Each entry and exit ramp shall have acceleration/deceleration lane for the Project Expressway.
The length of the acceleration/deceleration lanes shall be decided on the basis of speed
differentials of the Project Expressway traffic and the speed permitted on the ramps.
Drivers exiting an interchange are required to reduce speed to meet with toll payment where
such a scheme exists.
Drivers entering an expressway from a ramp accelerate
until the
adjacent through lane speed
is reached.
For
safety, expressway
exits should be
located on tangent sections, wherever possible
to provide maximum
sight distance and optimum
traffic manoeuverability operation. The
following recommendations should be considered from safety aspect.
Typical requirements
of Acceleration
length and
Deceleration
length and speed change
length adjustment factors are presented in Table 3.2 and Table 3.3. For flat grade exceeding
2 percent, adjustment factors given in MORTH Guidelines for Expressways shall apply.

SECTION -4
EMBANKMENT AND CUT SECTIONS
4.1
General
4.1.1
The design and construction of the road
in embanl<ment and
in cutting shall be
carried out in accordance with Section 300 of MORTH Specifications and the requirements,
and standards and specifications given in this Section. This Section also covers specifications
for subgrade and earthen shoulders.
4.1.2
The final centre line of the road and the road levels shall be fixed duly considering
all the relevant factors covering structural soundness, safety and functional requirements as
per relevant IRC Codes and provisions of this Manual.
4.1 .3
In plain terrain, the level of the expressway will generally be controlled by drainage
and earthwork considerations and can be constructed near ground level where no flooding
is reported/observed and the Water Table
is not high.
In rolling terrain where
fill material
is
available from cuttings, the embankment could be sufficiently raised to permit construction of
underpasses without lowering the level of cross roads. The principles given in para 4.2 below
shall be followed for fixing the height of the embankment.
4.2
Embankment
4.2.1
The height of the embankment shall be measured with respect to the finished road
levels. The following principles shall be kept in view while fixing the road level:
i)
No section of the road
is overtopped. The top of sub-grade shall be at least
0.5 m above the general ground level.
ii)
The bottom of sub-grade shall be at least 1.0 m above the high flood level/high
water table/pond level. The HFL should be decided by intelligent inspections,
local observations, enquiries and studying the past records. This shall be
relevant to situations where road alignment is sited within the flood plains or
in the vicinity of water bodies or where ponding of water is encountered and
cannot be efficiently drained.
iii)
To
fulfil the minimum free board requirement and provide smooth
vertical
profile for portions forming approaches to structures.
4.2.2
Structural Features and Design of Embankment
4.2.2.1
To attain a natural appearance along the roadside, the side slopes should be as
flat as possible and rounded. The slopes should be designed from stability considerations and
to provide a reasonable opportunity for a driver to recover control of an errant vehicle.
If the
right of way or other constraints make
it impractical to provide recoverable slopes,
it would be
necessary to provide a safety barrier. Embankment slopes 1V:4H or flatter are recoverable
slopes. Fixed obstacles such as culvert headwalls shall not extend above the
fill slope within
the clear zone distance. Embankment slopes between 1V:3H and
1 V:4H are traversable but
non-recoverable and a clear run-out area at the base is desirable as shown
in Fig. 2.3.
31



======================================================================
PAGE 42 of 160
======================================================================
IRC:SP:99-2013
4.2.2.2
Embankment with height 6.0 m or above shall be designed
in accordance with
IRC:75 taking
into account slope
stability, bearing capacity, consolidation, settlement and
safety considerations based on geotechnical and investigation data. Where the embankment
is to be supported on a weak stratum, appropriate remedial/ground improvement measures
shall be taken.
4.2.2.3
The side slopes shall be protected against erosion by providing a suitable vegetative
cover, kerb and channel, chute, stone/cement concrete block pitching or any other suitable
protection measures depending on the height of the embankment and susceptibility of soil to
erosion. Drainage arrangement shall be provided as per Section-6 of this Manual.
4.2.3
Use of pond ash for embankment construction
Where pond ash is used for embankment construction in pursuance of the instructions of the
Ministry of Environment and Forests or otherwise, the embankment shall be designed and
constructed in accordance with IRC:SP:58.
4.3
Roadway in Cutting
The road level shall be fixed, keeping in view the provisions of relevant IRC Codes, and the
side slopes of the cut section shall be governed by the type of soil met with. Generally, the
side slopes shall be as given
in Table 4.1. The slopes should be evaluated with regard to
soil stability and potential crash severity. Desirably, the toe of the rock-cut slope should be
located beyond the minimum lateral distance from the edge of the carriageway needed by
the driver of an errant vehicle to either regain control or to slow down the vehicle.

SECTION - 7
TUNNELS
7.1
General
7.1.1
Expressway shall be constructed
in tunnel either to carry the alignment under or
through a natural obstacle or to minimize the impact on the community under conditions such
as:
i)
Long,
narrow mountainous
terrain where a
cut
section
is
economically
unviable or leads to adverse environmental consequences.
ii)
Narrow right-of-way where
all the surface area must be retained for road
purpose.
iii)
Railway yard, airport or similar facilities.
iv)
Parks or other land uses, existing or planned.
v)
Prohibitive costs of land acquisition exceeding the costs of tunnel construction
and operation.
7.1.2
Planning and design of tunnel
shall be based on various conditions along the
expressway
alignment
including
the
topography,
geology,
meteorology,
environment,
locations and traffic volumes and shall generally conform to provisions of IRC:SP:91 and this
Manual.
7.1.3
Wherever tunnel
is required to be provided,
its location, length and number of
lanes shall be indicated in Schedule-B of the Concession Agreement.
7.2
Geometries
7.2.1
A
tunnel
shall
have
the same
geometric
standards
as
on
the expressway
carriageway outside the tunnel except as specified in this Section.
7.2.2
Cross section
Shape of tunnel cross section shall be commensurate with the methodology of construction,
e.g., mining or cut-and-cover method, geotechnical conditions and structural consideration.
7.2.3
Horizontal clearance
The tunnel
shall
cater for carriageway, paved
shoulder, edge
strip as on the
adjoining
carriageways outside the tunnel, and space to be provided
for ventilation ducts, escape
footway, emergency lay-bye where necessary, lighting, drainage, fire and other services.
7.2.4
Vertical clearance
The tunnel shall have a minimum vertical clearance of 5.5 m over the full width of carriageway
and paved shoulders.
Vertical clearance over footway shall be 3.0 m minimum. Additional
vertical clearance shall be provided for accommodating tunnel ventilation and lighting fixtures.

PAGE 66 of 160
======================================================================
IRC:SP:99-2013
7.2.5
Number of traffic lanes
For Project Expressways up to 8-lanes, twin tubes of 3-iane configuration shall be provided.
7.2.6
Paved shoulder
Tunnels shall have paved shoulder of 3.0 m on
left side and edge strip of 0.75 m on the
right side.
In case of tunnels having more than 500 m length, provision shall be made for
10 m long and 1.5 m wide emergency lay bye beyond the left most lane at 750 m intervals to
facilitate refuge for break down/damaged vehicles and also for maintenance vehicles. Proper
transitions, line of sight and informatory signs shall be ensured for such lay-bye.
Typical tunnel cross sections for unidirectional traffic conditions for three-lane carriageway
configurations are given
in Fig. 7.1
for cut and cover type construction and
in Fig. 7.2 for
mining type construction. A typical layout of lay-bye is shown in Fig. 7.3 for tunnels of length
more than 500 m.
7.2.7
Tunnel spacing
The clear distance between the twin tubes shall be kept depending upon the type of strata
and structural stability of the tunnel. Guidance in this regard may be taken from IRC: SP: 91
or any specialist literature.
7.2.8
Tunnel passage
The twin tunnels of more than 500 m length shall be connected by a cross passage at an
inclination to facilitate diversion of the traffic from one tube to other tube in the event of an
incident/accident in one of the tubes at a spacing of 300 m. The cross passage shall be at
an angle of 30 degrees with the direction of flow as shown
in Fig. 7.4. The cross passage
shall have provision for one traffic lane, edge strip of 0.75 m, crash barriers and walkways on
either side.
In normal conditions, the cross passage shall be barricaded.
7.2.9
Vertical alignment
The
vertical gradient
shall
not be more than 3 percent for tunnels of length more than
500 m.
In short tunnels, the gradient may be limited to 6 percent. However,
in such cases
the ventilation system should be designed to take effect of gradient and possible incidence
of fire.
7.2.10
Horizontal alignment
The
horizontal
alignment
shall be
straight as
far as
practicable.
However,
the
straight
stretch shall not be more than 1500 m to avoid the effect of monotony and induction of an
unconscious increase in speed. Similarly, the last few metres of the tunnel shall have gentle
curve. The curves,
if provided, shall be gentle and meet the minimum radius requirements
for design speed of the tunnel. Tunnel alignment at the ends and open/approach cuts shall
merge smoothly with adjoining road
in the open
air.
In case of twin tunnel, the crossing of
56



======================================================================
PAGE 67 of 160
======================================================================
IRC:SP:99-2013
central median shall be provided at suitable locations at approaches of both tunnel tubes so
as to allow emergency services gain immediate access to either tube and also to send back
diverted traffic to proper traffic lanes.
7.2.11
Tunnel approach
Tunnel approach shall have smoothly aligned tunnel walls without any sudden narrowing to
avoid a shift from the tunnel wall and a good day/night visibility of the edge lines. Tunnel wall
lining shall be of white colour with high luminous reflectance.
7.2.12
Tunnel portals
Tunnel portals should, apart from providing protection at entry and exit, convey drivers about
the presence of the tunnel, reduce the luminance effacing walls and be in harmony with the
surrounding environment from aesthetics considerations.
7.3
Geotechnical Investigations
In order to make a realistic geotechnical and geophysical assessment of the ground through
which the tunnel
is to pass and detailed mapping
of surface geology of the tunnel area
necessary for the planning and design of alignment and portal locations, shape of tunnel,
tunnel supporting systems, minimum distance to be kept between two tunnels, independent
geotechnical investigations should be carried in accordance with the provisions of Section-3
of IRC:SP:91.
7.4
Structural Design
7.4.1
Assessment of applicable loads shall be based on structural properties of the ground
likely to be met during tunneling as arrived from detailed geo-technical investigations.
7.4.2
The
design
shall
cater
to
the most adverse
combination
of
load
conditions
including only those loads which have reasonable probability of simultaneous occurring with
due consideration for the methodology of construction particularly in case of soft strata and
soils. The design shall be checked for loading conditions during the stages of construction,
operation and maintenance.
7.4.3
Tunnels in rock
Provisions of Section-4 of IRC:SP:91
shall be followed for the structural design of tunnels
passing through rock.
7.4.4
Tunnels through soft strata and soils
Structural design of tunnel system passing through soft strata and soils may be carried out
by suitable
national
or
international standards,
specialist
literature and
best engineering
practices.

7.5
Design of Drainage System
Efficient and effective drainage system
sliall be provided
in
tlie tunnel for tlie removal of
water from
rainfall, seepage, tunnel washing operations, vehicle drippings/spillage on
fire
fighting operations.
7.5.1
In order to trap rainwater from
hill slopes and prevent
it from flowing
into the
approach cuts and the tunnel, suitable catch water drains shall be provided above the top of
sides of the open/approach cuts and above excavated portals.
7.5.2
In the open/approach cuts discontinuous kerbs shall be provided to demarcate
the edge of the carriageway. Beyond the kerbs, side drains with adequate waterway shall be
provided in the open/approach cuts.
7.5.3
Inside the tunnel, suitable side drains shall be provided behind the kerbs/crash
barriers. Suitable drain pipes going through the kerbs/crash barriers shall be provided to lead
seepage and wash water to the drains. The drains shall be located below the walkways meant
for the pedestrians and maintenance personnel. The carriageway shall have suitable camber
to facilitate drainage into the side drains. In case of bi-directional tunnel, the camber shall be
from the centre outwards and in case of uni-directional tunnel from high speed lane towards
low speed lane. The vertical profile shall facilitate self draining of tunnel.
In case this
is not
feasible, detailed draining system shall be designed by providing sumps and combination of
self draining and pumping arrangements.
7.5.4
The
black-topped
road
surface
inside
tunnel,
generally constructed on
rocky
subgrade, gets damaged due to seepage water and creates severe problem for surface
drainage. Hence the pavement inside the tunnel and
in approach cuts
shall be of high
performance pavement concrete.
7.6
Waterproofing
Waterproofing
in the form of tunnel lining such as cast in situ concrete shall be provided for
structural protection from surrounding weathering effects as well as operational considerations.
To prevent water leaks inside the tunnel, water proof sheet at least 0.8 mm thick with synthetic
textile buffer between shotcrete and lining shall be provided.
7.7
Ventilation
7.7.1
Natural ventilation may be sufficient for tunnels of length up to 500 m. However
for tunnels of length more than 250 m natural ventilation system should be used only after
thorough evaluation of reliance on natural ventilation especially with reference to effects of
meteorological and operating conditions.
7.7.2
Mechanical system of ventilation shall be provided
in case of tunnels of length
more than 500 m.
7.7.3
Detailed design of ventilation shall be carried out as per Section-7 of IRC:SP:91
keeping
in view the length, shape, size, tunnel environs and complexion of the likely traffic
for which tunnel has been designed.

'
9.8
Drainage for Structures
9.8.1
Culverts and bridges
9.8. 1. 1
For culverts and bridges, provision of suitable cross slope/camber and down take
pipes/spouts near the kerb, covered with gratings at the
inlet points shall be provided
at
regular interval to facilitate rapid draining of water from the deck without any ponding. The
length and location of these drainage spouts should be such that the water is not discharged
on any bridge element.
9.8.1.2
The bridges
particularly those
in
high
rainfall area
shall
preferably be
built
in
longitudinal gradient with suitably designed cross drains at abutment locations to facilitate
proper drainage.
9.8.2
Grade separators/flyovers/road over bridges
9.8.2.1
Effective drainage
shall be provided
both
longitudinally and
transversely. The
transverse drainage shall be secured by means of suitable camber in the roadway surface.
Longitudinal drainage shall be secured by means of scuppers, inlets, or other suitable means
of sufficient size and numbers to drain the run-off efficiently.
9.8.2.2
Efficient drainage of the deck structure shall be ensured by providing a suitably
designed drainage arrangement consisting of drainage spouts connected to horizontal and
vertical pipe system such that the water from the structure does not fall on the road, does
not stagnate over the road or at entry and exit points of grade separated structure and
is
discharged into the draining system of the area. Care must be taken that the pipes are taken
down in such a way that they are aesthetically pleasing.
9.8.2.3
Typically, water spouts are provided at the kerbs at the rate of one number per
12 sqm of the surface
in level portions and one number per 15 sqm of the surface area on
gradients. Water spouts are connected to runner pipe of suitable diameter (minimum 100
mm) on either side of roadway and taken down by downtake pipes at pier and abutment
locations.

======================================================================
PAGE 81 of 160
======================================================================
IRC:SP:99-2013
9.8.2.4
Drainage fixtures and downspouts shall be of rigid, corrosion resistant material
not less than 100 mm as the least dimension and shall be provided with suitable cleanout
fixtures.
9.8.2.5
The arrangement of floor drains shall be such as to prevent the splashing discharge
of drainage water against any portion of the structure. Overhanging portions of concrete
floors shall be provided with drip moulds.
9.8.2.6
Catch water drains are necessary at the ends of viaduct portion so that water coming
from grade separated structure does not over saturate and affect the earthen embankment.
Similar catch water drains should be provided at the end of gradient so that water coming
from the structure is properly let out to the nearest drain.
9.8.2. 7
An integrated drainage plan for the water coming from the deck of structures, local
catchment area of the project and all other sources should be prepared so that no water falls
on any surface of the structures, or remain standing or flowing over the level roads. All the
water
is collected through sumps and finally discharged
into the local drainage system
i.e.
storm water drain/pipes etc. either by gravity through connecting drains or by pumping into
the existing outgoing drains.
9.8.2.8
The rainwater from the deck of the structures usually does not flow transversely
but flows on the high gradient slopes of the road or approaches and is collected in the valley
curve portion. As such attention
is to be paid to get this large quantity of water drained out
fast without accumulating there causing problems for traffic flow resulting
in traffic jams. The
draining out systems should be designed with greater margins so as to avoid this problem, at
least for grade separators, inside the cities or inhabited areas.
9.8.3
Underpasses and subways
Where rain water cannot flow into the drainage system by gravity due to the requirement
of depressed road to get minimum head room, necessary provision for drainage by vertical
drains and/or pumping shall be made so that there
is no disruption of traffic through such
location on account of water logging/flooding of underpass or subway.
9.9
Existing Drains, Canals and Winor Waterways
9.9.1
For the existing drains, canals and waterways, to be over passed by the expressway,
draining provisions shall be maintained and the effects of prolonged heavy rainfall must be
catered for.
9.9.2
Special
attention
shall
be
paid
to
the
drainage
channels
carrying
industrial
waste and effluent in particular to those draining chloride contaminated effluents which are
detrimental to the RCC structures.
9.9.3
Adequate
care
shall
be
taken
while
crossing
irrigation
canals
to
prevent
contamination of the flow in the canal by spillage from the expressway.
71

PAGE 82 of 160
======================================================================
IRC:SP:99-2013
9.10
When expressway runs
parallel to existing channels, adequate measures
shall
be taken
in the form of bank protection and channel alignment to avoid water build up or
stagnation against the expressway slope endangering the pavement drainage. The drainage
channels at the toe of the expressway may have to be adequately protected or reshaped for
discharge
into these channels. Where the discharge from road drainage
is not permitted,
separate cross drainage structures are to be provided on both sides of such channels.
9.11
Erosion Control Measures
Erosion
control measures
in accordance
with
the
provisions
of the MORTH
Guidelines
for Expressways shall be provided. Guidance may be taken from IRC:56 for treatment of
embankment slopes for erosion control.

In the case where
an interchange is located near the start or end of expressway, the roads leading to express-
way are treated with expressway type advance exit signs. The advance exit signs are placed
on the non-expressway section of the route as shown
in Fig. 10.8.
10.2.18
Post-Interchange signs
If space between interchanges permits, as
in
rural areas, and where undue repetition of
messages
will not occur, a fixed sequence of signs should be displayed beginning 150 m
beyond the end of the acceleration
lane. At this
point, a Route sign assembly should be
installed followed by a Distance sign as indicated
in
Fig.
10.9,
at a spacing of 300 m.
If
space between interchanges does not permit placement of these three post-interchange
signs without encroaching on or overlapping the Advance Guide signs necessary for the next
interchange, or in rural areas where the interchanging traffic is primarily local, one or more of
the post interchange signs should be omitted.
10.2.19
Distance sign
The post-interchange Distance sign
shall consist of a two-or three-line sign carrying the
names of significant destination points and the distances to those points. The top line of the

toll
collection" shall be adopted. Closed System of tolling means that
payment need to be made only at the exit by either charging the same to the On-Board Unit
on the wind-screen of the vehicle passing through the ETC lane or depositing the ticket
collected at the entry.
A closed toll system has an entrance and exit booth for the toll system and captures all users
and revenue of the system. Toll plazas are located at every interchange preventing diversion
around main lane toll plazas. Upon entering the toll system, the On-Board Unit on the vehicle
of the user is read. In case of manual/smart card collection system, the user receives a ticket.
When exiting, the user gives the ticket to the
toll collector and
is charged a set fee as per
policy decision and notification. In case of ETC system, the tag on that vehicle of the user is
charged accordingly.
12.6

SECTION -13
PROJECT FACILITIES: SERVICE AREAS,
PICK-UP BUS STOPS, STATE BORDER CHECK POSTS
13.1
Service Areas
13.1.1
Introduction
Service areas shall be planned and provided as wayside amenities for users of the expressways
to enable them to stop, take rest and refresh themselves so as to ease their fatigue. These
areas also cover facilities for providing fuel for vehicles and emergency requirements without
having to exit from the expressway. Thus, provision of service areas and their operation and
maintenance are to be an integral part of the Project Expressway for comfortable and safe
driving.
13.1.2
Site spacing
i)
The service areas may be planned at approximately 50 km intervals (This
may correspond to roughly 45 minutes of driving). Location of service areas
shall be as given in Schedule-C of the Concession Agreement.
ii)
In addition to the regular service areas, only toilet facilities are also required
to be provided. Their locations may be approximately
half way (midway)
between the service areas. These toilet facilities may be on short laybyes
off the expressway shoulders but with proper deceleration and acceleration
lanes. Further, such laybyes may not be located on sharp curves or inside of
curves. Location of laybyes for toilet facilities shall be as given in Scheduie-C
of the Concession Agreement.
13.1.3
Service facilities
The principal users of the expressway are passenger car users, bus users, goods vehicles
drivers and other attendants. The service area shall provide the following facilities for the
expressway users.
a)
For Vehicles
i)
Parking
lot: Separate lot for cars, buses and trucks
ii)
Fuel station: Provision for petrol, diesel, CNG,
oil,

iv)
Service roads
v)
Sewage disposal
vi)
Staff room for O&M personnel
vii)
Parking for O&M personnel
13.1.4
Site location
I)
The location may be decided keeping in view factors such as scenic attributes,
availability
of
utilities
(potable
water,
waste
water
disposal,
telephone,
electrical
service),
potential environment
impact,
availability
of adequate
right of way (ROW).
II)
The site should not be less than two km from an interchange unless the site
itself is planned and provided as an interchange-cum-service area.
13.1.5
Size
i)
The size of the service area would depend mainly upon the number of
parking spaces needed for cars, buses and trucks. This would be a function
of Average Daily Traffic and likely percentage of traffic wishing to stop by the
service area. Annex 13.1
gives broad guidance for assessing number of
parking spaces. The size of other facilities like toilets, cafeteria, restaurants
for passengers and drivers, lawns, walkway, road access and service facilities
would be linked to the number of users on the one hand and availability of
land and topography of the area on the other.
ii)
The size of the service area would be sum total of areas required to provide
the magnitude and level of facilities and amenities indicated
in para 13.1.3
120



======================================================================
PAGE 131 of 160
======================================================================
IRC:SP:99-2013
above. A minimum area of five hectares shall be provided. The service area
upto fifteen hectares is considered generally manageable and this will provide
enough space for landscaping and allow for future expansion requirements
with growth of traffic on the expressway.
iii)
The services of a competent and experienced landscape architect and a
transportation professional are essential for assessing the requirements of
each of the facility component indicated in para 13.1.3 above and working out
suitable layout. Factors such as separation of facilities for passengers and
truckers, walking distance from parking
lot to toilets, restaurants,
etc. and
relevant byelaws of local bodies including fire safety, environment, aesthetic
and landscaping aspects shall be considered while designing and preparing
the layout and design. Typical layouts are indicated in Fig. 13.1 A to 13.1F.
iv)
Provision of toilets
is another key facility which the users look for in service
areas. Special care
is required for provision of ventilation and
light
in toilet
areas. Separate toilets need to be provided for the persons with disabilities.
The number of toilet
facilities
will depend upon the number of users. No
standard guidelines are available
in this regard. Tables 13.1 and 13.2 give
the
minimum
requirements
for
these
facilities
linked
to
the ADT
and
composition of trucks in the total traffic.

13.1.6
Design considerations
For design considerations
of various
facilities,
reference may also be made
to MORTH
Guidelines for Expressways.
13.1.7
Operation and maintenance
i)
An operation and maintenance plan shall be developed for the service area
to ensure that various maintenance activities are appropriately considered as
part of ongoing service area operations. During construction, the equipments
installed, wiring diagrams, water lines, sewerage, pumps, septic tank, water
coolers, lighting fixtures, etc.
all shall be documented as to locations, types,
models, etc. All these details should be included
in the O&M Manual for the
Expressway.
ii)
A list of emergency contacts with telephone numbers and addresses shall be
kept and displayed at the service area.
13.2
Pick-Up Bus Stops
13.2.1
Introduction
The operators of bus services plying on the expressway would require facility of bus stops
at important towns and village settlements en-route served by the expressway for enabling
the passengers to either get down or to pick-up the passengers wanting to get in. Since the
expressway is not open to pedestrians, the bus stops have to be located outside the Right of
Way of the expressway to ensure safe and unimpeded travel.
13.2.2
Location
The pick-up bus stops shall be located at the inter-change points and planned
in a manner
that passengers are kept away from the expressway facility. The pick-up bus stops shall not
be located
in the Service Area except where the service area
itself
is planned at an
inter-
change
point. The location of pick-up bus stops shall be as given
in Schedule-C of the
Concession Agreement.
13.2.3
Design piiiiosoptiy
Basically, the design and layout of the pick-up bus stops may be integrated with local bus
services and
intermediate
public transport (auto rickshaws,
taxis,
etc.). Adequate
transit
facility shall be planned and provided accordingly. Being a closed system of tolls to be adopted
on expressways, there shall be specially designed access road for buses exiting from the
expressway to the bus-stop and thereafter entering the expressway such that the bus does
122

PAGE 133 of 160
======================================================================
IRC:SP:99-2013
not leave the access road except for letting the passengers get down from the bus or get into
the bus from the pick-up bus stops. Fig. 13.2 presents a typical functional arrangement of
pick-up bus stops at the Expressway combined with local bus stop facility.
13.3
State Border Check Posts
13.3.1
Introduction
The state border check posts shall be planned and provided to enable the State Authorities
to exercise checks as per Applicable Laws on the vehicles crossing the state border. Such
checks may be related to sales tax, VAT, entry tax, tourist permit tax, forest related taxes,
etc.
13.3.2
Location
The check posts shall be provided on laybyes
off the Expressway shoulders with proper
deceleration and acceleration lanes. Further, such laybyes will be located immediately after
crossing the state border. The location of check posts shall be as given
in Schedule-C of
the Concession Agreement.
13.3.3
Design consideration
The design of the check post will be undertaken
in consultation with the State Authorities.
Normally, a built-up area of 300 sqm would suffice including the toilet facilities. An open area
of around 300 sqm adjoining the building block shall be reserved for parking of vehicles.
Typical layout is given in Fig. 13.3.

Annex 13.1
Broad Guidance for Assessment of Parking Spaces in Service Areas
1)
The parking lots shall be provided separately for cars, buses and trucks
in
the same service area complex.
2)
The number of parking spaces depend upon:
the total average daily traffic,
•
usage ratio,
i.e. the ratio of vehicles likely to use the service area facility,
design hour factor,
i.e. the peak hour volume in relation to the average
flow
stay in hours
3)
AASHTO, UK Department of Transport and JICA have formulated their own
guidelines for assessment of parking
lots
in Rest Areas. Based on these
practices, a simplified approach
is given hereunder.
4)
Find out the ADT of cars, buses and trucks only for the direction in which the
Service Area lies for which the assessment is to be done.
Then the number of parking spaces will be given by the equation.
N=ADTxURxDHFxL
Where N = number of parking spaces
ADT = Average Daily Traffic in the direction of service area
UR = Usage Ratio
DHF = Design Hour Factor
L = Stay in Hours
5)
The suggestive values of UR, DHF and L for cars, buses and trucks are
given in Table 1 below:

SECTION -14
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ASPECTS,
LANDSCAPING AND TREE PLANTATION
14.1
Context
Expressway projects are likely to be associated with some adverse environment impacts during
construction, maintenance and operation
stages.
Significant impacts during construction
relate to clearing, grading or road bed construction; loss of vegetative cover; foreclosure of
land uses; property severance at community/individual levels; changes
in natural drainage
patterns; changes
in ground water
table,
landslides,
erosion,
streams, ponds and
lake
sedimentation, degradation of cultural
sites,
interference with movements of wild
life,
live
stock and local residents. Many of these impacts can arise not only at construction sites but
also at quarries, borrow pits and material storage areas serving the Project Expressway.
In
addition, impacts can occur due to air and ground pollution from construction plants; dust
from construction vehicle movements, noise from construction equipment and blasting, use
of pesticides, fuel and oil spills, trash and garbage etc.
14.2
Environmental Management Plan
Many
of
the
direct adverse
impacts
can
be
avoided/mitigated
at
the
design
stage.
Accordingly while
the Authority
will seek the Environmental clearance
for the
Project
Expressway
from
the
relevant
Ministries,
Departments;
the
Concessionaire
shall
be
responsible for implementation of Environmental Management Plan and action plan for
undertaking possible mitigation measures in accordance with extant guidelines for highway
projects of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) and Wildlife Department of the
Government of India.
The Authority shall make available to the Concessionaire, the list of conditions and directions
stipulated by the MOEF at the time of giving their clearance for the Project Expressway and
it
shall be the responsibility of the Concessionaire to incorporate the same in its Environmental
Management Plan referred to above.
14.3
Landscaping and Tree Plantation
14.3.1
General
The Concessionaire shall planttrees and shrubs of required numberand type atthe appropriate
locations within the Right of Way and in the land earmarked by the Authority for afforestation
keeping
in view the IRC Guidelines on Landscaping and Tree
Plantation. The Authority
will specify the number of trees which are required to be planted by the Concessionaire
as compensatory afforestation or otherwise
in Schedule-C of the Concession Agreement.
The Concessionaire shall also maintain the trees and shrubs
in good condition during the
Concession Period as per the maintenance schedule. Plantation shall be at the edge of the
Right of Way.

IRC:SP:99-2013
14.3.2
Design considerations in various locations
a)
Set-back distance of trees and other plantation
Trees on the roadside shall be sufficiently away from the roadway so that
they are not a hazard to road traffic or restrict the visibility. Most vulnerable
locations
in this regard are the inside of curves, medians, entry/exit ramps
and cut slopes. Trees shall be placed at a minimum distance of 14 m from
the centre line of the left side paved shoulder to provide recovery area for the
vehicle that runs off the road.
b)
Plantation in medians
In the sections of the Project Expressway where median width
is more than
3 m, shrubs shall be planted and maintained to cut off headlight glare from
traffic
in the opposite direction. Flowering plants and shrubs are eminently
suited for the purpose. These shall be planted either in continuous rows or in
the form of baffles. The height of shrubs shall be maintained at
1 .5 m to cut
off the effect of traffic lights coming from the opposite direction.
The shape of shrubs and
plants
shall be suitably regulated so that there
is no
overgrowth either vertically or horizontally beyond the edge of the paved median.
c)
Spacing of avenue trees
The spacing of avenue trees will depend on the type and growth characteristics
of trees, requirement of maintenance, penetration of distant views,
etc. A
range of 10-15 m would meet the requirement for most varieties.
d)
Choice of trees
The following guidelines shall be kept in view while selecting the species of
trees to be planted:
1)
Trees shall be selected with due regard to
soil,
rainfall, temperature
and water level.
ii)
Trees which become very wide shall be avoided as their maintenance
would cause interference with traffic flow.
iii)
The species must be capable of developing a straight and clean bole
up to a height of 2.5 to 3.5 m from the ground level.
iv)
The selected trees
shall,
preferably, be
fast growing and wind-firm.
These shall not be thorny or drop too many leaves.
v)
The trees shall be deep rooted, as shallow roots injure pavements.
vi)
In urban areas, the species selected shall be of less spreading type, so
that these do not interfere with overhead services, clear views of signs/
signals, and efficiency of roadway lighting.

14.4
Landscape Treatment
A suitable landscape treatment with provision of foundations and coloured lighting so as to
enhance the overall aesthetics duly designed by a qualified and experienced landscaping
architect, shall be provided at grade separators, elevated sections, viaducts, traffic islands,
toll plazas, bus bays, truck lay byes,
rest areas, O&M centre,
etc. The locations where
landscape treatment
is to be given shall be specified
in Schedule-C of the Concession
Agreement. The landscape treatment shall also be provided for special areas as given
in
IRC:SP:21 (para 8).
14.5
Report to be submitted
The Concessionaire shall submit scheme for Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and
for plantation and maintenance of plants and trees to the Independent Engineer for review
and comments,
if any.

ii)
The layout of the lighting system together with type of luminaries for different
locations shall be prepared by the Concessionaire in such a manner that the
minimum illumination level prescribed
in para
15.2(i)
is achieved and shall
be submitted to the Independent Engineer for review and comments,
if any,
for compliance by the Concessionaire.
iii)

138



======================================================================
PAGE 149 of 160
======================================================================
IRC:SP:99-2013
v)
All the fixtures, wires/cables, lights shall conform to relevant BIS specifications
as a minimum. The Concessionaire with the prior review and comments of
the Independent Engineer can use fixtures with better specifications.
15.3
Lighting Standards
The overall quality of an installation for lighting has several components:
i)
Average luminance
level: This
is
all-important, as
it not only impinges on
the safety benefits but also largely determines the power requirements and
hence the running costs.
In simpler design processes, and for checking the
performance of an installation, this translates into average illuminance level.
ii)
Overall uniformity of luminance, or illuminance, both across and along the
roadway. Defined as the minimum divided by the average, and designated at UO.
iii)
Uniformity of luminance, or illuminance, along the axis of the road, usually an
axis which coincides with a typical driver's eye position. Defined as the ratio
of the minimum to the maximum, and designated U1.
iv)
Glare: As
glare has the
effect
of reducing
contrast,
a
luminary's
"glare
performance", or optical control, can be expressed
in terms of the increase
in background luminance necessary to compensate (threshold increment,
T1). The lower this figure the better. These percentages are determined by
the amount of light the luminaries project near the horizontal. This light also
causes problems of sky-glow.
v)
Guidance: Whilst glare must be kept under control, a small amount of direct
light from the luminaries gives a useful sense of the "run" of the road ahead,
and can forewarn the approach of junctions or roundabouts.
15.4
Locations where Lighting is to be provided
Unless specified otherwise in Schedule-C of the Concession Agreement and elsewhere in
this Manual, the Concessionaire shall provide lighting at the following locations of the Project
Expressway.
15.4.1
Continuous expressway lighting
i)
Continuous expressway
lighting
is considered
to be warranted on those
sections where three
or more successive interchanges and cross roads
are located with an average spacing of 2.5 km or less, and adjacent areas
outside the right-of-way are urban in character.
ii)
Continuous expressway lighting shall be provided where for a length of 3 km
or more, the expressway passes near an urban area in which one or more of
the following conditions exist:
a)
Local
traffic operates on a complete street grid having some form of
street lighting, parts of which are visible from the expressway.
139



======================================================================
PAGE 150 of 160
======================================================================
IRC:SP:99-2013
b)
The expressway
passes
near
a
series
of developments
such
as
residential, commercial,
industrial and
civic areas, schools, colleges,
parks, terminals, etc., which includes roads, streets and parking areas,
yards, etc. that are lighted.
iii)
In rural areas each location must be individually evaluated as to its need for
illumination.
1 5.4.2
Interchange lighting
Complete interchange lighting shall be provided on all the interchanges.
15.4.3
Bridge structures and underpasses lighting
Lighting shall be provided inside the underpasses. The lighting of bridges and overpasses
should be of the same level and uniformity as the roadway.
15.4.4
Special situations
Tunnels
Tunnels require the use of lighting or equivalent means to provide adequate roadway and
tunnel user visibility necessary for safe and efficient traffic operations. The tunnel lighting shall
be designed as per MORTH Guidelines for Expressways, Chapter 13.5 Tunnel Lighting.
Toll Plaza Areas
The lighting
in and around Toll Plaza,
toll booths, office building, on the approach road, etc.
shall be as per Section-12.Toll Plazas of this Manual.
Wayside Amenities
All Wayside Amenities offering facilities should be lighted, including the entrance and exit, the
interior roadways, parking areas, and activity areas. Wayside Amenities include Rest Areas,
Truck/Bus laybys, and Pick-up bus Stops. The lighting of Wayside Amenities shall be as per
Section-13. Project Facilities of this Manual.
Other Specialized Areas
'
Lighting of other specialized areas should be considered with respect to the needs of the
users as well as the requirements of others interacting with the users. These other specialized
areas include truck weighing stations, inspections and enforcement areas, park-and-ride lots,
toll plazas, and escape ramps.
15.5
Report to be Submitted
The Concessionaire shall submit report containing the proposal for provision of Lighting on
the Project Expressway to the Independent Engineer for review and comments,
if any.
