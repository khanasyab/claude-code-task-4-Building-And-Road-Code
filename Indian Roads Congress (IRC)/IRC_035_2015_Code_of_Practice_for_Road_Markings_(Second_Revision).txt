Code  of  Practice  for  Road  Markings
INTRODUCTION
The Code of Practice for Road Markings; IRC:35 was first published by Indian Roads Congress 
in 1970 and thereafter was first revised in 1997. Since then, there has been development in 
current day traffic needs, technology, workmanship etc. Therefore, a need was felt to bring 
out revised version of the Code to include new concepts and materials for laying of road 
markings with latest technology so as to guide and control traffic on roads. Accordingly, the 
work of revision of this Code was taken up by the Transport Planning, Traffic Engineering 
and Road Safety Committee (H-1) during the tenure 2009-2011 under Convenorship of 
Shri S.C. Sharma. The first draft of revised document was prepared by the Sub-group comprising 
Dr. Geetam Tiwari (Chairman of Sub Group), Dr. Surinder Mohan,  Shri Pawan Kumar Singh, and 
Shri Amandeep Singh. This draft was discussed in various meetings of H-1 Committee during 
the tenure 2009-2011.
The H-1 Committee was reconstituted in 2012 and was renamed as Transport Planning and 
Traffic Engineering Committee. The reconstituted H-1 formed a new sub-group comprising 
Dr. Geetam Tiwari (Chairman of Sub-Group), Dr. S. Velmurugan, Shri Jacob George, 
Shri Sudhir Kumar, Shri Pawan Kumar Singh and Shri Amandeep Singh. The draft prepared 
by the Sub-group was discussed in various meetings of H-1 Committee and the document 
was subsequently approved by the H-1 Committee in its meeting held on 26.07.2014 for 
placing before the HSS Committee.
The composition of the H-1 Committee is as given below:

Section : 1
1.1	
General
1.1.1	
Road Markings perform an important function of guiding and controlling traffic on a 
highway. The markings serve as a psychological barrier and thus help to signify the delineation 
of traffic path and its lateral clearance from traffic hazards facilitating safe movement. Further, 
the road markings channelize the pedestrians and cyclists movement into safe location and 
in effect, provide for an extension of the side walk/cycle track across the roadway. Road 
markings are therefore, indispensable to ensure smooth and orderly flow of traffic and for 
promoting road safety.
1.1.2	
Notwithstanding some limitations, such as poor visibility when dusty or wet or 
obliteration by snow the frequent renewals of road markings have the advantage of conveying 
the required information to the road user without distracting the attention of the driver from

3
the carriageway. Unlike road signs, the road markings are not likely to be obscured and are 
not pruned to vandalism. 
1.1.3	
While some markings are provided in conjunction with road signs, most markings 
are provided independently. Road markings normally include longitudinal markings, transverse 
markings, text and symbols etc. on the road surfaces.
1.1.4	
The road markings provided in existing roads should be subjected to safety audit 
to ensure their uniformity.
1.2	
Scope
1.2.1	
The objective of this code is to establish uniform system for road markings in India 
to provide guidance, procedures and recommendation on the type of road markings with 
details on dimensions including selection, installation and inspection procedure for different 
road marking materials.
1.2.2	
The recommendation furnished in this Code is applicable to all categories of roads 
located in rural and urban areas.
1.3 
Definition
Road markings are defined as lines, patterns, words except road signs which are applied or 
attached to the carriageway or kerbs or to objects within or adjacent to the carriageway for 
controlling, warning, guiding and informing the road users.
1.4	
Authority
1.4.1	
Markings where used, shall be uniform in design, position and application so that 
they may be recognised and understood immediately. A uniform set of markings applicable 
throughout the country may, therefore, be as prescribed by the Indian Roads Congress or 
updated by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways from time to time.
1.4.2	
The Authority to provide road markings on a particular stretch of public road should 
be decided by Road Authorities in consultation with police, wherever felt necessary.
1.4.3	
Pavement and kerb markings being exclusively within the boundaries of public road 
should never be installed except by public authority. Installation of delineators and painting 
of objects, as a warning of hazardous locations should be performed under the control and 
approval of the authorities.

●	
Hot Applied Thermoplastic Compound
	
●	
Solvent borne and Waterborne Road Marking Paints
2.1.2	
Other special material for road marking includes Cold Applied Plastics and 
Preformed Adhesive Tapes.
2.1.3	
The Clause 803 of “Specification for Road and Bridge Works” published by the 
Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MORTH) shall be referred for technical specifications 
of road marking materials.
2.2	
Thermoplastic Markings
2.2.1	
Thermoplastic is the most commonly used pavement marking material on roadways 
and is a mixture of plasticizer and resins that serves to hold all of the other ingredients 
together. The thermoplastics hot applied in molten state adheres to pavement and get 
solidified immediately at the ambient temperature.
2.2.2	
Thermoplastic markings possess fast drying time and are highly durable. It has 
better retro reflective performance and service life than that of ordinary road marking paint. 
The service life of one application of thermoplastic can be upto 2 to 3 years, depending on 
traffic volumes.
2.3	
Solventborne and Waterborne Road Marking Paints
2.3.1	
Road marking paints are oldest form of pavement marking materials. It can be 
used for longitudinal line application in temporary work zone markings and also for those 
marking which are required for a very shorter period and can be removed thereafter easily.
2.3.2	
The solvent-based and water-based are the two types of road marking paints. 
Water-based paint is environmentally friendly and is easier to handle compared to solvent-
based paints and pose less safety hazards to workers. The road surface painted with water-
based paints can be opened to traffic quicker than the road surface painted with solvent-
based paints.
2.4	
Cold Applied Plastics
2.4.1	
For coloured pavement marking, the cold applied plastic is a better choice than 
road marking paints and thermoplastic materials. Cold applied plastics are the best means to 
provide audible raised pavement marking for edge lines.
2.4.2	
Cold applied plastic is more durable than thermoplastic markings in retaining the 
original colour and luminance values. It can be applied to the surface in a variety of ways with

5
a superior finishing and has no need of large application equipment and can be easily carried 
in a medium sized van and a trailer.
2.5	
Preformed Adhesive Tapes
2.5.1	
Preformed tapes are available in continuous rolls of various lengths and widths, 
conforming to ASTM D4592-12 that is designed to provide service life of 3 to 6 months 
depending upon the wear and durability factor. Unlike road marking with sprayed or extruded 
materials, the preformed tapes do not require application equipment or experienced operators 
for applications and do not require drying or curing period.
2.5.2	
The provision of preformed tapes would entail high initial cost than the other forms 
of road marking application, but would offer more service life in locations with high traffic 
volumes and are suitable for those locations that require frequent replacement of pavement 
markings.
2.5.3	
Preformed tapes are also used for object markings and also for transverse lines in 
high-traffic areas.
2.6	
Colour Pattern for Markings
The general colour pattern followed for road marking and various background surfaces are 
given below:
2.6.1	
White
Because of the visibility and good contrast against the road surface, the white colour should 
be widely used for road markings.
2.6.2	
Yellow
The longitudinal marking in yellow colour should be used to convey message where it is not 
permitted to cross the markings. Yellow colour is also used to show parking restrictions and 
to impose other traffic control. Yellow colour is defined as per IS Colour No. 356.
2.6.3	
Blue
The blue colour should be used to indicate new and special markings which are not conventional. 
Blue is the colour of public transportation including three wheelers, scooter and rickshaws. 
The blue colour shall be used to indicate dedicated bus lanes in the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) 
corridor on urban streets. In the bus lanes being marked across the intersection, the blue 
marking should be used to inform the road users that the lane is specifically meant for buses 
and other vehicle should not drive or stop in this lane.
2.6.4	
Green
The green colour should be deployed to distinguish the bicycle and non-motorised transport 
facilities provided on the road. Green colour background should be marked at the intersection 
to give priority to the cyclists and pedestrians in crossing the road. When the motorized 
vehicles and non-motorized vehicles share the same carriageway, the green background

======================================================================
IRC:35-2015
6
lanes are preferred. When dedicated non-motorized lanes are built, a special green cycle 
boxes should also be used.
2.6.5	
Red/Purple
Where multiple road users are sharing the road space on hazardous locations, the red 
colour marking is primarily used to help people understand the danger. Red marking is highly 
recommended on hazardous intersections and also at places where pedestrians traffic conflict 
with the motorized traffic.
2.7	
Visibility Related to Speeds
2.7.1	
Road markings must be clearly visible both in day and night. Road markings 
become an important aid for drivers to follow the unlit roads at night where the visual cues on 
road sides are absent.
2.7.2	
As a general requirement, the drivers need to be able to detect guidance markings 
at a distance equivalent to a minimum of two seconds of travel time. Table 2.1 gives the 
minimum preview distance based on the criteria.

2.7.3	
Variety of factors influence the visibility distance of road marking. The visibility 
of the road marking gets enhanced when the line thickness is wider and with higher mark 
to gap ratio and also with higher coefficient of retro-reflective luminance. Therefore, larger 
pavement marking widths combined with higher coefficients of retro reflectivity are used to 
help drivers detect the lines according to design speed of roadway.
2.8 
Retro Reflectivity
2.8.1	
Retro reflection is accomplished in pavement-marking through the use of glass 
beads, partially embedded on the surface of the marking as binder material and also spread 
externally during application time as shown in Fig. 2.1. The quality of glass beads plays an 
important role in retro reflectivity of pavement-marking as the glass bead returns light from 
vehicle headlamp to a driver.

======================================================================

IRC:35-2015
7
2.8.2	
Visibility distance is adversely affected by glare from oncoming vehicles, dirty 
head lamps or windscreen, especially during raining. The size of a glass bead can affect retro 
reflectivity, especially under wet conditions. Larger glass beads have slightly higher retro 
reflectivity than standard beads under dry conditions. When markings are wet, glass beads 
often turned out to be useless because the film of water that covers the marking causes light 
to scatter before it can enter the bead. This causes the wet markings to be nearly invisible 
at night. Large bead (minimum 1 mm thickness) is more effective when roads are slightly 
wet because the higher profile protrudes through the film of water better than small glass 
beads.
2.8.3	
The requirements of night time brightness for road markings are given in 
Section 15 on Performance Assessment & Monitoring.
2.9 
External Factors Influencing Marking Performance
2.9.1	
Many factors influence the performance of a given pavement marking material. 
The major factors can be grouped into three categories such as i) roadway surface; ii) traffic 
and iii) environmental.
2.9.2	
The factors influencing the performance of different pavement marking material 
should be considered in the material selection process. Prior to marking, the pavement 
surface shall be clean and dry to achieve proper pavement marking performance.
2.9.3	
All types of materials are very sensitive to the variables governing the application 
and hence warrant strict quality control during application. The key variables that influence 
the durability and retro reflectivity performance of pavement markings are:
	
i)	
material composition;
	
ii)	
application procedure;
	
iii)	
application machines;
	
iv)	
roadway surface and
	
v)	
presence of immediate traffic.

SECTION : 3 
CLASSIFICATION OF PAVEMENT MARKINGS
Pavement Markings are broadly classified into following seven categories based on the 
placement of markings with regard to vehicular movement and also based on the function of 
the markings.
	
i.	
Longitudinal Marking (LM)
	
ii.	
Transverse Marking (TM)
	
iii.	
Hazard Marking (HM)
	
iv.	
Block Marking (BM)
	
v.	
Arrow Marking (AM)
	
vi.	
Directional Marking (DM)
	
vii.	
Facility Marking (FM)
The pavement markings are accordingly abbreviated and given in Table A.1 to A.7 of 
Annexure A, presented as figures with details and dimensions along with colour pattern 
etc.
3.1	
Longitudinal Marking (LM)
The longitudinal marking are generally provided along the traffic movement. The broken 
lines, single/double continuous lines and continuity lines are classified under Longitudinal 
Marking and abbreviated as LM01, LM02, LM03 etc. for easy referencing as given in 
Table A.1. The applications of these markings are described in respective sections.
3.1.1	
As traffic moves forward, the broken longitudinal markings can be crossed, 
whereas continuous longitudinal markings shall not be crossed.
3.1.2	
The purpose of longitudinal marking is to navigate the driver for forward movements 
and to prohibit overtaking manoeuvring at certain at hazardous locations. In a multi-lane 
road, the lane boundary established by longitudinal marking really guide to avoid side swipe 
and head on collision accidents.
3.1.3	
The continuous longitudinal marking line can be single and double lines and are 
not expected to cross in normal condition. The double continuous lines are used to make the 
compliance prominent and to reinforce the message that it shall never be crossed. In urban 
roads having space constraints, the construction of raised median will reduce the traffic able 
width in roads and double prohibitive marking is always a solution to streamline the traffic, 
provided the road user behaviour is mature enough to have strict compliance.
3.1.4	
The continuous longitudinal marking in yellow colour is to signify that the marking 
provided is strictly prohibitive in nature and not to be straddled by the vehicles.
3.2	
Transverse Markings (TM)
The marking provided across the carriageway for traffic control with broken lines, single/
double continuous lines such as Stop marking and Give way marking are classified under 



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 156
======================================================================

IRC:35-2015
9
Transverse Marking (TM) and are abbreviated as TM01, TM02, TM03 etc. as given in 
Table A.2. The applications of these markings are described in respective sections.
3.2.1	
The transverse marking establishes the traffic control, lest it would lead to crashes, 
and therefore, its compliance is vital. The road authority shall always ensure the installation 
of transverse marking and continued maintenance.
3.2.2	
The transverse marking shall always be accompanied with corresponding sign.
3.3	
Hazard Marking (HM)
The pavement marking that facilitating traffic merging/diverging, prohibiting to cross-over 
and to deflect the traffic ahead of hazardous situations, generally done with like chevron 
and diagonal marking, hatch marking and prohibitory marking and such markings are 
classified under Hazard Marking and are abbreviated as HM01, HM02, HM03 etc. as given in 
Table A.3. The applications of these markings are described in respective sections.
3.3.1	
Since hazard marking are provided ahead of diverging and merging and around 
a hazardous location, its compliance is also vital. The hazard marking shall always be 
accompanied with appropriate sign.
3.4	
Block Marking (BM)
The zebra crossing for pedestrians, triangular and checkered marking for speed breakers 
and Giveway symbol which are painted in blocks on carriageway are classified under Block 
Marking and are abbreviated as BM01, BM02, BM03 etc. for easy referencing as given in 
Table A.4. The applications of these markings are described in respective sections.
3.4.1	
The application of thermoplastic paint for block marking is generally different 
from longitudinal marking. The quality of block marking with adequate visibility is of utmost 
importance.
3.5	
Arrow Marking (AM)
The arrows painted on carriageway are meant to give direction for driver to take mandatorily 
and are classified under Arrow Marking and are abbreviated as AM01, AM02, and AM03 etc 
as given in Table A.5.
3.6	
Directional Marking (DM)
The word message which are directional nature are classified under Directional Marking and 
are abbreviated as DM01, DM02, DM03 etc. for easy referencing as given in Table A.6. The 
applications of these markings are described in respective sections.
3.7	
Facility Marking (FM)
The marking for parking, the word messages for buses, cyclists and disabled ones are 
classified under Facility Marking and are abbreviated as FM 01, FM 02, FM03 etc. for easy 
referencing as given in Table A.7. The applications of these markings are described in the 
respective sections.

SECTION : 4 
MARKINGS FOR ROAD LINKS
This section covers the line marking required for mid-block sections where the cross section 
remains the same either for at-grade location or for grade separated structures, which are 
provided to navigate drivers and guidance for the traffic movement. Various line markings 
include center line, warning line, edge line, no overtaking line and typically applied to various 
situations like undivided road, divided carriageway roads, and one-way street/ramp/slip 
roads.
4.1	
Center Line
The center lines should be used only on single carriageway roads to separate the opposite 
streams of traffic and to facilitate their movements. Generally center line is placed at the 
centre of carriageway, but under following circumstances, the center line may not be located 
at the centre position:
	
●	
Carriageway width transition location
	
●	
Additional turning lanes at junctions
	
●	
Odd number of lanes on vertical and horizontal curves with limited sight 
distances
	
●	
Urban roads with parking permitted on one side only
	
●	
Urban roads with odd number of lanes with extra lanes allotted to the 
predominant direction of flow.
	
●	
On curves with extra widening
4.1.1	
On unimportant roads with less than 5.5 metres wide carriageway, center lines are 
considered undesirable as these entail discomfort and hazard, where drivers might expect a 
road marked with a centre line to be wide enough for opposing lane of traffic to pass. However, 
for short sections, centre line can be provided like on approaches to busy intersections, 
pedestrian crossings, level crossings, horizontal and summit curves with restricted sight 
distance and on locations where driver’s visibility is reduced e.g. due to frequent foggy 
weather conditions.
4.1.2	
When the pavement is widened on curves, the center line should be placed in 
such a manner that the width of the traffic lanes on both approaches of the curves will be 
maintained around outside curve. This will necessitate the center line marking being off center 
as far as the total width of pavement is concerned, but at the same time it will give the traffic 
using the inner lane to have more manoeuvring width than outer lane and details are given in 
Section 4.3.6.
4.1.3	
The line marking at the centre of a ramp or slip road or one-way street will be 
traffic lane line and shall be a broken line.
4.1.4	
If the center line is to be painted on the pavement on the approaches to a bridge, it 
shall be continued over the bridge provided that the width between the kerbs is 6 m or more. 



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 156
======================================================================
IRC:35-2015
12
Otherwise the centre line marking on approaches should be discontinued at 30 m to 35 m 
distance from each abutment of the bridge.
4.1.5	
On undivided carriageway where two lanes are available for one direction, double 
centre line should be used to separate the opposite stream of traffic. The double centre line 
with hatch marking will be effective in acute curves to avoid head on collision accidents, as it 
would be more appealing in separating the opposing traffic.
4.1.6	
The width, length and spacing of marking segments depending on speed and 
category roads are presented for all types of roads in Section 4.6.
4.2 
Traffic Lane Lines
4.2.1	
The carriageway having two or more in one direction are divided into separate 
lanes by traffic lane line marking for vehicles to move in proper lanes and to discourage 
the meandering tendency of the drivers, thereby promoting safety and ensuring maximum 
capacity. At intersections and on approaches thereto, marking of traffic lanes eliminates 
confusion and facilitates through and turning movements. Traffic lanes should also be 
marked near pedestrian crossings and at other dangerous locations in rural and urban area, 
in congested area where the carriageway can accommodate more than one lane and also on 
important one way streets. Since respect for road markings grows with proper usage, traffic 
lane should not be marked indiscriminately.
4.2.2	
Application of Traffic lane lines markings on divided carriageway and one-way or 
ramps are discussed in Section 4.7 and Section 4.8.
4.2.2	
Traffic lane line markings are only provided where there is at least one lane width 
as per relevant IRC is available between two traffic lane lines or between a traffic lane and 
edge or centre line. Invariably, the traffic lane line shall be avoided if lane width cannot be 
accommodated between two longitudinal markings, lest it may lead to side swipe accidents.
4.3	
No Overtaking Lines
4.3.1	
No overtaking zones shall be established on summit curves, horizontal curves 
and elsewhere on two and three lane highways where overtaking manoeuvring must be 
prohibited because of restricted sight distances or other hazardous conditions.
4.3.2	
On undivided highways with more than 3 lanes, there is hardly any need for 
vehicles to cross the center line for overtaking. The double solid centre line prescribed for 
such highways is to be regarded as continuous no-overtaking marking, which is not to be 
crossed on either side. The no-overtaking zone shall be marked by a solid line either single 
or double along the centre.
4.3.3	
The ladder hatching is another effective way of center line marking to emphasis 
on the no-overtaking zone. The ladder hatch also will have two solid lines separated by 
minimum 600 mm and longitudinal marking shall be either 100 mm or 150 mm. The diagonal 
of 200 mm width shall be provided at 4 m for speed up to 65 kmph and 6 m spacing for speed 
exceeding 65 kmph. i.e. HM10/HM11/HM12/HM13.

4.3.4	
No overtaking zone markings shall be marked when the sight distance available 
is less than the Minimum Visibility Distance (MVD) given in Table 4.1. A simple procedure to 
establish no-overtaking line in a 2-lane bi-directional road is given below.
4.3.5	
Procedure to establish No Overtaking Central Line
The simple procedure given under using the sighting poles and shall be read in conjunction 
with Fig. 4.1 and Table 4.1, where Minimum Visibility Distance (MVD) is defined and distance 
at which an object of 1.05 m above the carriageway can be seen by an observer, taking count 
of both vertical and horizontal curvatures. The steps involved are:
Step 1 – Determine 85th percentile speed for each direction of travel and find the Minimum 
Visibility Distance (MVD) from Table 4.1.
Fig. 4.1  Procedure to Establish No-Overtaking Center Line



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 156
======================================================================
IRC:35-2015
14
Step 2 – As shown in Fig. 4.1, the Person A & Person B will be positioned and are mutually 
visible at a distance of MVD apart. Then they are allowed to move forward, retaining the 
same MVD distance between A & B always.
Step 3 – As they are walking in the inner edge of curve, identify the last lap of MVD, beyond 
which minimum mutual visibility between person A & B ceases to exist and the position of 
person A will be the one extremity of the No-overtaking centre line and marked as Start of 
Barrier Line (SBL).
Step 4 - Further when the persons A & B continue their walk, by still retaining the same 
MVD distance apart, one need to identify the first lap of MVD, in which the mutual visibility 
between A & B is regained, wherein the position of person B would be the other extremity of 
the No-overtaking centre line and marked as End of Barrier Line (EBL) and the same will be 
considered as non-visibility stretch for the speed considered.
Step 5 - There will not be any opportunity for traffic approaching curves for a length equivalent 
to Warning Sight Distance (WSD) from the start of non-visibility stretch. Hence as shown 
in Fig 4.1, a length of WSD in both approaches to non visibility stretch shall be marked 
with a double line comprising a continuous line and a broken line that prevent overtaking 
for those traffic approaching non-visibility stretch. however the same section would allow 
overtaking for those traffic leaving the non-visibility stretch and may be marked as LM28/
LM29 as appropriate.
Step 6 – The both approaches of No-overtaking centre shall be marked with seven segments 
of warning central line described in Table 4.1 and defecting arrows.

4.3.7	
On acute curves, if the paved portion is more than the extra widening required 
indicated above (i.e. carriageway width > (ei+ea)), thus enabling vehicles on both directions 
of travel to negotiate the bend with reasonable comfort without crossing the lines, the no-
overtaking lines can be splayed to form a shape of central island with an internal width of at 
least of 600 mm. The area within the splay and parallel section must be hatched with inclined 
150 mm thick lines at 4 m or 6 m spacing, as indicated in Fig. 4.3. It should be installed with 
unidirectional road studs to make the lines prominent to drivers.
4.3.8	
The no-overtaking zone lines should be marked always with road studs.
4.4	
Warning Lines
4.4.1	
Warning lines are broken lines and are marked on horizontal and vertical curves 
where the visibility is greater than Minimum Visibility Distance (MVD), but less than the 
Warning Sight Distance (WSD) given in Table 4.1.

4.4.2	
Warning lines are always single and they should never be used as part of a double 
line installation (no overtaking zone). Ahead of any continuous barrier line, a minimum of 
7 line segments of warning line shall be provided at all locations.
4.4.3	
Warning lines are also used in lieu of centre lines and lanes lines at hazardous 
locations like approaches to intersections and sharp curves and obstruction approaches etc. 
and generally seven segments of warning lines are provided. The width of the warning line 
should be equal to the width of centre line/traffic lane line immediately preceding it, but length 
of the segment and gap are reversed to make them warning lines.
4.4.4	
Warning lines are preferred at mid-block sections passing through urban and 
ribbon settlements and also at locations where by virtue of some external factors or the 
absence of street lighting minimise the visibility of normal traffic lane line or centre line. At 
such locations, normal broken lines (i.e. segment and gap can be reversed) to be warning 
lines in order to make the broken lines look more conspicuous.

Border or Edge Lines
The border or edge lines are intended to indicate end of the carriageways and thus help to 
delineate the limits up to which driver can safely venture. This continuous guideline makes 
night driving comfortable during inclement weather.
4.5.1	
The pavement edge lines are desirable at the following locations:
	
●	
Where the shoulder is paved and is of similar texture and colour to the main 
carriageways:
	
●	
In advance of and near narrow bridges and around sharp curves;
	
●	
Where obstructions on the shoulder are close enough to constitute a hazard 
to the motorist;
	
●	
On pavement width transitions;
	
●	
On heavily trafficked two and three lane roads where head lamp dazzle is 
severe; and
	
●	
Along lengths which are prone to fog and mist.
4.5.2	
Carriageway edge lines shall ordinarily be provided only on roads with two or 
more than two lanes. These shall be in the form of a single continuous white line placed on 
the carriageway 150 mm from the edge.
4.5.3	
On multi-lane road with central median the carriageway edge line shall be 150 mm 
wide and on expressway the width shall be 200 mm. Where flush kerbs are provided, the 
edge lines should be superimposed.
4.5.4	
Edge line provided all along the raised kerb, both median side or footpath/raised 
kerb on shoulder side shall always have the setback distance to the extent possible which 
shall not be not less than 200 mm from the vertical face of kerb. This is, to prevent the edge 
lines from generally getting buried beneath with mud and dust or sometimes witnessing 
water stagnation, as the water may get accumulated at the corner of raised kerb, lest the 
safety performance of such important alignment delineating edge lines would be nullified.
4.5.5	
For two directional roads with less than 7m paved width, due to space constraints 
to place edge, it can be 100 mm.The edge line is preferable, as it would guide the driver to 
judge the alignment especially during the night time for locations with reduced visibility.
4.5.6	
The border or edge line markings should not be carried across the mouths of 
side roads, but shall be continued with continuity line. Continues edge line shall be broken 
continuity line in case of merging/diverging for slip roads, auxiliary lanes, for bus and truck 
laybyes and at locations where median are discontinued for traffic turning. Invariably edge line 
shall be continued through and through either with continuous line or with broken continuity 
line.

Longitudinal Marking for Undivided Roads
4.6.1	
The centre line markings of 3 m Mark + 6 m Gap of 100 mm/150 mm are used for 
normal sections. (i.e. LM01/LM02). However, when it entered into warning section, it shall be 
6 m Mark + 3 m Gap of 100 mm/150 mm (i.e. LM04/LM05) and continued as single or double 
or ladder hatching on no-overtaking section.

4.6.2	
The traffic lane line marking of 3 m Mark + 6 m Gap of 100 mm/150 mm are used 
for normal sections (i.e. LM01/LM02). However, when it entered into warning section, it shall 
be 3 m Mark + 3 m Gap of 100 mm/150 mm (i.e. LM11/LM12) and continued as single or 
double or ladder hatching on no-overtaking section.
4.6.3	
Table 4.3 along with Figs. 4.4 to 4.8 presents a summary of line markings for 
undivided roads in mid-block sections. The longitudinal marking at other places will be 
dealt separately at respective sections like junctions, lay byes and merging and diverging 
locations.

There could be situations in an undivided road, especially at urban locations or 
due to huge difference traffic volume in opposite direction, two lanes movement is facilitated 
in one direction and one lane to other direction. The Fig. 4.7 presents longitudinal marking at 
mid-block section for such road sections. The double centre line can be with or without hatch 
marking for normal, warning and no-overtaking sections. The colour of centre line is made 
yellow to make it distinguished with continuous traffic lane line marking in no-overtaking 
sections.

The width of centre line and traffic lane in urban section shall be more than 
100 mm, as line marking gets distracted by drivers due to external factors. The width depicted 
for centre line in Figs. 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6 are for a section of road passing through open country 
and the width shall be increased to 150 mm for urban sections.

Longitudinal Marking for Divided Carriageway
4.7.1	
The longitudinal markings 3 m Mark + 6 m Gap of 100 mm/150 mm are used for 
traffic lane line marking at normal sections. (i.e. LM01/LM02). However, when it entered into 
warning section, it shall be 3 m Mark + 3 m Gap of 100 mm/150 mm (i.e. LM11/LM12) and 
continues as single on no-overtaking section.
4.7.2	
The width traffic lane in rural section for design speed up to 100 kmph can be 
100 mm and 150 mm for design speed more than 100 kmph and expressways. It shall be 
150 mm in urban section as line marking gets distracted by drivers due to external factors.
4.7.3

SECTION : 5 
ROAD STUDS
5.1	
General
5.1.1	
Retro-reflective studs are used to supplement longitudinal/transverse reflectorized 
road markings, which would improve visibility in night time and adverse weather conditions. 
Road studs are also used across the carriageway to serve as Speed Arrestor coupled with 
eschewing warning through the creation of the rumbling sensation to the user. Series of such 
road reflector studs are to be laid in advance of junction/crossings/end of the flyover section 
wherein road crashes are prevalent.
5.1.2	
The Clause 804 of ‘Specification for Road and Bridge Works” by the Ministry of 
Road Transport & Highways (MORTH) and ASTM D4280-04 shall be referred for technical 
specifications of road studs.
5.1.3	
The performance of road studs depends upon the amount of light from vehicle 
head lamps reflected back towards the source.
5.2	
Types of Road Studs
5.2.1	
Studs shall be made of plastic material with reflectors for all type of roads. These 
reflectors should have abrasion resistant protective coating. The studs with anchorage or 
without anchorage can be bonded to road surface with suitable epoxy/bitumen adhesive as 
recommended by the manufacturer
5.2.2	
Uni-directional road studs shall be used on one directional carriageway of undivided 
roads, one way street or slip roads. Bi-directional road studs shall be used for two directional 
roads to delineate the centre line and edge line.
5.3	
Lateral Placement of Road Studs
5.3.1	
The road studs to be placed on broken longitudinal markings and it shall always 
be placed at the centre of gap and shall never be upon the line segment or by the side of line 
segment.
5.3.2	
However, in the case of the road studs to be placed on carriageway having a 
paved shoulder, it shall be placed outside the shoulder side edge line and shall be set back 
by a distance of 50 mm from the edge line. When road studs are to be placed on shoulder 
edge line having no paved shoulder, it can be placed on edge line due to space constraints.
5.3.3	
In the case of the roads studs provided on median side edge, it is to be again 
ensured that it shall not be on the median line marking, but shall be in hard strip or kerb 
shyness width, keeping at least 50 mm set back distance from median side edge line by 
ensuring a minimum 100 mm clearance distance from the vertical face of the raised kerb. 
This measure is expected to help in preventing road studs being covered by mud and dust 
which generally gets accumulated on the raised kerb corner on the median side as well as 
on the edge line side due to dust/mud accumulation emerging from the footpath.
5.3.4	
However, in the case of flushed or depressed median, the minimum requirement 
of 100 mm clearance requirement will not prevail and hence will not be applicable and only 
50 mm from the median side edge line will be applicable.



======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 156
======================================================================

IRC:35-2015
25
5.3.5	
However, in extreme circumstances, if the width of hard strip or shyness is not 
adequate enough to accommodate the required set back distance of 50 mm from edge line, 
the road studs can be placed adjacent to edge line and even directly on the edge lines.
5.3.6	
Road studs with anchorages are preferable for edge lines. If at all the road studs 
with anchorage are to be applied to road markings other than edge lines, the anchorage 
shall be applied ensuring proper workmanship so that pavement structure will not be affected 
during installation process. However, the road studs with anchorages are not recommended 
for concrete roads.
5.4	
Colour for Road Studs
The studs with different colours of reflectors such as white, red and yellow are used for 
highways. The usage of different colours of studs is as follows.
5.4.2	
White Colour
White road studs are to indicate traffic lane line and centre of carriageway.
5.4.3	
Red Colour
Red road studs are to be used to indicate a line which should not be crossed and mainly to 
delineate left hand edge of the running carriageway i.e. for road studs to be used on shoulder 
side edge line. The road studs shall be omitted or can be replaced with green colour where 
the facility for exiting traffic are provided from the main carriageway like entry to Truck Lay 
Bye/Bus Bay, Start of Service Road, etc.
5.4.4	
Yellow Colour
Yellow road studs are to be again deployed to indicate a line which should not be crossed 
with the aim to delineate the right hand edge of the running carriageway in case of the multi-
lane divided carriageways i.e. median side edge line.
5.4.5	
Green Colour
Green road studs are to be employed to indicate crossable edge line like the lay byes and to 
show the boundary of acceleration or deceleration line on left hand side of the carriageway 
in case of the multi-lane divided carriageways.
5.4.6	
Uni-directional carriageways shall have one coloured face with the applicable 
colour given above, whereas the Bi-directional carriageways shall have two coloured faces 
which can be a combination of two colours such as Red-White bi-directional road studs 
or same colour on two faces like white-white bi-directional road studs or Yellow-Yellow 
bi-directional road studs.
5.5	
Spacing of Road Studs
5.5.1	
The colour and spacing pattern to be followed in an undivided carriageway is 
given in Table 5.1 . The Fig. 5.1 shows the road studs for bi-directional road for normal/
warning and no overtaking section.
5.5.2	
The colour and spacing pattern to be followed in a divided carriageway is given in 
Table 5.2.

STOP and GIVEWAY MARKINGS
6.1	
Stop Line
61.1	
Stop line indicates the location on the ground beyond which the vehicles should not 
proceed where it is in laid such as at the vicinity of traffic signals, pedestrian zebra crossings 
and on minor road approaches merging with major roads it is provided in conjunction with 
the stop sign. Stop lines shall not be used unless traffic control by any one of these means 
exist. Stop lines should be either parallel to the intersecting roadway or at right angles to the 
direction of approaching vehicles. Stop line marking on side roads shall be supplemented 
with stop signs.
6.1.2	
Two Patterns are Prescribed:
	
i)	
Single Stop Line
	
ii)	
Double Stop Line
6.1.3	
Single Stop Line shall be applied in traffic signal and ahead of pedestrian crossing. 
Single Stop Line shall be solid white transverse line of 200 mm wide on urban roads and 
300 mm wide on rural roads.
6.1.4	
Single Stop Lines shall ordinarily be located not less than 2 metres and not more 
than 3 metres in advance from the desired location and shall be parallel to the nearest 
boundary of the pedestrian crossing marking. Where there is no pedestrian crossing, the 
Single Stop Line shall be placed not less than 1.25 metres and not more than 9 metres from 
the nearest carriageway edge of the intersecting road and shall extend across all approach 
lanes, usually to the centre line or in the case of one way streets to the right kerb or pavement 
edge. At traffic signals, the line shall be normally located 1 m before the nearest primary 
signal.
6.1.5	
As far as possible, Stop Lines at intersection shall be equidistant from the centre 
of the intersection.
6.1.6	
The Double Line is used exclusively at junctions controlled by “STOP’’ signs and 
in no circumstances should be used merely to give warning for the approaching traffic to the 
major road for which the “GIVE WAY” marking is more appropriate.
6.1.7	
Double Stop Lines shall consist of two continuous lines each 200 mm wide spaced 
300 mm apart and supplemented by a Stop Sign in accordance with IRC:67 (2012) and 
supplemented with the word message “STOP” encrypted on the carriageway as shown in 
Fig.  6.1. The size of the Stop Word message shall be as shown in Table 6.1 based on the 
approach speeds prevailing on the road section and the placement of the same shall be 
between 2.5 m to 15 m from Stop marking.

6.1.8	
The “STOP’’ sign/marking supplemented by the Double Line implies the adherence 
to the following traffic rules on the ground:
	
i)	
Every vehicle shall before entering the major road from the minor road, shall 
stop at the transverse lines (vide Fig. 6.1) and
	
ii)	
No vehicle shall proceed past these transverse lines in such a manner or 
at such a time as it is likely to necessitate any vehicle on the major road 
to change its speed or course in order to avoid collision with the vehicle 
emerging from the minor road.

6.1.9	
On two-way minor roads, the Stop marking shall extend to the centre of the 
carriageway coupled with the remaining width shown in broken continuity line as illustrated in 
Fig 6.1. In such cases, transverse marking shall be accompanied by barrier line and warning 
line.
6.1.10	
The Stop signs and markings should not be used in conjunction with the Give 
way Signs and Markings at the unsignalised Intersections can cause uncertainty as to which 
vehicle would have priority.
6.2	
Give Way Lines
6.2.1	
The Give way marking consists of two broken lines laid side by side, each 
comprising 600 mm line segments and 300 mm gaps. The lines are 200 mm wide and are 
spaced 300 mm apart the marking is laid across, the minor roads at intersections which are 
not controlled by stop signs, traffic signals or the police.
6.2.2	
The Give way lines shall be supplemented by the hollow triangular Give Way 
approach marking and a Give Way roadside signs. The marking should normally be located 
with its base around 2.5 m to 12 m from the transverse marking.
6.2.3	
On two-way minor roads, the Give way line normally extend to the centre of the 
carriageway and remaining width with broken continuity line as shown in Fig. 6.2. Also at 
intersections if the continuity of the kerb line of the major road needs special emphasis, 
the GIVE WAY markings may be extended across the entry half width of the minor road by 
providing continuous line. In such cases, transverse marking shall be accompanied with 
barrier line and warning line.
Fig. 6.2  Give Way Marking
6.2.4	
On major roads having paved shoulders, the provision of Give way or Stop marking 
shall be in line with shoulder side edge line of the main carriageway and thus the continuity 
line can be ensured for shoulder edge line to navigate the main carriageway traffic as shown 
in Fig 6.3.

At the entry point of the roundabouts, it is prudent to provide Give way marking 
and sign which is detailed in Fig. 9.14 in Section 9 under the Intersection Marking.
6.3	
Guidance for Installation of Stop or Give Way Markings
6.3.1	
Stop Marking and Stop Sign shall be used on a minor road at its intersecting point 
with a major road where conditions are considered to be unduly hazardous due to restricted 
visibility, bad alignment and high road crash record. If the visibility funnel shown in Table 6.1 
and Fig 6.4 is not obstruction free due to geometric deficiency or climatic factors or traffic 
constraints, it is prudent to install Stop marking and Stop Sign. If the visibility funnel is clear 
enough from both directions of travel, then the Give way Marking along with Give way Sign 
can be considered for installation on the Minor Road.
Fig. 6.4  Visibility Funnel
6.3.2	
However, on inter-urban roads as well as on the rural roads, it is preferable to 
provide Stop Marking and Stop Sign as these are more familiar to road users than the 
provision of Give way Signs and Give way Marking.

SECTION : 7 
MARKINGS FOR TRANSITION AND LANE CHANGE
7.1	
General
The Road Markings designating the transition and lane change areas shall be applied on high 
speed and slip roads and at diverging and merging locations. Typically, these markings shall 
be laid at acceleration and deceleration lanes at appropriate locations at the intersections so 
as to direct the entering and exiting traffic at the intersections. The provision of such transition 
markings would facilitate the formation of safe negotiating angle to achieve smooth movements 
of divergence and convergence. In this regard, different types of road markings that can be 
deployed at appropriate locations to facilitate transition and lane change phenomenon are 
listed below followed by a brief on their application strategy:
	
i.	
Diagonal and Chevron Marking
	
ii.	
Continuity Markings
	
iii.	
Lane Change & Merging/Diverging Markings
	
iv.	
Hatch Markings
7.2	
Diagonal & Chevron Markings
7.2.1	
Channelizing markings like diagonal and chevron markings are utilized to demarcate 
the neutral area at the nose of a channelizing island which can help in reducing the incidence 
of collision with kerb nose. They direct the entering and exiting traffic into the proper angle 
for smooth movements of divergence and convergence. These markings provide for proper 
and safe use of acceleration and deceleration lanes. The basic function is to inform the driver 
about the area/lane(s) which is set aside for the exclusive use of traffic on the main highway 
and thus enable the driver to adequately distinguish between through traffic lanes and the 
acceleration and deceleration lanes.
7.2.2	
The diagonal markings shall be marked where one of the traffic flows on either side 
of the marking is in opposite direction. The diagonal and chevron markings are generally placed 
at locations where traffic is expected to change position either to diverge or converge.
7.2.3	
Spacing between Diagonal and Chevrons
The spacing between chevrons and diagonals depends on the total length of chevron provided 
at a given location. Table 7.1 presents the spacing of Diagonal and Chevron depending on 
the total length of markings and the same is depicted in Fig. 7.1.

7.2.4	
The total length of diagonal and chevron markings depends on the lateral shift 
undertaken by a vehicle in motion. Also, the total length of longitudinal chevron and diagonal 
marking varies with site conditions and the length should be such that to accommodate at 
least two or three chevrons or diagonals.
7.2.5	
The chevrons must always point towards approaching traffic and chevron should 
be reversed when traffic is merging. The gap between chevron and boundary line shall be 
100 mm to facilitate drain of surface run off.
7.2.6	
Various diagonals and chevrons are HM01 to HM09 as given in Table A.3 of 
Annexure A.
7.3	
Continuity Lines
7.3.1	
Continuity Lines for Traffic Lane Line and Center Line
The continuity of the lane marking and center line markings through the intersection areas 
and hazardous area will be warning pattern of preceding lane line or centre line markings.
7.3.2	
Continuity Lines for Medians and Islands
At intersections where guidance through channelizer is warranted, broken line markings in 
continuation of the outer edges of the central channelizers or separators, etc. may be provided 
to help the vehicles in negotiating the area safely. They shall be 600 mm segment and 
300 mm gap (i.e. LM17/LM18) in white colour and width shall be same as that of preceding 
line markings.
7.3.3	
Continuity Lines for Stop and Give Way Lines
Continuity lines for stop and give way lines shall be in the form of a single broken line of 
100 mm wide with 600 mm line segment and 300 mm gap (TM04) in continuity with the outer 
lines of a double line installation and in continuity with the line, where only single stop is 
used.
7.3.4	
Continuity Lines for Right Turn Markings
Markings to guide right turning traffic which has to cross two or more lanes may be provided 
in the form of broken white line with 500 mm line segment and 500 mm gap (i.e. LM19/LM20)
for both rural and urban intersections and width shall be the same as that of preceding line 
markings. This pattern will be applicable for continuity line provided between through traffic 
lane and acceleration lane length including taper length.
7.3.5	
Continuity Lines for Left Turn Markings
Markings to guide left turning traffic which has to cross two or more lanes like bus bay, truck 
lay bye, and rest area and service area are in the form of broken white lines with 1000 mm line 
segment and 1000 mm gap (i.e. LM21/LM22) for both rural and urban intersections and width 
shall be same as that of preceding line markings. This pattern will be applicable for continuity 
line provided between through traffic lane and deceleration lane length including taper 
length.

7.3.6	
Single broken lines provided in Table A.1 and A.2 in Annexure A shall be applied 
for various continuity lines.
7.4	
Word Messages
The general information to guide, warn or regulate traffic may also be conveyed by inscription 
of word message on road surface in addition to directional arrows.
7.4.1	
The basic characters for word messages shall be capital letters only. Numerals, 
apostrophe and the words are formed in the same manner as for any worded sign, leaving a 
minimum of 0.3 m clear gap at either side of the lane/carriageway and in between the letters. 
The size of the basic alphabets and numerals is shown in Annexure C. Importantly, the 
letters shall be elongated in the direction of traffic.
7.4.2	
Letters of 1.25 m high in the direction of travel should be adopted for speeds up to 
50 kmph and 2.5 m high for speeds above that.
7.4.3	
The legends should be as brief as possible and shall consist of not more than 
three words, for any one message. Legends “RIGHT TURN ONLY”, “EXIT ONLY” should be 
used to supplement the directional arrows and should not be used without them.
7.4.4	
All these legends shall be white and except on well-lit roads, the reflectorized 
paints shall be used where nighttime visibility is restricted.
7.5	
Lane Change and Merging/Diverging Markings
7.5.1	
The lane change and merging and diverging at multilane highways will be critical. 
The length of the tapered portion shall always be in conformity with the continuity lane 
(LM 21/LM 22) whereas a combination of double line comprising broken line and solid lane 
(LM 28/LM 29) can be provided between auxiliary lane and through lane as illustrated in Fig. 7.2.
7.5.2	
The length of nose length to be provided shall be the function of approach speed 
and the taper rate for diagonal or chevron. The taper rate for nose length shall be as given in 
Table 7.2 and the required length shall be provided with entry and exit nose catering to the 
design speed at which vehicle merge or diverge as given in Fig. 7.2.

Hatch Markings
7.6.1	
Where traffic has to be deflected in an unusual situation, mere edge line will not 
be effective, in which hatch marking as shown in Fig. 7.3 should be considered. In the hatch 
markings also where traffic has to be shifted, taper rate as per Table 7.2 shall be applied. 
HM18/HM19 marking shown in Table A.3 are the hatch markings and shall be applied for 
markings to create refuge islands.
Fig. 7.3  Hatch Marking
7.6.2	
For deflecting of one lane to other and also for achieving lane reduction situation, 
it shall be done with hatch markings.
7.6.3	
Ladder hatching should be used where there are two streams of opposite side 
traffic merge. HM10/HM11/HM12/HM13 marking shown in Table A.3 is the ladder hatching 
marking. The spacing of the diagonal in ladder hatching shall be 4 m for speed up to 
65 kmph and 6 m for speed exceeding 65 kmph and the width of diagonal shall be 100 mm or 
150 mm.
7.7 
Raised Profile Edge Lines
7.7.1	
Raised profile edge lines are for use as an alternative to the edge markings. It 
is a continuous line marking with ribs across the line at regular intervals. The advantage of 
ribs is that the vertical edges of the raised ribs are clearly visible above the water film in wet 
conditions. The other advantage of raised ribs is that they provide audible warning to drivers 
when vehicle pass over the ribs and produce audible vibrations as warning. The type and 
pattern of raised profile lines are shown in Fig. 7.4.

======================================================================
PAGE 52 of 156
======================================================================
IRC:35-2015
42
7.7.2	
In general, spacing between two ribs should not exceed 500 mm. However, for 
expressway the recommended spacing between two ribs is 250 mm. Closely Spaced Ribs 
helps in maintaining rumble effect; but at the same time, it can become hazardous to the 
cyclist. The minimum and maximum width of raised profile edge should be 150 mm and 
200 mm as shown in HM26/HM27/HM28 in Table A.3 of Annexure A and height generally 
vary from 4 mm to 8 mm, whereas in the case of expressway it can be up to a maximum 
of 11 mm. Raised profile markings should be discontinued when edge line passes through 
crossway meant for pedestrian and cyclist.
7.7.3	
On the curved roads, having radii less than 1000 m, raised edge line should not 
be provided as the ribs of the raised edge line markings will destabilize two wheelers. To 
facilitate drainage, a gap of 100 mm to 150 mm should be provided at an interval of around 
36 m; otherwise rain water may get collected on the road surface.
7.8	
Lane Reduction / Narrowing Situations and Transitions
7.8.1	
The reduction and transition of traffic lanes are frequent and generally carried out in 
the case of four lane divided carriageway getting reduced to 2-lane bi-directional carriageway 
condition. In such situations, the drivers should be properly guided to transfer from 4-lane 
to 2-lane and vice versa. If one or more lanes are to be discontinued, the centre line and 
the lane lines should be merged in such a way that traffic safely merged on to the reduced 
number of lanes.
7.8.2	
Fig. 7.5 gives the layout in which 4-lane to 2-lane safe transfer is gained, where 
the centre line remain the same. The two lane approaches to be reduced to one lane, it shall 
be curtailed by deflecting them.
7.8.3	
Fig. 7.6 presents the typical layout illustrating the road marking for four-lane 
divided carriageway to two lane bidirectional carriageway where there is a shift in centre line. 
Taper length shall be developed for the approach speed as per Table 7.2.
7.8.4	
Fig. 7.7 presents the typical layout in which 3-lane is curtailed to 2-lane. The 
layout shown can also be applied for deflecting one lane if any hazard is present in the third 
lane. The Taper rate given in Table 7.2 shall be provided.
7.8.5	
There are situations where the carriageway or paved width will have to be reduced 
like in a narrow bridge. Fig. 7.8 depicts the typical layout showing how drivers are smoothly 
guided into such situation. The marking shown in Fig. 7.8 along with raised profile edges can 
be applied for tunnel approaches.
7.8.6	
Lane changing and transition marking shall be done with corresponding signs and 
hazards shall be illuminated with appropriate hazard markers.

SECTION : 8 
ARROWS AND WORD MESSAGES
8.1	
Directional Arrows
8.1.1	
Directional arrows should be used in advance to guide drivers to correct lane 
when approaching busy intersections whether signal controlled or not. Directional arrows 
must be elongated in the direction of the traffic flow to have adequate legibility, as arrows are 
viewed at low angle. The details for directional arrows are given in Table A.5 of Annexure A 
and in Table B.1 in Annexure B.
8.1.2	
For speeds up to 50 kmph, the arrows should be 3.5 m in length and it shall be 
5 m for speeds between 51 to 100 kmph, and 9 m for speed greater than 100 kmph including 
expressway as given in Table 8.1.

Speed
Length of Arrows
Up to 50 kmph
3.5 m
51 -100 kmph
5 m
>100 kmph & Expressways
9 m
8.1.3	
On two lane approaches to an intersection, the arrangement of arrows indicating 
the lanes for (a) straight ahead, (b) left turn, and (c) right turn will depend on the relative 
turning volumes and on the site conditions. In a two lane approach road having heavy right 
turn movements, the straight ahead and left turn arrow can be provided by combining both of 
them and the right turn arrow can be provided on the extreme right lane signifying exclusive 
right turning movements. Similarly, where there is a left filter lane, the same should be marked 
with left arrow marking alone, in order to exclude non-filtering traffic.
8.1.4	
Mandatory Turn Arrows
Lane arrows supplemented with the legend “TURN LEFT”, 
“TURN RIGHT” and “AHEAD ONLY” is prescribed. These 
versions may be used only where they indicate the effect 
of a statutory prohibition. The markings can also be used 
to reinforce a green arrow traffic signal or a regulatory 
turn sign, e.g. entry into a one-way road where all traffic 
is required to turn in the same direction. Typical example 
is given in Fig. 8.1.
8.1.5	
Guidance Arrows
These are marked in the junction area where some 
guidance to traffic is considered to be helpful. Care 
should be taken that the meaning is clear to drivers on 
all approaches. In order to avoid confusion and to ensure 
compliance, dedicated arrow markings are mandatory in a signal controlled intersection.

8.2 
Deflection Arrows
8.2.1	
Deflection arrows are used in advance to warn of the approaching restriction and 
to direct the traffic to the correct lane and also to warn of a hazard or change of direction and 
to indicate the side on which traffic should pass.
8.2.2	
The deflection arrow of 4.5 m length shall be used for speed up to 65 kmph and 
deflection arrows of 6 m shall be used for speed ranging between 65 kmph to 100 kmph 
and 9 m for speed more than 100 kmph as given in Fig. 8.2. (Refer AM17/AM18/AM19 in 
Table A.5 of Annexure A).
Fig. 8.2  Deflection Arrow
8.2.3	
Deflection arrow is also used in cycle or bus lane boundary markings to indicate 
the side on which other vehicles should pass them.
8.2.4	
In the bidirectional carriageways and especially ahead of no overtaking stretch, 
the deflection arrow shall be used to direct the traffic to streamline to dedicated lane as 
shown in Fig 8.3.
Fig. 8.3  Deflection Arrows Ahead of Restricted Stretch
8.2.5	
The arrow may be reversed so that it points to the right in appropriate 
circumstances.
8.3	
Bifurcation Arrows
8.3.1	
The bifurcation arrow should be provided at the commencement of deceleration 
lanes on the approach to junctions to guide vehicles ensuring that the full length of the lane 
is used to slow down for the junction without impeding the through vehicles on the main 
carriageway.
8.3.2	
Three sizes are prescribed. The longest (32 m) is for use on expressway or high 
speed all-purpose dual carriageway roads greater than 100 kmph and the medium (16 m) 
for speed 65 to 100 kmph and the shortest (8 m) elsewhere as given in Fig. 8.4. (Refer 
AM19/AM20/AM21 in Table A.5 of Annexure A). It should be noted that the lateral distance 
between the tips of the arrow heads is 2100 mm for all three sizes of marking. The ‘Ahead 
Arrow’ should be laid in the centre of the ahead lane; the turning arrow will then just encroach 
into the deceleration lane.
8.3.3	
The arrow marking may be reversed to suit right turn movements into deceleration 
lanes in the central reservation of dual carriageways and dedicated right turn lanes on other

roads. The right bifurcation arrow indicating a right turn (or ahead and right) must not be used 
in a through lane if it is not the lane from which traffic turns right.
Fig. 8.4  Bifurcation Arrows
8.3.4	
Fig. 8.5 shows the location of the bifurcation arrow in relation to other markings. 
This may be used as a guide for other sizes of arrows; the aim should be to site the arrow 
shortly after the commencement of the deceleration lane, at a point where it has developed 
adequate width.
Fig. 8.5  Positioning of Bifurcation Arrow
8.4	
Arrows on Side Road Approach
8.4.1	
In a side road approach wherein traffic has to turn to other road, normally two to 
three rows of arrows should be used in sequence on each lane.
8.4.2	
The direction arrow nearest to the intersection should be 10 to 15 m from the stop 
line or the entrance to the junction. The second arrow should be placed 15 to 20 m from first

row of arrow and the third row of arrow at 20 to 30 m before the second arrow as shown in 
Fig. 8.6 and is applicable for all minor side road approaches, which should either Stop or yield 
to the traffic on the main road. However, the placement of arrows shall be done judiciously in 
view of the widening of lanes and start of the splitter island.

8.4.3	
Full lane width shall be ensured at location where arrow is shown and shall be 
placed at the centre of two longitudinal markings.

Arrows on Main Road Approaches
8.5.1	
On approaches to major intersection on a multi-lane highway having more than 
two lanes involving changing of lanes where traffic have to enter filter lane or auxiliary lane, 
the position of arrows shall be as given in Table 8.2 and shown in Fig. 8.7.

The arrow shall not be used between two Longitudinal Markings (LM) where full 
lane width for the particular road is available.
8.6	
Word Messages
8.6.1	
Information to guide, warn or regulate traffic may also be conveyed by inscription 
of word message on the road surface. Some of these augment kerbside signs, others indicate 
the areas of the carriageway intended for a particular function (e.g. Bus Stop) or meant to be 
kept clear (e.g. School).
8.6.2	
The size of the basic alphabets and numerals shall conform to the speed range 
presented in Table 8.3. The alphabets and numerals shall be reflectorized. The letters should 
be elongated in the direction of traffic and details are given in Table A.6 of Annexure A and 
in Table C.1 to C.3 in Annexure C. Letters of 1.25 m high in the direction of travel should 
be adopted for speeds up to 50 kmph and 2.5 m high for speeds up to 100 kmph and 5 m for 
speed above 100 kmph (including expressways) as shown in Table 8.3.

8.6.3	
Word and arrows shall be white in colour, word message should not exceed 3 
lines of information and symbol markings should be not more than one lane in width.
8.6.4	
Because of the Necessity for Brevity, the following Typical Legends are 
Recommended which include, STOP, SLOW, BUS, BUS LANE, KEEP CLEAR, SCHOOL, 
RIGHT TURN ONLY, EXIT ONLY, SPEED-25. The message should be marked in advance, 
in case visibility is restricted.
8.6.5	
Legends RIGHT TURN ONLY, EXIT ONLY should be used to supplement the 
directional arrows and should not be used without them. The Legends SCHOOL, SLOW and 
STOP should be used only in addition to the standard signs conforming to IRC : 67-2012.
8.6.6	
Lane Destination Markings: Worded lane destination markings reinforce the 
advance direction sign in conformity. Its letter size depends on speed limit and 1250 mm for 
speed up to 50 kmph and 2500 mm for speed more than 50 kmph. These markings should 
be used at distance of equal to longest peak hour queue. It can be helpful to locate arrows in

conjunction with direction signs and only two directions can be shown on one arrow. Typical 
example is shown in Fig. 8.8.
Fig. 8.8  Lane Destination Markings
8.6.7	
The word STOP shall not be painted unless every vehicle is required to stop at all 
times. This word message must be used to supplement a “STOP” sign and stop line marking 
and shall not be used in any other circumstances. The marking should normally be located so 
that the top of the word is 2 m to 3 m from the nearest part of the double stop line. The word 
STOP shall be marked on the carriageway before the stop line for the approaching vehicle 
and at the centre of each lane if it is more than 2 lanes wide so that users of all lanes are able 
to see the marking at all times. Otherwise, one STOP word is 
sufficient which shall be marked at the carriageway.
8.6.8	
The word message “SLOW” may be used to 
supplement any warning sign on the approach to hazard or a 
road intersection including the advance signs giving warning 
of “STOP” or “GIVE WAY”. It should not be used to supplement 
the roadside “GIVE WAY” sign alone for which the hollow 
triangular marking has been prescribed.
8.6.9	
This word message KEEP CLEAR indicates to 
drivers that the part of the carriageway at the road intersections 
which should be left clear as shown in Fig. 8.9.

SECTION : 9 
MARKINGs FOR AT-GRADE INTERSECTIONS
9.1	
General
9.1.1	
Carriageway markings within and in the neighbourhood of an intersection 
would ensure orderly movement of traffic. The type of carriageway marking for a particular 
intersection depends on speed characteristics of traffic and availability of space. The choice 
of layout for a particular location depends upon the conditions at site. The markings for the 
various intersections types illustrated in this section are typical only. The precise layout may 
be adjusted to suit the design of intersection under consideration.
9.1.2	
At-grade intersection, marking involves i) Marking for Traffic Control; ii) Lane 
Demarcating Markings; iii) Diagonal & Chevron Markings; iv) Directional Arrow Markings and 
Word messages; v) Hatch Markings/Ghost Island; vi) Prohibitory Markings; vii) Pedestrian 
crossings.
9.1.3	
At the intersections, entry lane width should be between 3 and 3.65 m and at the 
locations where space is restricted, the entry lane width can be reduced to 2.5 m provided 
85th percentile approach speed does not exceed 50 kmph. This reduction in width will help 
the designer to provide extra lane at the junction. The number of lanes at the entry level and 
exit side of the junction should match at both sides of the stop line.
9.1.4	
On a minor road approach, minimum widths to be catered while making marking 
are given in Fig 9.1.
Fig. 9.1  Dimensions for Minor Road Approaches
9.1.5	
The lane demarcating markings such as centre line, traffic lane line and edge line 
are illustrated in Section 4. The through lanes should be maintained in its width throughout 
the carriageway and be separated from the right turn lane with broken markings. The traffic

lane line markings, centre line marking shall be warning broken line for a length equal to 
Stopping Sight Distance (SSD) on major road approaches.
9.1.6	
The traffic control established by Stop and Give way for junctions is given in 
Section 6.
9.1.7	
The various continuity line for junctions and diagonal and chevron markings also 
are given in Section 7.
9.1.8	
Various directional arrow markings and word messages for junctions are discussed 
in Section 8.
9.1.9	
The pedestrian crossing points at junctions should be properly marked for which 
stop line shall be placed at a minimum distance of 1.5 m in advance of primary signal post/
push button post. The full width of pedestrian crossing should be provided with Refuge Island 
on the carriageway.
9.1.10	
At the junctions where left turn is free or without the control of traffic signal, Give 
Way markings and signs should be provided so that pedestrian would get priority to cross. 
If visibility of junction is restricted and if the turning traffic volume is relatively high, whereby 
pedestrian will not get opportunity to cross, such left turning also shall be put under traffic 
signal.
9.1.11	
Yellow Box markings
Fig. 9.2 is a prohibitory marking to convey that the message that no vehicle shall be stopped/
stationed in the designated box junction area.
Fig. 9.2  Prohibitory Marking at the Intersections
9.1.12	
In order to prevent the unauthorised use of the right turn storage lane (which is 
exclusively meant for right turning traffic) by the through straight traffic, shall be converted to 
solid line which would serve as barrier line as shown in Fig. 9.2 and shall be provided at the 
end of storage lane.

Simple Junction
9.2.1	
The Simple junction is a T or staggered junction without any ghost or physical 
island both in major and minor side road. Simple junctions are applicable at locations where 
the side road traffic is very low and there is no evidence of right turning traffic involved in road 
crashes. The marking for a simple junction is given in Fig. 9.3.
Fig. 9.3  Typical Marking for Simple T-Junction
9.2.2	
If the forward visibility is clear enough, the broken centre line can be continued, 
but would be warning centre line at junction influence area.
9.2.3	
If the main road has visibility problems due to horizontal or vertical geometry or 
any other external factors, centre line shall be provided with no overtaking.
9.2.4	
The provision of edge line and width of centre line is also governed as per 
carriageway width. The Stop line marking along with Stop Sign shall be provided. Around 
30 m length barrier line shall be provided for side road, preceded by the warning line.
9.3	
Skew or Y-junction
9.3.1	
The skew or Y-Junction is a layout in which a side road approaches the main road 
at oblique angle.
9.3.2	
By virtue of geometry, a triangular island can be catered and thereby side road 
traffic would be made to align at nearly perpendicular to the main carriageway by which 
safety can be enhanced substantially. Fig 9.4 depicts a typical layout.
9.3.3	
If the forward visibility is clear enough, the broken centre line can be continued, 
but would be warning centre line. If the main road has visibility issues due to horizontal or 
vertical geometry or other external factors, centre line shall be no overtaking. The provision 
of edge line and width of center line will also be governed by carriageway width.

The Stop line marking along with stop sign shall be provided. If the visibility 
funnel is clear, Give way marking with Give way sign shall be given. Around 30 m length 
barrier line shall be provided for side road, preceded by warning line.
9.3.5	
The traffic coming from slip lane shall Give way to traffic in the side road and Give 
way marking along with Give way sign shall be provided.
9.4	
Ghost Island Junction
9.4.1	
It is an at-grade junction in which an area of the carriageway will be made with 
pavement markings to direct the traffic movement as well as it would give a shelter lane for 
right turning movement.
9.4.2	
Wide paved area generally will provoke drivers to move recklessly and hence 
hatch markings will cause the drivers to confine within the required space as well to avoid the 
accidents by hitting raised islands.
9.4.3	
If the physical island cannot be installed, wide open area effect can be avoided 
by providing Ghost Island so as to streamline the traffic movement within core junction area. 
The minimum area of a physical island shall never be less than 6 sqm, lest it is unlikely to 
be noticed by traffic, resulting in collision. In such situations, the wide area affect can be 
minimised through Ghost Island i.e. with pavement markings. The typical hatch marking and 
ghost island marking is given in Fig. 9.5.
Fig. 9.5  Hatch Marking and Ghost Island
9.4.4	
Creating ghost Island in the main carriageway eases the right turning vehicle and 
also provides some shelter to right turning traffic from through traffic. Ghost Island is not

desirable for single carriageway as the overtaking of vehicle has the chances of conflicting 
with right turning traffic. However, a storage lane provision with Ghost Island as shown in 
Fig. 9.6. This is a better solution than compelling right turning traffic to wait in the through 
lane, which can be created by a width of 3 m to 3.5 m at junction influence area.
9.4.5	
The width of through lane(s) should not be more than 3.65 m and not less than 
3.0 m. The desirable width of turning lane is 3.5 m but at urban junctions it is advantageous 
to use wider turning lane not exceeding 5 m so that the right turning vehicle can have some 
shelter. The width of the Ghost Island should be between 2.5 m and 3.5 m and not less than 
2.5 m in any case.
9.5	
Right Turn Protected T-Junction
9.5.1	
It is an at-grade junction in which, an area with the carriageway will be made with 
Physical Island to create a right turn protected lane for paved markings to direct the traffic 
movement as well as it would give a shelter lane for right turning movement.
9.5.2	
The width of through lane(s) should not be more than 5.5 m unlike with Ghost 
Island due to raised island and invariably between two raised kerb or island, a minimum of 
5.5 m shall be maintained. This minimum width shall be catered in the formation of Physical 
Island, lest the triangular island shall be with ghost islands.
9.5.3	
In the unlikely event of traffic plying through paved shoulder and even can hit the 
triangular channelizing islands, the islands can be protected by refuge island markings for 
Physical Island as shown in Fig. 9.7.
9.5.4	
The filter lane width shall be 3.5 m and no case it is less than 3 m. The width of 
the raised physical island shall be minimum 1.2 m to act as Refuge Island and also to ensure 
that signs placed in islands are in intact position without being hit by traffic.
9.5.5	
In order to create the right turning lane, necessary tapering shall be done as per 
the taper rate.
9.5.6	
The typical layout for right turn protected T Junction in Fig. 9.8. When the 
carriageway is wide enough and if there is provision for paved shoulder, the shoulder side 
edge line shall be provided. Similarly the fillet radius is not adequate enough to provide a 
physical triangular island; the triangular islands can be made of Ghost Island.
9.6	
Staggered Junction
9.6.1	
The staggered junction is a junction in which major road is continuous and major 
road can accommodate a shelter lane for right turning traffic and two minor T–junction are 
eccentrically placed so that there is enough space to provide right turning lane. Wherever 
there is sufficient space available, it is desirable to convert cross road into staggered junction, 
which will enhance safety substantially. It has an added advantage upon the cross road on 
safety performance by preventing easy cross road movements. Fig. 9.9 gives a typical layout 
for staggered intersection.

Dual Carriageway Junctions
9.7.1	
The standard layout for right turns on dual carriageway is shown in Fig. 9.10. The 
through lanes should maintain its width throughout the carriageway and be separated from 
the right turn lane with broken markings.
9.8	
Signalised Intersection
9.8.1	
At the signal controlled junctions, the Stop lines should be laid as near as possible 
to intersection keeping in mind the need of the pedestrians. Care should be taken that driver 
can have uninterrupted view of at least one signal. Lane lines should also be marked so 
that maximum available space of the carriageway could be marked. At the place near the 
intersection and approaches, appropriate arrow should be marked to show the turning lane.
9.8.2	
stop line should be positioned 1.5 m in advance of nearside primary signal. The 
markings should be carried out at right angle. The markings should be carried out at right 
angle to centre line of the carriageway. Fig. 9.11 shows the basic principles in signal control 
markings.
Fig. 9.11  Marking in Signal Controlled Junction
9.8.3	
The marking layout for a four armed junction controlled by signal is shown in 
Fig. 9.12. According to signal traffic phase based on traffic turning movements, dedicated 
arrow markings shall be given. Pedestrian marking shall be provided and shall be user friendly

to make it distinct. The width of the zebra crossing shall be based on pedestrian crossing 
volume and shall be provided with road studs also.
9.8.4	
A signalised intersection facilitating free left turn movement is shown in Fig. 9.13. 
If turning movement through free slip road is high, the pedestrian crossing across slip road 
will also warrant signal control coupled with the provision of Speed Table as per IRC:67 
(2012) for facilitating the safe crossing of pedestrians.

Roundabout
9.9.1	
The general rule governing the behaviour of traffic at roundabout is that drivers 
should give way to any traffic on their immediate right. The conventional roundabouts always 
operate based on the priority from right rule and shall be adhered. The traffic from approach 
road while entering into circulatory carriageway shall ensure the priority of those vehicles 
already in the circulatory carriageway as given in Fig 9.14.
Fig. 9.14  Give Way Marking for Priority in Roundabout Approach
9.9.2	
Exit roads at roundabouts should be indicated by signs and directional arrows 
placed both at the edges of Central Island and the directional islands. Pedestrian and cyclist 
crossings should be provided with suitable pavement markings.
9.9.3	
The marking for conventional roundabout is given in Fig 9.15 wherein approach 
roads of more or less same category intersect at the roundabout.

9.10	
Signal Controlled Roundabouts
9.10.1	
Signalled roundabouts have traffic signal on one or more approach arms. stop 
line should be laid at right angled to carriageway edge. Lane markings should be provided on 
the circulatory path of the roundabout lane marking and will improve the road space on the 
roundabout and guide the driver for its smooth movement. Lane markings will act as a major 
tool in reducing the incidence of the side swipe of the circulating traffic as well as collision 
between entering and circulating traffic.

carriageway are concentric circles, helping the drivers to know the extent of lane width in which 
he is circulating. Lane arrows and destination arrows are usually repeated on roundabout 
circulatory carriageways. At the entries of roundabouts, these arrows help the drivers to 
identify the correct lane for the specific exit on the roundabout. Pedestrians should never be 
expected to cross the roundabouts and should be provided with safer crossing point outside 
the rotary.
9.10.3	
Yellow box markings at un-signalised roundabout are not allowed but it could be 
used on signalled controlled roundabouts.
9.10.4	
The marking for signal controlled roundabout is given in Fig. 9.17.
9.11	
Double Roundabout
9.11.1	
Double roundabout will be required in situations where in the number of roads are 
meeting and are not possible to handle them in one big roundabout. In a double roundabout 
as shown in Fig. 9.18, the two roundabouts shall function as standalone roundabouts and by 
so doing it will enhance safety and capacity.
9.12	
Mini Roundabout
9.12.1	
Mini roundabouts are effective in improving safety at junctions due to side road 
delays in urban junctions and could be installed with minimal alterations to kerbs etc. Mini 
roundabouts have a one-way circulatory carriageway around a slightly raised central disc 
with or without flared approaches. The layout of mini roundabout is given in Fig 9.19. The 
layout should be designed in such a way that road sign shall be in place as per IRC:67 (2012)
to make the driver aware in good time that they are approaching a roundabout. 
9.12.2 	
Mini roundabouts should be used when all approaches are subject to a speed limit 
of 30 kmph or less. The mini roundabout is not recommended when speed limit on any of the 
road is above 30 kmph as markings will not be conspicuous at higher speeds and the space 
on the mini roundabout will not be sufficient for deflection of the vehicle. The choice of size 
of mini roundabout will depend on the available space. The standard Give Way marking be 
used at mini roundabouts accompanied by sign of roundabout sited at about 1.5 m advance 
of Give Way markings. The central islands of mini roundabout should be kept free of all type 
of furniture as shown in Picture 9.1.

SECTION : 10 
GRADE SEPARATED JUNCTIONS
10.1	
General
10.1.1	
In the case of traffic approaching the grade separated intersections, there is 
likelihood that the lane change from the main carriageway to the auxiliary lanes or vice versa 
generally takes places at high speed and hence has to be dealt carefully. The basic issue 
to be addressed in this regard is to enable the driver to distinguish clearly between through 
traffic lanes and the auxiliary lanes. Additional emphasis has to be provided by means of 
chevron markings in the neutral area. 
10.1.2	
Merging and diverging can be provided either with lane gain or lane drop or without 
lane gain or lane drop depending upon the level of traffic bifurcating or merging.
10. 2	
Merging/Diverging without Lane Gain or Lane Drop
10.2.1	
The traffic merging and diverging occurring in the vicinity of the flyover or 
Vehicular Under Pass (VUP) are generally carried out without any lane gain or lane drop as 
given in Fig. 10. 1.
10.2.2	
The nose length shall be determined based on the speed and actual lateral shift 
traffic as given in Section 7. The position of arrows are given as per Section 8. The length 
of the auxiliary lane and taper shall be as per the design.
10.3	
Merging/Diverging with Lane Gains/lane Drop
10.3.1	
If there is substantial quantum of traffic either diverging or merging, the merging 
or diverging operations are to be facilitated by the provision of a lane gain or lane drop as 
presented in Fig. 10.2.
10.3.2	
The nose length shall be determined based on speed and actual lateral shift of 
traffic as given in Section 7. The position of arrows is given in Section 8. The length of 
auxiliary lane and taper shall be as per the design.
10.3.3	
For diverging and merging situations with two lane slip roads, a safer practice of 
lane gain and lane drop shall be carried out with ghost marking as given in Fig. 10. 3.

MARKINGS FOR SPEED REDUCTION MEASURES,  
PEDESTRIAN CROSSING & CYCLISTS
11.1	
Markings on Speed Breakers
11.1.1	
The markings on speed breakers are necessary to warn driver about the hazard 
ahead in advance. For better night time visibility, the marking shall be made with retro-
reflective and reinforced with road studs. Speed breaker markings shall be supplemented 
with warning sign in advance of zebra crossing location and also informatory signs at the 
location of zebra crossing.
11.1.2	
Fig. 11.1 shows the types of markings to be equipped on the speed breaker, which 
comprises two rows of checkered markings consisting of alternate black and white bands of 
500 mm width on either side of tapering. The Triangular Markings in the case of both Round 
Top and Flat Top Humps shall be marked. The width of the base of the triangular marking 
shall be 750 mm and the height from base to its apex shall be a maximum of 1850 mm. 
The triangular block and chequer block shall be as per the dimension given in Table A.4 of 
Annexure A.
11.1.3	
It is desirable to provide raised footpath for at least small length as shown in 
Fig. 11.1. This measure would help in preventing the violating traffic from using the shoulder 
with their motive to avoid road hump installed in the main carriageway. The road hump of 
various chord lengths can be developed, facilitating different speed and the geometric details 
for construction of road humps have been illustrated in Fig. 11.1.
11.2	
Thermoplastic Bar Marking
11.2.1	
Thermoplastic bar marking is a softer treatment to reduce the speed. One set of 
bar marking (refer TM 08) comprises of 6 bars of 300 mm wide. Each strip of thermoplastic 
strip shall be of 5 mm high and shall be applied across the full width of the carriageway. Each 
strip of 300 mm shall be set apart by 600 mm and one set shall comprise of 6 strips. The 
number of set of bar marking shall be based on approach speed as given in Table 11.1 and 
Fig. 11.2.

11.3	
Pedestrian Crossings
11.3.1	
Pedestrian crossing shall be provided at important intersections and is essential 
where conflict exists between vehicles and pedestrians. The success of the pedestrian 
crossings depends on where and how they are marked. The site should be so selected 



======================================================================

that the pedestrians are subjected to minimum inconvenience and pedestrian would have 
enough visibility to see the oncoming vehicles and at the same time, the vehicular traffic is 
not interrupted very often.
11.3.2	
At intersections, the pedestrian crossings should invariably be preceded by a stop 
line. At an unsignalised pedestrian crossing, the stop line shall be set back 2 m to 3 m from 
the start of zebra crossing marking. In a signalised intersection, zebra crossing shall be 1 m 
ahead of primary signal and stop line shall be placed another 1 m ahead of the start of zebra 
crossing.
11.3.3	
If pedestrian crossing length is more than 10.5 m in one go, there shall be Refuge 
Island in between of at least 1.2 m width to serve as shelter place. The road studs shall also 
be provided to make the zebra crossing visible to users during night time. All kerbs to be 
mounted by pedestrian shall never be more than 50 mm and shall be user friendly facilitating 
wheel chair usage by the disabled at urban locations.
11.3.4	
The pedestrians shall have sufficient space on the footpath to wait. The obstruction 
such as trees, sign posts, lamp posts etc. shall be cleared in the path of pedestrians at either 
end of the pedestrian crossing.
11.3.5	
Fig. 11.3 depict pedestrian marking done at a typical mid-block section. The 
width of the pedestrian crossing is governed by the pedestrian volume crossing and by local 
requirements, but in no case should it be less than the width of footpath subject to minimum 
of 2.0 m. The width of the crossing generally lies between 2 m to 4 m. (Refer Table A.4 of 
Annexure A for detailed dimensions). It may be advantageous to install flashing signal 3-5 
m in advance to warn drivers about the presence of the crossings in urban locations.
11.3.6	
It is desirable to provide raised kerb at least for small length for pedestrian to feel 
safe while waiting for an opportunity to cross the road as shown in Fig. 11.3.
11.3.7	
Pedestrian crossing in priority control T-intersection is given in Fig. 11.4. The raised 
median and triangular island shall be depressed so as to make it comfortable for pedestrians 
and even for wheel chairs.
11.4	
Marking for Vulnerable Road Section
11.4.1	
The road passing through road section having human activities and pedestrian 
presence for a distance shall be dealt separately as shown in Fig. 11.5.
11.4.2	
The centre line and edge line marking for the entire vulnerable section shall be 
with zig zag hazard marking (HM20/HM21/HM22/HM23) to alter the driver. Both extremities of 
vulnerable reach shall be provided with speed breaker at locations where it is really required 
to curtail the speed physically and both extremities shall be provided with bar marking at 
other locations to serve as soft treatment.
11.5	
Bicycle Lane Marking
11.5.1	
Bicycle lane marking should be provided when a portion of the carriageway is 
used by motorized vehicles as well as when it is earmarked for exclusive use of cyclists.

11.5.2	
When exclusive lane as a part of carriage way is required for Cyclists, the cycle 
lane markings should be provided. The markings shall consist of 150 mm (if speed< 65 
kmph) wide solid white boundary line, else 200 mm wide solid line (if speed > 65 kmph). The 
minimum width of the cycle track shall be 1.5 m and shall be 2 m where the cycle traffic is 
heavy.
11.5.3	
The cycle symbol (BM08) as shown in Table A.4 of Annexure A shall be marked 
on cycle lanes. The termination of a prescribed cycle lane should be indicated by an END 
marking on the carriageway and this must always be used in conjunction with cycle symbol. 
Cycle lane markings shall be supplemented with cycle lane signs.
11.5.4	
The continuity of the white solid line shall be maintained at bus stops and junctions 
by providing continuity line and the marking should be continuous across driveways. 
The broken taper line (i.e. 600 mm mark and 300 mm gap) precedes cycle lane and can 
have inclination up to 30 to 45 degree and shall never be sharper than 1:10 as shown in 
Fig. 11.6.
11.5.5	
Advisory cycle lanes markings shall be marked where vehicles look for gap to do 
so then they can enter the lanes and these are marked with warning lines on either side.

The markings shall be placed at all road-rail level crossings having significant 
vehicle/rail conflict. At unimportant crossings or in urban areas, where other devices are 
provided with suitable control, these markings may be omitted. Continuous edge line of 
carriageway at rail crossing shall be marked. The type of centre line marking used generally 
depends on the width of the carriageway available at rail crossing. Where the width of the 
carriageway over the rail crossing is less than 5 m, centre line markings will not normally 
be provided. If carriageway width is between 5 m and 5.5 m, then longitudinal warning lines 
shall be provided on either side of crossing. And if carriageway width is greater than 5.5 m, 
then the double white solid lines at the crossing shall be provided. Arrow markings shall be 
provided at approach arms to reinforce the solid lines at crossings.
11.6.3	
Transverse Marking
If the traffic signal is installed, then stop line of 300 mm width shall be placed at 1 to 2 m from 
signal. At open controlled crossing, Give way line shall be provided at more than 2.0 m from 
near approach rail preceded by give way marking and sign.

PARKING AND RESTRICTIONS
13.1	
Parking Spaces
13.1.1	
The limitation in parking space on urban roads warrants efficient use of the parking 
spaces. Proper parking markings avoid the tendency of encroachment on fire hydrant zones, 
bus stops, loading / unloading zones and other such locations where parkings of vehicle will 
be undesirable. The markings shall be solid white lines of 100 mm wide.
13.1.2	
The limits of the designated parking places should also be indicated by informative 
parking signs mounted on the kerb side in accordance with IRC:67-(2012).
13.1.3	
The word “TAXI”, “CARS”, “SCOOTERS”, “AUTO-RICKSHAWS”, etc, may also be 
written if the parking area is specific for any particular type of vehicles. These words should 
also be indicated on the supplementary plate. Typical details for off street parking are given 
in Fig. 13.1.
13.1.4	
Special Marking (TSR Parking): TSR parking is generally situated on to the left 
side of the motor vehicle lanes. The lane widths of the carriageways shall not be affected 
by the TSR parking as separate pockets are to be created and delineated for them using 
Road Marking. The TSR parking has special marking shall be in blue paint coupled with TSR 
written on it along with a symbol of an auto rickshaw. Dimensions for this symbol marking box 
shall be 2000 mm perpendicular to the lane and 3100 mm along the lane. This place is the 
temporary parking place for the Three wheeler Scooter Rickshaws (TSR). No other vehicle 
except TSR is allowed to be parked in the TSR designated parking area.
13.1.5	
Parking can be on street or off street parking and a typical detail for off street 
parking is given in Fig. 13.2.
13.2	
Restrictions
13.2.1	
The stretch in which parking is to be restricted has to be delineated with yellow 
kerb painting coupled with the provision of yellow edge line. Restrictions like Keep Clear 
marking can be effected on road stretches located in front of school and hospitals by providing 
zig-zag marking and this may be further supplemented by painting the kerb using yellow 
colour marking for the length intended to be kept clear of traffic along with proper sign as 
shown in Fig. 13.3.
13.2.2	
A stretch of road in which parking is prohibited for certain hours can be distinguished 
with yellow single solid edge as given in Fig. 13.4.
13.2.3	
A stretch in which parking or waiting is prohibited at all times has to be distinguished 
by providing yellow double solid edge as shown in Fig. 13.5.
13.2.4	
In order to make the ‘No-Parking’ or ‘No-waiting’ for stricter compliance, lest the 
lane would be blocked leading to a chaotic situation shall be delineated with zig-zag marking 
as shown in Fig. 13.6.
13.2.5	
in order to signify that the loading or unloading of goods is allowed during certain 
hours of the day, loading and unloading prohibition can be imposed by the provision of road 
marking as given in Fig. 13.4 and 13.5. This shall be supplemented with the erection of 
appropriate sign boards with typical messages displaying day and time restrictions like “No 
Loading - Mon-Sat 8.30 am to 6.30 pm” or “No Loading”, etc. as the case may be.

OBJECT PAINTINGS
14.1	
Object Markings
14.1.1	
Basically objects within / adjacent to the carriageway are physical obstructions 
which constitute a serious hazard to the traffic flow and shall be adequately marked. The 
objective of delineating such objects is to make those objects more visible during the night 
time for facilitating safe driving and thereby taking the measures towards the prevention/
avoidance of collision of vehicles with the objects.
14.1.2	
Physical obstructions present on the road can be classified under two categories 
namely,
	
i)	
Objects within carriageway and ii) Objects adjacent / near to carriageway 
based on the location of such objects on the roadway.
14.1.3	
Typical obstructions within carriageway are monuments, raised channelizing 
islands, central island and central median, underpass structures such as piers, abutments 
and their restricted vertical clearance.
14.1.4	
Typical obstructions adjacent/near to the carriageway are continuous raised kerbs 
at the edge of carriageway, culvert head walls, subway abutments and piers, electrical poles, 
sign posts, signal supports, trees, guard rails and stones.
14.2	
Markings for Objects within the Carriageway
14.2.1	
On the face of obstructions (underpass pier, abutment, restricted vertical 
clearance) located within the carriageway 
shall be marked by not less than six alternate 
black and yellow stripes sloping downward 
at an angle of 45 degrees towards traffic. 
The diagonal stripes shall be uniform and 
its width shall not be less than 300 mm as 
shown in Fig. 14.1.
14.2.2	
On structures with restricted 
vertical clearance, the markings of vertical 
black and yellow stripes having width of 
at least 300 mm shall be marked. If the 
obstructing object does not easily lend 
itself to markings, the markings may be 
placed on an independent surface mounted 
immediately in front of the object. Total width 
of the road marking to be provided in such 
circumstances shall be at least equal to the 
width of obstruction protruding into roadway 
including paved shoulder and shall not be 
less than 450 mm.

Performance Assessment and Monitoring
15.1	
General
In this section, the level of performance required to govern the quality of the road marking 
is discussed. It also describes the assessment mechanism for various performance 
characteristics. The performance of the white road markings is based on daytime visibility, 
nighttime visibility, wet reflectivity and wear durability.
15.2	
Wear Durability
Assessment of the degree of wear is measured as a percentage of the area remaining 
intact of the high performance pavement marking. Pavement marking systems 
demonstrate different wear profiles (Figs. 15.1 and 15.2). Some pavement marking 
systems wear out faster corresponding with the traffic operation while others tend to 
exhibit the phenomenon of staying intact for a longer time with the pavement surface 
depending up on its wearing resistance. As wear may be more apparent on left-hand edge 
lines or side road entries, the overall performance of the marking system needs to be taken 
into account.
Fig. 15.1  Above 95% of Area Intact
Fig. 15.2  Below 70% of Area Intact
15.3	
Daytime visibility
Reflection in day light or under road lighting is measured based on the luminance coefficient 
exhibited under the diffuse illumination i.e. Qf measured in accordance with EN 1436 and 
expressed in milli candela per square meter per lux (mcd/m²/lux). Qd corresponds to how 
drivers can view the marking from distance (30 m) see Fig. 15.3. depicts the typical day time 
visibility of a properly laid road marking. Day time luminance is to be measured using the 
method described in Annexure D.

15.4	
Nighttime Visibility
15.4.1	
Dry Retro-Reflection
Retro-reflectivity (night time line visibility) is a result from vehicle headlamps being retro-
reflected back to the source (the driver) at a very narrow observation angle see Fig. 15.4. 
This ultimately facilitates in the proper visibility of the pavement markings during night time 
to the driver. The measurement of the retro-reflected light is the coefficient of retro-reflected 
luminance and is expressed as mcd/m2/lux.
Fig. 15.4  Night Visibility of Road Marking
Nighttime pavement marking visibility is a function of both line pattern dimensions and retro-
reflectivity, can be appreciated in Fig. 15.4 sharing both daytime and nighttime visibility. The 
brighter and wider the marking is, the longer is the road preview time, or end-of-line detection 
distance. This is an important safety consideration to be kept in mind for all types of roads. 
Dry retro-reflectivity is to be measured using the method described in Annexure E.
Another important parameter is the quality and the quantity of Titanium Dioxide used in 
the paint. This chemical is the white pigment used to render brightness to the pavement 
marking.

15.4.2	
Wet retro-reflection
A film of water coating the glass beads in wet condition reduces retro-reflective performance of 
the pavement markings. Wet retro-reflectivity is to be measured using the method described 
in Annexure E.
Pavement markings may change the micro texture and the macro texture of the pavement 
surface. For cyclists and motorcyclists in particular, this may have a destabilizing effect. It is 
to be noted that the improved skid resistance is generally brought about by the inclusion of 
surface applied angular particles to the marking. The angular particles may create shadowing 
of the retro-reflective elements (glass beads) and as a consequence, the measure of retro-
reflectivity (night time visibility of the markings) may be reduced. Picture of a Skid Resistance 
Testing Tool is given in Fig. 15.5.

SECTION : 16 
WARRANTY AND TESTING METHODS
16.1	
Warranty
Road markings are laid on the pavement either temporary or for long term purposes. The life 
of the road markings is limited to the duration of the working zone. In the case of long term 
purpose road markings, it is appropriate to consider the reasons of safety to have a functional 
life that lasts for at least two years. The road authority must demand for a warranty period 
for the pavement marking. During the warranty period, all the performance parameters must 
remain higher than the minimum threshold level. Performance parameters should be checked 
every year on a random section of the network conforming to the procedure presented in 
Section 15.
16.2	
Testing Methods - Inspection
16.2.1	
General
Road Markings shall be inspected using the methods and frequency defined in this section. 
The purpose of inspection is to identify when the deterioration of road markings would occur 
resulting in the delivery of safety benefits. In this regard, it is essential to determine the 
appropriate timing for maintenance intervention.
16.2.2	
Characteristics requiring Maintenance Inspection of Pavement Marking
Road marking shall be preferably subjected to routine inspection desirably once in six 
months for all the characteristics in accordance with the inspection methods set out in the 
flow diagrams in Annexure F.
	
●	
Retro-reflectivity Dry and Wet (RL and Rw)
	
●	
Wear (W)
	
●	
Luminance coefficient (Qd)
	
●	
Skid resistance (SRT)
The location of the road markings will determine which of these characteristics require 
inspection and the methods of inspection to be employed.
16.2.3	
Methods of Inspection and Frequency
The road corridor/network should be surveyed on a routine annual basis. For all longitudinal 
road markings on National Highways and Expressways : An annual survey of retro reflectivity 
exhibited by the pavement marking laid on the ground may be carried out by using the 
High Speed Monitor (HSM) instrumentation system or any other appropriate instrumentation 
system. This assessment would help to understand whether the pavement marking conforms 
to the criteria shown in the Flow Diagram A of Annexure F. The results may be averaged 
for every 100 m interval. The areas of the network that cannot be surveyed by HSMs (e.g. 
STOP lines, Give Way lines, Exit arrows etc.) shall be inspected annually by the alternative 
inspection methods set out in Flow Diagram B in Annexure F. These inspections shall 
include at least an assessment of retro reflectivity by the use of handheld retro-Reflectometer. 
Measurements shall be carried out as set out in Annexure E and assessed against the 
criteria set out in Annexure F, vide Flow Diagram B.

An Assessment of Wear
A visual assessment shall be carried out on 50 percent of the road markings at each location 
or for every 20 m on a 5 m length of an area for continuous road markings. An average of 
the results shall be taken and assessed against the criteria set out in Annexure F, vide Flow 
Diagram B.
16.4 
An Assessment of the Luminance Co-efficient
16.4.1	
Measurements shall be carried out on 50 percent of the road markings at each 
location or every 20 m for continuous road markings. An average of the results shall be taken 
and assessed against the criteria set out in Annexure F, vide Flow Diagram B.
16.4.2	
Skid resistance measurements shall be carried out annually on a quarter of the 
critical areas of the network detailed in Annexure G, vide flow diagram C. Measurements 
should be taken on the most trafficked areas of the road markings at each location and an 
average of the results shall be taken.
16.4.3	
Road markings framed by longitudinal road markings such as hatched road 
markings or ghost islands shall need to be inspected as these will deteriorate at a slower rate 
than the surrounding markings. Road makings of this type shall be maintained along with the 
replacement of any surrounding deteriorated continuous road markings.
16.5	
Road Marking Evaluation Process
This technique shall be used to assess for newly installed markings as well as for in-
service markings. This technique can be used to assess all types of pavement markings. 
All measurements are to be made in the direction of travel. On the centre line of undivided 
highways, measurements should be made in both directions unless otherwise specified.
16.5.1	
Longitudinal Pavement Marking Line
For Pavement Marking Lines (3 km or less): Measurements shall be made on any randomly 
located evaluation section on the pavement marking line. The sample size shall be set at least 
20 numbers and the average of the 20 measurements is to determine the retro-reflectivity of 
the marking as given in Fig. 16.1.
Fig. 16.1  Typical Evaluation of Pavement Marking for Distance Less than 3 km
For Pavement Marking Lines (3 to 16 km): Measurements shall be made on at least three 
randomly selected evaluation sections wherein the pavement marking line is in place. The 
evaluation sections shall not overlap. Measurements within each evaluation section shall be

shall be calculated. The grand average is determined using the average retro reflectivity from 
each evaluation section.
For Pavement Marking Lines (more than 16 km): For assessing pavement marking lines 
wherein the length if more than than 16 km, it is essential to select more than three evaluation 
sections as given in Fig. 16.2 and the average retroreflectivity for each evaluation section 
shall be calculated. The grand average is determined using the average retro-reflectivity from 
each evaluation section.
Fig. 16.2  Typical Evaluation of Pavement Marking for Distance More than 3 km
16.5.2	
Legends, Symbols, Pedestrian Crossing, and other Non-Longitudinal Markings
Legends: Each letter is considered as an evaluation section; three measurements shall be 
made in each letter in the direction of travel. The average value shall be calculated for each 
letter and the average value of each measurement section can be used to compute the grand 
average. The grand average shall be used to determine compliance with the appropriate 
specification.
Symbols or Transverse Lines: Each symbol or transverse line is considered a separate 
evaluation section. Six measurements shall be made on symbols or transverse lines that are 
2.4 m tall or wide. Three measurements on symbols or transverse lines smaller than 2.4 m 
shall be made. The average value shall be calculated for each symbol or transverse marking 
and the average value of each measurement section can be used to compute the grand 
average. The grand average shall be used to determine compliance with the appropriate 
specification.
Pedestrian Crossings: Three random stripes shall be selected as an evaluation section; 
six measurements shall be made in each of the selected stripes. The average value of each 
stripe shall be calculated and the average value of each measurement section can be used 
to compute the grand average. The grand average shall be used to determine compliance 
with the appropriate specification.
16.6	
Category of Defect and Maintenance
As a result of the inspections referred above, any defects may be noticed and these shall be 
categorized under the two categories given below:
Category 1:
Defects that require prompt attention because they represent an immediate or imminent

hazard, there is a breach of statutory duty (e.g. A Badly Worn-out STOP or GIVE WAY line, 
double white lines) or a slippery road marking.
Category 1 defects shall be corrected or made safe at the time of inspection if reasonably 
practical or within no more than 24 hours of notification. If it is not possible to repair the 
defects within 24 hours, then the appropriate prescribed sign (e.g. “NO ROAD MARKINGS 
FOR X KM”) shall be displayed until long term repairs are carried out. These repairs shall be 
completed within 7 days of the notification of the defect.
Category 2:
Defects that require rectification within six months of the inspection
16.7	
Records
An inspection report in a format agreed by the road authority shall be maintained for all 
inspections.
All measurements collected and defects identified during inspection shall be reported and 
recorded, including details of any action taken or required.
An annual report including a summary of inspections, routine maintenance operations and 
changes in the network shall be supplied to the road authority at the end of the financial 
year.
16.8	
Inventory
An accurate computerised inventory shall be maintained and made available to the road 
authority on request. The stock inventory shall be maintained through back-up facilities with 
agreed security procedures.

Measurement Method for the Luminance Coefficient
Introduction
Equipment for the measurement of the luminance coefficient under diffuse illumination Qd of 
a field of a road marking includes an illumination system, a photometer and means to define 
a horizontal reference plane with a reference centre. Laboratory measurements are used to 
establish Qd values for samples, which are to be used to test or calibrate in situ equipment. 
The reference plane and the reference centre are defined by means of a sample holder and 
an alignment procedure. The diffuse illumination can be provided in a photometric sphere. 
A light source is mounted in the sphere in such a way, that direct illumination falls only on 
the lower half of the sphere. By reflection and inter-reflection, the upper half of the sphere 
has a close approximation to a uniform luminance. The reference plane is the horizontal 
plane through the centre of the sphere and the reference centre is the centre of the sphere. 
In some cases, samples can be as short as 200 mm. Samples used to test or calibrate 
portable instruments need to be at least 40 cm long, while samples used to test or calibrate 
vehicle mounted equipment need to be longer. For some structured road markings, fairly 
long samples are required. A practical width of samples is often 200 mm. A sample should 
be backed by a substrate to assist handling and should show a non-deformed surface of the 
road marking. The sample can either be laid directly onto the substrate, or it can be taken 
from a road and adhered to the substrate.
Portable instruments are intended for the measurement of Qd values of road markings on the 
road, but may be used to measure Qd values of road marking materials on sample panels 
before placing them on the road. A portable instrument integrates the photometer and the 
illumination system. For a fixed-aim instrument, the reference plane and the reference centre 
is defined by feet of the instrument. For an aiming instrument, the reference plane and the 
reference centre is defined by an aiming procedure.
When measuring a structured road marking with a portable instrument, it is necessary to 
establish if the instrument in question is able to measure the structured road marking with 
the actual height of structures and gaps between these. The Qd value is established as 
the average of a number of readings taken with shifts of the instrument in steps along the 
marking, covering one or more spacing of structures.
Vehicle mounted instruments are used to measure Qd values of road markings while moving 
at traffic speed, and can be used for longer stretches of road than portable instruments and 
in cases where the use of portable instruments requires extensive precautions, in particular 
on expressways. Vehicle mounted instruments should in principle comply with the same 
requirements as for portable instruments, and should be able to cope with the movements 
of the vehicle and with changing conditions of daylight. However, the operation at speed 
may cause additional difficulties of the measurement, which may lead to compromises with 
requirements or cause additional variation of measured values.

Note :	 At present, vehicle mounted equipment available in the market uses daylight illumination, 
which under an overcast sky with a reasonable free view to the horizon, approximates 
diffuse illumination. Due to variations in daylight, luminance and luminance should be 
measured simultaneously. Suitable daylight illumination does not occur very often. 
Portable and vehicle mounted instruments are to be calibrated, maintained and used 
according to instructions rendered by the instrument supplier.
Spectral Match
The photometer shall have a spectral response according to the V(λ) distribution and the 
illumination shall have a spectral emission according to standard illuminant D65 as defined 
in ISO 10526. However, it is permissible to use illumination with other spectral distributions, 
if the spectral response of the photometer is modified to provide a correct overall spectral 
response of illumination and measurement.
Note :	 Only in the case of fluorescence it is necessary that the spectral emission of the light source 
itself is correct.
Portable instruments shall have an overall spectral response that ensures correct measurement 
of at least white and yellow road markings. The overall spectral response can be tested by 
means of a white (spectrally neutral) reflection standard, or a white road marking sample, 
and a set of long pass absorption filters providing colours of light yellow and dark yellow.
The ratio of the Qd values obtained with a yellow filter inserted in front of the photometer, and 
without the filter, shall be within ± 5 percent of the luminous transmittance of such a filter in 
standard illuminant D65 illumination. The filter shall be inserted at a location, where it does 
not affect the illumination of the white reflection standard or road marking sample. Filters of 
other colours may be added to test the ability of an instrument to measure road markings of 
such colours.
Standard Measuring Condition of Measuring Equipment
The photometer measures a field of the reference plane, which is located about the reference 
centre. The illumination system illuminates a field of the reference plane, also located about 
the reference centre.
The fields are arranged according to method A, if the illuminated field contains the measured 
field, and according to method B if the measured field contains the illuminated field. The 
measured area, defined as the area of the smaller of the two fields, shall be minimum 
50 cm².
The observation direction is the central direction of all rays from the measured area to the 
photometer leading to detection. The observation angle, symbol ‹, is the angle between the 
observation direction and the reference plane. In the standard measuring condition, the 
observation angle ‹ shall be 2.29° ± 0.05° and the total angular spread of the measuring 
directions shall not exceed 0.33°.
Note :	 1	
The standard measuring condition is intended to simulate a visual distance of 30 m 
	
for the driver of a passenger car with an eye height of 1.2 m above the road with diffuse 
	
illumination from daylight or under road lighting.

2	
For some instruments, measuring directions can be tested by putting steady light through 
	
the optical system of the photometer, and observing the transmitted beam. Putting light 
	
through the optical system needs to be done in consultation with the supplier of the 
	
instrument and according to his instructions.
Diffuse illumination is obtained with an illumination system that provides a surface of constant 
luminance, which may be an opening into an illuminated photometric sphere, or other 
device.
When using a photometric sphere, the illumination shall cover all of the interior sphere surface 
above the opening with such a degree of uniformity that the ratio of the smallest to the 
largest luminance of the interior sphere surface is minimum 0.8, when measured in directions 
through the centre of the opening with a circular measuring field of a diameter 0.1 times the 
diameter of the sphere.
When the height of the remaining part of the sphere, after introducing the opening, is minimum 
0.8 times the diameter of the sphere, no further measures to secure uniformity of luminance 
are required.
When less of the sphere surface remains than stated above, or when the sphere is 
approximated by other shapes, the ratio of the smallest to the largest luminance of interior 
surfaces shall be minimum 0.8, when measured in different directions and locations through 
the opening. The test shall be carried out with the opening empty, and shall be repeated with 
the opening covered by a reflecting surface of white, matt finish with suitable holes to allow 
for the measurements.
The surface of constant luminance shall be close to the road marking surface in order to 
provide adequate sensitivity to surface reflection. This may be tested by measurement of 
road markings with a low degree of surface texture. Typical bias values shall be reported by 
the manufacturer.
Practical Applications of Measuring Equipment
The equipment shall have sufficient sensitivity and range to accommodate Qd values expected 
in use, typically 1 to the maximum of approximately 318 mcd/m²/lux(1000/π) . The linearity 
over this range of Qd values shall be adequate for the purpose. The sensitivity, range and 
linearity of portable instruments may be tested by means of suitable samples. The equipment 
shall be able to cope with the conditions expected in use such as stray light entering from 
the surroundings. Portable instruments are used in conditions of full daylight and shall be 
constructed so that readings are not affected by ambient light in these conditions. Some 
instruments may need to inform the operators by warnings or error messages if necessary.
Offset by stray light in daylight conditions may be tested by measurement in full daylight, 
where readings obtained without additional cover of an instrument are compared to readings 
obtained with additional cover by a black cloth or other obstructions about the instrument.
Portable instruments may be tilted and shifted in height relative to the road marking surface 
because of texture and curve of road markings on the road, particles on the surface and 
structure of structured road markings. For fixed-aim instruments, the sensitivity to tilts and 



======================================================================
PAGE 140 of 156
======================================================================
IRC:35-2015
130
shifts shall be tested by shifting the height position H of the instrument parallel to a road 
marking sample and simultaneously moving the sample horizontally so that the measured 
area stays in the same location on the sample surface. The movement of the sample is by 
H/sin 2.29° = 25.H for Method A ; the sample is not to be moved for Method B. Using a non-
glossy surface, the measured Qd value shall not change by more than ±10 percent, when the 
height position is shifted from ‘0 mm’ to -1 mm, 1 mm and 2 mm.
Aiming instruments shall meet the same requirements, but verification has to be according to 
the construction of the instruments. Other height positions may be included to demonstrate 
the ability of an instrument to measure road markings with extreme texture, in particular 
structured road markings.
Note :	 When an instrument is able to perform at a height position H, it is able to measure structured 
road markings when the structure height is at most H or the gaps between structures is at 
most 25.H.
Calibration of the Measuring Equipment
For laboratory measurement on road marking panels placed in a photometric sphere, direct 
calibration is obtained by mounting the photometer at the reference centre with an orientation 
towards the upper part of the sphere, and calibrating the photometer reading to be 1000/π 
approximately 318 mcd/m²/lx(1000/π). The photometer can then be used to measure the Qd 
values of the road marking panels directly in mcd/m-2/lux-1. Direct calibration is suitable, when 
the luminance of the upper part of the sphere is perfectly constant. Else, indirect calibration 
by means of a standard sample with a known Qd value, measured with direct calibration 
or with another traceable calibration technique may be preferable. The ‘sample’ may be a 
curved mirror or another optical system that gives a view to the upper part of the sphere.
A portable instrument shall be calibrated by means of a traceable standard sample with a 
known Qd value. Independent calibration of the standard sample shall be possible. A transfer 
standard may be used for routine tests of the calibration in order to avoid frequent handling 
of the standard in road conditions.
Uncertainty of Measurement
Note :	 1	
The concept of ‘uncertainty of measurement’ is the overall concept that involves both, 
	
trueness (or bias) and precision (repeatability or reproducibility).
	
	
Some level of trueness can be assured indirectly by use of measuring equipment, 
	
when also limiting the use to the range of applicability of the particular equipment. 
	
Precision can be determined by conventional means according to the definitions.
	
2	
Ideally, trueness could be established by means of road marking panels with accepted 
	
reference values measured in laboratory conditions. However, laboratory measurements 
	
are not presently sufficiently developed.
Accordingly, uncertainty of measurement can be addressed in the following steps:
	
●	
calibration;
	
●	
ability to cope with practical conditions including applicability for structured 
pavement markings,;

●	
compliance with the standard measuring condition;
	
●	
spectral match including applicability in terms of colours of road markings;
	
●	
precision (repeatability and reproducibility)
Suppliers/producers of measuring equipment shall account for each of these steps in such a 
way that the range of applicability and the uncertainty of measurement within this range can 
be addressed:
	
●	
the uncertainty of calibration shall be accounted for with reference or 
traceability to a calibration standard with an accepted reference value
	
●	
an instruction shall be available regarding use of equipment in practical 
conditions, in particular for use on structured road markings
	
●	
these and other steps shall be accounted for on the basis of independent test 
reports to the widest possible extent.

MEASUREMENT METHOD FOR THE COEFFICIENT OF RETRO REFLECTION
Introduction
Equipment for the measurement of the coefficient of retro reflected luminance RL of a field 
of a road marking includes an illumination system, a photometer and means to define a 
horizontal reference plane with a reference centre. Laboratory measurements are used to 
establish RL values for samples, which are to be used to test or calibrate in situ equipment. 
The reference plane and the reference centre are defined by means of a sample holder and 
an alignment procedure. In some cases, samples can be as short as 20 cm. Samples used 
to test or calibrate portable instruments need to be at least 40 cm long, while samples used 
to test or calibrate vehicle mounted equipment need to be longer. For some structured road 
markings, fairly long samples are required. A practical width of samples is often 20 cm. A 
sample should be backed by a substrate to assist handling and should show a non-deformed 
surface of the road marking. The sample can either be laid directly onto the substrate, or it 
can be taken from a road and adhered to the substrate.
Portable instruments are intended for the measurement of RL values of road markings on the 
road, but may be used to measure RL values of road marking materials on sample panels 
before placing them on the road. A portable instrument integrates the photometer and the 
illumination system. For a fixed-aim instrument, the reference plane and the reference centre 
is defined by feet of the instrument. For an aiming instrument, the reference plane and the 
reference centre is defined by an aiming procedure. When measuring a structured road 
marking with a portable instrument, it is necessary to establish if the instrument in question 
is able to measure the structured road marking with the actual height of structures and gaps 
between these. The RL value is established as the average of a number of readings taken 
with shifts of the instrument in steps along the marking, in total covering one or more spacing 
of structures.
Vehicle mounted instruments are used to measure RL values of road markings while moving 
at traffic speed, and can be used for longer stretches of road than portable instruments and 
in cases where the use of portable instruments requires extensive precautions, in particular 
on motorways. Vehicle mounted instruments should in principle comply with the same 
requirements as for portable instruments, and should be able to cope with the movements 
of the vehicle and with changing conditions of daylight. However, the operation at speed 
may cause additional difficulties of the measurement, which may lead to compromises 
with requirements or cause additional variation of measured values. Portable and vehicle 
mounted instruments are to be calibrated, maintained and used according to instructions by 
the instrument supplier.
Spectral Match of Measuring Equipment
The photometer shall have a spectral response according to the V (λ) distribution and the 
illumination shall have a spectral emission according to standard illumination ‘A’ as defined in 



======================================================================

133
ISO 10526. However, it is permissible to use illumination ‘A’ with other spectral distributions, 
if the spectral response of the photometer is modified to provide a correct overall spectral 
response of illumination and measurement.
Note :	 Only in the case of fluorescence it is necessary that the spectral emission of the light source 
itself is correct, but it is unlikely that fluorescence will occur to a significant degree in conditions 
of RL measurement.
Portable instruments shall have an overall spectral response that ensures correct measurement 
of at least white and yellow road markings. The overall spectral response can be tested by 
means of a white (spectrally neutral) reflection standard, or a white road marking sample, 
and a set of long pass absorption filters providing colours of light yellow and dark yellow. 
The ratio of the RL values obtained with a yellow filter inserted in front of the white reflection 
standard and without the filter shall be within ± 5 percent of the luminous transmittance of 
an air space pair of two such filters in standard illuminant ‘A’ illumination. The filter shall be 
inserted with a small tilt to avoid signal by surface reflection, and at some distance from the 
standard to avoid surface reflection back to the standard. Filters of other colours may be 
added to test the ability of an instrument to measure the road markings of such colours. For 
vehicle mounted instruments, it is also permissible for the light source to be a visible laser, if 
calibration is carried out for the colour of the road markings to be measured.
Standards for Measuring Condition of Measuring Equipment
The photometer measures a field of the reference plane, which is located about the reference 
centre. The illumination system illuminates a field of the reference plane, also located about 
the reference centre. The fields are arranged according to Method A, if the illuminated field 
contains the measured field whereas according to Method B if the measured field contains 
the illuminated field. The measured area, defined as the area of the smaller of the two fields, 
shall be minimum 50 cm².
The observation direction is the central direction of all rays from the measured area to the 
photometer leading to detection. The observation angle, ε symbol is the angle between 
the observation direction and the reference plane. The illumination direction is the central 
direction of all rays from the illumination system to the measured area. The illumination 
angle is the angle between the illumination direction and the reference plane. In the standard 
measuring condition, the observation angle ‹ shall be 2.29°± 0.05, the illumination angle 
shall be 1.24°± 0.05 and the angle between the two vertical planes containing respectively 
the observation and the illumination direction shall be 0°±0.05. The total angular spread of 
the measuring directions shall not exceed 0.33°. The total angular spread of the illumination 
directions shall not exceed 0.33° in the plane parallel to the reference plane and 0.17° in the 
plane perpendicular to the reference plane.
Note 1: The standard measuring condition is intended to simulate a visual distance of 30 m for the 
driver of a passenger car with an eye height of 1.2 m and a headlamp mounting height of 
0.65 m above the road.
Note 2: For some instruments, compliance with the standard measuring condition can be tested by 
putting steady light through the optical systems of the photometer and the illumination system, 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:35-2015
134
and observing the transmitted beams. Putting light through the optical systems needs to be 
done in consultation with the supplier of the instrument and according to his instructions.
Practical Applications of Measuring Equipment
The measuring equipment shall have sufficient sensitivity and range to accommodate RL 
values expected in use, typically 1 mcd/m2/lx to 2000 mcd/m2/lux. The linearity over the range 
of RL values expected in use shall be adequate for the purpose.
The sensitivity, range and linearity of portable instruments may be tested by means of suitable 
samples. Portable instruments are used in conditions of full daylight and shall be constructed 
so that readings are not affected by ambient light in these conditions. Some instruments may 
need to inform the operators by warnings or error messages, if necessary.
Offset by stray light in daylight conditions may be tested by measurement in full daylight, 
where readings obtained without additional cover of an instrument are compared to readings 
obtained with additional cover by a black cloth or other obstructions about the instrument. 
Portable instruments are used to measure wet road marking surfaces, whose RL values might 
be small, while surface reflections are strong. Portable instruments shall be constructed, or 
compensated, so that surface reflections are not provoking offset of the readings. Sensitivity 
to surface reflections may be tested by measurement of a black acrylic plate with a smooth, 
clean surface, whose RL value is naught. Portable instruments may be tilted and shifted in 
height relative to the road marking surface because of texture and curve of road markings 
on the road, particles on the surface and structure of structured road markings. For fixed-aim 
instruments, the sensitivity to tilts and shifts shall be tested by shifting the height position H 
of the instrument parallel to a road marking sample and simultaneously moving the sample 
horizontally so that the measured area stays in the same location on the sample surface. 
The movement of the sample is by H/sin2.29°= 25.H for Method A and by H/sin1.24°= 46.H 
for method B. The measured RL value shall not change by more than ±10 percent, when the 
height position is shifted from 0 mm to -1 mm, 1 mm and 2 mm.
Other height positions may be included to demonstrate the ability of an instrument to measure 
road markings with extreme texture, in particular structured road markings.
Note :	 When an instrument is able to perform at a height position H, it is able to measure structured 
road markings when the structure height is at most H or the gaps between structures is at 
most 25.H. Aiming instruments shall meet the same requirements, but verification has to be 
according to the construction of the instruments.
Calibration of Measuring Equipment
For laboratory equipment, direct calibration is obtained by mounting the photometer at the 
reference centre, with an orientation towards the illumination system, and measuring the 
reading illumination. This reading is several decades larger than typical readings during 
measurement, and accordingly the linearity of the photometer shall be verified over the full 
range. Indirect calibration by means of a standard sample with a known RL value, measured 
with direct calibration or with another traceable calibration technique, may be preferable. 
A sample in the form of a tilted white ceramic surface is particularly suitable. A portable

IRC:35-2015
135
instrument shall be calibrated by means of a traceable standard sample with a known RL 
value. Independent calibration of the standard sample shall be possible. A transfer standard 
may be used for routine tests of the calibration in order to avoid frequent handling of the 
standard in road conditions.
Note A :	
Standard with a tilted surface to be used for Method B needs to be assigned the value 
	
of sin 1.24°/sin 2.29° = 0.542 times the measured RL value. For vehicle mounted 
	
instruments, it is permissible to use calibrated portable instruments for field calibration 
	
provided that the portable instrument in use is calibrated with a traceable standard.
Condition of Wetness
The test condition shall be created using clean water poured from a bucket from a height 
of about 0.3 m above the surface. The water is poured evenly along the test surface so 
that a crest of water momentarily floods the measuring field and its surrounding area. The 
coefficient of retro-reflected luminance RL in condition of wetness shall be measured under 
the test condition after the water has been poured. The amount of water to be poured at one 
location is at least 3 litres. The test condition can also be created (60 ± 5) after stopping the 
artificial rain.
Note
	
1	
The test condition is not applicable for newly applied road markings, when the surface 
	
is hydrophobic so that water forms puddles on the surface. The hydrophobic surface 
	
property normally disappears a few weeks after a road marking is applied.
	
2	
In hot, sunny weather the road surface may be so hot that the road surface dries out 
	
very quickly. It helps to pour water on the road surface more than once to cool it 
	
down.
If portable equipment is cool after transport, dew will form on its optics when placing it on a 
hot, wet road surface. The portable equipment should be allowed to warm up and the road 
surface should be cooled down.
Uncertainty of Measurement
Note
	
1	
The concept of ‘uncertainty of measurement’ is the overall concept that involves both 
	
trueness (and bias) and precision (repeatability or reproducibility). Some level of 
	
trueness can be assured indirectly by use of measuring equipment. Precision can be 
	
determined by conventional means according to the definitions.
	
2	
Ideally, trueness could be established by means of road marking panels with accepted 
	
reference values measured in laboratory conditions. However, laboratory measurements 
	
are not presently sufficiently developed.
Accordingly, uncertainty of measurement can be addressed in the following steps:
	
●	
calibration;
	
●	
ability to cope with practical conditions including applicability for structured 
pavement markings;
	
●	
compliance with the standard measuring condition;
	
●	
spectral match including applicability in terms of colours of road markings;
	
●	
precision (repeatability and reproducibility).



======================================================================
PAGE 146 of 156
======================================================================
IRC:35-2015
136
Suppliers/producers of measuring equipment shall account for each of these steps in such a 
way that the range of applicability and the uncertainty of measurement within this range can 
be addressed:
	
●	
the uncertainty of calibration shall be accounted for with reference or 
traceability to a calibration standard with an accepted reference value;
	
●	
an instruction shall be available regarding use of equipment in practical 
conditions, in particular for use on structured road markings;
	
●	
these and other steps shall be accounted for on the basis of independent test 
reports to the widest possible extent.
Conditions of wetness cause additional uncertainty. According to tests carried out by CEN/
TC 226 WG2, the repeatability (95 %) of the condition of wetness is approximately 5 mcd/m2/
lx for wet road markings with RL values up to 60 mcd/m-2/lx-1.
Procedure for the In-Situ Testing of Retroreflection using Handheld Devices
General
This procedure is recommended for the use of handheld equipment as described in the 
procedure BS EN 1436. Avoid moving the instrument whenever there are large temperature 
changes. If necessary, ensure that the instrument is effectively shielded from direct sunlight. 
For longitudinal lines, position the equipment so that its light source shines in the same 
direction as a vehicle’s headlights would. Measurements on other road markings (such as 
symbols, letters etc.) should be taken, wherever appropriate, in the general direction from 
approaching vehicles. All markings to be measured should be free from dirt and completely 
dry. A suitable brush should be used to remove loose dirt and/or loose glass beads prior to 
testing. Safety must be given prime consideration during this type of operation. Constant 
attention must be given to the safety of the operator and of other road users.
Selection of the Test Area
Choose an area of marking which appears representative of the total area to be assessed.

137
Number of Readings
For continuous lines, take 15 readings over a 5 metre section minimum. If the marking is a 
centre line, take 15 readings with the equipment facing in each direction. For intermittent 
lines, take 5 readings per mark for 3 consecutive marks. Note readings should not be taken 
at the very beginning or end of the line. For markings wider than 150 mm, take readings 
down the central axis of the line but including some “off-centre” also. Take care to ensure that 
any such “off-centre” measurements are still made within the confines of the marking. For 
other markings, such as symbols, letters, transverse marking lines, reading should be taken 
at 5 approximately equidistant points on the surface of the marking. If a particular reading 
appears inconsistent another reading, that reading should be taken.
Recording and Interpretation of Results
A survey report for each location should be produced. Information to be included in the report 
should be as follows:

Calculate an average of all the readings for a particular area. Readings for individual marks 
should be “sub-totalled” before being combined.
Optional Measurement of Retroreflectivity in Condition of Wetness
In addition to the measurement method for the retro reflectivity, RL, of dry markings, 
EN 1436 also includes inspection methods for “condition of wetness”. The inspection method 
for “condition of wetness” is as follows:
The test condition is created using clean water poured from a bucket with an approximate 
capacity of 10 litres and from a height of approximately 0.5 m above the surface so that the 
measuring field and its surrounding area is momentarily flooded by a crest of water. The retro 
reflectivity shall be measured under the test condition one minute after the water has been 
poured.

MEASURING METHOD FOR SKID RESISTANCE
Principle of the Test
The test equipment consists of a swinging pendulum fitted with a rubber slider at its free end. 
The energy loss caused by the friction of the slider over a specified length of the road surface 
is measured and the result is expressed as Skid Resistance Tester (SRT) units.
Note :	 The Skid Resistance Tester simulates the performance of a vehicle with patterned tyres 
braking with blocked wheels at 50 km/h on a wet road.
Description of the Skid Resistance Tester
The skid resistance tester consists of a base with three levelling screws, a vertical column 
with a 508 mm pendulum of 1.5 kg mass, with a spring loaded rubber slider mounted on 
the end, giving a constant force of 22.2 N on the test surface. On the column, control knobs 
permit the vertical movement of the suspension axis. The operator is provided with means 
for holding and releasing the pendulum arm so that it falls freely from a horizontal position. 
A 300 mm long pointer indicates the position of the pendulum throughout its forward swing 
and indicates the measured value on a circular scale. Two friction rings are used to bring the 
result to the zero of this scale for a completely free swing of the pendulum arm.
Maintenance of the Rubber Slider
The rubber slider is of dimensions 76.2 mm, 25.4 mm and 6.3 mm and shall be made from 
rubber with the properties given in Table A-G:1.

The slider can only be used for one year after the date mentioned on its side face. One slider 
edge can be used for at least 100 settings (500 swings). The wear of the edge should not 
exceed 3.2 mm horizontal and 1.6 mm vertical as shown in Figure. All new sliders should 
be roughened by swinging 5 times on a dry surface and 25 times on a wet surface (after 
adjusting the sliding length to 125 mm to 127 mm).

Maximum Wear of the Rubbber Slider
Adjustment of the Sliding Length
Prior to measurement, the sliding length shall be adjusted as follows:
Ensure that the base of the apparatus is level, with the central column in front of the centre 
of the area under test. Raise the head so that the pendulum arm swings free of the surface 
and check the zero setting in this position. If necessary adjust the setting using the friction 
rings so that the pointer reading is zero. Check the sliding length (to be between 125 mm and 
127 mm) by gently lowering the pendulum arm until it touches the surface on one side. Place 
the spacer so that the outer mark on the side corresponds with the contact line between the 
rubber and the surface. Raise the slider off the surface by means of the lifting handle, move 
it without friction to the other side and then gently lower onto the surface again. The contact 
line should be between the two marks on that side of the spacer. Adjust by raising or lowering 
the head. When the required height is obtained, lock the head and place the pendulum in its 
release position.
Measuring the SRT Value
The SRT value shall be measured as follows:
The surface under test shall be cleaned with a smooth wet brush. Place the pendulum arm in 
its release position and the pointer in line with it. Wet the surface by applying 100 ml ± 20 ml 
of water on the contact area, release the arm immediately after applying the water and, after 
the maximum has been reached, catch the pendulum on its return swing with the left hand 
to avoid damage by striking the road surface. Read the position of the pointer. Replace the 
arm and the pointer in the release position. Repeat the same measurement five times. If the 
values obtained do not differ by more than 3 units, record the mean of the five readings as the 
SRT value. Otherwise, repeat the test until three successive readings are constant. Record 
the temperature of the water lying on the road just after the measurement.
Correction for the Temperature
The effect of temperature on rubber resilience exerts a perceptible influence in all skidding 
resistance measurements; it shows itself as a fall in skidding resistance as the temperature 
rises. In addition, the magnitude of the variation of skidding resistance with temperature 
varies considerably from road to road, because of the changes in road surface texture. As a

rough guide however, an average temperature correction evaluated for a range of surfaces 
is given in figure D2; thus it is apparent that a correction for the effect of the temperature 
only becomes important for tests made below 10ºC, and then its main use is to give a more 
accurate assessment of the skidding resistance which the road is likely to offer to the tyres 
of vehicles, since they are likely to be running at temperatures rather higher than that of the 
slider rubber on the portable tester.
Temperature Corrections for Skid Resistance Values to Allow for Changes in  
Resilience of the Slider Rubber
To assist in the interpretation of the results, the temperature of the water lying on the road 
immediately after test should be recorded. It should be stressed that the change in state of 
polish of road surfaces throughout the year is a much bigger factor determining changes in skid 
resistance than is the change in temperature; the latter accounts for about one-quarter of the 
total seasonal change in skid resistance, which is primarily due to real and reversible changes 
in the road surface. In order to have an idea of the influence of all variable parameters such 
as temperature, slider wear etc., both before and after a series of measurements, the skid 
measurement should be conducted with the same slider on one or more standard samples, 
the value of which has previously been determined in the laboratory at 20ºC.
Note :	 The trueness of a measurement cannot be established as the characteristic is defined by the 
Skid Resistance Tester itself and not by physical laws.
