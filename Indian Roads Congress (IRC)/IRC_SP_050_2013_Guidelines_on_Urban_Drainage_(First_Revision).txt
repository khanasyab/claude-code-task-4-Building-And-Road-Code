GUIDELINES ON URBAN DRAINAGE
BACKGROUND
The Guidelines for Urban Drainage was first published
in 1999. With the change
in urban
infrastructural concepts and
introduction
of new transportation
infrastructures
like metro
rails,
multilevel interchanges, elevated
corridors, the Urban Roads Streets and Transport
Committee (H-8) felt the need of revising the Guidelines to meet the challenges of future. Asub-
committee comprising S/Shri R. Jai Prasad, R.K. Jaigopal and Dr. B.R Bagish prepared the
draft revision of IRC:SP:50 'Guidelines on Urban Drainage' which has been deliberated since
2009.The H-8 Committee discussed the draft in series of meetings and approved the same in
its meeting held on 29*^ September, 2012 for placing before the Highways Specifications and
Standards Committee. The HSS Committee approved the draft document in its meeting held
on
IS**" December 2012 for placing before the Council. Finally the Council in
its meeting held
at Coimbatore (Tamil Nadu) on 8*^ January, 201 3 considered and approved the draft document
subject to incorporation of comments of the Council Members. Accordingly, H-8 Committee
again discussed and approved the draft document in
its meeting held on 2""^ March, 2013 for
placing before the HSS Committee. The Highways Specifications and Standards Committee
(HSS) in
its meeting held on 19'^ July, 2013 approved the document for publishing.

IRC:SP:50-2013
1 INTRODUCTION
1.1
Urban drainage
is an
integral part of road network for disposal of surface and
subsurface water to designated
locations.
Structural
integrity of road mainly depends on
effective and efficient disposal of storm water. The increased volume and velocity of runoff
being caused by increased impervious urban development of the city can easily overwhelm
the existing conventional drainage systems of the city. Decentralized stormwater management
along streets and
public places
in
different locations shall help
in
mitigating problems of
flooding and water logging on the roads.
Urban drainage system
is to be designed such that, they capture the storm water runoff,
from the road surface and right-of-way and infiltrate
it into the ground closest to the source,
where
it is falling. In case, there is lack of space,
it should be conveyed along the right-of-way
and discharged at receiving body,
in addition to infiltrate
it in to below ground at designated
locations only. The load on drainage
will reduce,
if infiltration
into ground
is effective. The
infiltration shall happen even while conveying and disposing effectively, and will also recharge
the depleting ground water table which is alarmingly going low due to intensive urbanization,
paving of roads and private properties.
The urban drainage can be detailed into:
)
Road surface drainage
i)
Sub soil drainage
ii)
Infiltration into the ground for recharging of ground water table.
v)
Disposal of storm water.
)
Road surface drainage:
It is an important factor to remove all the water from
road surface at the least possible time, so that structural integrity of overall
cross-section of the road is maintained, good riding quality of road will enable
in saving vehicle operation cost,
if surface runoff, of rain water
is efficient.
The study of pavement drainage for both flexible and
rigid pavements has
resulted
in arriving at a decision that the construction shall be treated as a
series of permeable layers and added precautions are necessary to protect
the sub-grade. All structural elements of road from wearing coat to sub-grade,
footpath
etc.
will deteriorate leading to major maintenance,
if efficiency of
disposal system is inadequate. One major cause of pothole formation on road
surface
is due to inadequate storm water disposal mechanism.
In the event
of road profile
is not constructed with necessary camber and maintained to
desired standards, the disposal of rain water will not be quick and efficient,
resulting in pooling of water on the carriageway, deteriorating the pavement
cross-section, leading to skidding, hydroplaning or splashing of water, which
will result in causing inconvenience to other vehicloo in addition to self-driven
vehicle, causing accidents.

IRC:SP:50-2013
ii)
Sub soil drainage: Most of the sub
soil drainage locations are localized.
This water
shall be
collected
by subsurface drainage systems which
in
turn discharge into a drainage system clear of road formation. Methods of
investigation for estimating rates of surface water infiltration ground water
levels and flows form an important part of the engineering of a drainage
system. Use of self draining materials and
introduction of membrane has
helped control the migration of fine particles from sub-grade specially while
pumping, as
relatively small migration of fines from sub-grade
into voids
in the sub-base can seriously reduce the capacity of the sub-base to act
as a lateral drain. The sub soil drainage shall be sustainable for stability of
pavement within design parameters. Highest precaution shall be exercised
when water logged soil below sub-grade may cause serious damage to the
road crust.
iii)
Infiltration into the ground for recharging of ground water table: The
storm water disposal system will be highly efficient,
if infiltration into the ground
is made a part of urban drainage. The primary advantage will be reduction
in quantum of water at final disposal location. Secondary advantage will be
recharging urban ground water which is depleting at alarming rate. Infiltration
of storm water shall commence at street drains and shall be continued
all
along conveying system. Different suitable mechanisms shall be adopted for
infiltrations,
like providing
filter mediums of certain length or providing
filter
bed
at alternate junctions
etc.
Infiltration
will also take place at detention
and retention facilities where storm water can be controlled qualitatively and
quantitatively.
In the present state of rapid
urbanization,
this method
will
assume greater significance
in the Indian content as storm water needs to
be conserved while
it is made to run off.
iv)
Disposal of acceptable quality of water:
In the present scenario of rapid
urbanization,
the
adverse
impact
of development
activity
needs
to
be
mitigated. Urban storm water management practice has to be employed for
benefit of storm water control and pollutant removal capabilities. Water quality
practices shall be adopted of acceptable standards while disposing
off of
storm water. Generally, urban storm water management practice shall adopt
high pollutant removal for non soluble particles pollutants such as suspended
sediments.
In the global scenario of recycling of available water, continuous
disposal of contaminated water will seriously jeoparadise the availability of
potable water. In such circumstances, addition of recycled water to available
fresh water is becoming a popular option and
is
in existence
in a few parts
of the world. All possible efforts shall be made for continuous and constant
removal of pollutants in the drainage system. All available open tanks, parks,
nearby quarry pits shall be modernized effectively and utilized as detention
and retention ponds and new additional ponds
in the flow stream shall be
created and added.
3



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 124
======================================================================
IRC:SP:50-2013
Urbanization of any locality and population needs well engineered surface
and subsurface drainage system.
In the present day context of depletion of
water table, the storm water drainage shall be effectively utilized for ground
water charging. Water from the road flows to the road side drain through inlets
and gratings. For effective drainage, this should join the peripheral drains,
which in turn should join the main or trunk drain for ultimate discharge to the
natural drain or detention facility or retention facility. Storm water drainage,
needs to take into account alignments, levels on ground and outfall levels.
Existing drains pass through highly developed and thickly populated areas. As
such, there may be a problem of availability of land for increasing capacity of
drains, further. Also, the problem of availability of land, for effective disposal
of storm water, may not be possible due to non availability of further land.
Besides these, drains shall be able to cater to the increased discharge due
to continuous addition of new colonies and urbanization.
In such situations,
the most effective method of disposal of storm water would be by way of
disposal
into permeable strata of ground at
all possible locations
in drain
itself or at vertical drains specially built for the purpose. An important aspect
of drain
is to ensure a good velocity in the drain not only when the drain
is
flowing
full but also when the drain
is
partially
full.
Usually,
silt and other
materials collect in the bed
in large quantities and necessary silt traps shall
be designed
at frequent
intervals for periodic removal
of the same. The
design needs to be made to ensure self cleaning velocity during dominant
and lean flow conditions.
In most of the urban areas,
responsibility
for design and construction
of
peripheral and trunk drainage system rests with
local bodies,
i.e., Bruhat
Nagara
Palike, Nagara
Palike,
Municipalities
etc., while that of the road
side drain with the road
construction agency
like PWD.
For an
effective
implementation
of
drainage
system,
proper
co-ordination
between
all
concerned agencies is compulsory.
v)
Poor Drainage results
in losses, direct and indirect in the form of damaged
roads, reduced serviceability and serious health hazards to general public.
Greater awareness
on
the
subject
is
visible.
Importance
of
planning,
organization, fund allocation and monitoring
is taking place among urban
conglomerates in recent times in the country. Need has been felt to modernize
and update the drainage system. There are serious efforts made towards
identification and separation of sewerage drains and storm water drains.
Immediate and all out efforts are required to separate these two drains or else
environment will seriously and permanently be damaged leading to urban
catastrophe. This will be important and serious issue for environmentalists.
Under no circumstances, sewerage shall be allowed to flow
in storm water
drains in any part of urban areas.

IRC:SP:50-2013
Keeping in view a large scale development in urban front in the country and
keeping
in pace with higher improvement
in economic growth relatively to
earlier decades coupled with large scale importance given to this sector by
the Government,
it is felt that the earlier publication IRC:SP:50-1999 needs
revision. Drainage and urban roads require to deal with complex situations
and parameters in the present changed context.
It is, therefore, felt necessary
to bring out detailed guidelines dealing with drainage of urban roads.
2 SCOPE
The guidelines covered under this revised
publication deal with drainage of urban roads
running through plain and rolling areas. The details covered
in the revision are the influence
of road features, drainage of surface, subsurface and drainage
at special
locations
like
rotaries, vehicular underpasses, parking
lots,
etc. Design aspects of storm water drains,
detention and retention facilities for disposal of storm water are covered. Details of pumping
have been dealt separately. Due to rapid urbanization,
infiltration of rain water into the sub
soil has decreased
drastically and
recharging
of ground water has diminished.
Special
emphasis on ground water recharging and rain water harvesting
is laid and a new chapter
is now included. Urban water quality requirements while final disposal of storm water is also
covered. Enforcement for maintenance of drains
is added as a separate chapter due to
its prime importance. A new chapter on geographical information system has been added
for better planning of storm water drains. The drainage of rural section of roads,
hill roads,
airfield pavements and cross drainage have not been covered under these guidelines since
separate guidelines in 1RC:SP:42-1994 on these subjects have been published.
3 ROAD SURFACE DRAINAGE
3.1
Traffic safety and service condition
of road pavement can be maintained only
if effective road drainage exists. Water on the pavement can reduce skid resistance, can
interrupt traffic,
limit visibility due to splash and spray, increase potential for hydroplaning,
and cause difficulty in driving of vehicle. Due to slow precipitation of water and pooling on the
carriageway resulting
in restricted width and carrying capacity, inturn leading to congestion
and slow movement of traffic after showers.
The total road drainage composes of surfr'ce drainage, flow
in the drains and capacity of
inlets. The design of these elements depends on storm frequency and allowable spread of
storm water on pavement surface. This chapter elaborates on guidance to these elements.
3.2
Surface Drainage
The rain water travels as unsteady non uniform sheet flow from middle of pavement to the
edge of pavement. Factors influencing the depth of water on pavement are the flow of path
length, surface texture, surface slope and
rainfall
intensity. Design guidelines on existing
parameters for the following drainage elements are essential.

3.2.1
Longitudinal gradient of pavement
The minimum
longitudinal gradient
is governed by drainage considerations of pavement.
This minimum longitudinal gradient
is more important for a kerbed pavement than for an
unkerbed pavement. On unkerbed pavements near level longitudinal gradients may not be
objectionable, when the pavement has sufficient camber to drain
rain water
laterally. For
effective and efficient internal drainage of pavement layers, especially for granular materials,
at least a minimum gradient is essentiai. Also,
in cut sections and medians, a slight gradient
is desirable to facilitate the removal of water. Desirable longitudinal gradients shall not be
less than 0.50 percent for pavements for satisfactory drainage.
A minimum longitudinal gradient of 0.30 percent is necessary to facilitate flow of water in side
drains. With outlets example
like bridges, culverts, ponds, nallas are provided at required
interval to restrict the depth of drains.
3.2.2
Transverse gradient of pavement/camber
The transverse gradients are compromise between the need for reasonably steep gradients
for drainage and
relatively flat gradients for driver comfort and safety. For quick dispersal
of precipitation on the road surface,
it would be necessary that water has to travel
least
distance through reasonably steep cross slope. However from the consideration of comfort to
traffic, steep cross slope is objectionable. As such, a judicious balance is required to be kept
between the two requirements. Cross slopes of 2 percent have
little effect on driver comfort
in steering or on friction for vehicle stability. The use of cross slope exceeding 2 percent on
pavements with a central crown
line
is not desirable.
In areas of intense rainfall, a steeper
cross slope of 2.5 percent may be adopted for effective drainage. However in surfaces like
graveled or WBM cross slope ranging between 2.5 to 3.0 percent can be considered.
For urban roads having divided carriage way, the camber
is unidirectional away from the
median. A few typical cross sections are shown in Fig. 3.1 & 3.2 (a) (b) (c) & (d).
In case of super elevated sections, either gap in the central verge with suitable adjustments
in the levels of the two carriageways or in extreme cases, central drainage arrangement is
resorted to. Schematic arrangement is shown in Fig. 3.1.

When the road is in gradient, the flow of rain water is governed by the resultant slope produced
by longitudinal and cross slope.
In such case,
in order that water travels the least distance
on road surface (more the distance more is the quantity of sheet flow causing hydroplaning),
the camber should be 0.7 of the longitudinal gradient or the camber values specified
in the
following table for a particular road surface whichever
is higher.
In other words, on steep
gradients on long length of road, the camber should be increased to get satisfactory drainage
conditions.
Special care
is also required
in detailing the valley curves so that such locations do not
collect water.
IRC:86 "Geometric Design Standards for Urban Roads in Plains" recommends that camber
or cross slope on straight sections of roads as given in Table 3.1
.
Table 3.1
: Cross Fall/Camber Values for Different Road Surface Types
Surface Type
Cross fall/Camber
Graveled or WBM surface
Thin bituminous surfacing
High type bituminous surfacing or cement
concrete surfacing
2.5 to 3 percent
2 to 2.5 percent
1 .7 to 2 percent
"
Note
:
Higher value of camber should be adopted
in areas with high
intensity of rainfall and
where ponding
is expected due to any reason. Steeper camber should also be provided
on kerbed pavements to minimize the spread of surface water.

======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 124

IRC:SP:50-2013
Additional guidelines to transverse gradients are suggested as below:
i)
Although not widely encouraged,
inside lanes can be sloped towards the
median
if conditions warrant.
ii)
Median areas should not be drained across travel lanes as far as possible.
iii)
The number of length of the flat pavement sections in cross slope transition
areas shall be minimized. Consideration shall be given to increasing cross
slopes
in sag vertical curves, cross vertical curves and
in sections of flat
longitudinal grades.
iv)
Shoulders shall be sloped to drain away from the pavement, except with
raised, narrow medians and super elevations.
3.2.3
Hydroplaning
When water level increases on the road, the drainage capacity of the tyre tread pattern and
pavement surface is exceeded and the water begins to build up in front of tyre, the occurrence
of this phenomenon
is called hydroplaning. The potential for hydroplaning increases, when
the depth of water flowing over a roadway surface increases. When a rolling tyre encounters
a film of water on the roadway, the water
is channeled through the tyre tread pattern and
through the surface roughness of the pavement. As the water builds up, a water wedge
is
created and this wedge produces a hydrodynamic force which can lift the tyre off the pavement
surface. This
is considered as
full dynamic hydroplaning and since water offers
little shear
resistance, the tyre losses
in tractive ability resulting
in loss of control of the vehicle. There
is also loss of stability of the vehicle. Hydroplaning can occur at speeds of 80-90 kmph with
a water depth of 2 mm.
Hydroplaning
is a function of water depth, roadway geometries, vehicle speed, tread depth,
tyre inflation pressure and conditions of pavement surface. The driver is responsible for using
caution and good judgment when driving
in wet conditions similar to as when driving on
snow. In problematic areas, hydroplaning may be reduced by the following:
i)
Designing the highway geometries to reduce the drainage path length of the
water flowing over the pavement, which will prevent build up of flow.
ii)
Increasing the pavement surface texture depth, by such methods as grooving
of cement concrete. An increase of pavement surface texture will increase
the drainage capacity at the tyre - pavement interface.
iii)
Certain developed countries are adopting porous bituminous layer by which
water gets percolated from the surface and drains out from sides. This could
be tried in our country with effective supervision during lying. See also figure
in Chapter-10, 10.1(vi) (b).
iv)
The effective use of drainage structures along the roadway will reduce the
thickness of film of water while flowing over the pavement and reduce the
hydroplaning potential of the roadway surface.

Roadside gutter and inlets
For shoulders along unkerbed pavement the cross fall should be at least 0.5 percent steeper
than that of the pavement subject to the minimum values given below:
WBM surface
3 percent
Gravel surface
4 percent
Earth surface
5 percent
In addition,
it is necessary that shoulders are not higher than adjoining pavement surface to
prevent pooling of water at the edge of carriage way and for quick drainage.
For paved footpaths a cross-fall of 3 to 4 percent should be adopted sloping away from the
carriage way. For verges and unpaved areas cross-fall should be 4 to 6 percent.
Precipitation from the road surface flows towards outer edge of carriageway (except where
central drainage arrangement has been provided) in to shoulder drain where kerb and footpaths
are provided. The roadside gutter and inlets shall be a minimum of 600 mm wide with internal
smooth finish and shall have a minimum transverse slope of
1
in 6. The longitudinal slope
of roadside gutter and
inlets
is guided by the road gradient.
In reaches where there
is no
longitudinal gradient in the road, roadside gutter and inlets shall slope away from kerb inlet
or bell mouths. The roadside gutter and inlets discharge its flow in to road side drains. All due
care shall be taken to geometrically design the drain for its easy maintenance. The spacing
may require to be placed depending upon the longitudinal gradient of the road. The inlets
could be grated kerb, combined grated kerb, sag point inlet with outflanking inlets
The spacing of inlets depends on condition of road surface
size and type of inlet and rainfall.
They shall be provided at closer intervals near junctions and valley curves; however maximum
spacing shall not be more than 30 m.
The road side drains can be constructed out of any locally available materials like bricks, size
stones, solid blocks or RCC (where slender walls are required and combined
utility ducts
can be provided), wee
holes at regular intervals to cut down the water table and drain the
subgrade water are to be provided.
The alignment of roadside gu
ar and inlets underneath the sidewalk shall be in th
^ direction
of flow of water during storm for efficient discharge as shown in Fig. 3.2.4 (a).

DIRECTION OF FLOW
Fig. 3.2.4 (a) Inclination of Roadside Gutter and Inlets with Respect of Flow in Pavement
The shoulder drains shall generally be spaced at longer intervals upto 50 m in level grounds
and at closer intervals upon 5 m
in saddle areas and junctions. The shoulder drains in high
intensity traffic areas shall be upto 3 m in regions like Mumbai. The shoulder drains can also
be of NP3 pipes of circular, horse shoe, elliptical shapes
The nnedian walls shall be taken for considerable depth upto subgrade level of road so that
water does not seep into base or sub base layers of pavements.
In locations where carriageway slopes towards median, as may be the case where road
is
in curve, necessary openings shall be provided
in the median for smooth passage of water
from one lane to other and to onwards side drain. The determination of median crossings for
drainage requires good engineering judgment. These crossings are governed by hydraulic
as well as non-hydraulic considerations.
In curves, the median acts as an obstruction to flow of storm water towards inside of curve
leading to flooding of the outer carriageway. A median opening shall be provided from outer
to inner edge of median. See Fig. 3.2.4 (a) & Fig. 3.2.4 (b)
The provision
of median openings
at ?uper elevation and curves
in divided carriageway
shall be for and upto two lanes
is shown
in Fig. 3.2.4 (b) and Photo 3.2.4 {a). When each
carriageway
is three
lane
or mere, then
a
drain
shall be
introduced below the median
and
inturn connected
to
lower
level
drain
by a minimum 600mm
dia NP3
pipes. See
Fig. 3.2.4 (c).

Bridge deck drainage
Bridge deck drainage
will be relatively less efficient than road way drainage due to flatter
cross slopes, gutters collect large amount of debris and drainage spouts are less hydraulically
efficient and more easily clogged by
silt and debris. Because of the difficulties
in providing
for and maintaining adequate deck draining systems, side drain flow from road ways shall
be intercepted before
it reaches the bridge. For similar reasons, zero gradients and sag
vertical curves shall be avoided on bridges. Additionally, runoff from bridge decks shall be
collected immediately through drainage sprouts with gratings after it flows into the subsequent
pavement section where larger grates and inlet structures limiting to shy distance shall cater
for effective end
point drainage. Splashing of collected water on vehicles moving on the
bridge will result in reduced visibility and cause accidents. Each pier shall have a drainage
disposal pipe designed for the area of disposal for immediate discharge of rain water from
bridge deck.

Drainage of high embankment
In
high embankments and approaches
to
bridges,
if the water
is allowed
to leave the
carriageway at undefined spots,
it may cause serious damages to the embankment and
eventually undermines the pavement.
In each
location
rain water
is
collected
in
small
manageable quantities through longitudinal kerb channel and brought down through stepped
chutes without damage. The chutes may be lined with cement concrete on stable supports and
may be located at 10 to 15 m intervals depending upon the rainfall and width of carriageway.
Stepped outfall may be used
in place of chutes. Typical drainage arrangement and typical
chute sections and energy
potential
construction
of steps
or simple energy
dissipation
structures may need to be provided and the same
is shown
in Fig. 3.2.6. For protection of
slopes between chutes. IRC:SP:42 "Guidelines on Road Drainages".
The recent trend of providing earth reinforced walls instead of retaining walls to approaches
of bridges and flyovers has eliminated the high earthen, wide embankment at base and
have efficient drainage system. The storm water reaches the approaches which required to
be provided with catch drain as
in case of subways. Arrangement shown

Relationship between Impervisioness and Surface Runoff
The urbanization has resulted
in
all types of construction
activities primarily paved roads,
lined drains, which were earlier acting as pervious natural surface. Due to the reduction of
infiltration owing to urbanization causing increased volume of runoff, surfaces are also smooth
there by allowing more rapid drainage and ground water storage
is usually reduced. The
natural drainage systems are also replaced by lined channels, storm water drains and kerb
and gutter systems. This system produces an increase in runoff volume and peak discharge,
as well as reduction
in time to reach peak runoff.
4.1
Design Strategies for Stormwater Drainage System
Storm water can be managed by adopting following measures
There are three main principles to follow sustainable storm water management:
1 )
D.sconnecting the flow of storm water from the conventional pipe system and
using all possible alternate areas for recharge.

4.1.1
Filtration
Prevents
sediments
and
other
materials
from
reacining
and
clogging
downstream facilities.
The slow movement
of runoff through
vegetation
or gravel
provides an
opportunity
for sediments and
particulates
to
be
filtered and
degraded
through biological activity.
In
draining
soils,
the
filters also provides an opportunity for storm water
infiltration, which further removes pollutants and reduces runoff volumes.
These are especially applicable to parking lots and along highways as they
can be sloped into linear grass or rock swales to collect and treat runoff from
pavement surfaces. Adjacent pavement level should be slightly higher than
the filtration area.
Filtration can include rock and vegetated swales, filter strips or buffers, sand
filters.
infiltration
In the present scenario of depleted ground water
in urban conglomerates
all storm water
drains shall be efficiently utilized for the benefit of raising the existing ground water table.
This can be achieved by redesigning the existing drainage cross sections in such a way that
storm water starts
infiltration
into ground at street level drain
itself and continued through
tertiary drains, secondary drains and primary drains. (Refer chapter 6 for classification of
drains).
Before the ultimate disposal of rain water all possible methods shall be adopted for ground
water recharging as ground water has depleted beyond 250 m in certain urban cities.
It shall
be commendable
if ground water recharging starts at initial point of side drain of road
itself.
By the time storm water moves through tertiary, secondary and primary drains which shall
have ground water recharging facilities, major quantity of storm water will get into the ground
facilitating effective disposal system.

Conveyance
Conveyance systems help storm water runoff to capture, convey, and potentially
infiltrate
before
it moves downstream.
Types of Conveyance systems are:
a)
Bioswale
: See Fig. 4.5 (a) (1) and 4.5 (a) (2)
•
A bioswale
is a modified swale that uses bio retention media to improve
water quality, reduce the runoff volume, and modulate the peak runoff rate
while also providing conveyance of excess runoff.
•
The bio swale typically has water tolerant vegetation permanently growing in
the retained body of water.
•
Uses biological process to remove a variety of pollutants
•
Provides storm water treatment and conveyance
•
Can be part of infrastructure within transportation Right of Way
•
Can be a landscape feature

•
Planters are contained landscape areas designed to capture and retain storm
water runoff.
•
Infiltration & Flow-through planters are structural landscaped reservoirs used
to collect, filter, and infiltrate stormwater runoff.
•
They allow pollutants to settle and filter out as the water percolates through
the planter soil and infiltrates into the ground.
•
Flow rates and volumes can also be managed with infiltration planters.

The storm water released has to be controlled quantitatively and qualitatively by a temporary
storage which
is also called as detention/retention
facility. Previous concepts which called
for the rapid removal of storm water runoff from developed areas, usually by downstream
channelization, are now being combined with methods for storing storm water runoff to
prevent over loading of existing downstream drainage systems. The storage of storm water
can reduce the frequency and extent of downstream flooding,
soil erosion, sedimentation
and water pollution. Worldwide, detention and retention facilities have been used to reduce
the cost of large storm water drainage systems by reducing the required size for downstream
storm water drain conveyance systems. The use
of detention or retention
facilities can
reduce peak discharge from any watershed. The main objective of storm water management
is to maintain the peak runoff rate from flooding, soil erosion, sedimentation and importantly
prevention of pollution of ground water.
A detention facility is a storm water storage which can gradually release or weaken the force
of runoff by way of a control structure or any similar mechanism. The retention
facility
is
storage of storm water runoff and release via evaporation and infiltration only.
In the Indian scenario
all the open tanks
in urban
limits and extended urban
limits where
storm water is being released can be effectively used as detention or retention facilities with
necessary modifications. Important thing to bear in mind here is sewerage drains shall not be
mixed up with storm water drains.
5 STORM WATER DRAINAGE SYSTEM AND APPURTENANCE
5.1
Classification of Urban Storm Water Drains
Drainage in the urban context is classified briefly as:
a)
Primary Drains
b)
Secondary Drains
c)
Tertiary Drains
Primary Drains: These are
natural drainage systems connecting series of major water
bodies' upto disposal location
in a particular catchment area. This originates as a tributary
of a river basin and receives water from one or more watershed regions through secondary
drainage network, tertiary drainage network or directly from road side drains during its course
of flow.
Secondary Drains: These are natural or manmade network of drains connecting to primary
drain or a water body.
It originates from a particular water shed region and receives water
from one or more micro watershed regions through tertiary drainage network or from road
side drains during
its course of flow.
Tertiary Drains: These are natural or manmade network of drains connecting to secondary
drains or a water body.
It originates from network of road side drains and receives water from
micro watershed regions directly or through road side drains or in combination of both. Any
31



======================================================================
PAGE 40 of 124
======================================================================
IRC:SP:50-2013
higher capacity road side drain when compared to normal road side drain
is also a tertiary
drain.
A master plan of existing network of primary and secondary drains shall be prepared for
every city or town for future guidance and to check any encroachment or diversion of drains
by individuals, particularly in new layouts.
5.2
The functional requirements of any drainage system will be
its efficient disposal
mechanism. Drainage water can be disposed off by:
a)
Over the surface
b)
In open channels
c)
In covered drains
d)
In flat terrain
Keeping
in view the alarming decrease of ground water, and drawing water from deep
underground which are leading to serious health hazards, the drainage system
shall be
effectively
utilized
for recharging
in urban area's which
will be boon, when implemented
efficiently.
a)
Drainage over the surface
The run-off of surface water will be at kerb side initially and later let off into
drains through inlet structures, access holes and junction chambers.
As and when certain semi-urban areas and revenue pockets are merged into
urban conglomerates, the areas would, have been under developed and the
roads
will normally be narrow resulting
in non provision of drains.
In such
situations water shall be drained through gutter into main street drainage
system where the minor street meets main road.
b)
Drainage through open channel
The open drain along road side shall preferably be at the edge of right-of-
way of road, as
it has dual advantage of transportation of water as well as
demarcation of road property. These drains are more efficient as they carry
larger discharge particularly in flood conditions when drainage is surcharged.
These drains are easier to maintain and allow for removal and disposal of silt
and other solids.
c)
Covered drains
Covered drains can be located at edge of right-of-way, below footpath or even
below the carriageway, where the road
is narrow, as in newly added areas/
revenue packets and road land
is encroached, RCC box drains designed to
take vehicular load may be provided. The location and size required can be
accommodated at a suitable position
in the right-of-way so that inspection.

silt removal and
its disposal can be carried out without any hindrance. See
Photo 5.2.
Photo 5.2 Box Drain in the Carriageway Portion of Road
Pipe
drains
also have the advantages
but they
shall be used
for short
lengths with required manholes
at appropriate locations for maintenance
and disposal of silt. Concrete pipe drains of appropriate shapes as circular,
elliptical, pipe arch, horse shoe can be used with closely spaced manholes,
as good mechanical equipment are available for cleaning and desilting. The
disposal of storm water in such situations and in underpasses shall be carried
out by gravity using 1200 mm size NP-3 pipes with necessary manhole at
appropriate locations. However, whenever flow cannot be gravitational, same
shall be converted to pumping.
Cost shall not be the governing factor in selecting a drainage system. For the
purpose of long term maintenance, willingness of people to adopt to system
and
initial setting up cost shall be considered.
It is preferable to have open
drains for the ease of operation and maintenance. A drain along the boundary
of main road with suitable inlets shall be considered. Drainage access to all
properties shall be provided by means of properly designed outlets.
Flat Terrain
Disposal of storm water in flat terrain
is a tricky affair, as conveyance will be
very slow or
nil due to zero or near zero gradient. The ideal mechanism
in
such situations is to increase the sectional dimensions of drains and introduce
filter mediums in the external surface of drain, with necessary outlets, so that
storm water can
effectively be disposed
off. Retention ponds at frequent
intervals in available Government lands, parks, large private properties etc.,
shall be provided with necessary gradient for conveying system for disposal
of water.

5.3
Disposal of Storm Water
It is essential to dispose off the rain water into one of the following natural bodies:
5.3.1
River system
5.3.2
Coastal waters
5.3.3
F\oo6 plains
5.3.4
Water bodies and natural reservoirs
5.3.5
Underground strata
5.3.1
River system: Disposal of storm water into
river system can be considered at
locations
if water is not being taken for water supply from
its downstream side. Discharge of
rain water into river needs to be allowed depending on the environmental conditions which
shall be foreseen.
5.3.2
Coastal areas: Problems
arising due to high
tide
shall be clearly understood.
Similar would be the case when the ultimate disposal
is into the river system.
In most of
such systems, during high floods sluice gates, which are controlled by flood department, are
closed resulting in back flow.
In such cases, where such a situation is likely to create critical
conditions during heavy downpour, pumping may have to be resorted for discharging water
above HFL. Self-regulatory holding ponds having sluice gates with one way water movement
are a solution in tidal situations.
5.3.3
Flood plains:
Possibility of demarcating some low laying areas where surplus
water from the drains can be temporarily allowed to impound for some time may exist. Such
systems shall be well designed not only for the entry of the storm water but for exit of the
storm water. Also after retreat of storm, the drains do not no longer discharge their peak
flows. Desilting of such ponds and maintaining of environment shall be well designed.
5.3.4
Water bodies: These had a
historical and ecological significance but down the
line due to urbanization, their size
is reducing, encroached upon and many sewers open
into them making
it toxic tanks almost devoid of any life. Rapid urban growth and insensitive
planning of road network is destroying natural heritage value which otherwise were directly
used as natural catchment area. As on
alternative,
retention ponds
at frequent intervals
in available government lands, parks, large private properties etc., shall be provided with
necessary gradient for conveying system for disposal of water.
5.3.5
Underground strata: There are many instances where storm water drainage leads
to dead end, especially
in large built-up areas. This happens due to poor topography to
lead off storm water in thickly built-up areas.
In such circumstances, only viable option
is to
dispose off the rain water into underground strata and further stagnated water needs to be
pumped out.
Subsurface water
is
likely to get contaminated due to this system, where
it needs careful
examination. However as stated earlier due to depletion of ground water table, this method
34



======================================================================
PAGE 43 of 124
======================================================================
IRC:SP:50-2013
of disposal in to sub surface will be of added advantage rather than considering
its negative
impact.
A vertical drainage disposal system into underground strata in built-up.
Area's is described briefly below:
The method
is designed to dispose the storm water into the permeable strata below the
ground level in built-up area, where there is no side drain functioning.
A vertical bore-hole of adequate diameter is made, the bottom of which
is taken to at least
50 cm into the permeable layer. The bore-hole is then filled with brick bats or stone aggregates.
To prevent clogging of the vertical drains,
it is wrapped with non-woven geofabric or HOPE
woven geofabric without lamination. The top portion of the vertical drain is covered with filter
material for a depth of 1 5 cm.
The number and spacing and diameter of the drains depend upon:
i)
The permeability of the strata at which the water is finally to be disposed.
ii)
The rainfall of the area
iii)
Extent of area to be covered
The vertical drain proposed may be constructed
in conjunction with the horizontal drain to
increase the rate of disposal. The vertical drain portion may also be modified by introducing a
perforated PVC pipe wrapped with geotextile inside the bore-hole instead of filling
it with brick
bats. The method has been tried and found to be successful. The schematic arrangement for
the system
is shown
in Fig. 5.3 Any alternate method suiting to local soil condition shall be
adopted for satisfactory disposal of rain water.
5.4
Design Objectives
The primary objective of road drainage design
is to provide for safe passage of vehicles
during the design storm event. The drainage system is designed to collect storm water run-off
from the road way surface and right-of-way, convey
it along and through the right-of-way, and
discharge
it to an infiltration system for ground water recharging and balance into a receiving
body without causing adverse site impacts.
The conveying system of storm water which includes drainages, ditches, channels, pumps
etc, to provide an efficient mechanism of conveying design flows from inlet locations to the
discharge point without surcharging inlets and also without causing surface flooding. Erosion
potential of flow shall also be considered in design of open channels and other flow systems
used for storm water conveyance.
The ground water disposal and storm water collection systems shall be designed to provide
adequate surface drainage. Traffic safety is intimately related to the surface drainage. Rapid
removal of storm water from the pavement minimizes the unsafe conditions which can result
in hazards of hydroplaning. Surface drainage
is a function of transverse and longitudinal
pavement roughness, inlet spacing and inlet capacity.

Cross-Section of Vertical Drain
The discharge design facilities for storm water collection and conveyance systems include
consideration
of storm
water
quantity and
quality.
Urban,
State
or Union government
regulations often control the allowable quantity and quality of storm water discharges. To meet
these regulatory requirements, storm water drainage systems will usually require detention
or retention basins and/or other best management practices for the control of discharge.
General considerations in design of storm water drain:
a)
Drains should be planned taking into consideration the ground levels, slope
of the ground, valley and ridges and also the land uses planned for urban
development.
b)
Drains should be planned to get good
longitudinal slope, considering the
nature of soil and subsoil water level. Drainage of large area can be better
36



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:50-2013
achieved by subdividing
it into small grids to avoid a long main drain. Aim
should be to get a high velocity for the dominant flow.
c)
Efficiency
in
maintenance
of drainage
system
should
be an
important
consideration in selecting the size, (covered or open) shape and the location.
The specification of the drain should also aim at preventing the possibility of
ingress of other extraneous materials, debris, rubbish, vegetation etc. where
gratings are provided on
drains, they should be so located as to
attract
attention of maintenance staff, easy to approach, inspect and clean
it.
d)
An attempt
shall be made
in the design
to
provide
higher
starting and
higher outfall bed levels in drains. A free outfall shall be attempted as far as
possible.
e)
Design of the main drain shall be so made as to allow use of the all methods
including mechanical type for desilting operation. This shall include vehicles
to get in drain for desilting.
5.5
Appurtenances
For efficient functioning of storm water drainage system, certain appurtenant structures are
essential. Storm water drain
inlets are used to collect run-off and discharge
it to drainage
system. These are the devices meant to admit the surface runoff to the drain and form a very
important part of the system. Their locations and design
shall, therefore, be given careful
consideration.
Inlets are typically located
in gutter sections, paved medians, road side and
median ditches. Storm water inlets can be categorized in to following five groups:
1)
Grate inlets
2)
Kerb-opening inlets
3)
Slotted inlets
4)
Combination inlets
5)
Manholes
6)
Bell Mouth Inlet
Grate inlets are opening
in the gutter covered by a grating. Kerb opening inlets are vertical
openings
in the road kerb covered by a top slab through which storm water flows. Slotted
inlets consist of a pipe cut along the longitudinal axis with bars perpendicular to the opening
to maintain the slotted opening. Combination inlets consist of both a kerb opening inlet and a
grate inlet placed in a side-by-side configuration. Fig. 5.5 (a) illustrates each class of inlets.
Grate inlets perform satisfactory over a wide range of gutter grades. Grate inlet is generally
loose capacity with increase
in grade, but to a lesser degree than kerb
inlets. Fig. 5.5 (a)
Photo.5.5 (a) shows varieties of grate inlets. The basic advantages of grate inlets are that
they are installed along the roadway where the water is flowing. Their disadvantage
is that
they may be clogged by floating trash or debris. For safety reasons, preference shall be given
37



======================================================================
PAGE 46 of 124
======================================================================
IRC:SP:50-2013
to grate inlets. Also missing gratings may cause accidents particularly for light motor vehicles
and two wheelers.
mmmmmmwiuim^
Fig. 5.5 (a) Various Types of Kerb Inlets
Photo 5.5 (a) Varieties of Grate Inlets
Various types of - inlets are vertical openings
in the road kerbs through which the storm
water flows and is preferred where heavy traffic is anticipated. They are termed as deflector
inlets. This type of drain inlets does not interfere with the flow of traffic as the top level of
these deflectors lie in the plane of the pavement. See Photo's 5.5 (b).
38



======================================================================
PAGE 47 of 124
======================================================================
IRC:SP:50-2013
Photo 5.5 (b) Different-types of Kerb Openings
Combination
inlets provide the advantages of both kerb opening and grate
inlets. This
combination results in a high capacity inlet which offers the advantage of both grate and kerb
opening
inlets. When the kerb opening precedes the grate
in a sweeper configuration, the
kerb opening inlet acts as a trash interceptor during the initial phases of storm. When used in
a sag configuration, the sweeper inlet can have a kerb opening on both sides of the grate.
Slotted drain inlets can be used in areas where
it is desirable to intercept sheet flow before
it crosses into section of roadway. Primary advantage
is their ability to intercept flow over a
wide section. However slotted
inlets are very susceptible to clogging from sediments and
debris and are not recommended for use
in environments where significant sediment or
debris loads may be present. Slotted inlets on a longitudinal grade do have same hydraulic
capacity as kerb openings when debris
is not a factor. Fig. 5.5 (b) & (c) indicate different
types of openings.
Bell Mouth Inlet
In Urban areas, where a footpath is made and the location of the drain is adjacent to
it, water
inlet in many cases,
is through a RCC pipe. This is 250 mm dia NP class pipe. The spacing
is depending upon the area to the drained and the longitudinal slope of the road. Schamatic
arrangement is shown in Fig. 5.5 (a).

MANHOLES are the openings constructed on the alignment of a covered or pipe drain and
its primary function
is to provide convenient access to the storm water drainage system for
inspection and maintenance. The secondary functions of manholes are they serve as, flow
junctions, can provide ventilation and pressure relief for storm water drainage system. The
spacing of manholes depends on local agencies, past experience and maintenance equipment
limitations. Manholes shall be located taking into account of the following conditions:
i)
When two or more storm water drains converge,
ii)
When pipe sizes change,
iii)
When change in alignments occurs and
iv)
When change in grade occurs
Generally manholes in straight reaches are at a spacing of 10 m to 20 m. Atypical schematic
arrangement of manhole is shown in Fig. 5.5 (d).
Manholes can be of circular, square, rectangular or any suitable shape but opening for entry
into the manhole shall not be less than 500 mm clear. A circular opening is generally preferred.
Inside dimensions of manhole shall be adequate to permit inspection and maintenance without
difficulty. Minimum inside dimension of manhole shall be of 1200 mm x 900 mm.
In case
of shallow manholes upto depth of 1.40 m, minimum allowable width could be reduced to
750 mm. Manhole covers and frames shall be factory made with fiber reinforced or reinforced,
so that higher level of quality control exists. They are available in following grades:
a)
L.D-2.5

6 STORM WATER DRAINAGE DESIGN
6.1
Prior to commencement of design, system planning
is essential to the successful
development of storm water drainage design. Urban drainage design shall be a component of
overall urban planning. The design of drainage system shall mainly comprise of (i) collection
of storm water (ii) conveying
(iii) and discharging to an adequate receiving body. The design
approach
shall be
collection
of data,
coordination between various
interested agencies,
preliminary development of concept, refinement of concept and design.
6.2
The design of drainage system involves:
6.2.1
Calculation of total discharge that the system is required to drain off.
6.2.2
Fixing the dimensions and slope of the drain to have adequate capacity to carry
the discharge and also easy on its maintenance
6.2.1
Calculation of total discharge that the system is required to drain off. The discharge
is dependent upon intensity and duration of precipitation characteristics of the area and the
time required for such flow to reach the drain. The storm water flow for this purpose may
be determined by using the rational method, hydrograph method,
rainfall runoff correlation
studies,
digital computer models and empirical formulae. The empirical formulae that are
available for estimating the storm water runoff can be used only when comparable conditions
to those for which the equations are derived initially can be assured. Of the different methods
available, the rational methods is most commonly used and serves the purpose for design of
road side drains satisfactorily.
6.2.2
There is a need to fixing the dimensions and slope of the drain to have adequate
capacity
to carry the discharge and
also easy on
its maintenance.
Rainfall data
of the
concerned area shall be analyzed by any suitable method of forecasting. Road side drains
are not designed for the peak flow of rare occurrences such as once in 50 to100 years - as is
the case with design of important structures such as bridges or weirs. However,
it is necessary
to provide adequate capacity to prevent frequent flooding of the drainage area. There may
be some water accumulation on the roads when the rain fall exceeds the design value which
has to be permitted. The frequency of occurrence which can be permitted varies from place
to place, depending upon the importance of the place. Flooding at any time, however, causes
inconvenience to people but
it shall be accepted once
in a while considering the savings
affected
in drainage costs. The areas such as important junctions, areas having basement,
substations etc. should be considered as important areas and higher frequency of flooding
shall be adopted in the design. Based on the practice being followed in metropolitan cities in
our country and considerations of cost in mind,
it is recommended that a return period to
1 to
2 years be adopted in estimation of runoff.
6.3
Time of concentration:
It
is the time required
for the maximum
runoff rate
to
develop.
It is equal to the time required for a drop of water to run from the most remote point
43



======================================================================
PAGE 52 of 124
======================================================================
IRC:SP:50-2013
of the road surface to the point for which the runoff
is being estimate.
Empirical formula
(IRC:SP:13) may be referred to determine the time of concentration:
= (0.87)
(13)0-385
(H)
Where
L
=
time of concentration in hours
c
L
=
Distance of critical point of the drain in km
H
=
Fall in level from the critical point to the drain level in meters.
For a critical area, the time of concentration is made up of two components. These components
are inlet time i.e., the time required for the rain water to flow over the road surface and enter
the drain at various
inlets into the drain and the time of flow. The time of flow
is the time
required for water to flow through the drain from the starting point upto the critical section
under examination.
It
is to be remembered that flow time would be different for different
points in the drainage system. This
is illustrated through an example. Referring to Fig. 6.1,
water from area A enters the drainage system at 2, and water from area B enters at 3. The
time of concentration in this case is made up of inlet time, which takes into concentration for
area A in which the drain starts and the time of flow in the drain from 2 to 3.
If the inlet time is
5 minutes and the flow time is 3 minutes, the time of concentration at 3 is 8 minutes. Time of
concentration for water at 4 to reach inlet at 3 is 9 minutes.
If the rainfall duration is less than
8 minutes, not all of the area A and B would be contributing because water from more remote
points of A fail to arrive to point 3.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:50-2013
6.3.1
The method described above can be used for each storm
line to the outlet for
arriving at the time of concentration. At every point under consideration, the inlet time at the
most remote end of the drain
is added to the total flow time
in the drain.
Inlet time used
in
actual practice may vary from 5 to 10 minutes. Experience or investigation
will be needed
in arriving at the proper value, though this factor decreases
in importance as the area or
the length of the drain increases, and
inlet time becomes a small proportion of the time of
concentration.
6.4
Rainfall intensity:
It has been observed that shorter the duration of critical rainfall,
the greater would be the expected average intensity during that period. For example, during
a 30 minute rainfall, some 5 minute period, or any period less than 30 minutes in length, will
have an average rainfall intensity greater than that of the whole storm. The critical duration
of
rainfall
will be which produces maximum
runoff. This duration
is equal
to the time of
concentration, since shorter periods do not allow the whole area to contribute water, and
longer duration
will give a smaller average
rainfall
intensity. The problem, thus reduces to
one of establishing a relationship between time of rainfall duration and probable or expected
rainfall intensity. For the design purpose, high intensities are of importance.
6.4.1
Current practice being followed in some of the metropolitan cities is as follows:-
i)
Mumbai
The runoff coefficient adopted in fully developed area is 1 .0. In less developed
areas the coefficient is worked out which may range between 0.58 to
1 .0. The
critical intensity of rainfall is considered 50 mm per hour and the frequency of
the storm 2 times a year.
The criteria for design depth are not to allow flooding of 15 cm above G.L.
ii)
Chennai
The intensity of rainfall adopted is 25 mm per hour. This roughly corresponds
to
rainfall
intensity of 60 minutes duration with a frequency of
1
in
1.25
years.
iii)
Delhi
'
The average value of runoff which is adopted for different category of drains
is as follows:-
a)
Internal drains (0.1 77m2/ha)
left/acre
b)
Intercepting drains (0.132m^/ha)
0.75 cusec/acre
c)
Main drain (0.088 m%a)
0.5 cusec/acre
6.4.2
The above values have been worked
out on
following assumptions.
Rainfall
intensity of 30 minutes duration at the rate 2.5" (62.5 mm) per hour occurs once in two years.
Time of concentration 30 minutes and the average runoff coefficient adopted
is 0.60.
45



======================================================================
PAGE 54 of 124
======================================================================
IRC:SP:50-2013
This gives average runoff for internal drains as 0.88 cum/ha. Considering that flooding at
streets for an hour or so may be allowed and the drains are designed for a runoff of
1 cusec/
acre.
For intercepting drains, time of concentration considered in 30 minutes and runoff coefficient
adopted is 0.4. The average runoff is taken as 0.13 cum/ha cusec/acre as against calculated
value of 0.177 cum/ha.
In case of main drains, time of concentration considered
is one
hour and the corresponding intensity of rainfall as 42 mm (1.65") per hour occurring once in
2 years. The average runoff coefficient adopted is 0.30 which gives runoff 0.5 cusec/acre.
6.4.3
Intensity
is expected to vary
in different parts of the country. Though the rainfall
gauges installed by the Meteorological Department and other Government Organizations are
not numerous enough to give entirely satisfactory data, but sufficient information is available
to allow adoption of rainfall intensity and designer is not required to make guesses. Smaller
cities that do not have a
rainfall gauge station should
install their own gauge and begin
accumulating
rainfall records for future use
in design. While obtaining data from the India
Meteorological Department (IMD) an important fact to be born in mind
is that the processing
of data by IMD
is mainly for arriving at the design flood of a specific return period - usually
50 years, for fixing water ways, design HFL etc. for important streams and the data
is not
ready made for the specific purpose of design of road side drains.
6.5
For the estimation of flood discharge, Central Water Commission (CWC), jointly
with
India Meteorological Department (IMD), RDSO,
Ministry of Railways and
Ministry of
Surface Transport has compiled very useful data. The entire country has been divided into 26
hydro meteorological homogeneous subzones as can be seen in Fig. 6.2. Twenty (20) flood
estimation reports covering hydro meteorological studies for 23 subzones have already been
published. The report includes the detailed rainfall studies of various stations having Ordinary
Rain Gauge (ORG) and Self Recording Rain Gauge (SRRG) installed by the IMD and the
state Governments.
In case of ORG locations, the data available
is in terms of daily rainfall
i.e., highest one day station
rainfall (24 hours
rainfall ending 0830 hrs of date) along with
date of occurrence.
In case of SRRG stations, data available is the heaviest storm rainfall
in
durations of 24, 12, 6, 3 &
1 hour along with date and time of occurrence. For some selected
locations data for half an hour rainfall is also available. In locations where only 24 hour rainfall
data
is available, the same can be converted into short duration
rainfall (shortest duration
1 hour) by adopting conversion factor in the report. The conversion factor varies from zone
to zone and the one applicable for the design zone should be adopted. As an example, the
graph showing duration vs conversion
ratio applicable for Western Himalayas (zone-7)
is
reproduced
in Fig. 6.3. Due to their specific requirement, the data available with CWC, IMD
etc.
is limited to minimum period of one hour, whereas, for the design of storm water drains,
depending upon the time of concentration, periods may be less than
1 hour.

is possible where the gauge records at the intervals
of 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 90 minutes are available. Method using such a data for

The stepped line indicates the location ofthe storm occurring once

Alternatively, one hour duration storm intensity may be converted into any duration intensity
using the following formulae given in IRC: SP:13.

Eqn.

Where
i
=

F
=
Total rainfall in storm in cm falling in duration of storm of T' hours.
t
=
Smaller time interval in hours within the storm duration of 'T' hours.
6.6.1
It
is also added that as per practice being followed
in most of the metropolitan
cities, the calculation of runoff is being carried out using hourly rainfall intensity for a return
period of one to two years. This
is primarily for simplicity of calculations. However, for a
large drainage system,
it
is recommended that calculations be carried out on the basis of
detailed analysis as the efforts may be directed towards the saving
in cost for the design of
the drainage system.
6.7
Rational Formula for Estimating Peak Run-Off Rates
For small water sheds not exceeding 50 km^, as is the usual case for urban drainage system,
the Rational method
is widely used for estimating the peak run-off rates. The formula is
Q=
0.028 PAL
Eqn. 2
Where,
Q
=
Design peak runoff rate in cum/sec.
P
=
Coefficient of run-off for catchment characteristics.
A
=
Area of catchment in hectares.
1^
=
Critical intensity of rainfall in cm per hour for the selected frequency and
the duration.
6.7.1
The coefficient of runoff (P) is the portion of precipitation that makes its way to the
drain.
Its value depends on a large number of factors such as permeability of the surface,
type of ground cover, shape and size of catchment area, the topography, the geology,
initial
state of wetness and duration of storm. The value of
'P' commonly adopted
for used
in
Rational Formula is given in Table 6.1.
6.7.2
The values of coefficient of run
off for
different types
of surfaces

If any change
is expected
in the land use pattern
in the contributing area during
the
life time of the drainage system, consideration for same should also be taken
in the
design.
It is a common practice that the run-off coefficient for the whole area is derived after
estimating or ascertaining the proportion of the various surfaces to the whole area. Some
common figures adopted
for coefficient of run-off are given
in Table 6.2.
It
is also to be
remembered that run-off coefficient tends to become larger as rain fall continues due to filling
of depressions in impervious surfaces and soaking of the upper layers of exposed soil.

In case of

6.8.6
The effective section of the drain carrying design discharge should be considered
below the bell mouth pipe so that there is no back flow of water on to the road.

The parabolic profile is considered to be the best for hydraulic flow but its actual construction

is
difficult. The V shaped drain
is not very popular
in urban areas as
its
desilting
is difficult. The trapezoidal and rectangular sections are easy to construct and are
considered most suitable.
In urban areas
all drains passing through built up area and near
to bus stand, crossing etc. should preferably be covered so that the drains are not used as
dust-bins. Even
if the drains cannot be covered in the initial stage due to economy reasons
provision should be available for covering
it at a later stage. However,
it should be kept in
mind that pipe drains are difficult to desilt and maintain.
6.8.8
Economical sections (for lined drains)
As far as possible, for obtaining economical sections, the relation between bed width and
depth shall be as follows;

For main or trunk drains the side slopes should be
1 :1 or VzA depending upon nature of soil
and availability of land.
6.8.9
Cunetts and cross slope in bed
All main drains wider than 3 m shall be provided with a central cunett for dry weather flow.
If the dry weather flow can be estimated
it should provide for the same. Some municipal
authorities, based on experience, provide for 6 to 7 percent of peak flow. A cross slope of
1
in 20 to
1
in 30 shall be provided in the bed towards the centre of the cunnet.
6.8.10
V Poles
One important structural aspect of drain will be to provide weep holes in the bed of all main
drains where the height of water table is expected to be above the bed level of the drain.
6.8.11
Silt trap
A suitably designed
silt trap
in the form of tank, which can be maintained easily shall be
constructed at all the inlet points of every covered drain and also provided with vertical grating
in order to avert entry of floating material into the drain.
7 SUB SURFACE DRAINAGE
- DIFFERENT TYPES OF FILTER MATERIAL
7.1
Subsurface water
in the granular layers or
in the subgrade of a pavement may
harm the road in different ways.
a)
The presence of water reduces subgrade strength. The strength of granular
bases/sub-bases
is strain dependent and poor strength
in subgrade affects
the performance of top granular layers also.
b)
Heavy wheel loads may create pulsating water pressure resulting in internal
erosion and ejection of materials through cracks and joints. This, coupled
with movement of subsoil water, changes the arrangement of fine to coarse
material and aggregates
in the structure
resulting
in weakening granular
bases, cement treated bases and stabilized layers.
c)
Absorption of water in the filler material, which may not be fully non-plastic,
may seriously undermine the load support characteristics of the layer.
d)
Free water in bituminous pavements results in stripping of the binder leading
to faster cracking and deterioration.
7.2
For design
of subsurface drainage system, the source and quantum must be
determined, and the ingress of water may take place from
a)
Top
i.e., surface infiltration of water through paved or unpaved areas,
b)
Lateral seepage through shoulders and verges, and
c)
Free water from a high water table or capillary action from a water table.

7.3
In most urban areas, the percentage of built up surface area
is rather high and
as such situations with problems of subsurface water may not be frequent unless the water
table is unusually high and the subgrade soil
is poor from point of view of drainage. Physical
condition of nearby roads, presence of vegetation which usually occur in wet soils and the local
experience helps
in selecting area for detailed investigation. During detailed investigation,
the following information
is collected
:
i)
Rainfall data for the area and the design of storm water. This aspect has
been covered in Chapter-6
ii)
Assessment
of
ground
water
conditions.
This
is
achieved
by
making
boreholes, trenches and
pits. Water levels and inflows should be carefully
recorded at the time of excavation. Pumping tools can be used to establish the
in-situ permeability of materials, and the rate of recoupment of ground water.
For gathering information on water table using piezo-meters, understanding
the location of various strata through study of bore log
is essential. These
are required to be installed in the strata which influence water table level. As
such, these should never be installed at a predetermined depth but should
be installed in the particular strata.
iii)
Assessment of the soil properties, information in respect of soil classification.
Atterberg limits and moisture content of soil at subgrade level and other levels
in areas are made where water is present and collected.
7.4
Drainage of Surface Infiltration
7.4.1
Road surfaces, medians, shoulders and
rainfall on higher adjoining areas are
permeable and the precipitation invariably seeps down. Collection of water in potholes and
undulations etc. also contributes to seepage cracks in pavement, particularly due to ageing,
defects and joints also permit ingress of water into the road structure. For design purpose,
the quantity of water which
is required to be drained off is dependent upon the intensity of
rainfall and the coefficient of infiltration or the infiltration factor. Commonly adopted ranges
are
i)
Earthen shoulders
0.4 to 0.6
ii)
Bituminous pavement
0.2 to 0.4
iii)
Concrete pavements
0.3 to 0.4
7.4.2
The best way of drainage of pavement course is to provide and extend a specially
designed sub-base layer upto the embankment slope face.
In urban situations, this may not
always be possible.
In such a case, provision of a subsurface drain
is made. The sub base
layer and the subsurface drain should have sufficient capacity to carry the design discharge.
Flow through sub-base layer, which
is considered as saturated laminar flow,
is calculated
using Darcy's Law and the flow through pipes
is calculated using Mannings formulae. The
Darcy's Law given

7.4.3
Sub-base and base should have self draining provisions by extending granular
drainage layer fully over the road formation width (Ref. Fig. 7.1 ). In addition, proper cross fall
to the drainage layer should be provided to guard against any sluggish flow. Road subgrade
should also be provided with a cross fall appropriate to the material with which
it
is built so
that there
is no accumulation of water on top of the subgrade due to sluggish flow at that
level. As a general rule, the lower pavement layer should be more permeable than the upper
one.
In case of existing pavements, where such situation may become unavoidable from
other considerations, the overlaid layer having larger voids should be drained
off laterally
to avoid
interfacial drainage problems and premature failure of the overlaid
layer. Typical
arrangement of drainage of pavement is shown
in Fig„ 7.2.

Typical exannples to determine permeability requirement of drainage layers and the quantity
of flow are given below:
1)
To determine

to dispose
off

58



======================================================================
PAGE 67 of 124

IRC:SP:50-2013
Given: The design rainfall intensity of a city is 5 cm/hr. The pavennent camber
is 3 percent and the longitudinal gradient is 4 percent, coefficient of infiltration
is 0.3.
It is proposed to utilize a permeable layer 250 mm thick to carry this
water to subsoil drainage trench on the low side of the pavement.
Quality of water entering the pavement per meter length of carriage way
=
0.05 X
1 X
1 X 0.3 =
1 .5 X
1 0-2 m^/hour.
The camber of 3 percent and
longitudinal gradient of 4 percent gives a
resultant slope of 5 percent at an angle of about 37° to the centre line. The
width of longitudinal 1m wide pavement along the line of maximum slope is
therefore, 0.6 m.
Darcy's equation can be written as:
-
K =
Q_
= 1.5x10-2
= 2 m/hr
iA 0.05x0.25x0.6
Or, required K = 5.55 x 10-^ m/sec.
2)
To determine quantity of water intercepted by a formation drain provided
across water charged permeable layer.
Given: Thickness of permeable layer is 2.0 m and
is on a 15 percent slope.
The permeable strata are silty sand having maximum permeability of 1.8 x
10"^ m/sec.
or
Q
=1.8x10-5x0.15x2
= 6.4 X 10"^ m^/sec. per m length of the drain
Thus, the formation drain and the pipe should be of sufficient capacity to
cater for this discharge and any particular section of the drain should be
designed for cumulative discharge upto that point.
7.5
Drainage of Subsurface Water
7.5.1
Darcy's law is applicable for subsurface flow of water. However,
in actual practice
one encounters soil or rock formations which are highly heterogeneous and have anisotropic
permeability's. Fissures, joints, faults and bedding planes
in soils and rock structures may
give
quite
different
properties and
misleading ground water
conditions. Applications
of
theoretical models to complex natural situations can lead to errors in estimation of quantity of
flow and flow conditions. For these reasons field observations and measurement is the best
guide. Also, interpretation of observations should be done by those who have geotechnical
skills.
In some cases,
it may be desirable to arrive at the solution through trial either before
or during early construction phase of a
project by measuring the flows and water table.
The depth of drain
is increased or additional provision
is made at closer spacing.
It may
also be necessary to have field or laboratory determination of permeability coefficients
in
the selection of pavement, shoulder, surfacing and drainage materials. As a general guide
permeability ranges are given in Fig. 7.3. For a successful design using range of permeability
59



======================================================================
PAGE 68 of 124
======================================================================
IRC:SP:50-2013
for a given material, the highest permeability value should be used when the material
is to
act as a barrier and the lowest value used when the material
is being used to allow water to
pass through.

Permeability Ranges
Some typical arrangements indicating use of formation drains and drainage blanket is shown
in
Fig.
7.4. The drainage can be effected by
installation
of solid pipes with open joints,
perforated pipes and the
like surrounded by free drainage material or the
filter. The
filter
material
is required to prevent fine soil particles from flowing into the system, at the same
time
it should have required degree of permeability for drain off the required quantity of water.
Also, the
filter material must be more permeable than the surrounding material and stable
under flow situations so as not to flow into perforations or joints in drainage pipes.
7.5.2
Aggregate filters
A properly designed and installed aggregate filter should be able to retain soil and prevent
the movement of soil particle, thus eliminating piping potential. Properly, designed aggregate
filters ensure that there are no large voids within the
filter and particularly at the soil
filter
interface of a subsurface drainage structure. A single component aggregate
filter may be
used to protect relatively coarse soils whereas drainage through fine soils usually require
a multi-layered aggregate
filter. A multi-layered
filter consists of a fine aggregate gradation
which retains the natural soil particles at their original positions and a coarser filter aggregate
which prevents particles of the fine aggregate filter from migrating into the perforations of a
drainage pipe or granular water transport medium. Fig. 7.5 shows,
in a schematic way, the
effect of a properly designed filter and improper filter. A MORTH Specification for Road and
Bridge Works (Fourth Revision) gives the grading requirement for filter material and also the
grading requirements for aggregate drains. These are reproduced as Tables 7.1 and 7.2 for
60

IRC:SP:50-2013
ready reference.
It must be remembered that
if the aggregate gradation
is too coarse, the
gaps and voids at the soil aggregate interface may be so large that the adjacent soil particles
will not bridge or be retained. However,
if the gradation
is too fine,
insufficient water flow
may result in build-up of hydrostatic pressure. Theoretical gradation of filter material
is also
possible based on empirical relationships between the particle size of soil and the filter using
filtration as well as permeability criterion.

Fabric Filters
Filter fabrics or Geotextiles are generally manufactured from polyethylene or polypropylene
or similar fibers, either woven or non-woven
in variety. Specification of Geotextile has been
covered
in MoRT&H Specifications for Road & Bridge Works and has not been repeated
here. For subsoil drainage system bio-degradable fabric filters are not used as their life span
is very short. Geotextiles eliminate the need for aggregate
filters. The fine pore size and
high permeability of these filters make one filter suitable for protecting a broad range of soil
gradations. Also, such filters are available with varying pore sizes and permeability properties
so as to meet the need of nearly all subsurface drain designs. Some typical example of use
of fabrics as filters is shown in Fig. 7.6.
Fig. 7.6 Uses of Fabrics as Filters
63



======================================================================
PAGE 72 of 124
======================================================================
IRC:SP:50-2013
Briefly, there are three basic requirements on the elements of filter criteria for drainage fabrics.
These are:
a)
Retention (of interface soil) Ability
It is specified by EQS < 3
D 85 soil
Where, EQS
is the equivalent opening size and
is defined as the size of standard sieve
having opening closest in size to the filter fabric and
is determined by sieving glass beads
through the fabric D85 soil=nominal diameter of soil particles for which 85 percent of the soil
gradation
is finer - determined by grain size distribution analysis.
b)
Permeability: The permeability of the fabric filter should be substantially greater
than that of the protected soil.
For proper flows:
K fabric > 10 K soil
Where K is the coefficient of permeability
c)
Clogging Resistance: The clogging behavior of a geotextile should be evaluated
in a test that simulates actual use condition. One such test
is to make up a slurry of the
soil to be filtered and
filter
it through a sample of fabric.
If the finest particle pass through
without clogging the fabric and the rate of flow is satisfactory. The fabric may be considered
to perform adequately as a filter.
7.5.4
Subsoil water drainage system
The purpose of the subsoil drainage
is to collect the water from
its source and ultimately
dispose off to a place where
it can do no harm to the road.
It consists of filter, the pipe inlets,
intermediate
pits and the outlet marker pegs are also installed to indicate their location. A
schematic diagram of the system is shown in Fig, 7.7.

Use of Subsoil Drainage for Special Locations
In urban areas
utility services usually run
parallel to the road and
in many cases, due to
widening of roads they get buried below the pavement or the footpath. Due to large temperature
variations particularly when the season changes and vibrations of the moving traffic, some of
the joints of underground water supply pipe may leak leading to subsoil water conditions and
damage to road.
In such locations, subsoil water drainage arrangement should be made to
safeguard the structural soundness of the road.
8 DISPOSAL OF ACCEPTABLE QUALITY OF STORM WATER
The adverse impact of development activity in urbanization with respect to storm water quality
needs to be mitigated.
In the present scenario of severely polluted storm water drains,
first
by discharge of sewerage water and secondly by polluted storm water, the discharge
itself
shall be regulated. Sewerage drains and their content shall strictly be forbidden from entering
storm water drains. This can be achieved by providing cutoff drains
all along and lead to
storage tank & this sewage water can be treated through STP & used for watering plants,
medians & excess can be lead to main SWD.
After negotiating
this impediment, the next pollutant from storm water
itself needs to be
managed. There shall be a programme of self-designed storm water pollution prevention
plan.
Some sort of regulation shall be
in place for setting forth practices, procedures and
objectives for controlling storm water quality in urbanized locations.
In order to effectively remove urban
pollutants from storm water many methods can be
adopted.
Existing open tanks or wet ponds which are nothing but retention ponds, serves both the
purposes of controlling the volume of runoff and treating the runoff for pollutant removal.
They
will act as permanent storing pool during dry weather. These wet ponds can have
aesthetic value; can be used for recreational purposes and also as emergency water supply.
Over flow from the pond
is released by hydraulic outlet devices designed to discharge flows
at various elevations. Regular desilting, especially removal
of finer particles from bed of
tanks
in addition to pollutants will keep the detention/retention facility always ready to take
next batch of storm water of good quality.
In the urban scenario where parking
lots,
bigger complexes and other structures which
discharge large quantity of pollutants along with storm water needs to install filter and oil-grit
separator arrangement so that drained out water shall be free from pollutants Fig. 8.1 shows
oil and grit separator in three chamber system. First chamber traps sediments, second one
oil separation chamber and the final one for letting out cleaned storm water into the drainage
network. This will improve the quality of water let into the drainage network.

Segregating Sewer and storm water drainage systems
The segregation of sewer water flowing into storm water can be achieved by proving cutoff
drains on both sides,

linked to cutoff drains which ultimately connected to treatment plant or away from the city/
town See Fig. 8.2.

Under no circumstances sewerage shall be allowed to flow in storm water drains in any part
of urban area.
9 STORM WATER DRAINAGE OF SPECIAL LOCATIONS
The special locations in urban scenario for drainage will normally be:
9.1
Flyovers and bridges
9.2
Drainage at foot of flyovers
9.3
Vehicular subways
9.4
Rotaries
9.5
Retail outlets
9.6
Drains underneath the carriageway
9.7
Intersection
9.1
Drainage of Flyovers and Bridges
The entire rain water on the carriage way of flyover shall be drained though efficient piping
network of rainwater of the area. Caution shall be exercised not to allow straight drop of water
67

PAGE 76 of 124
======================================================================
IRC:SP:50-2013
from flyover to road surface below, which results in disruption of traffic and damage to road
pavement. The rain water on flyover, which has to be above road
is drained through either
down take pipes or pipes embedded in the piers into series of network of rainwater harvesting
system of the area and overflow can then be directed to the drains. All such disposal systems
shall blend well and aesthetically pleasing.
A schematic arrangement is shown in Figs. 9.1 and 9.2.

IRC:SP:50-2013
9.2
Drainage at Foot of Flyovers
The longitudinal gradient of ramp of flyovers is usually upto 3 percent or even more and the
cross slope will be about 2 percent. The majority of rain water flows rapidly
in longitudinal
direction rather than cross slope resulting in very large quantity of water reaching the valley
curve area where
it meets ground level road. This junction shall be provided with finger plate
drain across the pavement. The valley junction shall be engineered in such a way, that even
below road pavement shall have downward longitudinal gradient towards valley junction, so
that entire
rain
water
from
flyover
can
be efficiently
discharged
into
the
drain at the
edge. Then
it can be directed to nearby stormwater management facility and overflow can be
directed to the main drain which will stop the water from flowing directly to the road.
9.3
Vehicular Subways
Drainage of vehicular subways shall be efficiently planned at its conception stage itself. Most
preferable system of drainage shall be by gravity. Entire surface drain of subway shall be taken
to a lowest level and a suitable grating provided across full width of road. A typical subway
drainage is shown in Photo 9.3 (a) & Fig. 9.3 (b). The grating shall have a disposal chamber
which will collect the stormwater and dispose
it to the nearby stormwater management facility
like detention, retention ponds or open ground and overflow can be directly connected to the
main drain. The lead off drain shall be preferably pipe drains with manholes at a maximum
spacing of 30 m.
In case of larger subways, two inlets can be provided at both ends of box-
approach ramp junctions. The gratings shall be at least
1 0 m away from the deck to minimize
ascending water during rains in the box portion.

In case tlie drainage cannot be effectively discharged by gravity, necessary suitable pumping
arrangement shall be made size of pumps shall be calculated based on drainage quantity
with necessary sumps, debris filters etc.
9.4
Drainage of Rotaries
In urban situations, many intersections, particularly load traffic volume intersect sections are
provided in the form of rotary.
In such locations, due to super elevation requirement water from a large area flows towards
the center of the rotary.
It is essential to this water and drains
it to the main drainage system.
Atypical schematic arrangement is shown in Fig. 9.4.
Once the water is directed in the rotary, the overflow needs to drain off efficiently to the local
drainage system. Minimum size of outflow from rotary shall be 600 mm width for ease of
maintenance.
If the site conditions permit outlets can be made multiple, which will reduce the
depth of circular drain.

Drainage of Retail Outlets
Many of the retail outlets or gas filling stations discharge water directly on to the pavement
as
in Photo 9.5 (a) resulting
in rain water pooling on the carriageway
till reaching nearest
shoulder drain. Gratings shall be provided as
in Photo 9.5 (b) at the approaches over the
existing drain so that the rain water drains off effectively, without reaching the carriageway.

Drains Underneath the Carriageway
At many locations in urban limits, storm water drains run across the carriageway. The storm
water can directly be drained through gratings designed appropriately.
9.7
Drainage at Intersections
Drainage at the intersections shall be well planned. The level of junction shall be slightly
higher than the roads meeting, so that water can reach the traffic island at the corners, which
already exist along respective roads. Any stagnation water at intersections would reduce the
capacity of junction resulting
in traffic jams and underutilization of junction.
In the event of
junction at lower level, the drainage shall be engineered
in such a way that rain water shall
be directed to this green traffic island and overflow can be connected to the main drainage
system.

10 INFILTRATION OF STORM WATER, GROUND WATER RECHARGING,
PONDS, AND RAIN WATER HARVESTING
10.1
In the recent past, rapid growth in the urban area has led to increase in asphalted/
concrete pavements and slabs or paver blocks for footpaths. Consequently the rain water
runoff has increased and ground water recharge has declined causing more runoff on road
surface and considerable flooding of secondary and primary drains finally discharged outside
the city. Considering the depleting ground water, as much as 250 m below in some cities and
towns,
it
is desirable to hold the water flowing away from city/town and charge the ground
water within the city. This can be achieved among other systems by
i)
Infiltration
of storm water
into the ground
for recharging water table by
retrofitting the ROW
ii)
Providing Landscaping in round about's, medians, traffic channels, sidewalks
(where the width
is more than prescribed
in IRC) and adoption of French
drains
Providing bore wells in the tertiary and secondary drains
Use of secondary drains of porous layers & filter materials
Detention & Retention ponds
Use for porous layers in pavement
Perforated paving in Parking lots
Rain water harvesting in buildings
10.1.1
Infiltration of storm water
In the present scenario of depleted ground water
in urban conglomerates,
all storm water
shall be efficiently
utilized for the benefit of raising the existing ground water table. This
can be achieved by redesigning the existing drainage cross-sections
in such a way that
storm water starts into ground at street level drain itself and continues through tertiary drains,
secondary drains and primary drains.
Before the ultimate disposal of rain water all possible methods shall be adopted for ground
water recharging.
It shall be commendable
if ground water recharging starts at initial point of
road side drain of road
itself. Storm water flowing into secondary and primary drains which
shall also have ground water recharging facilities.
Infiltration of rain water, which
is discharged from pavement surface, can be trapped by
construction of infiltration-filter median drains,
all along the pavement. The regular drains
shall be located adjacent to
infiltration drains, to facilitate pavement water from pavement
will enter
infiltration
drains and
incase
of excess water
will flow
to
regular drains. See
Fig. 10.1.1 (a), 10.1.1 (b), lO.l.i (c), 10.1.1 (d).

Retrofit Conditions for Existing Roads:
Retrofit road projects usually offer fewer options for flexibility. The following point should be
considered while retrofitting existing streets for storm water management.
i)
Draining of water from the road surface.
ii)
Cost
of
rebuilding
the
street
profile
and
underground
infrastructure.
Conforming to the existing street profile and identifying storm water solutions
that work with this drainage condition
is the simplest and most cost-effective
approach to retrofitting a street. See Fig. 10.1.

AREA A: This could be have storm water systems
like
filtration along with conveyance
facilities depending on the width available, the water could
infiltrate
into the ground after
passing through the infiltration process through different filter material layers as specified
in
Chapter-8 Section 4 and the excess water can be diverted to the main existing storm water
drain.
AREA B: This area will capture water from the road and due to lack of space will convey
the water to the main existing storm water drain after passing through the infiltration process
through different filter material layers.
AREA C: This area will capture water falling on
it and will filter the water to the ground water
table after passing through the infiltration process through different filter material layers.
EXISTING DRAIN: Existing drain can be retrofitted to have soak pits and infiltration chambers
at equal interval to let the storm water percolate to the ground water table at regular interval
after passing through different filter layers as specified in diagram below.
ADJACENT PROPERTY: All the adjacent properties should retain the storm water into their
property and have some recharge facilities or rainwater harvesting tank.
All the
institutions, public parks, open recreational spaces, play-grounds, medians, water
bodies etc. should be able to provide either detention or retention facilities so the excess
storm water can be diverted to these areas for further ground water recharge.

Conventional Road Section
Methods of investigation for estimating rates of surface water infiltration ground water levels
and flows form an important part of the engineering of a drainage system. Use of self-draining
materials and introduction of membrane has helped to control the migration of fine particles
from sub grade specially while pumping, as relatively small migration of fines from sub-grade
in to voids
in the sub base can seriously reduce the capacity of the sub base to act as a
lateral drain. The sub
soil drainage shall be within design parameters. Highest precaution
shall be exercised when water logged soil below sub grade may cause serious damage to
the road crust.
Proposed Road Section
The primary advantage
will be reduction
in quantum
of water at
final disposal
location.
Secondary advantage will be recharging urban ground water which
is depleting at alarming
rate.
Infiltration of storm water shall commence at street drains and shall be continued
all
along conveying system.
Different suitable mechanisms shall be adopted
for
infiltrations,
like providing
filter mediums for certain length or providing
filter bed at alternate junctions
etc. Infiltration will also take place at detention and retention facilities where storm water can
be controlled qualitatively and quantitatively.
In the present state of rapid urbanization, this
method will assume greater significance in the country's context as storm water needs to be
conserved while
it is made to runoff.
Disposal of acceptable quality of water:
In the present scenario of rapid urbanization, the
adverse impact of development activity needs to be mitigated. Urban storm water management
practice has to be employed
for storm water control with benefits and
pollutant removal
capabilities. Water quality practices shall be of acceptable standards while disposing off storm
76



======================================================================
PAGE 85 of 124
======================================================================
!RC:SP:50-2013
water. Generally, urban storm water management practice shall adopt high pollutant removal
for non-soluble particles pollutants such as suspended sediments.
In the global scenario
of recycling of available water, continuous disposal of contaminated water
will
seriously
jeopardize the availability of potable water. In such circumstances, addition of recycled water
to available fresh water
is becoming a popular option
in many of the countries and also
in
India. All possible efforts shall be made for continuous and constant removal of pollutants in
the drainage system. All available open tanks shall be modernized effectively and utilized as
detention and retention ponds and new additional ponds in the flow stream shall be created
and added.
Urbanization of any locality and population needs well engineered surface and sub-surface
drainage system.
In the present day context of depletion of water table, the storm water
drainage shall be effectively utilized for ground water charging. Water from the road flows
to the road side drain through inlets and gratings. For effective drainage this should join the
peripheral drains, which
in turn should join the main or trunk drain for ultimate discharge to
the natural drain or detention facility or retention facility. Storm water drainage, needs to take
into account alignments, levels on ground and outfall
levels.
Existing drains pass through
highly developed and thickly populated areas. As such, there may be a problem of availability
of land for increasing capacity of drains, further. Also, the problem of availability of land, for
effective disposal of storm water, may not be possible due to non-availability of further land.
If there is less space on road side, water can be taken through drain channel to nearby large
green area or other conveyance system/harvesting system as shown in Fig. 10.1

Due to continuous addition of new colonies and urban extension areas, these drains could
be designed calculating the actual discharge capacity.
In such situations the most effective
method of disposal of storm water would be by way of disposal into permeable strata of ground
at all possible locations in drain
itself or at vertical drains specially built for the purpose. An
important aspect of drain
is to ensure a good velocity in the drain not only when the drain
is
77



======================================================================
PAGE 86 of 124
======================================================================
IRC:SP:50-2013
flowing full but also when the drain is partially full. Usually, silt and other materials is deposited
in the bed in large quantities and necessary silt traps shall be designed at frequent intervals
for periodic removal of the same. The design need to be made to ensure self-cleaning velocity
during dominant and lean flow conditions.
In most of the urban areas, the responsibility for design and construction of peripheral and trunk
drainage system rests with Urban Local bodies. For an effective implementation of drainage
system, proper co-ordination between all concerned agencies is compulsory between urban
local bodies and PWD, Referred below {Ref Fig. 10.1
(ii) (d) to 10.1
(ii) (n)}.
1.
storm water management strategy-
For disposal of storm water along road side, the aim is to follow sustainable storm water management
strategy.
The design strategy is to let the storm water falling on a particular catchment area, slows, spreads
and soaks within that catchment area itself. As shown below:

Planters
Infiltration & Ftow-through
planters are structural landscaped
reservoirs used to collect, filter,
and infiltrate stormwater runoff.
They allow pollutants to settle and
filter out as the water percolates
through the planter soil and
infiltrates into the ground.
Flow rates and volumes can also
be managed with infiltration
planters.
Planters are contamed landscape
areas designed to capture and
retain storm water runoff.

French Drains
This is the most popular type of drainage system used in rural dual carriageway and motorways
in Ireland and other Countries.
It consists of either a porous, perforated or open-jointed non-
porous pipe at the bottom of a trench
filled with gravel
laid
at the edge of the pavement
or close to
it.
It serves both purposes of surface and subsurface drainage and
is called a
combined
filter drain.
It
is mainly used
in cutting or areas with ground water problems.
It
also provides storage of runoff during storms that may help to attenuate flood peaks at the
receiving stream due to the time lag.
The earliest forms of French drains were simple ditches, pitched from an area to a lower
one and
filled with gravel. These were described and popularized by Henry Flagg French
(1813-1885) a layer and assistant treasury secretary from concord, Massachusetts
in
his
book farm drainage. French's own drains were made of sections of ordinary roofing tile laid
with a
1/8
in (0.32 cm) gap
left
in between the sections to admit water.
Later, specialized
drain tiles were designed with perforations. To prevent clogging, the gravel size varied from
coarse at the center to fine at the outside and was designed based on the graduation of the
soil surrounding the drain. The practical sizing was critical to keep the surrounding soil from
washing into the voids in the gravel and clogging the drain. The development of geo textiles
greatly simplified this procedure. See Fig. 10.1

Storm Water Management Facilities
•
Median only collects the rain water falling on
its own surface area, as the
road camber is towards the road side greens.
•
Run off from entire road enters the road side greens.
•
Over flow from the green areas should always go to nearby open land / parks
or existing pipe system after passing through the infiltration layers depending
on the type of storm water facilities implemented depending on the size.
While building new roads, the storm water facility on a road should be mandatory. The type of
storm water facility to be used depends on the street profile or typology. For new construction,
there
is far more flexibility for storm water management because the street profile can be
designed in a variety of ways.

can be led to these landscaped areas with open kerbs.
Rotaries normally cater for low traffic volume intersections and for super elevation requirement,
water from a large area flows towards center of the rotary. This water could be in filtered into
the ground for ground water recharge by directing the entire road slope towards the green

Rain gardens
are shallow landscape areas
that can
collect,
slow,
filter
and absorb large volumes of water, delaying discharge into the watershed
system.
•
Rain gardens
retain storm water, thereby reducing flow
rate and
overall
volume.
•
They can also allow for infiltration, depending on the capacity of the native
soil.
At intersections the green island can act as rain gardens to take in
all the storm water from
adjacent areas and then the over flow could be drained out by main drainage
pipe. By
providing kerb cuts
in the street kerb, storm water flow can be managed, as shown

All types of infiltration facilities shall have pervious bottom for effective ground water charging
in order to drain the basin. Detailed engineering geological studies are necessary to ensure
that infiltration facility can function as planned. Particulates for in flow shall be removed, so
that they do not settle and preclude infiltration.
Another option for handling overflow is to construct a new storm drain/overflow channel inlet
within the storm water facility as shown below:

Detention and retention ponds
Detention System
:
Detention systems are designed to store storm water temporarily and then
release or reuse
it gradually.
•
The primary purpose of detention basins
is to control storm water runoff.
Detention systems store runoff for up to 48 hours
after a storm and are
dry
until the next rain
fall. This provides pollutant removal by temporarily
capturing runoff.
•
This helps in preventing flooding of low lying areas and storm water drains
during heavy rains resulting in loss of life and property.
•
Detention storage can be provided
at one or more locations and can be
above ground or below ground. These locations can exist as impoundments,
collection and conveyance facilities, underground tanks and on site facilities
such as parking
lots, basins etc. The facility may have a permanent pool,
known as wet pond. These ponds can be typically used where pollutant
control is important. Detention ponds can be common type of storage facility
used
for controlling storm water runoff peak discharges. The majority of

these are dry ponds which release all the runoff temporarily detained during
a storm. They can also be located
in large open areas of central/defense/
Government lands and private properties.
Different Types of detention systems:
a)
Detention pond
:
•
Detention ponds are temporary holding areas for storm water that store
peak flows and slowly release them, reducing the demand on treatment
facilities during storm events and preventing flooding.
•
Detention ponds are designed to
fill and empty within 48 hours of a rain
fall and could reduce peak flows and runoff volumes.
•
They can be used to provide flood control by including additional flood
detention storage.

Dry Swale
:
•
Dry swales are simple drainage and grassed channels that primarily
served to transport storm water runoff away from roadways and rights-
of-way.
•
This provides both quantity (volume) and quality control by facilitating
storm water detention.
•
Dry swales are used at low density residential projects or for very small
impervious areas.
Retention Systems
:
•
Retention
facilities
are
basically extended
detention
facilities,
infiltration
basins and swales.
In addition to storm water storage,
retention
facilities
may be used for water supply, recreation, pollutant removal, aesthetics and
importantly recharging of ground water.
In the context of serious depletion
of ground water table, these
infiltration
facilities provide
significant water
quality benefits and although ground water recharge is not a primary aspect
of urban storm water management, the infiltration basins need to be used for
the primary benefit of urban area.

Retention pond
:
•
Retention ponds maintain a permanent pool
of water
in addition
to
temporarily detaining storm water. These ponds
fill with storm water
and release most of
it over a period of a few days, slowly returning to
its normal depth of water.
•
As these have to maintain a permanent pool, they can't be constructed
in areas with insufficient precipitation or highly permeable soils.
•
Retention ponds can have
aquatic
habitat
if
properly
planted and
maintained. Regular cleaning and maintenance
is needed to ensure
proper drainage.

Rain water harvesting in buildings
Rain water harvesting
is the process of collecting and
storing
rain water for future use.
Rainwater harvesting in large areas with open ponds, lakes, tanks and rooftop,
it is estimated
that in a roof area of 100 sqm with annual
rainfall of 1000 mm the roof yield
is
1
lakh
liter
per year which
is allowed to go waste and also can cause flooding of storm drains in urban
areas with lakhs of square meters of built up area. See Figures and Photos showing the
arrangement and collecting of rain water.
Many of the urban local bodies have made
it mandatory to provide rain water harvesting in
respect of residential sites of more than 200 sqm and also water supply organizations (Govt.
Undertakings) have made rain water harvesting compulsory in order to provide water supply
and UGD connection. Extended concession is extended in the water charges by water supply
agencies.

11 DRAINAGE THROUGH PUMPING
11.1
Wherever storm water cannot flow
into drainage system by
gravity, especially
in low lying areas below bed level of adjoining storm water drain, pumping is the best solution.
Sump tanks with storm water pumping stations will be necessary for removal of storm water
from road sections, in respect of structures like under passes, road under bridges, a few types
of flyovers, where road
is required to be depressed to get minimum vertical clearance. The
storm water accumulated on the pavement is channelized to a sump tank and then pumped
to the nearest drain; from therein
it flows by gravity.
In recent development, the sump tanks
are also used as infiltration tanks by providing open bottoms with necessary filtration system,
which will reduce load on pumping stations. Adequate capacity of sump, pump and reliability
of the pumping system and continuous power are essential,
in order to avoid disruption of
traffic
in such locations. Pumping
is also required at the
tail end of a drainage system to
discharge the out flow above HFL or any such designated level.
103



======================================================================
PAGE 112 of 124
======================================================================
IRC:SP:50-2013
11.2
Design of pumping stations depends on quantity of storm water to be pumped
out, type of equipment used, the pumping station's and availability of land. Pumping station
shall be located and that
it would not be flooded at any time. The intake structure shall
be constructed
in such a way that
it will supply even distribution of flow to the pumps. An
uneven distribution may cause strong local currents resulting in reduced pump efficiency and
undesirable operational characteristics. The ideal approach will be a straight channel coming
directly into the pump or suction pipe. Turnings and obstructions are detrimental, as they may
cause eddy currents and tend to initiate deep cored vertices. The inflow shall be perpendicular
to a line of pumps and water should not be allowed to flow past one pump to reach another.
The discharge piping shall be kept as simple as possible. The pumping systems that
lift the
storm water vertically and discharges
it through individual lines to a gravity storm water drain
as quickly as possible are preferred. Trash racks shall be provided at the entrance to the wet
well
if debris is anticipated.
If substantial amounts of sediments are anticipated, a chamber
may be provided to catch solids that are expected to settle out. This will minimize wear on
the pumps and
limit deposits in the wet well. The grit chamber shall be designed so that a
convenient means of sediment removal is available. See Fig. 11.1.
Pump ftomoval
0is€hitf8« Unt
Fig. 11.1 Typical Wet-Pit Station
Pumping stations are vulnerable for wide range of operational problems from malfunction of
equipment, loss of power to vandalism when unmanned. Provision shall be made to facilitate
easy removal of pumps and motors for periodical repair and maintenance. Monitoring systems
such as on-site warning lights and remote alarms will minimize failures and will facilitate in
early maintenance of equipment.

======================================================================
PAGE 113 of 124
======================================================================
IRC:SP:50-2013
The capacity of the sump shall be decided upon future increase
in flow due to change of
land use. Pump selection procedure is to establish a criteria and then to select a combination
from the options available, which meets design criteria. Pumps shall invariably be controlled
basically by water
level sensor automatic start-stop operating mechanism
in
addition
to
manual system. Also depending on the location, pump with variable speed drives with sensor
controlled
shall be used
to match pumping
rate precisely with inflow rates. Multiple pumps
shall be in place as alternate arrangement. The discharge system to gravity mains shall be
as quick as possible. The discharge piping shall be easy to handle.
Maintenance
The best overall procedure for proper functioning of a pump station will be implementation of
a schedule for maintenance with a maintenance manual
in place. Pumps shall be checked
and serviced before monsoon. All defective and worn-out parts shall be replaced.
In case of
usage of generator for back up, same shall also be tested and kept in working condition.
12 MAINTENANCE OF DRAINS
12.1
The capital cost involved in construction of drains is less than of the total expenditure
involved in providing the infrastructure in the form of carriageway, footpaths, medians, street
lights and other street furniture. Like any other capital asset, storm water drainage system
also needs constant maintenance,
if the investment is to serve the purpose meant for. The
need for a good storm water drainage or absence of
it
is
felt during monsoon. However,
the adverse effect of weak or damaged road crust due to ponding of water and saturation
of subgrade continues for a
fairly longer period and has to be clearly understood by the
engineering fraternity.
12.2
The drainage system
is at
its best, when
it
is maintained properly as designed.
For this purpose,
it is necessary that the drains keep their shape and slope in the designed
manner during their
life time.
It
is also necessary to ensure that the drains retain their full
cross section, particularly for the monsoons. The system of maintenance can be classified
into following three categories.
a)
Continuous regular maintenance
b)
Periodical maintenance
c)
Special maintenance/Repairs for improvement
The extent of these repairs depends upon size of the drain, location of the drain, nature of
habitation nearby and cross drainage structures. The difficulty in maintenance is also caused
by a lesser degree of consciousness/civic sense. Malba, garbage,
solid waste and road
cleanings enter the drain resulting
in silting and solidification of extraneous material making
the maintenance difficult and reducing efficiency. A broad check list is given below.
Broad Checklist for Maintenance of Drains

Discourage & enforce street, house sweeping being dumped into open drains
or gutter openings
12.3
Periodical inspection and maintenance of drains
is very necessary, as failure of
drains will occur due to deficiency
in maintenance. The principal activities
in maintenance
are:
a)
Desilting
b)
Clearing of weeds
c)
Cleaning of obstruction, debris and blockage
d)
Repairing
of
lining
immediately
at
the commencement
of damage
or
deterioration
12.4
Continuous
action and
attention
in
detail
are
important aspects
pertaining
to
maintenance programmes.
It
is very essential that maintenance units should have
all the
drawings of existing drains showing
all technical details on ground. The drain should be
identified by suitable numbering with proper chainage.
It should be the endeavor to ensure
that works are maintained as per details shown in the inventory prepared just after completion
of the drainage scheme.
12.5
The maintenance manual should indicate clearly the work to be carried out. The
frequency for that work, the equipment and labour to be used and most important, any safety
measures and equipment required. The cleaning
is required for all the elements namely, the
kerb channel, bell mouth, the pipe, grit chamber/inspection chamber and the drain. Though,
it is not practicable to assign individual frequencies for each element as a routine for each
area,
it should be such as to ensure that
all elements are cleaned before the drain gets
blocked. For different localities,
it may have to be based on local experience.
12.6
It
is a common practice that
all drains are desilted thoroughly before onset of
monsoon. All kutcha side drains shall be dressed and deepened before monsoon.
It is also
essential that all the drains are in a state of good condition and works regarding, reshaping
106



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:50-2013
or profile correction, wherever required
is completed well before the onset of monsoon.
In
case of pipe drains,
if
it is not possible to desilt
it manually, suitable mechanical devices, as
described
in clause 12.10 shall be employed. Success of such operation can be ensured
only through proper inspection by all field officers rather than leaving
it only to maintenance
gangs. Outfall structures and the cross drainage structures also require similar treatment.
12.7
During the rains also, there is a need to monitor at the exit and entry point of water
for the presence of undesirable collection of rubbish, polythene/paper bags blocking the
passage of water and in everyway ensuring free unobstructed flow of rain water. The condition
of road camber also needs to be watched. During rains, specially after heavy showers,
all
cross drainage structures should be inspected to observe any blockage due to debris, log of
wood and other such materials. After that, the deficiencies in the drainage system should be
assessed and problem locations identified and record kept updated. Necessary corrective
measures should be implemented immediately after rains. The missing manhole
if any covers
and broken covers are also required to be identified and replacement/repairs need to be
carried out on priority to avoid accidents.
12.8
Some of the common deficiencies encountered
in road drains and suggested
remedy is as under:

12.9
Maintenance of Subsoil Drainage
Subsoil drainage uses porous pipes, lateral and vertical layers of granular material and man
made fabrics and membrane. Such drainage techniques are largely built in features of the
design, and do not lead themselves to routine maintenance. Their presence and the intended
mode of operation must be known and understood by the maintenance engineer. Many of
'
107



======================================================================
PAGE 116 of 124
======================================================================
IRC:SP:50-2013
these systems tend to clog over a period of time and may need replacement. In such cases,
obvious surface signs, such as flooding, or instability of pavements may be the first warning of
the system failure. The most critical aspect of subsoil drainage is the provision of detailed "as
built" information or drawings to the maintenance personnel to reduce the risk of inadvertent
disruption of intended operation during subsequent maintenance works.
For the purpose of easy identification
it would be necessary that location of various inlets,
outlets, intermediate pits along the drainage lines is marked using pegs on the ground. Same
numbering should be available on the pegs and the drawings also. The following guidelines
may be adopted for maintaining the expected performance level of subsurface drains.
a)
The drainage system should be inspected at least twice a year out of which
at least one should be immediately after heavy rains. The quality and quantity
of outflow should be observed and recorded.
It is to be noted that pavement
drains discharge water,
after rains only, whereas drains
installed to lower
subsoil water table or intercept underground seepage could carry water even
in dry season. Muddy water could indicate non functional filter and no flow
could indicate a blocked drain.
b)
Inlets should be inspected for signs of structural damage, vandalism and
blockage and corrective action taken.
c)
Outlets should be inspected for scour, structural damage and blockage.
The routine maintenance consists of removal of siltation, removal of grass
and repair of any minor scour.
d)
A check should be made to ensure that surface runoff does not enter the
subsoil drainage system.
e)
A check should be made to ensure that marker pegs are not missing and are
visible.
f)
Pit covers and frames should be replaced
if damaged and pits relocated
if
damaged frequently.
12.10
Storm Water Drain Cleaning Equipment and Devices
Covered drains and pipes, though solve other problems do not lend themselves to cleaning
easily as their size are small. Many a times, the cleaning
is done only at the location of
manholes or inspection chambers or near the location of removable slabs. This does not
give satisfactory level of service as the pipes or the main channel remains blocked and full
design cross section
is not available. As such
it is necessary that proper attention
is paid to
this aspect and available cleaning equipments and devices are used.
In some cases
it may
be necessary to adopt the commonly used sewer cleaning devices for this purpose.
Covered drains and pipes carrying storm water can be cleaned using following equipment
and devices. When cleaning after a dry spell,
it would be necessary that water is let into the
manholes for the deposited silt to get softened for is removal by mechanical devices.
108



======================================================================
PAGE 117 of 124
======================================================================
IRC:SP:50-2013
i)
Portable pump set
In cases where the drains are blocked completely and water has accumulated in the manhole/
road side, the collected water has to be pumped out to tackle the blockage. Such pumps,
should preferably be non clogging type on four wheel trailers and should be of self priming
type to save time and effort.
ii)
Sectional sewer rods
These rods (Fig. 12.1) are used for cleaning small lines. These rods may be
of bamboo or teakwood or locally available wood or light metal usually about
1m long. The ends have coupling arrangement which remain
intact
in the
line but can easily be disjointed in the manhole. Sections of rods are pushed
down the
line
until the obstruction
is reached and dislodged. The front or
the advancing end of the rod is normally fitted with a cutting edge to cut and
dislodge the obstruction.
Fig. 12.1 Joined Sewer Rods
iii)
Flexible sewer rods
The flexible rod used in manual cleaning
is usually made by sand-witching a
manila rope between bamboo strips and tying at short intervals. The flexible
rod is introduced first from one manhole to the other, its end being connected
to a thicker rope which, when dragged down the line draws out deposited
material
into the down stream manhole from where
it can be removed
easily.
iv)
Ferret used in conjunction with a water jet
This is used for breaking and removing the deposited materials.
It uses a high
pressure hose connection and produces a small but high velocity stream of
water forward in the upstream direction from the central nozzle and several
lower velocity jets in the down stream direction. The forward jet loosens the
accumulated debris ahead and the rear jet washes
it back down stream. This
device must be attached to a vehicle carrying necessary capacity water tank
and mechanical device which can raise such pressures to reach the next
manhole. Also,
it must be kept in motion to prevent sand/silt from locking the
hose
in the line. Now a days these indigenous devices are being regularly
used for flushing manholes in sewerage drains.
v)
Bucket machine
The bucket machine (Fig. 12.2) consists of two powered winches with cables
in between. The winches are centered over two adjacent manholes. The cable
109



======================================================================
PAGE 118 of 124
======================================================================
IRC:SP:50-2013
is threaded through the line by using flexible rods. The cable from the drunn
of each winch
is fastened to the barrel on each end of an expansion bucket
fitted with closing device, so that the bucket can be pulled in either direction
by the machine on the appropriate end. The bucket is pulled into the pipe line
until the operator feels that
it is loaded with silt. This motor is then disengaged
through a clutch system and the opposing winch is put into action. When the
opposite pull
is started, the bucket automatically closes and the deposited
materials comes out. This operation is repeated
till the entire line is clear. This
machine is also used along with other scraping instruments for loosening the
deposited material or cutting roots and dislodging obstructions.
Fig. 12.2 Sewer Cleaning Bucket Machine
vi)
Rodding Machine with flexible rods
This consists of a machine which rotates a flexible rod to which a cleaning
tool such as auger, corkscrew, sand cups is attached (Fig. 12.3 & 12.4). The
flexible rod consists of a series of steel rods with screw couplings. The flexible
rod
is guided into the manhole through a bent pipe. The machine rotates the
rod with cleaning
tool
(Fig. 12.5) attached to the other end. The rotating
rod
is pulled
in and out in quick succession so as to dislodge or loosen the
obstruction when the obstruction
is cleaned, the rod
is pulled out by means
of clamps.
vii)
Scraper
This method
is used for pipes of dia larger that 750 mm. The scraper
is
an assembly of wooden planks of slightly smaller size then the pipe to be
cleaned. The scraper chain, which is attached to the scraper is connected to
a winch on the next downstream manhole by means of chain. The winch
is
then operated to push the debris ahead of the scraper. The heading up of flood
behind the scraper will also assist in pushing
it in the forward direction.

viii)
Hydraulically propelled rubber balls
The ball used
is of soft rubber and
is inflated to slightly lesser diameter than
the pipe. A rope
is attached to the
ball and
it
is allowed, to travel from a
manhole downstream in the pipe. The ball adjusts itself to the irregularities in
the pipe, but the water held behind
it escapes in a strong stream between the
ball and the pipe thus flushing the debris. Some of the balls have spiraled ribs
which impart a rotary motion to the water on the downstream side. Others
are enclosed in a light chain network or a canvas cloth.
12.11
In case of blockage of drain due to settlement, the drain section
is required to be
repaired after locating the settled portion.
13 ENFORCEMENT FOR CLEANING DRAINS
13.1
Enforcement of Cleaning the Drains
1 3.1 .1
Majority of Urban Local Government Bodies in the Country are enforcing the practice
and periodic silt removal and have become more conscious about restriction and disposal of
debris in to storm water drains. As since large quantum of public funds are spent on storm
water drainage implementation, time has come for enforcement of certain disposable systems
where
in the offending party shall be penalized and booked under various punitive clauses
of respective local urban bodies. This practice
is already in force and
is being continued
in
many Urban Local Government Bodies.
13.1.2
All vulnerable stretches of drains which are thickly populated and where debris is
likely to be thrown into the drain shall be fenced suitably.
13.1.3
In
light of serious choking of storm water drains by reckless disposal of debris,
punitive action like criminal proceedings with respective state municipal acts shall be imposed,
in addition, larger corporations shall deploy patrolling vehicles for containing the same. Some
cities have already implemented this provision.
13.1.4
Silt removal from open channel drains and covered drains shall be carried out
as and when the channel
is filled to the extent of twenty percent or more of cross sectional
area of drain. The silt removal from the drain shall be carried out straight to waiting disposal
vehicle in all urban locations other than central business district. The silt shall not be stacked
adjacent to the drain.
In CBD area's when disposal vehicles cannot wait on the road due
to traffic conditions,
silt can be stacked adjacent to drain and loaded to vehicle within 6-8
hours of removal of silt, preferably during nights or when traffic is lean. Social, administrative
and punitive measures shall be imposed to see that these open drains are not used as trash
collectors. Offenders shall be penalized under respective penal clauses of urban local body.
13.1.5
Most
primary
and
secondary
drains
in
Urban
Local
Bodies
have
been
encroached upon reducing the width of valleys. The discharge capacity gets reduced leading
to flooding
in populated
localities. City survey maps will provide information about original
width of conveying drains and
all encroachments shall be removed and the original width of
drain shall be restored.
112



======================================================================
PAGE 121 of 124
======================================================================
IRC:SP:50-2013
13.1.6
No residential or commercial structure shall be constructed on any type of storm
water drains.
In case of existing ones, same shall be removed.
13.1.7
Service roads shall be constructed on either side of storm water primary/secondary
drains for movement of maintenance vehicles.
14 GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM - MASTER PLAN
14.1
The drainage guidelines
will work most effectively under a larger framework of
a Comprehensive drainage master plan that will manage stormwater based on watershed
based planning, that directs water based on natural topography of the region, focusing on
retaining and recharging water locally as in pre-development conditions.
14.2
In the earlier period,
all the storm water drains, tertiary primary & secondary were
exposed in every town and cities. Due to phenomenal growth of cities and towns, these drains
are covered, encroached & realigned.
It is desirable a GIS (Geographic Information System)
based master plan
is prepared based on the analysis of drainage patterns,
hydrological
mapping, topography and open spaces of the
city.
It will help identify watersheds,
critical
aquifer recharge zones, ecologically sensitive riparian zones and other green areas of the
city that need to be preserved for their role in sustainable urban drainage system.
In addition, master plan may be prepared for storm water drains in every city & town indicating
the type of drain, cross sectional area and also rehabilitation mentioning the return period.
Some
of the
cities have already prepared,
proposal master plan covering
primary and
secondary drains which collect water from road side tertiary drains and road surface. This
covers alignment of drains/service roads and also any widening required as per design on
return for upto 5 years, based on which the width of the channel
is arrived at. A map of city
indicating the alignment of drains is shown in Fig. 14.2.
(i).
14.3
The key objectives of a drainage master plan are:-
1 )
Protecting the existing watenA/ays
2)
Reducing run off by using natural drainage mechanisms
3)
Facilitating low (environmental) impact development.
4)
recharging ground water
5)
maintaining quality of water
6)
Maintaining health of eco-systems
7)
Building resilience of the stormwater system
8)
Formulation
of
guidelines
for
design,
construction,
operation
and
maintenance

in a coherent manner within
decentralized systems
listed above. The constructed/ structured drainage system
will be
designed to take additional run-off from intense peak hour rainfall and direct
it to closest
detention areas or to closest water course. The overall aim
is to spread and soak water in
natural and designed low areas (roadside greens,
bio swales,
filter strips,
etc.) so that
it
recharges closest to where
it falls. The natural systems primarily act as conveyance channel
of stormwater whereas structured systems supplement them, to protect the existing water
ways, to formulate guidelines for design, construction, operation and maintenance of the
system
