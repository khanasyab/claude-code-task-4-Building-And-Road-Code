The Bridges Specifications and Standards Committee in
its
meeting held on the 14th July, 2001 approved the draft subject to
certain modifications in the light of the comments made by
members. The draft was approved by the Executive Committee in
its meeting held on the 16th December, 2001 and
later by the
Council of the Indian Roads Congress in its 164th Meeting held at
Kochi on the 8th January, 2002.
IRC:83, Standard Specifications and Code of Practice for Road
Bridges, Section IX is being brought out in four parts, Part I deals
with Metallic Bearings, Part II with Elastomeric Bearings, Part III
with POT, POT-cum-PTFE, PIN and Metallic Guide Bearings and
Part IV with Expansion Joints.
The Part I of the Code relating to Metallic Bearings and Part II
relating to Elastomeric Bearings have already been published as
IRC:83-Parts I & II respectively.
922. SCOPE
922.1.
This section of the code deals with requirements
for the materials, design, manufacture, testing, installation and
maintenance ofPOT, PTFE, PIN and Metallic Guide Bearings for
Road Bridges. The provisions of this code are meant to serve as a
guide to both design and construction engineers, but mere
compliance with the provisions stipulated herein will not relieve
them
in any way of their responsibility for the stability and
soundness of the structure designed and erected.
922.2.
The provision ofthis code shall apply for operating
temperature between -10°C and 4-50°C.
922.3.
Pot bearings with confined elastomeric pressure

======================================================================
IRC:83 (Part III)-2002
pads upto 1500 mm diameter are within the scope of this code.
922.4.
Bearings which are subjected to tensile bads are
beyond the scope of this code.
922.5.
Bearings which are subjected to rotations greater
than 0.025 radians are beyond the scope of this code.
923. TERMINOLOGY
923.1.
Pot Bearing
A bearing consisting of a metal piston supported by a disc of
unreinforced elastomer that is confined within a metal cylinder for
allowing rotational movement about any axis in horizontal plane
and to bear and transmit vertical load. Pot bearings may be provided
with sliding assembly (with or without restraint in the form of
guide along a desired direction to bear and transmit horizontal force)
comprising of stainless steel plate attached to metal backing plate
sliding in horizontal plane over PTFE confined in recess(s) on the
piston which shall be termed as Pot-cum-PTFE bearings.
Depending on the desired degree of freedom Pot bearings may be
of three types as follows:
923.1.1.
Fixed type pot bearing: A type of Pot bearing
which alongwith vertical load, bears and transmits horizontal force
in any direction and allows rotation about any axis in horizontalplane
without permitting any movement in horizontal plane (Fig. 13).
923.1.2.
Free sliding type pot-cum-PTFE bearing: A type
of Pot bearing which bears and transmits vertical load and allows
movement
in any direction
in the horizontal plane and
accommodates rotation about any axis
in horizontal plane
(Fig. 14).

923.1.3.
Guided sliding type POT-cum-PTFE bearing:
A type of Pot bearing which alongwith vertical load bears and
transmits horizontal force in one direction only and allows
movement perpendicular to that direction and allows rotation about
any axis in horizontal plane (Fig. 15).
923.2.
PTFE Sliding Assembly
A bearing consisting of a sliding assembly (with or without
restraint in the form of guide along a desired direction to bear and
transmit horizontal force) comprising of stainless steel plate
attached to a metal backing plate sliding in horizontal plane over
PTFE confined in recess(s) on a fixed plate. PTFE sliding
assemblies are capable to bear and transmit vertical load but are
not capable to accommodate rotational movement unless provided
with additional arrangement. Depending on the desired degree of
freedom PTFE sliding assemblies may be oftwo types as follows:
923.2.1.
Free PTFE sliding assembly: A type of PTFE
sliding assembly which bears and transmits vertical load and allows
movement in any direction in the horizontal plane (Fig. 16).
923.2.2.
Guided PTFE sliding assembly: A type ofPTFE
sliding assembly which alongwith vertical load bears and transmits
horizontal
force
in one direction and allows movement
perpendicular to that direction (Fig. 17).
923.3.
Pin Bearing
A bearing consisting of a metal pin provided within a metal
cylinder to bear and transmit horizontal force along any direction
in the horizontal plane and accommodating rotational movement
about any axis. Pin bearings cannot bear or transmit any vertical
load (Fig. 18).

IRC:83 (Part III)-2002
930. INSTALLATION
930.1.
General
930.1.1.
Bearings should be installed with care to ensure
their correct functioning in accordance with the design for the whole
structure. Bearings shall be so located as to avoid the accumulation
of dirt and debris likely to interfere with their performance and the
structure so detailed that water is prevented from reaching the
bearings.
930. 1.2.
In order that moving surfaces are not contaminated,
bearings should not normally be dismantled after leaving the
manufacture's workshop but if for any reason they are, then this
should only be done under expert supervision and
the
manufacturer's assistance should be sought.
930.1.3.
Transfer of superstructure weight on to bearings
should not be allowed until sufficient strength has developed in
the bedding material to resist the applied load. Temporary clamping
devices should be removed at the appropriate time before the
bearings are required to accommodate movement. Consideration
should be given to any treatment required to holes exposed on the
removal of temporary transit clamps. Where reuse of these fixing
holes may be required, the material selected to
fill them should
not only give protection against deterioration but also should be
easily removable without damaging the threads.
930. 1 .4.
Suitable temporary supporting arrangements under
bearing base plates should be made to accommodate thermal
movement and elastic deformation ofthe incomplete superstructure,
if necessary. Such temporary supports,
if provided, should be
compressible under design loading or removed once the bedding
63



======================================================================
PAGE 74 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:83 (Part III)-2002
material has reached the required strength. Any voids
left as a
consequence oftheir removal should be made good using the same
type of bedding material. Steel folding wedges and rubber pads
are suitable for such temporary supports under bearing base plates.
930.1.5.
The installation tolerance given in Clause 930.5
may be relaxed, provided the same has been taken care of in the
design of the structure.
930.2.
Bedding
930.2.1.
The choice of bedding materials is influenced by
the method of installation of the bearings, the size of the gap to be
filled, the strength required and the required setting time. When
selecting the bedding material, consideration should, therefore, be
given to various factors,
like, type of
bearing, size of bearing,
loading on bearing, construction sequence and timing, early
loading, fiiction requirements, access around the bearing, thickness
ofmaterial required, design and condition ofsurface in the bearing
area, shrinkage of the bedding material.
930.2.2.
It is essential that the composition and workability
ofthe bedding material be specified with the above factors in mind.
In some cases, it may be necessary to carry out trials to ascertain
the most suitable material. Commonly used materials are
cementitious or chemical resin mortar and grout.
930.2.3.
To ensure even loading on bearings and the
supporting structures,
it is essential that any bedding material
whether above and below the bearing, extend over the whole area
of the bearing.
930.2.4.
Bearings shall be bedded over their whole area.
After install^ion there shall be no voids or hard spots. The bedding
64



======================================================================
PAGE 75 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:83 (Part III)-2002
material shall be capable of transmitting the applied load to the
structure without damage. Surfaces to receive bedding mortar shall
be suitably prepared to a state compatible with the mortar chosen.
The top surface ofany extension ofthe bedding beyond the bearing
shall have a downward slope away from the bearing.
930.3 .
Fixing of Bearings
930.3.1.
To cater for vibration and accidental impact, some
anchorage should be provided. Anchorage should be accurately
set into recesses cast into the structure using templates and the
remaining voids in the recesses should be filled with material
capable of withstanding the loads involved.
930.3.2.
Bearings that are to be installed on temporary
supports should be firmly fixed to the substructure by anchorage
or other means to prevent disturbance during subsequent operations.
Finally, voids beneath the bearings should be completely filled
with bedding material using the appropriate method.
930.3.3.
Bearings may be fixed directly to metal bedding
plates that may be cast in or bedded on top of the supporting
structure to the correct level and location.
930.3 .4.
Ifthe structure is of steel, the bearings may be bolted
directly to it. Proper care shall be taken to ensure that there are no
mismatch in the bolt holes of the structure and the bearing.
930.3.5.
Threaded fasteners shall be tightened uniformly to
avoid overstressing of any part of the bearing.
930.4.
Bearings Supporting In-Situ Concrete Deck
930.4.1
Where bearings are installed prior to forming an
in-situ concrete deck, formwork around bearings should be
65



======================================================================
PAGE 76 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:83 (Part III)-2002
carefully sealed to prevent grout leakage. However, it is essential
that the bearings and particularly the working surfaces be protected
during concreting operations. Sliding plates should be fully supported
and care taken to prevent tilting, displacement or distortion of the
bearings under weight ofwet concrete. Any mortar contaminating the
bearings should be completely removed before it sets.
930.4.2.
For bearings supporting precast concrete or steel
elements a thin layer of synthetic resin mortar should be used
between bearings and precast concrete beams. Bearings shall be
bolted to anchor plates or sleeves embedded in precast elements,
or to machined sole plates on steel elements.
930.5.
Installation Tolerances
930.5.1.
The tolerances given in Clause 930.5.2 shall be
observed unless otherwise specified.
930.5.2.
Bearings shall be located so that their centrelines
are within +/- 3 mm oftheir correct position. The level of a bearing
or the mean levels of more than one bearing at any support shall
be within a tolerance of +/- 0.0001 times the sum of the adjacent
spans of a continuous girder but not exceeding +/- 5 mm. Bearings
shall be placed in a horizontal plane within a tolerance of 1 in 200
in any direction unless otherwise specified, even under
superstructure in gradient.
931. MAINTENANCE
931.1.
This section
stipulates the requirements for
inspection and maintenance ofPot, PTFE, Pin and Metallic Guide
bearings during service period. Bearings should be designed and
manufactured to make it maintenance free so that it can eliminate
undesirable effects caused by extreme atmosphere or aggressive
66



======================================================================
PAGE 77 of 84
======================================================================
IRC:83 (Part III)-2002
environmental condition/unforeseen events. However, the
surrounding area of the bearings shall always be kept clean and
dry to avoid damage to the bearings.
93 1 .2.
Suitable easy access to the bearing shall be provided
for inspection and maintenance. Provision shall be made forjacking
up the superstructure so as to allow repair/replacement ofthe bearings.
93 1 .3.
Inspection of bearing at site is required from time
to time to ascertain the performance of the bearings. Periodic
nominal maintenance of bearing shall be carried out in order to
ensure better performance and longer life of the bearings. The
bearings are required to be inspected at an interval of one year for
the
first five years and at an interval of two years thereafter.
However, the bearings shall also be examined carefully after
unusual occurrences, like, heavy traffic, earthquakes, cyclones and
batteriiigs from debris in high floods.
93
4.
The inspection shall be preceded by careful cleaning
of the bearings as well as its surrounding space, depending on the
actual conditions around the bearings, e.g., deposit of salt, debris,
dust or other foreign material.
93 1 .5.
Elements of Inspection
The following are recommended inspection elements and actions
which are considered necessary to monitor and upkeep the bearing
:
( 1 ) Measurement of movement
: During inspection at site, measurements
are required to be taken and documented to compute its movement and
rotation values in relation to their design values to ascertain whether
the performance ofthe bearings are satisfactory. To ascertain maximum

movement shall be compared with the design values.
(2) Measurement of dimensions
: Overall dimensions of the bearings are
required to be measured and compared with the actual dimensions to
ascertain any excessive stress or strain on the bearing.
(3) Evidence of locked in condition
: If any movable or rotating part of a
bearing
is found to be
in locked-in/jammed condition, necessary
rectification measures shall be taken immediately.
(4) Evidence of corrosion
: If corrosion of any part of exterior exposed
steel surface of the bearing is detected the following measures may be
taken. In addition, the root cause of defect should be searched and
proper actions should be taken to avoid recurrence of the problem.
•
Detect affected part
•
Wire brush the affected portion to clean of it's rust.
•
Apply protective coating as per manufacturer's specifications.
(5) Condition of the adjacent bridge structure
: The adjacent structure
of the bearings are also required to be inspected for any damage and
necessary actions to repair the same, should be taken immediately.
93 1 .6.
Results and Actions
The results of every inspection has to be|Tecorded in the
inspection report and shall be classified in each case into the
following types of action:
X
No action.
XX
Further measurements/long-term monitoring or design analysis
needed (e.g., considering extreme temperatures/exposures,
variation of loads, etc.). Actions to be outlined in a report.
XXX
Minor repair works e.g. cleaning, repainting, etc.
XXXX
Repair or replacement of entire bearings or parts of the bearings.
Actions to be outlined in a report.
In case of defects where the cause of necessary actions cannot
be determined by the inspecting person or the responsible bridge
engineer, the bearing manufacturer shall be consulted.
