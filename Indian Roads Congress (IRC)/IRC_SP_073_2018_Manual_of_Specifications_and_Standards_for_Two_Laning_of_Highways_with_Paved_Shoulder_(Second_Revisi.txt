Manual of Specifications & Standards for Two Laning  
of Highways with Paved Shoulder
INTRODUCTION
The Manual of Standard & Specifications for two laning of State Highways on BOT Basis” was 
first published in August, 2007. The first revision of this document was approved by Council in its 
204th Meeting held in Bhubaneswar on 19th January, 2015 and it was made applicable for 2 lane 
with or without paved shoulder on BOT/EPC Basis. However, since then based on the experience 
of EPC Projects and site specific problems, the Project Preparation, Contract Management, 
Quality Assurance and Public Private Partnership Committee (G-1) under the Convenorship of 
Shri B.N. Singh in its 1st meeting held on 06.06.2015 decided that IRC:SP:73-2015 should 
be reviewed on priority. A sub-group under Shri A.V. Sinha with other members as Shri Ashok Kumar, 
Shri A.K. Bhasin, Shri I.K. Pandey and Shri S.K. Nirmal was constituted. The sub group prepared 
different sections of the special publication in the Transport Bhawan, which were further discussed 
in different meetings of G-1 Committee between 25.07.2015 and 19.11.2016. On 19.11.2016, the 
Committee after detailed discussion authorized the Convenor to finalize the document as per 
suggestions/comments of the members. The sub-group discussed in detail the various comments/
suggestions during their meetings on 20.1.2017, 21.3.2017, 29.4.2017 and 06.06.2017 under 
the chairmanship of Convenor again at Transport Bhavan and finalized the document. The draft 
revision was approved by the GSS on 24.06.2017 and by Council in its 212th meeting at Udaipur 
on 14th to 15th July, 2017 authroizing EC to take a view about safety aspects. Finally, EC in its 
meeting on 07.08.17 approved the document for publication. The Sub-Group received inputs from 
Shri Jacob George in drafting sections on Road Safety and Cross-section drawings which is duly 
acknowledged. The Sub-group gratefully acknowledges peer review of the draft by Shri D.P. Gupta.

Preamble
This Manual is divided into various sections each dealing with a particular aspect of the 
project such as General, Geometric Design, Pavement design, Structures, Drainage, Safety, 
Environment, Materials, etc. Each chapter contains various sections, paragraphs, tables, 
sketches and drawings describing those aspects in detail. These provisions collectively intend 
to ensure delivery of value through this procurement by completing the work within the stipulated 
time and with quality, safety and environmental safeguards. Therefore, subject to the provisions 
of this Manual, the Concessionaire shall plan and execute the work in a manner that eventually 
delivers value (i.e., timely completion with quality, safety and environmental safeguards).
The Concessionaire shall plan and design the work, deploy the required resources, establish 
systems and procedures for execution of the work and execute the work in accordance with 
these procedures. At every stage, the focus shall be on value delivery by timely completion 
of the Work with quality, safety and environmental safeguards. This focus shall be ensured by 
devising, as a part of procedures, a system of pre-audit of all activities including the procedures 
relating to execution of the Work. As long as the focus remains on delivery of value, the Authority 
shall accept such plan, design, deployment, and procedures without questioning their adequacy. 
However, in case the execution is not in accordance with the Concessionaire’s own plan and 
procedures, it shall be considered a violation of this Manual.
The system and procedure to be established by the Concessionaire shall include but not limited 
to (a) delegation of responsibility to its personnel, Consultant and Subcontractors, (b) the 
mechanism for initiating, completing, checking and acceptance of the assigned responsibility, 
(c) the mechanism for controlling the inputs, processes and outputs or outcomes relating to any 
part of the work or activity. In the event of persistent non-compliance with the provisions of this 
Manual by any of the Concessionaire’s personnel, Consultant and Subcontractors within their 
respective delegation, the Authority shall have the right not to accept their continued presence 
on the site of the Work and the Concessionaire shall make suitable replacements.
Planning
The overall planning of the work shall (a) recognize the constraints at site such as limitation of terrain 
and space; existence of habitation and its needs such as safety of shops and dwelling units, safe 
access, movement and circulation during construction; likely adverse impact of construction on 
the communities such as loss of business, increase in air, dust and noise pollution, severance of

manpower and finances; by identifying the sources of supply, deciding the supply schedule and 
finalising the terms of supply; by identifying the specialist suppliers including design consultants 
and specialist subcontractors and finalising the terms of engagement with them and (d) establish 
the systems and procedures for execution of the work by assigning responsibilities to the 
personnel, consultants and subcontractors; by specifying the manner in which the work-related 
activities shall be initiated, carried out and accepted; by specifying the manner in which the inputs, 
processes and the outputs or outcomes shall be controlled; by specifying the accountability of 
the personnel for various actions.(Emphasis added)
Design
The Work and its components shall be designed in a manner that they are (a) safe, both locally 
as well as globally; (b)serviceable under the operating conditions;(c) durable within the design 
life, (d) constructible under the given site conditions and with the technological option chosen by 
the Concessionaire, (e) maintainable in future by repairs, replacement or rehabilitation; and (f) 
fit for the intended purpose. Wherever necessary, design shall be accompanied with detailing. 
Design shall be done in three steps, viz., the initial design, proof check and acceptance, each of 
the steps being taken independently by different sets of personnel.(Emphasis added)
Execution
The execution of Work in accordance with these Manuals shall ensure timely completion with 
quality, safety and environmental safeguards.
Timely completion: At any stage of the work, if the Concessionaire is notified that the work 
is not likely to be completed within the stipulated period as per the plan furnished by the 
Concessionaire, the latter shall revise the plan and deploy additional resources to complete the 
work within the stipulated period.
Quality: Quality shall mean to include the quality of inputs and outputs, the capability of the 
processes and the actual controls in running these processes to deliver uniform and reproducible 
outputs and outcomes; durability of the materials and the work; serviceability of the work and 
its components; and the overall fitness of the Work to serve its intended purpose. The Quality 
procedures of the Concessionaire shall address each of these issues.
Explanations
 
(1) 
Inputs: Conforming quality of aggregates and their grading within the specified 
band but some deficiency or excess of a particular size fraction making the mix 
harsh and incompactible.
	
(2)	
Outputs: Conforming quality and quantity of inputs, correct process of mixing but 
the mix delivered at site is segregated.
	
(3)	
Serviceability: A work executed with conforming inputs and by following the 
correct processes but the surface delivered has more undulations than permitted 
in the Manual.



======================================================================

(4)	
Durability: A pavement designed for certain years loses serviceability prematurely 
because of faulty mix design or compaction at inappropriate temperature or 
absence of certain essential ingredients like anti stripping agents. 
	
(5)	
Processes: An overheated bituminous mix because of malfunctioning of the 
temperature control in the hot mix plant.
	
(6)	
Fitness of purpose: A drain constructed in correct slope and cross section unable 
to discharge for lack of connection with outfall.
The Concessionaire shall devise the quality procedures, have these procedures pre-audited and 
ensure their compliance by their personnel, the Consultants and subcontractors. 
Safety: Safety shall include safety of works, workers, traffic, other road users and safety of third 
party properties. Safety procedures devised by the Concessionaire shall address each of the 
stakeholders and provide for appropriate measures to ensure safety. 
Safety of works shall include both temporary and permanent works. All the works including 
temporary works shall be designed safe, both globally and locally, and constructed as per 
design. The design of temporary works, lifting and launching systems shall have sufficient built-
in redundancies to safeguards against accidental failure of any component or member. Transfer 
of loads from temporary to permanent structures shall be only after the permanent structure is 
capable of taking that load. 
Safety of workers shall be ensured by providing them with safety gears, briefing them with 
safety procedures, insulating all workers from the site of a risky operation except those who are 
trained and responsible for carrying out such operation, not exposing any worker to traffic except 
those responsible for traffic management and equipping the latter with high visibility gears and 
equipment, setting up an emergency protocol and intervention, debriefing the workers in case of 
a mishap and taking remedial measures. 
Safety of traffic shall be ensured by segregating road space for normal traffic operation from 
a construction site within a construction zone and regulating the traffic within that zone; by not 
permitting construction traffic and equipment to interfere with normal traffic; by not permitting 
any overhead operation in the vertical space over the road carrying traffic and protecting the 
road surface against accidental falls of materials, tools, equipment or construction members; by 
illuminating the construction zone, marking the travelled way and providing road signs including 
vehicle mounted signs.
Safety of other road users such as access traffic, non-motorised vehicles and pedestrians shall 
be ensured by making available protected road space segregated from normal traffic within the 
construction zone and providing them safe crossing.
Safety of third party properties shall be ensured against collateral damage to the properties 
and exposure of their owners and occupants to the risks of construction traffic and equipment 
operation.
Environmental safeguards: Safeguards against damage to physical environment like land, air, 
water and noise as well as disruption to social environment like severance of communities, visual

intrusion, and blocked accesses shall be ensured during execution. Environmental safeguard 
procedures devised by the Concessionaire shall address each of these issues and provide 
appropriate mitigating measures.
Land shall not be allowed to be degraded by drawing of construction materials without rehabilitating 
the land, dumping of construction wastes in non-designated dump sites, spillage on ground of 
unacceptable materials like oils, chemicals, construction mixes.
Water bodies like community ponds shall not be encroached upon without providing alternatives, 
water courses shall not be allowed to silt by dumping of wastes and contaminants like chemicals 
and untreated wastes, drawl of ground water shall not be indiscriminate to cause lowering of 
water table at unacceptably high rate.
Air pollution level shall not increase unacceptably due to release of fumes and particulate matters. 
Appropriate dust palliation measures shall be taken.
Noise levels shall not increase to unacceptable level to cause inconvenience to the nearby 
habitation and appropriate attenuation measures shall be taken.
Where communities are severed or access is blocked or the construction is visually intrusive to 
the communities, appropriate alternatives shall be provided.
Consultation with stakeholders
The Concessionaire shall make every effort to bring all stakeholders on board by having interaction 
with them during which it will explain its position, understand the stakeholders’ views, make its 
proposals, receive their response and accommodate their requests to the extent possible. Such 
consultations shall be limited to the local issues resulting from the construction of the project and 
not extend to global policy issues like greening the environment, ecological imbalance or climate 
change, etc., if these are cited to question the construction itself.
Procedures and pre-audit of procedures 
The Concessionaire shall devise its internal procedures to take care of the issues described 
above and have the procedures internally pre-audited to satisfy itself that these adequately cover 
each aspect of planning, design and execution with focus on delivery of value by adherence to 
time, quality, safety and environmental safeguards. In case any changes and modifications are 
required these shall be carried out in the procedures.

Concession Agreement. While finalizing the feasibility/project report for the Project Highway, and 
the scope of the project, each of these paras should be carefully examined and addressed by 
the Authority with a view to making appropriate provisions in the Schedules of the Concession 
Agreement. A list of such paras is enclosed at Appendix 2.
1.13	 General considerations for Planning, Design and Construction
The Concessionaire shall undertake measures to overcome the physical and operational 
constraints and plan, design and construct the Project Highway using appropriate methods, 
management techniques and technologies in line with intention specified in the preamble 
prefacing this Manual. The objective, therefore is to construct a 2 lane highway for all road users 
as an active infrastructure facility for people for their safety and services and as a catalyst in 
development of economy based on an inclusive approach.
General considerations shall, without being limited to, be as follows:-
	
a)	
The constraints
	
	
The physical constraints in the existing highway are in the form of limitation of 
right of way, un-regulated access, inadequate service roads and underpasses, 
numerous at-grade junctions, lack of physical separation between local and 
through traffic etc. The operation constraints arise out of the necessity or 
possibility of closing a portion of the road for construction and/or diverting the 



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 227
======================================================================

IRC:SP:73-2018
9
traffic to temporary diversions, thereby reducing the capacity and safety of the 
existing highway. The solutions evolved by the Concessionaire shall be such 
that these operational constraints are overcome through appropriate planning, 
design and construction method, techniques and technologies and by adopting 
suitable traffic management measures.
	
b)	
Safety of design
	
	
All designs shall be safe to ensure that the Project Highway or any part thereof 
(for example embankment, pavement, retaining structures, bridges, culverts, 
etc.) does not collapse (global stability) nor its serviceability/performance (for 
example settlement, roughness, undulations, deflections, etc.) deteriorates 
below acceptable level as prescribed in Schedule ‘K’ of the Concession 
Agreement.
	
c)	
Durability
	
	
The Project Highway shall not only be safe but also durable. This would mean 
that the deteriorating effects of climate and environment (for example wetting and 
drying, freezing and thawing, if applicable, temperature differences, aggressive 
environment leading to corrosion, etc.) in addition to the traffic shall be duly 
considered in design and construction to make the Project Highway durable.
	
d)	
Mitigating disruptive effects of construction
	
	
The planning, design and construction of the highway shall be such that 
the construction of Project Highway does not have adverse impact on the 
environment and does not disrupt the lives and business activities of the people 
living close to the Project Highway.
1.14	 Safety during Construction and Operation & Maintenance
1.14.1	
The Concessionaire shall develop, implement and administer a surveillance and 
safety programme for providing a safe environment on or about the Project Highway, and shall 
comply with the safety requirements set forth in the Concession Agreement.
1.14.2	
Before taking up any construction or maintenance operation/work, the Concessionaire 
shall prepare a Traffic Management Plan for each work zone and furnish it to the Independent 
Engineer for comments duly incorporating the following:
 
i) 
Designate a Site Safety Team headed by a qualified Safety Officer.
 
ii) 
Traffic safety devices as per IRC:SP:55 with the following specifications:
 
a) 
Signages of retro-reflective sheet of high intensity grade.
	
b)	
Delineators in the form of cones/drums as per IRC:SP:55 made of plastic/
rubber having retro reflective red and white band, along with a reflective 
tape (red and white band) to be tied in between the gaps of cones/drums. A 
bulb/flasher using solar energy is to be placed on the top of the cone/ drum 
for night delineation.
	
c)	
Barricades as prescribed in IRC:SP:55 shall be used.

10
 
iii) 
The arrangement of traffic during construction and maintenance shall conform 
to the requirements of IRC:SP:55, Clause 112 of MORTH Specifications and 
provisions of the Concession Agreement. During the construction period, the 
Concessionaire shall maintain, at its cost, the existing lane(s) of the Project 
Highway or divert the traffic on to an alternative route-diversion road so that 
the operating width and safety standards shall be equal to those of existing 
lanes (excluding paved shoulders, if any) for each direction. The crust of such 
alternative route/diversion road shall be provided for minimum 10 msa. The 
drainage of existing road and construction zone during construction shall be given 
special attention by the Concessionaire. Prior to commencement of construction 
works, the Concessionaire shall submit to the Independent Engineer, the 
detailed construction methodology to meet the aforesaid requirement including 
temporary drainage plan of existing road and construction zone.

The Concessionaire shall also be responsible for ensuring compliance of all labour 
laws and regulations including those relating to the welfare of workers engaged both directly and 
indirectly on the Project Highway, besides their occupational safety and health.
1.15	 The Concessionaire shall set up field laboratory for testing of materials and finished 
products as stipulated in Clause 120 of MORTH Specifications. It shall make necessary 
arrangements for additional/confirmatory testing of any materials/products at the government 
accredited laboratory, for which facilities at site laboratory are not available.
1.16	 Environment Mitigation Measures
The Concessionaire shall carry out tests/monitor various parameters impacting the environment 
of the Project Highway keeping in view the guidelines of the Ministry of Environment and Forests 
and submit proposals for mitigation of adverse environment impact including provision of noise

GEOMETRIC DESIGN AND GENERAL FEATURES
2.1	
General
	
i)	
This Section lays down the standards for geometric design and general features 
for upgrading the existing highways to two-lane. Emphasis, focus objective shall 
be on improvement and development of highway to NH standards and to ensure 
that no stretch remains with deficient geometrics so that eventually hierarchical 
function of the highway is facilitated. 
	
ii)	
Stretches where 4/6-laning is to be provided, shall be indicated in Schedule ‘B’ 
of the Concession Agreement and respective Manual of 4/6 laning shall be 
applicable.
 
iii) 
Where there are constraints of existing ROW width or difficulty in acquiring 
land along the existing alignment in built up areas, the Authority may decide 
for construction of a bypass. The alignment of the bypass shall be given in 
Schedule ‘B’ and placed eccentrically with respect to the ROW to facilitate 
proper widening to four lanes in future (Fig. 2.3).
	
iv)	
The geometric design of the Project Highway shall conform to the standards 
set out in this Section as a minimum. The Concessionaire shall ensure with the 
consent of Engineer that liberal geometric standards are followed to the extent 
feasible within the given Right of Way and consistent with safety.
	
v)	
As far as possible, uniformity of design standards shall be maintained throughout 
the length. In case of any change, it shall be effected in a gradual manner.
 
vi) 
Where the existing road geometrics are deficient with respect to minimum 
requirements and its improvement to the prescribed standards is not feasible 
due to any constraint in acquisition of additional land, such stretches shall be as 
specified in Schedule ‘B’ of the Concession Agreement.
 
vii) 
Existing horizontal curves, which are found deficient in radius, layout, transition 
lengths or super elevation shall be corrected to the standards specified in this 
section.
 
viii) Any deficiencies in the vertical profile in respect of grades, layout of vertical 
curves and sight distance shall be corrected to meet the minimum requirements 
in this section.
2.2	
Design Speed

steeper than the slope of the pavement and paved shoulder subject to a minimum of 3.0 per 
cent. On super elevated sections, the earthen portion of the shoulder on the outer side of the 
curve shall be provided with reverse crossfall of 0.5 per cent so that the earth does not drain on 
the carriageway and the storm water drains out with minimum travel path.
2.8.3

i)	
The rate of change of centrifugal acceleration should not cause discomfort to 
drivers. From this consideration, the length of transition curve is given by:
	
	
Ls	 =	
0.0215 V3/CR,
	
Where,
	
	
Ls	 =	
Length of transition curve in metres,
	
	
V	
=	
Speed in km/hr,
	
	
R	
=	
Radius of circular curve in metres,
	
	
C	
=	
80/(75+V) (subject to a maximum of 0.8 and minimum of 0.5)
	
ii)	
The rate of change of super elevation should be such as not to cause discomfort 
to travelers. Further, rate of change should not be steeper than 1 in 150 for roads 
in plain/rolling terrain, and 1 in 60 in mountainous/steep terrain. The formula for 
minimum length of transition on this basis is:
	
	
Ls =2.7V2/R
2.9.6	
Sight Distance
	
i)	
Visibility is an important requirement for the safety of travel on roads. For this, 
it is necessary that sight distance of adequate length is available in different 
situations, to permit drivers enough time and distance to control their vehicles 
so that chances of accidents are minimized.
	
ii)	
On two-lane roads, at least twice the safe stopping sight distance shall be 
available throughout. The attempt should, however, be to provide overtaking 
sight distance in as much length of the road as possible.
	
iii)	
The recommended sight distances for various speeds are given in Table 2.6.

SECTION - 3
INTERSECTIONS AND GRADE SEPARATORS
3.1	
Introduction
3.1.1	
Subject to the provisions of this Manual, properly designed intersections shall be 
provided at all road crossings/junctions. The types and locations of Grade-separated Intersections 
shall be specified in Schedule ‘B’ of the Concession Agreement. The intersections to be provided 
shall be one of the following types:
	
i)	
At-grade intersections
	
ii)	
Grade separated intersections
3.1.2	
The existing intersections, which are deficient with respect to the minimum 
requirements shall be improved to the prescribed standards. Additional land, if any, required for 
improving the existing intersections shall be provided by the Authority. The types and locations of 
new Intersections, and grade-separated Intersections shall be based on requirements stipulated 
in IRC:SP:41, IRC:5, IRC:92 and MORTH Specifications for Road and Bridge works. These shall 
be specified in Schedule ‘B’ of the Concession Agreement.
3.1.3	
The exit and entry arrangement before and after a grade separator shall also be 
treated as part of the development of grade separator intersection.
3.2	
At-Grade Intersections
3.2.1	
General
	
i)	
Type of intersections to be adopted shall be decided on the basis of 
parameters like number of intersecting legs, traffic volume/speed, available 
right of way, type of traffic control (signalized/non-signalized) etc. Necessary 
traffic surveys for the design of road junctions shall be carried out as per 
IRC:SP:19.
	
ii)	
The design of different elements of intersection shall be done as per IRC:SP:41.
	
iii)	
The design shall aim at simplicity and uniformity in design standards. Complex 
designs which may involve complicated decision making by drivers shall be 
avoided.
 
iv) 
The intersection control shall be of ‘Stop Control’ unless specified otherwise. 
This will mean that traffic on the minor road must stop prior to entering the major 
road. Where roads of equal importance intersect, priority will be given to the 
traffic on the right. The traffic control by “STOP” or by “GIVEWAY” signs and 
pavement markings shall be decided based on the guidance given in IRC:67 
and IRC:35. The visibility funnel given in IRC:35 shall be encumbrance free 
to ensure the mutual visibility between traffic plying in main highway and that 
approach from side road.

v)	
At the intersection, the alignment of project highway shall be as straight and 
the gradient as flat as practicable. Gradients in excess of 2 per cent will not be 
allowed at intersections.
	
vi)	
The alignment and grade of intersecting roads shall be corrected to improve 
traffic conditions and safety. The intersecting roads shall be regraded, if 
required so that at least 30 m length of the intersecting road beyond junction 
is at the same level as that of main carriageway at the junction. The side road 
gradient even for the insignificant minor road that joins the main highway at 
least for the length that falls within the visibility funnel shall be near to flat 
gradient.
	
vii)	
The sight distance to be adopted shall be at least twice the safe stopping sight 
distance as specified in Section 2.
 
viii) At multi leg intersections, the points of conflict should be studied carefully and 
possibilities of realigning one or more of the intersecting legs and combining 
some movements to reduce the conflicting movements shall be examined.
	
	
The objective shall be to simplify the design and appropriate control devices 
added to ensure more efficient and safe operation.
3.2.2	
Design Standard
Design standards shall be as per IRC:SP:41. Salient features are given below:
	
i)	
Design Speed: The approach speed shall be taken as the design speed adopted 
for the section of Project Highway on which the intersection is located. The 
design speed for various elements of the intersection shall be taken as 60% of 
the approach speed.
 
ii) 
Design Traffic Volume: The traffic volume for the design of intersection and 
its distribution at peak hours shall be assessed, up to the operation period, 
taking into consideration the past trend, likely new development of land, socio- 
economic changes, etc.
	
iii)	
Design Vehicle: Semi-trailer combination (refer IRC:3) shall be used in the 
design of intersections.
	
iv)	
The number of lanes to be provided at the intersection shall be governed by 
peak hour traffic volume in each direction of travel and shall be determined 
based on the projected traffic for the year in which further capacity augmentation 
is considered. The minimum width of carriageway and slip road in junction area 
shall be as indicated in the junction layouts. Widening of carriageway shall be 
achieved depending upon the approach speed of traffic and based on taper 
rate stipulated below. Generally desirable minimum taper shall be followed. In 
unavoidable situations, absolute minimum values given in the Table 3.1 can be 
adopted.

Type and radius of curve of intersection: The type and radii of curves would 
depend upon the types of vehicles turning at the intersection and shall be 
decided based on the traffic data.
	
vi)	
Visibility at intersection: A minimum safe stopping sight distance, appropriate for 
the approach speeds, shall be available for the traffic on the Project Highway. 
3.2.3	
Traffic Control Devices
	
i)	
Road markings: Typical road markings for road intersection as given in IRC:SP:41 
and IRC:SP:35 shall be followed. The specifications of road markings shall be 
as given in Section 9 of this Manual.
	
ii)	
Signs: Traffic signs at the junctions shall be provided as per IRC:67 and 
Section 9 of this Manual.
 
iii) 
Reflectors: To guide the traffic, reflectors in the form of Reflective Pavement 
Markers (Road Studs), delineators, etc shall be provided, in addition to the road 
markings, especially at the channelizing islands.
3.2.4	
Typical at-Grade Junction Layouts
Based on the general principles and design standards laid out, the typical design provided below 
may be adopted
	
i)	
Major Junctions: For major at grade junctions, the layouts described below 
shall be adopted.
	
ii)	
Minor Junctions: Depending upon the situations, following layouts shall be 
applied for minor junctions.
Fig. 3.1 : Layout for T Junction with storage lane with physical island and is applicable for all 
junctions unless otherwise it falls in the minor junction category.
Fig. 3.2 : Layout for staggered Junction with storage lane with physical island and is applicable 
where there is enough space to convert a cross junction into a staggered junction.
Fig. 3.3 : Layout for roundabout/rotary where project highway joins or intersect with another 
road of more or less same both hierarchically as well as traffic volume wise and witnessing 
considerable right turning traffic. Roundabout/rotary can be adopted for rural and semi-urban 
location to have round-the-clock traffic control. The IRC:65 shall be followed for layout design of 
roundabout and rotary.

Fig. 3.4 : Layout for cross road with signalization and is applicable where approach traffic volume 
warrants traffic signal and can be adopted in junctions where there is predominate presence of 
pedestrians and cyclists. In order to ensure round the clock traffic control, signal shall be vehicle 
actuated.
Fig. 3.5 : Layout for Simple T junction for an insignificant side road like a property access in the 
project highway.
Fig. 3.6 : Layout for Simple Y or skew junction for an insignificant side road joining project 
highway, wherein the side road traffic has been made to join the project highway at nearly 
perpendicular in order to achieve mutual visibility between traffic approaching in project highway 
and that in side road. A direct taper of 50 m shall be given for merging and diverging and also to 
avoid rear end collision.
Fig. 3.7 : Layout for T Junction with storage lane with Ghost islands i.e. with markings. The 
layout is applicable for a minor junction, even if there is few right turning movement to side road, 
as at some locations, the land availability does not permit to provide a junction with shelter lane 
protected with physical island. Unlike the simple junctions, the small vehicles can still find a 
shelter, avoiding waiting in the fast lane of through traffic, as they are intended to ply on priority.

Interchanges
3.4.1	
General
	
i)	
An Interchange is a grade-separated intersection with connecting roadways 
(ramps) for turning traffic between highway approaches. Such an Interchange 
will be necessary at all crossings of a highway, which is to be developed to 
completely access controlled standards. An Interchange may also be justified at 
locations where traffic on cross roads is heavy and when an At-grade intersection 
fails to handle the heavy volume of turning, merging and diverging traffic leading 
to excessive delays and fatal and major accidents. 
	
	
Cost effectiveness will decide whether to provide full Interchange or grade 
separated intersection without ramps.
 
ii) 
An Interchange may be justified at the crossing of the Project Highway with 
another highway, and where the total traffic on all the arms of the intersection is 
in excess of 10,000 PCUs in peak hour.
	
iii)	
The decision to provide Interchange at such locations shall be taken by the 
Authority and the requirement shall be clearly spelt out in Schedule ‘B’ of the 
Concession Agreement, which shall also indicate specifications and traffic 
streams to be grade separated.
	
iv)	
The detailed design and layout of the Interchange shall conform to broad 
parameters and requirements specified by the Authority in Schedule ‘B’ of 
the Concession Agreement. Based on detailed survey and investigations, the 
Concessionaire shall develop appropriate detailed drawings and designs and 
submit to the Independent Engineer for review and comments, if any.

3.4.2	
Types of Interchanges
	
i)	
Interchanges are generally described by the pattern of the various turning 
roadways or ramps, which determine their geometric configuration. The common 
geometric configurations of Interchanges are the trumpet, diamond, cloverleaf, 
rotary and directional. Within each type of Interchange, there can be several 
variations such as split diamond, partial cloverleaf, etc. depending on the ramp 
arrangements.
	
ii)	
The type of Interchanges, the shape and pattern of the Interchange ramps 
and loops and their designs shall be governed by factors such as the 
importance of the intersecting highway, the number of intersecting legs, the 
design volumes of through and turning traffic movements including their 
composition, the design speeds, available right of way and topography. The 
Interchange site shall be studied in detail and alternative designs made, to 
determine the most suitable arrangement of structures and ramps satisfying 
the specified requirements.
3.4.3	
Geometric Design Standards for Interchange Elements
The geometric design standards shall be as per IRC:92 appropriate for the design speed adopted 
for the Project Highway. The design speed for ramps shall not be less than 40 km per hour. 
The desirable values of various parameters given in IRC:92 shall be adopted, unless there are 
severe site constraints.
3.4.4	
Design Traffic
The traffic volume for the design of various elements of Interchange including ramps shall be 
assessed up to the end of the Concession Period or twenty years, whichever is more, taking into 
consideration the past trends, likely new development of land, socio-economic changes, etc.
3.4.5	
Design of Structure
For design of structure of grade-separated structure comprising of main structure and ramps, 
the details given in Sections 7 and 8 of this Manual shall be followed. Minimum length of viaduct 
required to be provided at various grade-separated structure shall be specified by the Authority 
in Schedule ‘B’ of the Concession Agreement.
3.4.6	
Traffic Control Devices
Traffic signs (refer IRC:67) shall be provided at suitable locations to:
	
i)	
Serve as advance notice of the approaches to the Interchanges;
	
ii)	
Direct drivers into appropriate lanes for diverging/merging movements;

IRC:SP:73-2018
56
6.7.2.2 
Efficient drainage of the deck structure shall be ensured by providing a suitably 
designed drainage arrangement consisting of drainage spouts connected to horizontal 
and vertical pipe system such that the water from the structure does not fall on the road, 
does not stagnate over the road or at entry and exit points of grade separated structure 
and is discharged into the draining system of the area. Care must be taken that the 
pipes are taken down in such a way that they are aesthetically pleasing.
6.7.2.3	
Typically, water spouts are provided at the kerbs at the rate of 1 No. per 
12 sqm of the surface in level portions and 1 No. per 15 sqm of the surface area on 
gradients. Water spouts are connected to runner pipe of suitable diameter (minimum 
100 mm) on either side of roadway and taken down by downtake pipes at pier  and 
abutment locations.
6.7.2.4 
Drainage fixtures and downspouts shall be of rigid, corrosion resistant material 
not less than 100 mm as the least dimension and shall be provided with suitable clean 
out fixtures.
6.7.2.5 
The arrangement of floor drains shall be such as to prevent the splashing 
discharge of drainage water against any portion of the structure. Overhanging portions 
of concrete floors shall be provided with drip moulds.
6.7.2.6	
Catch water drains are necessary at the ends of viaduct portion so that water 
coming from grade separated structure does not over saturate and affect the earthen 
embankment. Similar catch water drains should be provided at the end of gradient so 
that water coming from the structure is properly let out to nearest drain.
6.7.2.7	
An integrated drainage plan for the water coming from the deck of structures, 
local catchment area of the project and all other sources should be prepared so that 
no water falls on any surface of the structures, or remain standing or flowing over the 
level roads. All the water is collected through sumps and finally discharged into the local 
drainage system i.e. storm water drain/pipes etc. either by gravity through connecting 
drains or by pumping into the existing outgoing drains.
6.7.2.8 
The rainwater from the deck of the structures usually does not flow transversely 
but flows on the high gradient slopes of the road or approaches and is collected in the 
valley curve portion. As such attention is to be paid to get this large quantity of water 
drained out fast without accumulating there causing problems for traffic flow resulting in 
traffic jams. The draining out systems should be designed with greater margins so as to 
avoid this problem, at least for grade separators, inside the cities or inhabited areas.
6.7.3	
Underpasses and Subways
6.7.3.1 
Where rain water cannot flow into the drainage system by gravity due to the 
requirement of depressed road to get minimum head room, necessary provision for 
drainage by vertical drains and/or pumping shall be made so that there is no disruption 
of traffic through such location on account of waterlogging/flooding of underpass or 
subway.

Existing Drains, Canals and Minor Waterways
6.8.1	
For the existing drains, canals and waterways, to be over passed by the 
highway, draining provisions shall be maintained and the effects of prolonged heavy 
rainfall must be catered for.
6.8.2	
Special attention shall be paid to the drainage channels carrying industrial 
waste and effluent in particular to those draining chloride contaminated effluents which 
are detrimental to the RCC structures.
6.8.3	
Adequate care shall be taken while crossing irrigation canals to prevent 
contamination of the flow in the canal by spillage from the highway.
6.8.4	
When highway runs parallel to existing channels, adequate measures shall 
be taken in the form of bank protection and channel alignment to avoid water build 
up or stagnation against the highway slope endangering the pavement drainage. The 
drainage channels at the toe of the highway may have to be adequately protected or 
reshaped for discharge into these channels. Where the discharge from road drainage 
is not permitted, separate cross drainage structures are to be provided on both sides of 
such channel.

TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES AND ROAD SAFETY WORKS
9.1	
General
The highways being built under various road development programmes are adopting the 
geometric standards specifications, signage, road markings etc. as per the provisions 
contained in the codes of practice and the standards of the Indian Roads Congress 
supported by the Ministry’s specifications. However, accident data demonstrates that 
motorists leave the roadway for numerous reasons including errors of judgment. To ensure 
long term road safety on these highways, the following suitable engineering measure are 
considered essential for adoption so as to help in reducing risk of road crashes.
Traffic Control Devices, Road Safety Devices and Road Side Furniture shall comprise 
of road signs, road markings, object markers, hazard markers, studs, delineators,

9.7	
Roadside and Median Safety Barriers
There are two types of safety barriers viz., roadside safety barriers and median safety barriers.
9.7.1	
Road Side Safety Barriers
	
i)	
Warrants: The longitudinal roadside barriers are basically meant to 
shield two types of roadside hazards i.e. embankments and roadside 
obstacles and also for preventing the vehicles veering off the sharp 
curves. Therefore, all embankments with height 3 m or more shall have 
safety barriers at the edge of formation, with delineating reflectors fitted 
on them. W-beam barrier shall be provided along all curves having radii 
upto 450 m for complete length of curves including transitions and 20 m 
further before and after the curve.
	
	
Normally, on shoulder side, the lateral distance of at least 0.75 to 1.0 m 
width from edge of paved portion (i.e. carriageway + paved shoulder) 
should be available without any obstacles. Wherever a permanent object 
cannot be removed for some reasons, provision of tandems viz. W-beam 
metal crash barriers and hazard markers with reflectors must be made. 
Further, frangible lighting columns and sign posts need to be used for 
minimizing the severity in case of collision.
	
	
Irrespective of type of barrier being used, the slope in front of W-beam 
or wire rope or rigid barrier shall be near to flat gradient so that safety 



======================================================================
PAGE 98 of 227
======================================================================
IRC:SP:73-2018
88
barrier perform best when impacted by a vehicle and the slope of ground 
in front of barrier shall not be steeper than 10:1.
	
	
Some of the commonly encountered roadside obstacles are bridge piers, 
abutments and railing ends, roadside rock mass, culverts, pipes and 
head walls, cut slopes, retaining walls, lighting supports, traffic signs and 
signal supports, trees and utility poles.
9.7.1.1	
Types of roadside safety barriers
There are three types of longitudinal roadside safety barriers viz:
	
a)	
Semi-rigid type like
 
● 
“W” beam type steel barrier
 
● 
Thrie beam type steel barrier
	
b)	
Rigid type (like concrete crash barriers) 
	
c )	 Flexible type (like wire rope fencing)
The steel barriers with strong post type usually remain functional after moderate 
collisions, thereby eliminating the need for immediate repair. If damaged by a vehicle 
collision, both posts and rails of W-beam are to be repaired. Lack in maintenance can 
cause the W-beam rails to protrude into traffic way creating highly unsafe situation. The 
wire rope though technically complicated, can be repaired with minimum costs. Though 
initial installation cost is relatively high for concrete rigid barrier compared to W-beam 
and wire rope safety barriers, the repair and maintenance issues can be minimized 
greatly in concrete rigid barrier. The psychological shyness of drivers to keep away from 
the safety barrier will be the least in rigid concrete barrier compared to other types. Since 
rigid barriers will not yield under any vehicle impact, it shall be provided for bridges and 
ROBs and also to shield roadside objects/hazards where the required set back distance 
cannot be retained with wire rope and W-Beam (due to any site condition), as they are 
deflective in nature.
Invariably W-beam and wire rope barrier shall not be installed upon a structure. For 
a median upon a structure, it shall be concrete rigid barrier. Wire Rope Safety Barrier 
shall not be used over major or minor bridges.
9.7.2	
Road Side Steel Barriers
	
a)	
Design aspects: The “W” beam type safety barrier consists of steel 
posts and a 3 mm thick “W” beam rail. There shall be a steel spacer block 
between the post and the beam to prevent the vehicle from snagging on 
the post, as the snagging can cause the vehicle to spin round. The steel 
posts and the blocking out spacer shall both be channel section of 75 
mm x 150 mm size and 5 mm thick. The posts shall be spaced 2 m center 
to center. Fig. 9.10 gives the typical details of ‘W’ beam rail and splices 
and shall be procured and installed from a reputed manufacturer.
	
	
The Thrie beam safety barrier shall have posts and spacers similar to the 
ones mentioned above for “W” beam type. The rail and splices design 



======================================================================
PAGE 99 of 227
======================================================================

IRC:SP:73-2018
89
details for typical Thrie beam are shown in Fig. 9.11 and shall be from 
a reputed manufacturer. This barrier has higher initial cost than the “W” 
beam type but is less prone to damages to vehicle collisions especially 
for shallow angle impacts.
 
 
The “W” beam, the Thrie beam and the posts spacers and fasteners for steel 
barriers shall be galvanized by hot dip process and design elements and 
installations shall be as per the details shown for crash barrier in this Manual 
so as to achieve the performance characteristics intended for ‘W’ beam. For 
any structural elements and details missing in this Manual for ‘W’ beam and 
its various end treatments, the details from international guidelines/manuals on 
‘W’-beam which would conform to EN 1317 Part-2 can be adopted.
	
b)	
End treatment for steel barrier: If hit, an untreated end of the roadside 
barrier can be hazardous, because the barrier beam can penetrate the 
passenger compartment and cause the impact vehicle to stop abruptly. 
End treatments should, therefore, form an integral part of safety barriers 
and the end treatment should not spear vault or roll a vehicle for head 
on or angled impacts. The end treatment on approach shall be Modified 
Eccentric Loader Terminal (MELT) arrangement as shown in Fig. 9.12 
and departure sides it shall be Trailing Terminal (TT) arrangement as 
shown in Fig. 9.13. The international practices shall be adopted for 
those details which are not available in this Manual for MELT and TT 
arrangements for the end treatment of ‘W’ beam.
	
	
The ‘W’ Beam to concrete transition shall be carried out by decreasing 
the post spacing, nesting one rail behind another and using steel section 
behind the ‘W’ Beam. The transition between ‘W’ beam and concrete 
barrier is detailed in Fig. 9.14 or tested transition should be allowed.
	
c)	
Placement: Placement recommendations determine the exact layout of 
the barrier and shall be made by the design engineer keeping in view 
the lateral offset of the barrier and flare rate. The final layout shall be 
as site-specific combination of these factors. The barriers shall be as 
far away from the traffic as possible and shall preferably have uniform 
clearance between the traffic and the hazard. As far as possible, the 
safety barrier shall be placed beyond 2.5 m of the travelled way. For long 
and continuous stretches, this offset is not critical. The distance between 
the barrier and the hazard shall not be less than the deflection of the 
barrier by an impact of a full sized vehicle. In case of embankments, a 
minimum distance of 600 mm shall be maintained between the barrier 
and the start of embankment slope of a hazard to prevent the wheels 
from dropping over the edge.
	
	
The ‘W’ beam and thrie beam perform well on the outside of curves and 
even those of relatively small radius. When a kerb exists on the edge 
of road and on to close proximity traffic way whether on shoulder or 
median edge lines, a distance not more than 100 mm shall be maintained 
between vertical face of kerb and ‘W’ beam or thrie beam face to ensure 



======================================================================
PAGE 100 of 227
======================================================================
IRC:SP:73-2018
90
that impacting vehicle do not vault over safety barrier and at the same 
time reduces the nuisance hit. The steel barrier shall be placed in such a 
way so as to be collided by vehicle directly.
9.7.3	
Road Side Concrete Barriers
	
a)	
Design aspects: Roadside concrete safety barriers are rigid barriers 
having a sloped front face and a vertical back face. For uniformity New 
Jersey type concrete barriers should be used where necessary. Rigid 
crash barriers may however be required only in constrained urban location 
between main carriageway and service road. The concrete barrier may 
be pre-cast in lengths of up to 6 m depending upon the feasibility of 
transport and lifting arrangements. Concrete grade for the barriers shall 
not be leaner than M 30. The minimum thickness of foundations shall 
be 25 mm thick cement concrete or hot mix asphalt placed at the base 
of barrier to provide lateral restraint. Where more than 75 mm thick over 
lay on the road pavement is anticipated, the foundation step may be 
increased to 125 mm. However, longitudinal roadside concrete barrier 
should have elaborate footing design which is structurally safe unless 
sufficient earth support is available. Suggested flare rates depending 
upon the design speed are given in Table 9.2.

14:1
60
11:1
40
8:1
	
b)	
End treatment: Safety barrier shall be provided with an end treatment, 
which shall be obtained by tapering the height of terminating end of the 
median barrier within a length of 8 m to 9 m.
	
c)	
Placement: Placement recommendations for roadside steel barriers, mentioned 
in Para 9.7.2 (c) are applicable to roadside concrete barriers as well.
9.7.4	
Wire Rope Safety Barrier
	
a)	
Design aspects: The wire rope barriers/systems are suitable for either 
shoulder and/or median side application, provided there is adequate 
clearance to account for their deflection, as per manufactures system 
design specification and standards. The slope of surface between traffic 
way and wire rope safety barrier shall always be flatter than 10:1 and there 
shall not any object or raised kerb in between so to enable the cables 
to readily disengage from posts during impact and thereby minimizing 
snagging and ensuring that the vehicle is smoothly redirected.
	
	
Wire rope barrier can be repaired quickly and only damaged posts are 
to be replaced. High tension 3 rope or 4 rope wire system confirming

the requirements of EN 1317-2 for higher containment Level of H2 shall 
be used. Typical details of wire rope barrier are given in Fig. 9.15 and 
wire rope barrier with ropes interwoven are also presented in Fig. 9.16. 
The wire rope barrier shall be the proprietary product of an approved 
manufacture. The material and design of wire rope shall be as per the 
MORTH Specification.
	
b)	
End treatment: The end treatment shall be as per the manufactures 
details conforming to EN 1317 Part 2. The wire rope to ‘W’ beam transition 
shall be done Modified Eccentric Loader Terminal (MELT) arrangement 
as shown in Fig. 9.17 or as per Manufacturer’s approved design. The 
termination of wire rope to a rigid or concrete barrier or a parapet shall be 
avoided and there shall be a transition from wire rope to W-beam in-turn 
to concrete barrier as shown in Fig. 9.18.
	
c)	
Placement: The placement of the Wire Rope Safety Barrier shall be 
determined by the design engineer and shall be a combination of the 
deflection ratios of the barrier and the site-specific conditions. The 
barrier shall be placed as far away from the traffic as possible and shall 
preferably have uniform clearance. The lateral slope of surface between 
traffic way and wire rope safety shall always be flatter than 10:1 so that 
vehicle bumper trajectory will not change before an errant vehicle hit the 
wire rope.
When Wire Rope Safety Barrier is provided in front of a hazard, it shall be so located caters 
to the deflection specified by the manufacture. The barrier shall be extended at full height 
not less than 30 m in advance of the hazard on the approach side, and shall continue at 
full height for 7.5 m beyond the hazard on the departure side. The minimum length of fence 
shall be no less than 50 m. If there is a hazard present in the deflection area of the barrier, 
then the distance between fence and the hazard shall not be less than that deflection values 
described by the manufacture and will depend upon the post spacing.
There shall be at least 1 m setback distance between wire rope safety barrier and the start 
of drop or embankment slope. While installing wire rope on a highway carrying two/three-
wheelers and other small vehicles, the deflection as specified by the manufacturer shall 
be maintained as set back distance from the start of drop or embankment. The deflection 
can be reduced by closer post spacing, however the minimum setback distance shall be 
ensured. Wire rope can be installed for curves radii more than 450 m only.
The Wire Rope Safety Barrier shall not be permitted in following situations:
 
● 
Where a hazard is present within the deflection area of the fence.
 
● 
Where total fence length is less than 50 m
 
● 
On a horizontal curves of radius 450 m or less but not less than 200 m.
 
● 
On vertical sag curves of radius less than 3 km.
 
● 
Where rate of change in setback is steeper than 1 in 10.

the highway at predetermined and safe locations. As the guardrails would 
confine the movement of pedestrians to the footpath, it is obligatory that 
sufficient width of footpath be made available for the use of pedestrians.
	
ii)	
Design: The design shall be such that the guardrails are neat and simple 
in appearance. The height of guardrail shall be 1.2 m from foot path 
level. The visibility of the approaching vehicles by the pedestrians as 
well as the visibility of the pedestrians by the drivers of the approaching

Pedestrian crossings shall be provided where they will be well used. 
Pedestrian crossings shall be suitably integrated with the overall design 
of the inter section.
	
ii)	
The following criteria shall be followed regarding selection of pedestrian 
crossing:
	
a)	
At-grade Pedestrian Crossing (pedestrian cross walk): 
Pedestrian cross walks shall be provided at all important inter 
sections and such other locations where substantial conflict 
exists between vehicular and pedestrian movements. Wherever 
possible, the cross walks shall be at right angles to the carriageway 
and properly marked so that the pedestrians are subjected to 
minimum inconvenience. Cross walks shall not substantially 
increase the walk distance of pedestrians. Adequate visibility, 
freedom from obstructions and sufficient space for waiting are 
the other important requirements for location of cross walks.
	
	
At-grade pedestrian crossings can be uncontrolled or controlled. 
Uncontrolled pedestrian crossings shall be provided only where the 
inter section itself is left uncontrolled because of low volumes of both 
vehicular and pedestrian traffic even during peak hours and where 
accident records do not indicate any need to segregate vehicular 
traffic from cross pedestrian traffic. Uncontrolled pedestrian cross 
walk shall be marked by studs or paint line.
	
	
Controlled form of crossing shall be achieved through provision 
of Zebra Crossings, whether at a non-signalized or signalized 
intersection. Fig. 9.20 gives a typically out of pedestrian cross walk 
in an intersection.
	
b)	
Zebra Crossing: A zebra crossing shall not be sited within 150 m 
of another such crossing. The zebra crossing shall be somewhat 
set back from the carriageway line. However, the set back distance 
shall not be so much as to cause an appreciable increase in 
walking distance for the pedestrians. Pedestrian guard rails may be 
necessary where the set back distance is appreciable or at the skew 
crossings.
	
	
The width of the zebra crossing shall be adequate and shall generally 
lie within a range of 2.0 m to 4.0 m. The crossing shall, as far as 
possible, proceed uninterrupted through the median strip. In the 
event of the median strip being used as pedestrian refuge, adequate 
width of median shall be provided. Incase of raised medians, such 
portion could be suitably depressed with kerb height not exceeding 
150 mm.
 
 
In the vicinity of zebra crossing, guard rails of sufficient length shall 
be provided to deter pedestrians from crossing the road at any 
arbitrary point along the road. Fig 9.21 gives a typical layout zebra 
crossing in a mid-block section.

Dropped kerbs (ramps) shall be provided at all the at grade pedestrian 
crossings as per Clause 6.2.3 and 6.7 of IRC:103-2012. 
9.9 
Work Zone Traffic Management Plans (WTMPs)
The traffic diversion plan during construction shall be prepared as per IRC:SP:55 for the 
entire project highway. Separate traffic diversion plan shall be prepared for structures 
and CD works. Following suggested layouts presented in IRC:SP:55 are recommended 
for various construction scenarios. Suiting the specific site requirements, the application 
steps described therein shall be followed.
9.9.1	
Lateral Widening
The layout Fig 9.22 shown is applicable when a two lane highway is upgraded to 2-lane 
with paved shoulder with eccentric widening. In the first stage, the traffic will continue to 
ply through the existing road.
9.9.2	
Single/Intermediate Lane Road to 2-lane 
9.9.2.1	
The layout Fig 9.23 for Stage-1 shown is applicable when a single lane or 
intermediate or two lane carriageway is upgraded to standard two lanes with paved 
or earthen shoulder. In this stage, the work will be taken up adjacent to existing traffic 
movement with traffic control measures. Layout of signs and barriers would be as 
shown. In Fig 9.23, there is layout for preparing surface to facilitate temporary traffic 
movement is also shown: The layout shown is applicable (if at all required) to prepare 
additional width to achieve 5.5 m width to facilitate two directional traffic movement with 
the pavement composition and thickness which can withstand the temporarily diverted 
traffic for a length from transition zone to termination zone. 
9.9.2.2 
In the subsequent stage, the traffic will be diverted to the portion of carriageway 
and shoulder developed during the first stage. Layout of signs and barriers would be as 
shown in Fig 9.24 for Stage-2.
9.9.3	
Temporary Diversion for CD Structures
The layout, Fig 9.25 shown is applicable when a Cross Drainage structure has 
to be constructed and where a temporary diversion will need to be constructed for 
maintaining the traffic flow. The diversion in most cases would be on embankment; 
therefore, delineation is essential for both day and night time. Temporary diversion shall 
be developed and maintained to accommodate all types of vehicles likely to ply through 
the road.
9.9.4	
Work at the center of Carriageway
The layout, Fig 9.26 shown is applicable for short term maintenance activities at the 
center of a carriageway. Generally, traffic cones are used so that it can be placed and 
removed easily.

9.9.5	
Flyover/VUP Construction
9.9.5.1	
The layout, Fig 9.27 shows the Stage-1 in flyover/VUP construction. In the 
first stage, the traffic will be diverted to a service road or temporary road. The turning 
movements would continue at the existing intersection and construction of piers/
embankment/RE wall would be taken up in the cordoned portion. Carefully planned 
pedestrian markings on the roads and protected safe passage for crossing of pedestrians 
shall be provided through work area.
9.9.5.2	
The layout of Fig 9.28 shows Stage-2 of flyover/VUP construction. In the 
second stage, the central portion will be taken up and junction will be blocked for direct 
cross road movement. During this short period of time, cross road movement will be 
accommodated like a circulatory movement using U-turn, whereas the through traffic 
will continue to ply through service road/temporary road. Direction signs would be 
carefully planned and installed. Carefully planned pedestrian markings on the roads 
and protected safe passage for crossing of pedestrians shall be provided through work 
area.

The function of the ALB is to control the passage of vehicles through the lane. Each lane shall 
be fitted with an ALB, the exact location of the ALB shall be provided by the Concessionaire in 
the lane layout drawing at the time of tender.
The operation of barrier is linked to the lane controller. It allows the vehicle to pass through after 
a successful transaction has happened at the lane. 
The system consists of a fixed housing and a movable arm with a high impact breakaway device 
or provision. The housing shall contain the motor and control units along with the integrated 
metal detectors for vehicle detection purpose. The housing shall be installed on the right side of 
the traffic direction, after the booth on a concrete base.
The boom arms shall be fitted with a swing-away flange to prevent damages to the barrier/
vehicle in case of an unpermitted or forced drive-through.  Boom contact shall be available which 
gives continuous alert to the TMS when the boom is missing or swung away.

prevent barrier arms coming down on vehicles while passing. This shall be in 
the form of infrared units and dedicated embedded loops. Apart from the barrier 
arm, the mechanism may not have any moving protrusions that pose a risk to 
persons standing in close proximity to the barrier.
	
iii)	
The barrier arm shall be fabricated from a light, corrosion resistant material 
readily and inexpensively available in India. The barrier arm shall further have 
a protective mechanism whereby controlled fracture of the barrier arm occurs 
without damage to the housing or motor in the event of frontal collision. Preference

a protection mechanism to detect the presence of vehicles to avoid accidental 
hitting on the vehicles, whenever the boom is triggered for closing.
	
iv)	
Suitable power supply scheme shall be implemented by the Contractor to feed 
the Exit barrier to protect the source from being damaged due to electrical surges/
spikes injected by the dynamic (inductive) load. Further, the drive shall be so 
designed as to the damping factor is just sufficient for the drive to operate the 
booms without any jerks during open/close to avoid freak hitting by the exiting 
vehicles.

The Concessionaire shall also maintain the trees and shrubs in good condition during 
the concession period as part of the maintenance schedule. The guidelines given in this 
Section shall be followed in plantation of trees and shrubs.
11.2	 Design Considerations in various locations
11.2.1	
Set-Back Distance of Trees and other Plantation
Trees on the roadside shall be sufficiently away from the roadway so that they are 
not a hazard to road traffic or restrict the visibility. Most vulnerable locations in this 
regard are the inside of curves, junction corners and cut slopes. Trees shall be placed 
at a minimum distance of 10-11 m from the centre line of the extreme traffic lane to 
provide recovery area for the vehicle that runs off the road. A second row of trees 6 m 
further away will also be planted, wherever possible. Preferably, the first row of trees 
shall consist of species with thick shade and other rows of vertical type providing thin 
shade. Expansion of the project highway to 4-lanes shall be taken into consideration 
while locating the trees so that land is free of trees when further widening takes 
place. In case future widening is not to be considered the same shall be specified in 
Schedule ‘D’ of Concession Agreement. The distances for alternative rows of trees shall 
be reckoned from the nearest edge of the pavement. No plantation shall be allowed on 
the embankment slopes.
11.2.2	
Set-Back of Trees on Curves
In plain terrain, as topping sight distance of 180 m corresponding to the design speed 
of 100 km per hour shall be ensured on all curved sections of project highways along 
the inner most lane. However, where there are site restrictions, their requirement may 
be reduced to 130 m corresponding to the design speed of 80 km per hour as a special 
case. The existing trees and vegetation on the sides have to be suitably thinned/trimmed 
or even removed, if necessary, and a regular programme of pruning of the offending 
trees shall be undertaken as part of the maintenance operations. In all cases, location 
of trees shall be checked to ensure that clear vision of all highway signs/signals is

available at all times to the motorists. Also, the foliage or trees shall not come in the way 
of roadway lighting.
In urban/built-up sections of the Project Highway, trees can be planted on the raised 
footpaths, provided the distance between the edge of the kerbs and the nearest edge 
of tree is not less than 2 m.
11.2.3	
Vertical Clearance of Trees and other Plantations
For safe traffic operation, the vertical clearance available across the roadway shall be 
minimum 5 m. From this angle, the probable size of all plants shall be anticipated in 
advance, at the time of initial planting. To allow for the effects of growth, wind and rain, 
trees shall be trimmed to 6 m and 6.5 m above the pavement in rural and urban areas 
respectively.
11.2.4	
Deleted
11.2.5	
Spacing of Avenue Trees
The spacing of avenue trees will depend on the type and growth characteristics of 
trees, requirement of maintenance, penetration of distant views, etc. A range of 10-15 
m would meet the requirement for most varieties.
11.2.6	
Choice of Trees
The following guidelines shall be kept in view while selecting the species of trees to be 
planted:
	
i)	
Trees shall be selected with due regard to soil, rainfall, temperature and 
water level.
	
ii)	
Trees which become very wide shall be avoided as their maintenance 
would cause interference with traffic flow.
	
iii)	
The species must be capable of developing a straight and clean bole 
upto a height of 2.5 to 3.5 m from the ground level.
 
iv) 
The selected trees shall, preferably, be fast growing and wind-firm. These 
shall not be thorny or drop too many leaves.
	
v)	
The trees shall be deep rooted as shallow roots injure pavements.
	
vi)	
In urban areas, the species selected shall be of less spreading type, so 
that these do not interfere with overhead services, clear view of signs/
signals and efficiency of roadway lighting.
11.3	 Landscape Treatment
A suitable landscape treatment with provision of foundations and coloured lighting so 
as to enhance the overall aesthetics duly designed by a qualified and experienced 
landscaping architect, shall be provided at grade separators, elevated sections,

case where bus stands are provided by the concerned State Government Transport 
Authority, the Concessionaire shall provide only access road within the Right of Way.
12.6.2	
Location
The location of the bus bays shall be fixed on the basis of following principles:
	
i)	
The bus stops shall be sited away from bridges and other important 
structures and embankment sections more than 3 m high.
	
ii)	
As far as possible, bus bays shall not be located on horizontal curves or

due to space constraints, it can be provided with Ghost island also as 
given in Fig. 12.2.
	
iv)	
Bus bays shall be provided on both sides of the project highway for each 
direction of travel independently, so that the buses do not have to cut 
across the road. Bus bays on opposite sides shall be staggered to a 
certain extent to avoid undue congestion on the highway. At intersections, 
the bus bays for up and down direction shall be located on farther sides 
of the intersection.
	
v)	
Covered steps with rise not exceeding 150 mm (minimum 5 m wide) 
along with a ramp for use of disabled persons (1 m wide minimum) with 
railing on either side shall be provided for climbing up/down from bus 
shelter to underpass/overpass to carriageway and vice versa. The cover

ETC PRE-SCREENING ARRANGEMENT AND OPERATION
A)	
VEHICLE WITH VALID TAG
When the vehicle approaches the dedicated ETC lane, the first transceiver reads the Tag and 
allow the vehicle to proceed.
B)	
VEHICLE WITHOUT TAG OR INVALID TAG
When the vehicle approaches the dedicated ETC Jane, the first transceiver detects vehicle as 
non-Tag I invalid Tag and bring down the barrier blocking the entry to ETC lane. This will force 
the vehicle to eject from the ETC lane and go to adjacent Cash Lanes.
