Guidelines for Traffic Forecast on Highways
1 Introduction
This guideline is intended for use by traffic engineers/planners to forecast traffic on highways 
and inter-urban roads. This document is structured in Three Sections. Section A describes 
the basic concepts and gives a brief overview of the forecasting process. Section B highlights 
the methodological aspects related to traffic forecasting on inter-urban roads/highways. In 
Section C, several example problems are provided to help traffic engineers/planners to carry 
out project specific calculations in a similar manner.
The revised draft Guidelines for Traffic Forecast on Highways, IRC:108-2014 was prepared 
by the Sub-group comprising Dr. Bhargab Maitra, Dr. M.R. Tagore, Dr. S. Velmurugan and 
Dr. P.K. Sarkar. The Committee deliberated on the draft revision in a series of meetings. The 
Transport Planning and Traffic Engineering Committee (H-1) approved the draft revision in 
its meeting held on 26.07.2014 for placing before the Highways Specifications & Standards 
Committee (HSS).

Section : A 
Basic Concepts and Overview of Forecasting Process
A.1 
Need for Traffic Forecasting
All projects relating to roads and highways need the fundamental input of traffic volume to 
be catered for by the facility. This is true for any present day analysis or assessment of the 
facility in future date. Therefore, it is imperative that a traffic forecast is necessary to evaluate 
the case on a future date.
Any forecast will be as good as the data that are used as input to the forecasting method and 
process. Thus, forecast cannot be considered to be totally accurate and forecasts for longer 
horizons need to be reviewed and revised with the progression of time using the available 
data progressively. Also, this is a function of the method used and disaggregation used in the 
forecasting process.
Therefore, all designs, analysis and evaluation related to roads and highways shall require 
traffic forecasts as input. So much so, the economic and financial viability of projects are 
largely ruled by the traffic forecast.
A.2	
Basic Terminologies
In the context of traffic forecast on highways, several terminologies are used. These 
terminologies are defined below:
Average Daily Traffic (ADT): The total volume of traffic passing a point or segment of a 
roadway during a given time period (more than a day and less than a year) divided by the 
number of days in that time period.
Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT): The total volume of traffic passing a point or segment 
of a roadway during one full year divided by the number of days in the year.
Base Year: It is the year when all primary traffic surveys are carried out. Base year is also 
that year beyond which traffic projections are carried out.
Capacity: The maximum sustainable hourly flow rate at which persons or vehicles reasonably 
can be expected to traverse a point or a uniform section of a lane or roadway under prevailing 
roadway, environmental, traffic and control conditions.
Control Count Stations: Control count stations are selected representative locations where 
classified volume counts are carried out over the complete survey period to measure and 
quantify variation of traffic volume patterns.
Coverage Count Stations: Coverage count stations are those locations where classified 
volume counts are carried out only for a part of the complete survey period. Each coverage 
count station shall have a representative control count station to establish variation in traffic 
volume pattern over the complete study period.
Design Hourly Volume (DHV): It is that hourly volume in a year which is used to judge the 
capacity requirement. DHV is normally taken as 30th highest hourly volume, which means 
that only for 29 hours in a year the traffic volume can exceed the design volume.
Design Period: The period in future for which the road is designed.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:108-2015

Directional Distribution: A characteristic of traffic, that the volume may be greater in one 
direction than in the other during any period on a highway. Directional distribution indicates 
the percentage distribution of total traffic in two directions of travel. This is more relevant for 
undivided roads and an important input for capacity analysis and pavement design.
Forecast Period: The total length of time span covered by the traffic forecast. It is equal to 
the difference between the end year of the design period and the base year.
Horizon Year: The future years to which a planning activity is directed, which may be more 
than one. The traffic volume forecast is also done for each horizon year.
Level of Service (LOS): A quantitative stratification of a performance measure or measure 
that represents quality of service, measured on an A to F scale, with LOS-A representing the 
best operating conditions from the traveler’s perspective and LOS-F the worst.
Peak Hour Factor (PHF): The hourly volume during the analysis hour divided by the 
4 x peak 15-minute flow rate within the analysis hour. The PHF is also considered as a 
measure to estimate traffic demand fluctuations within the peak hour. (The use of PHF is 
remote in case of highway traffic analysis, unless intersections are considered).
Peak Hour Proportion (PHP): The volume of traffic during the peak hour (highest hourly 
volume in a 24 hour day) expressed as percentage of total 24 hour traffic volume in a day. 
This is normally used for reverse calculation of daily traffic volume from peak hour volume 
estimated from traffic survey for a shorter duration than 24 hours.
Project Influence Area (PIA): The geographical area where the impact of the upcoming 
proposed highway development will be predominant. Alternatively, it is also the geographical 
area the development of which will influence the traffic of the specific highway project. The 
socio-economic profile of the PIA is expected to have influence on the traffic volume of the 
project corridor.
Seasonal Factor: Seasonal Factors consider variation of travel demand during different 
months or seasons in a year. Generally, these factors are estimated based on data from 
permanent traffic count stations. But, in absence of such data, secondary data like petrol and 
diesel sales data along the project corridor may be used to formulate the seasonal factors.
Service Flow Rate: The maximum directional rate of flow that can be sustained in a given 
segment under prevailing roadway, traffic, and control conditions.
Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ): The basic geographic unit for inventorying demographic data 
and land use within a study area. The size and shape of TAZs can influence model results. 
Highway trip loadings and the percent of intra-zonal trips are directly impacted by study area 
zonal detail and the size of the zone. 
A.3	
Design Period
The design period may vary from one project to another. In majority of road projects, the 
design period may be taken as 15 or 20 years. It is important to specify the design period, 
since traffic volume forecasts are required from the starting year to the end-year of the 
design period. The growth of traffic may not be uniform throughout the design period due to 
various reasons. A common practice of dividing the design period into suitable time spans 



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 37
======================================================================

IRC:108-2015
5
(with intermediate horizons) and estimation of the growth factors for each time span may 
be adopted, and the traffic volume forecast at the end of each time span be reported. For 
example, if the base year for a project is 2013, and the design period is 20 years, and if 
the road is expected to be opened to traffic in 2017, then traffic forecast is necessary up 
to horizon year 2037. If the design period is divided into four equal time span, then traffic 
forecast may be reported for horizon years like 2019, 2024, 2029, 2034 and 2039. Thus, the 
growth factors may be reported for different time span so that it is possible to calculate the 
traffic volumes even at intermediate years.
A.4	
Stage Construction
As the traffic volume continues to grow over years, the capacity requirement to maintain a 
minimum LOS may vary during the design period. If the variation of capacity requirement 
is equivalent to that of additional traffic lane(s), then a stage construction may be planned 
to optimize the utilization of financial resources. For example, traffic volume forecast for an 
existing 2-lane road may indicate a requirement of 4-lane dual carriageway in 2019 and a 
6-lane dual carriageway in 2029. In such a situation, a stage-wise construction plan may be 
developed as per the requirements.
A.5	
Mid-Blocks and Intersections
For highways, the mid-block traffic volumes govern the capacity requirement, pavement 
design, etc. Highways also include intersections and hence the appropriate design of these 
intersections is essential for safe and efficient movement of traffic. This implies that the, 
highway projects shall require traffic studies for mid-blocks as well as intersections. Intersection 
traffic volumes can also be used for deciding the nature of control (say, uncontrolled, rotary, 
grade separated, etc.) required at the intersection.
A.6 
Components of Traffic Forecast
For forecasting of traffic in the future, it may be necessary to estimate separately various 
components of traffic namely normal traffic, generated traffic and developmental traffic.
Normal Traffic: Normal traffic is the estimated traffic on a roadway facility due to increase 
in population, natural change in land-use and normal socio-economic development in the 
region or PIA. The normal growth should be estimated based on the past and envisaged 
future growth trend of traffic on the project corridor or in the influence area. Normal traffic 
growths are expected to be higher for uncongested operations but the growth rate declines 
with increase in congestion level, reaching a self-limiting equilibrium.
Generated Traffic: Road improvements may attract trips from other routes, modes and 
encourage longer and more frequent travel. The additional traffic volumes likely to be 
generated on project corridor due to road improvements are termed as generated traffic. 
Generated traffic may be classified further as diverted traffic and induced traffic.
Diverted Traffic: It is that component of generated traffic which is the result of shift in route 
and change of mode. Diverted traffic could be both positive and negative.
Induced Traffic: It may be defined as an increase in total vehicle-kilometers of travel due 
to roadway improvements, which may be due to increase in vehicle-trip frequency and 



======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 37
======================================================================
IRC:108-2015
6
distance, but exclude trips/traffic shifted from other routes. It is like release of latent demand 
for travel.
Generated traffic reflects the economic “law of demand,” which states that consumption of 
goods increase as the price declines. Roadway improvements, that alleviate congestion 
and reduce generalized cost of travel, encourage more travel/vehicle use. Depending upon 
the road network and socio-economic profile of the PIA, generated traffic may constitute a 
significant part of the total future traffic volume.
Developmental Traffic: In some cases, there may be large scale developments in the PIA 
of the proposed project corridor. Such developments may be industrial, commercial or even 
residential, and they may generate a substantial amount of additional traffic and contribute 
significantly to the future traffic volumes on the project corridor. Developmental traffic may 
not be relevant in all projects. Wherever it is relevant, the traffic engineer/planner should 
consider this component for obtaining a realistic forecast of total traffic.
In principle, total traffic forecast for the horizon year should be inclusive of all components of 
traffic, i.e., normal traffic, generated (diverted plus induced) traffic and developmental traffic. 
In all road projects (say, two-lane to four-lane or four-lane to six-lane) normal traffic forecast 
is mandatory. However, generated and developmental traffic are project specific and should 
be considered for total traffic forecast when they are contextual. For example, if there is 
a competing road or rail corridor then the traffic forecast on the project corridor cannot be 
done without considering the influence of the competing corridor and in such cases it will be 
necessary to duly consider the component of generated traffic. Similarly, if a new township 
or settlement is planned in the PIA then it would be necessary to estimate the developmental 
traffic while forecasting the total traffic on the project corridor. The traffic engineer/planner 
may estimate generated and/or developmental traffic, if these are found to be relevant and 
significant for the project. If generated and/or developmental traffic are excluded, the traffic 
engineer/planner should justify the reasons for exclusion.
A.7 
Impact of Toll on Traffic Volume
In India, over the last decade, many highways have been developed as toll roads on the 
principle of “user pays” to meet the cost of the road construction and maintenance through 
toll revenues. While road development is likely to have positive impacts on traffic growth, 
the toll charges is likely to have a deterrent effect on the traffic growth. Traffic volume on the 
proposed project corridor is likely to be lower than normal case when the corridor is operated 
as a toll road, when there are competing routes. Hence, it is necessary to duly consider the 
effect of toll on various components of traffic forecast in order to have a realistic assessment 
of traffic volumes. It may also be noted that accurate traffic volume forecast is of critical 
importance as the forecast influences the financial viability of toll road projects.
A.8	
Highways Passing through Urban Areas
Whenever highway passes through urban/suburban area, the section of highway 
experiences the movements of local as well as regional and through traffic. Local or Urban 
Traffic is that component of traffic which is internal in nature (i.e. Internal-Internal). Regional 
traffic constitutes the traffic which is internal-external and external-internal in nature. Through 



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 37
======================================================================

IRC:108-2015
7
traffic constitute vehicles having both origin and destination outside the study area or the 
core PIA and is therefore, external-external in nature. Generally, the growths of these types 
of traffic are different from each other. Therefore, when a significant length of highway is 
passing through urban/suburban area and a separate forecast is necessary for the section of 
the highway, it is necessary to appreciate the nature and magnitude of these types of traffic 
and work out separate growth factors for each type of traffic to forecast the overall growth of 
traffic. The contribution of various types of traffic in the ADT may be obtained from the O-D 
data.
A.9 
Traffic Forecasting Process and Steps
The steps in traffic forecasting process for rural highways are shown in a flowchart given in 
Fig. A.1. There are three major stages that should be considered in traffic forecasting on rural 
highways. Stage-1 (may be called as preparatory works) includes activities pertaining to the 
preliminary understanding about the proposed project corridor and its role in the influence 
area or regional development. Stage-1 also provides significant assistance in carrying out 
various tasks in Stage-2 (may be called as analysis of base year travel) and Stage-3 (may be 
called as forecasting of travel). Stage-2 includes detailed understanding of the travel along 
the project corridor in the base year. It consists of the field data collection and analysis of 
base year data. Secondary data (socio-economic data) pertaining to factors which usually 
influence the overall travel scenario of the PIA should also be collected and analyzed at this 
stage. Stage-2 also involves the estimation of base year traffic to be used in forecasts for 
horizon years. In Stage-3,the growth rates are to be determined with possible disaggregation 
of base year data and duly considering various factors which influence the growth of traffic 
in the project corridor. The details of the steps, to be followed in various stages are shown in 
Fig. A.1 and explained in the succeeding section.
A.9.1	
Study of the Base Year Transport Network
It is necessary to study the transport network map in the proposed project corridor, which will 
highlight the different components of transport network, viz. roadway network, railway network 
and shipping infrastructures if any, within the PIA. Functional and operational classification 
of the transport links should also be presented categorically. Carriageway configuration of 
different road links should be highlighted in the map. It should also consider the existence of 
the human settlements. The study of the transport network would give an understanding about 
role of the proposed project corridor in the PIA. Alternate routes and/or alternate transport 
facilities should also be identified in this step.
A.9.2	
Reconnaissance Survey
Reconnaissance survey needs to be conducted to understand the base year travel, land-
use along the corridor; and identify the major intersections which act as points of diversion/
feeders for the highway traffic. A basic understanding of the travel pattern of passenger and 
goods traffic needs to be obtained at this stage. The influence of the local traffic also needs 
to be observed along the corridor to decide judiciously the primary survey locations and 
formation of TAZs.

A.9.3	
Identification of the PIA and TAZs
Demarcation of the PIA is vital for forming the TAZs. Major settlements and land uses along 
and in the influence area of the project corridor should be identified. A preliminary Origin and 
Destination (O-D) survey may also be carried out to understand the zones of influence of 
the vehicles (i.e. travel between O-D pairs) using the project corridor. This O-D survey is for 
identification of PIA and TAZs only. A more detailed O-D survey should be carried out in the 
later stages as described in Section A.9.5.
In forming the TAZs, care should be taken to identify the zones with distinct land-use pattern 
(viz. mines, quarry, industrial units, tourist spots, district headquarters etc.). The PIA should 
be divided into several TAZs, with proper road connectivity to the project corridor. Minor 
restructuring of TAZs may also become necessary after conducting the primary traffic 
surveys.
A.9.4	
Identification of the Homogenous Traffic Sections
Homogenous traffic sections are the stretches of the project corridor where traffic volumes 
and/or composition are likely to be the same. Homogenous traffic sections should generally 
be identified based on the major points of diversion along the proposed project corridor (e.g. 
major intersections). The effect of the local traffic and travel pattern of the passenger and 
goods traffic should also be considered while identifying homogeneous sections.
A.9.5	
Identification of Primary Traffic Surveys and their Locations
Primary traffic surveys are intended to understand the base year travel. These surveys 
include:
	
●	
Mid-block classified traffic volume count survey,
	
●	
Classified turning movement count survey at intersections,
	
●	
Origin-Destination, Occupancy and trip characteristics survey,
	
●	
Commodity survey,
	
●	
Travel behavior survey and
	
●	
Speed and Delay survey
For each identified homogenous section, at least one survey location should be selected 
for mid-block classified traffic volume counts. In order to have a reasonable estimate of the 
through traffic on the highway, it is necessary to select survey locations with negligible share 
of local traffic. It is generally done for 3 days or 7 days continuously. Turning movement 
count survey should be conducted at major intersections which may act as the major points 
of diversion for the traffic on the project corridor. It is generally carried out for 16 or 24 hours 
depending on the type of road section.
Origin-Destination and trip characteristics survey should be carried out on a sample basis along 
with the mid-block classified traffic volume count survey for a specified duration (generally 
24 hours or 48 hours). On the road corridors where the traffic during night time is significant, 
the O-D survey should also cover night traffic. Trip characteristics data such as origin and 
destination of trip, trip frequency, purpose of the trip, etc. should also be collected.
Commodity survey should also be carried out through the O-D survey questionnaire on 
sample basis to understand the pattern of commodity movements on the project corridor.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:108-2015
10
Travel behavior survey may also be conducted at specific cases, such as toll roads or the 
project road where significant level of generated traffic are anticipated in horizon years. The 
survey is to be conducted through interviews of the road-users along the corridor, especially 
at dhabas, service centres, laybys, rest areas, parking areas, etc.
Travel time-delay surveys on the project corridor and the potential alternate routes would be 
helpful in assessing the diversion of traffic from/to the project highway, due to the improvement 
and also levying of toll on the project highway.
A.9.6	
Identification of the Secondary Data and their Sources
Secondary data may consist of the following:
	
●	
Population
	
●	
Fuel-sales data along the project highway
	
●	
Agricultural and/or industrial output in the influence area of project highway
	
●	
Socio-economic data of the PIA, including economic parameters (Net District 
Domestic Product/Net State Domestic Product, Per capita Income) in the 
PIA.
	
●	
Past traffic data on proposed project corridor and/or surrounding road 
network
	
●	
Vehicle registration data (mode-wise/vehicle category wise)
	
●	
Land-use development plans viz. upcoming township, industrial unit/SEZ 
etc.
	
●	
Transport network/link development/improvement plan within the PIA.
Several other secondary data may be required for traffic forecasting and the secondary data 
requirements may also vary for different projects. The sources of various secondary data 
should also be identified and verified for authenticity and accuracy.
A.9.7	
Primary Traffic Surveys
Primary traffic surveys are vital for collecting traffic data for the proposed project corridor 
operating under prevailing condition. The data collection shall meet the requirements 
as specified in A.9.5. This data shall provide the understanding of the base year travel 
demand/pattern on the project corridor.
A.9.8	
Collection of Secondary Data
Based on the requirements of the project, the secondary data is required to be collected 
from different sources, which are normally the Census, State Economics and Statistics 
Department, Industries/Tourism/Ports Department, Regional Development Authority, State 
Planning Department, NHAI/MoRTH and State PWD, etc. The sources must be authentic and 
should be referred while preparing the final report on traffic forecast for the project corridor.
A.9.9	
Base Year Traffic Analysis
In base year traffic analysis, the data collected from traffic surveys should be processed 
and representative ADT for each homogeneous traffic section should be estimated. If the 
computed/estimated ADTs on adjacent homogenous sections are similar, then the number 
of homogeneous sections may be reduced (by merging two or more homogeneous sections) 
with adequate justifications related to implications on capacity and design requirements. 
Generally traffic volume on highways or non-urban roads varies during different months or 
seasons in a year due to several factors. It is important to understand the reasons for such 



======================================================================
PAGE 18 of 37
======================================================================

IRC:108-2015
11
variations in the project context from local enquiries. Also, to account for such variations of 
traffic volumes during different months or seasons, it is necessary to estimate AADT from the 
measured ADT and secondary data reflecting seasonal variation.
A.9.10	
Estimation of Growth Factors for Normal Traffic
This step includes estimation of traffic growth factors for projecting the normal traffic to horizon 
years. Normally, several approaches are adopted to compute and understand the growth rate 
of traffic on the proposed project corridor or in the PIA. These approaches include; i) Growth 
factors based on past traffic trend data on study corridor; ii) Growth factors based on past 
trends of vehicle population (registered motor vehicles) in the PIA; iii) Growth factors based 
on elasticity of transport demand; and (iv) Growth factors based on time series analysis. While 
estimating growth factors based on registered vehicle data, it should be kept in mind that the 
vehicle population may not be exactly equal to the number of registered motor vehicles as old 
vehicles are discarded as per the prevailing Government policies. Due to the unavailability of 
data, all the methods may not be suitable and applicable in all project contexts. Finally, the 
growth rates (factors) adopted for the horizon years should be by giving due and judicious 
consideration to realistic assessments of the past traffic growth, envisaged economic growth 
in the PIA, etc. The traffic engineer/planner may recommend growth rates, which are different 
from the growth trend observed in the past. However, the reasons for such recommendations 
are expected to be mentioned in the report.
A.9.11	
Horizon Year Transport Network
The transport network for the PIA may be updated for different horizon years on the basis 
of the available information. This may be necessary to understand the likely change in the 
travel pattern, if any, and the effect on future traffic on the project corridor. The horizon year 
transport network is of critical importance in understanding the relevance and estimation of 
diverted traffic.
A.9.12	
Normal Traffic Forecast
The normal traffic forecast at each horizon year is to be estimated by applying the 
recommended traffic growth rates/factors on the base year AADT.
A.9.13	
Developmental Traffic Forecast
The estimation of developmental traffic, if relevant, should be carried out based on information 
obtained from local or regional development authorities. Developmental traffic should be 
estimated separately for each horizon year.
A.9.14	
Generated Traffic Forecast
Generated traffic should be estimated separately for each horizon year. As generated 
traffic includes both diverted traffic and induced traffic, it is necessary to estimate these two 
components separately. If the generated traffic is ignored in the forecast of future traffic for 
the project corridor, necessary justifications should be provided for the same.
A.9.15	
Total Traffic Forecast
Forecast of total traffic along the proposed project corridor at horizon years may be obtained 
by the compilation of the forecast of normal traffic, developmental traffic and generated 
traffic.

Section : B
Methodology
B.1	
Analysis of Base Year Travel
Analysis of base year travel scenario involves conducting primary traffic surveys, collection 
of secondary data, and then analysis of all data to understand the base year travel and 
establish the base year traffic estimates for the project corridor.
B.1.1	
Primary Traffic Surveys
Primary traffic surveys involve classified volume counts at selected mid-blocks and 
intersections along the project corridor and surrounding network, Origin-Destination of travel 
in PIA, type of commodity movements, etc. While carrying out classified vehicle counts, 
appropriate vehicle classification should be adopted as per relevant guidelines of IRC keeping 
in mind the presence of different vehicle categories operating on the project highway. The 
primary traffic surveys should be conducted as per the recommended procedures provided 
in IRC:SP:19-2001 “Manual for Survey, Investigation and Preparation of Road Projects” or 
its updated version. The equivalent Passenger Car Unit (PCU) values shall be used as per 
relevant IRC guidelines.
Mid-Block Classified Volume Counts
The midblock volume counts are representative of the through traffic on the project stretch 
and should be used for forecasting the future traffic volume on the project corridor. Therefore, 
it is recommended to carry out midblock traffic counts away from the intersections to avoid 
the effect of local traffic.
The classified volume counts should be carried out in both directions for successive 
15 minute periods, for a minimum of 24 hours. Normally, for traffic forecasting on highways, 
it is necessary to carry out classified volume counts for a period of one week in order to 
account for the daily variation of demand which is predominant on such roads. There should 
be at least one survey location for each homogeneous traffic section as a control count 
station where classified volume counts should be carried out for one week. Depending on the 
length of the homogenous section and observed variation of traffic flows, additional classified 
volume counts may be carried out for shorter period (i.e. less than one week) at coverage 
count stations on project highway and on surrounding network. The average weekly traffic 
volume at each coverage station may be estimated using the survey data and the pattern of 
daily variation may be established.
Traffic volume surveys may be carried out using different methods such as manual count 
method (using paper-pencil or mechanical hand-counters), portable automatic count method 
(using pneumatic road tubes), permanent count station method (using loop detectors infrared 
system), satellite based system, video recording system, etc. Considering the cost of 
available technology and its suitability in mixed traffic operations with lack of lane discipline, 
manual count technique is acceptable in India for the purpose of traffic forecast. However, 
the practical constraints of suitable manpower required for the manual count method must 



======================================================================
PAGE 20 of 37
======================================================================

IRC:108-2015
13
be taken into account through proper design of field survey formats, training of enumerators, 
deployment of adequate number of enumerators and supervisors, etc.
As there is no scope of validation of data collected using manual method, it is desirable 
to record vehicular movements using videography and extract data using manual/semi-
automatic methods. Other methods such as loop detector may also be used, if such methods 
have been established to produce reasonably accurate estimates under prevailing roadway, 
traffic and operating conditions.
Intersection Turning Movement Counts
The Intersection Turning Movement Counts are necessary to understand the traffic movements 
at intersections and also for design of intersections as per the local requirements. Apart 
from major intersections (which act as major points of diversion along the project highway), 
intersections having turning movements predominantly of the non-motorized vehicular modes 
and/or pedestrian movements (which substantially affect the operation of highway traffic 
during peak hours) should also be included in the primary traffic survey.
The intersection turning movement count survey should be carried out for successive 
15 minute period, for a minimum of 24 hours on a working day. Turning vehicles from each 
approach of the intersection should be counted with classification of vehicles and recorded 
separately, as per respective turning direction of individual vehicle (viz. through movement, 
left and right turning movements).
Origin-Destination, Occupancy and Trip Characteristics Survey
The primary objective of the Origin-Destination and trip characteristics survey (normally 
termed as O-D survey) is to collect the travel related information for both the goods and 
passenger traffic moving on the project highway. O-D survey should be carried out along with 
the mid-block traffic volume count survey at specified locations for a minimum period of 24 
hours. The survey may be carried out using roadside interview method. The vehicles should 
be intercepted on sample basis with the assistance of local police and trained enumerators 
should interview the drivers to obtain the required data. During the survey, the vehicle 
occupancy and information pertaining to origin and destination of the trip, duration of the trip, 
trip length and trip purpose as applicable for various vehicle modes should be collected and 
recorded. Sampling strategy and sample size for O-D survey should be justified.
Commodity Survey
Commodity surveys are to be carried out along with the O-D survey. The survey should 
focus on collecting information regarding the type and value of commodity (including the 
tonnage), carried by different category of goods vehicles such as local pick-up vehicles, 
2-axle trucks, 3-axle trucks, multi axle vehicles, etc. moving along the corridor. The sample 
size for commodity survey should also be justified.
B.1.2	
Base Year Traffic Analysis
Data collected through primary surveys and secondary sources are to be used for the base 
year traffic analysis. The various vehicle categories having different sizes and characteristics 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:108-2015

are to be converted into standard PCU value. PCU values may be taken as per 
IRC:64-1990 “Guidelines for Capacity of Roads in Rural Areas” or its updated version.
B.1.2.1	
Average Daily Traffic (ADT)
Traffic volume count data for 7 days at each of the mid-block locations need to be averaged 
to determine Average Daily Traffic (ADT). The ADT should be expressed in PCUs using 
appropriate PCU values as per IRC: 64-1990 or its updated version. The peak hour and peak 
hour proportion of daily traffic should also be reported.
Composition of Traffic
The composition of traffic by vehicle category is to be worked out from the classified volume 
count data. The share of motorized and non-motorized traffic and the share of different 
vehicle categories such as bus, truck, LCV, etc. within the motorized traffic stream should 
be reported. A sample format for composition of traffic is shown in Fig. B.1. Suitable vehicle 
classification maybe adopted by the traffic engineer/planner depending on the project corridor 
and the context.

Hourly Variation of Traffic
The hourly variation of traffic volume should be reported and the observed pattern should 
also be explained. This may be computed using the ADT data, i.e. based on average daily 
traffic obtained from 7-day count data.
Daily Variation of Traffic
The daily variation of traffic should be studied and explained based on the 7-day count 
data.
A representative ADT should be indicated for each homogeneous traffic section. Vehicle 
composition, peak hour, hourly and daily variation of traffic should be reported for each 
survey station. Variation across different stations, if any, should be properly explained and 
accounted for. Also, any unusual pattern in terms of traffic volume and composition, etc. 
should be explained.
B.1.2.2	
Rearrangement of homogeneous sections
Based on the representative ADT values, if it is observed that there is little or no variation 
(say, within 10%) in traffic volume and pattern for two or more consecutive homogeneous 
sections, they may be merged and considered as a single homogeneous traffic section.

B.1.2.3	
Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT)
Traffic volume on highways usually varies during different months or seasons in a year. 
Seasonal variation in traffic movement is expected mainly on account of variation in 
movement of agriculture produce and industrial products. The reasons for seasonal variation 
of traffic volume on a project stretch should be understood based on local queries and 
ground knowledge. Also, suitable secondary data to be collected to represent the variation of 
traffic volume during different seasons. Finally, the measured ADT should be converted into 
Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) using appropriate seasonal factors. Typically, a year 
may be split into three to four weather periods designated as seasons. But, the distribution of 
12 months in a year to various seasons may depend on the geographic location of the project 
highway. Attempt should be made to derive separate seasonal factors for different vehicle 
categories, say, passenger and goods vehicles. Seasonal factors may be developed using 
secondary data such as monthly fuel sale data for at least three years, authentic vehicle 
category wise traffic data from any nearby toll plaza, or data from any permanent traffic count 
station in the area, etc.
B.1.2.4	
Analysis of turning movement count data	
The turning movement count data needs to be analyzed to represent daily traffic movement, 
share of non-motorized and motorized vehicles, peak periods, peak hour, peak hour 
proportion, etc. The result of the analysis should also be reported in the form of turning 
movement diagrams.
B.1.2.5	
Analysis of O-D and commodity survey data
The sample O-D data collected from each survey station should be compiled for the base year, 
using the zoning system adopted for the study. Initially, the survey data may be compiled to 
develop vehicle category wise O-D matrices for one station. These O-D matrices then need to 
be expanded to develop O-D matrices for the population using appropriate expansion factors 
developed using the classified volume count data. Some of the zones may be combined at 
this stage if the contribution of those zones are found to be insignificant.
Occupancy
Passenger occupancy data collected during O-D surveys may be compiled to present the 
occupancy distribution and report the average occupancy value for each vehicle group.
Trip Purpose
The trip purpose information collected during O-D surveys (for passenger vehicles) may be 
compiled to represent distribution of trips by purpose.
Commodity Groups
The commodity data collected during primary surveys (along with O-D survey) should be 
analyzed and presented in suitable formats. Due consideration need to be given to include 
all possible commodities and to categorize them into homogeneous groups.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:108-2015
16
Load Analysis
The commodity data need to be used to understand the distribution of load carried by goods 
vehicles. The load carried by different categories of goods carrying vehicles viz. LCVs, two 
axle trucks, three axle trucks and multi axle vehicles are to be distributed in weight ranges.
Lead Analysis
The O-D survey data should be analyzed to obtain the average lead and lead ranges for 
various vehicle types. Different categories of vehicles viz. car, jeep, bus, mini bus, LCV, 2 
axle truck, 3 axle truck, and multi axle vehicles shall be grouped and distributed on the basis 
of trip lengths or lead ranges.
B.2	
Forecast of Travel Demand
The traffic forecast for each horizon year should be estimated considering three components: 
(i) normal traffic, (ii) generated traffic, and (iii) developmental traffic.
B.2.1	
Forecast of Normal Traffic
Forecasting of normal traffic involves understanding the past traffic trend using different direct 
and indirect methods, which should be account for making realistic assessments of the traffic 
growth and envisaged economic growth in the PIA, which would allow estimation of AADT 
for horizon years.
B.2.1.1	
Data requirements
The data requirements for estimation of growth rates are functions of the methods applied for 
estimating them. The following data should be compiled, when available and applicable for 
determining traffic growth rates:
	
a)	
Historical traffic count data (previous 5 to 10 years of traffic volumes)
	
b)	
Registered motor vehicle data in the zones of influence
	
c)	
Growth of different economic indicators in previous 5 to 10 years, such as 
population, per capita income, GDP, NSDP, NDDP, etc., in the PIA.
Based on the methodology adopted to determine growth rates, additional data such as fuel 
sales records, land use data/maps, etc. may also be required.
B.2.1.2	
Establishing traffic growth trends
An understanding of the past traffic growth is necessary before establishing traffic growth 
rates for the horizon years. Different methods may be used to understand the past traffic 
growth and several approaches need to be explored to realistically assess and quantify the 
past traffic growth trends. Some of the approaches have been recommended in the following 
paragraphs. Other rational approaches may also be adopted with proper justification for 
analyzing the past traffic growth.
1. 
Growth factors based on past traffic data on study corridor
Plot historical ADT or AADT at a convenient scale with traffic volume on y-axis and year of 
count on x-axis.Use regression analysis combined with graphical representation for obtaining 



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 37
======================================================================

IRC:108-2015
17
traffic growth trend. The graphical representation may show different growth rates for different 
periods within the available data, which may suggest appropriate considerations.
Attempts should be made to obtain growth factors separately for different vehicle categories. 
If data is not available at the required disaggregate level, then some of the vehicle categories 
may be combined logically to create lesser number of vehicle categories and obtain growth 
factor for each category separately. In situations where only the aggregate data (say, total 
PCU) is available, the growth factor may be obtained for the complete traffic stream. However, 
in this situation, it is necessary to derive growth factor according to vehicle category using 
other rational approaches. The overall growth of traffic obtained from different approaches 
can be used for comparison purpose.
It is worthwhile to mention that the past traffic data obtained from secondary sources may 
be inconsistent due to several reasons (such as presence of outliers). A few data points 
(showing extreme variation) may be excluded from the analysis to obtain rational trends in 
traffic growth. The inconsistency in the past traffic data obtained from secondary sources 
could be attributed to one or more of the following reasons:
	
a)	
Inaccuracy of the data collected: The traffic data is collected normally 
by manual method and there could be errors during collection of data and 
its processing. As the data has been collected manually, it is impossible to 
check the accuracy of that data at a later stage.
	
b)	
Poor road conditions: Till recently, not much attention was paid and very 
little resources were deployed for proper maintenance of highways. As a 
result, some roads may be experiencing very poor operating conditions. 
Poor road conditions severely affect the LOS and the maximum service 
volumes could be much lesser than the normal or that of similar road section 
under ideal condition. Such road conditions normally make the road less 
attractive for traffic movements and the vehicle volume data collected under 
such situations may not reflect the normal traffic level. In addition, the natural 
calamities, weather condition, ongoing road maintenance works etc. also 
may influence traffic volume on a corridor temporarily.
	
c)	
Policy measures and other influences: In practice, there could be an 
unexpected increase or decrease in traffic volumes due to number of policy 
measures. Several policies at the Government level such as change in 
cost of new vehicles, cost of fuel, taxes on several commodities etc. may 
influence traffic volumes. In fact, the fluctuating developing economy may 
result into a wide variety of situations, which may directly or indirectly affect 
the movement of traffic on a road.
It is because of all the aforesaid reasons, the past growth rates cannot be used directly for 
estimating future traffic on the project corridor. Any substantial change in policy (e.g., fare, 
travel time, loading and unloading of goods, etc.) and infrastructure (e.g. Improvement of 
existing rail services, new railway line, etc.) may also affect the traffic volume on the project 
corridor.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:108-2015

2.	
Growth factors based on registered vehicle data
The category wise registered motor vehicle data in each zone of PIA may be collected and 
analyzed to estimate growth factors. Plot historical registered motor vehicle data by vehicle 
category at a convenient scale with number of registered vehicles on y-axis and year of traffic 
count on x-axis. One can use regression analysis combined with graphical representation for 
obtaining growth factors for registered vehicles. It may also be possible that there is more 
than one trend in the period of data collected, which may be duly accounted in recommended 
growth rates.
For every vehicle category, the growth rate at different zones, along with the observed O-D 
pattern for the same vehicle category can be used to obtain the growth rate of that vehicle 
category for the travel in the particular O-D pair or group of O-D pairs. The basic assumption 
of this approach is that the growth of a vehicle category on a project highway is proportional 
to the growth of that vehicle category using the project road from the O-D zones of their travel 
in the influence area.
The traffic engineer/planner involved in the forecast needs to be careful that several state 
governments have their own policies to scrap old vehicles. In such cases, care should be 
taken to review the local/regional policies and consider the number of old vehicles that will be 
scrapped during the forecast period while adopting final growth rates.
3.	
Growth factors based on elasticity of transport demand
As the growth of vehicle population can also be related to other influences, an attempt 
may be made to relate vehicle population with one or more logically derived independent 
variables for deriving elasticity of transport demand. Elasticity of transport (traffic) demand, in 
the present context, is defined as the ratio of percentage change in traffic to the percentage 
change in socio-economic parameters. The concept of developing regression equation to 
relate the dependent variable in terms of one or more independent variable is widely used 
in transportation engineering for variety of purposes. The preferred dependent variable is 
past traffic on the project corridor. However, if the past traffic data is not consistent, number 
of registered motor vehicles in the zone of influence (Town/District/State) may be taken as 
dependent variable. The independent variables are socio-economic parameters. The choice 
of independent variables depends on vehicle type under consideration. It is logical to relate 
growth in traffic with NSDP/NDDP, PCI and population.
It is normally required to predict independently the socio-economic variables such as 
population, PCI, NSDP/NDDP, etc. for future years for assessing the future traffic growth 
rates using transport demand elasticity values. The traffic growth rates, by vehicle types, may 
be obtained by using simple regression and fitting the regression equation with prospective 
values of independent variables. The selection of variables and model is also a function of 
availability of data and model goodness of fit statistics (e.g. R2, t-value, etc.).
4.	
Growth factors based on time series analysis
Wherever traffic volume data is available in time series (say, from an existing toll booth), 
the trend of traffic growth or the future traffic volume may be estimated using time series 



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:108-2015
19
analysis. It comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful 
statistics and other characteristics of the data. In special scenarios where past trends about 
independent variables affecting traffic growth such as population, PCI etc. are not available, 
time series analysis may be helpful for assessing future traffic volumes.
Time series analysis may be carried out using (a) Smoothening techniques, such as Single 
Moving Average (SMA), Double Moving Average (DMA), Single Exponential Smoothening 
(SES), etc., (b) Auto Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) Model, and (c) Auto Regressive 
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. If the data is limited, then ARMA or ARIMA  model 
fit may not be good. In such cases time series based smoothening could be very effective.
It may be mentioned that in majority of projects involving four laning of existing two lane 
highways, it may not be possible to carry out time series analysis due to unavailability of data. 
In such cases, the growth rates should be investigated using other methods, as discussed 
above. On the contrary, where time series data are available from toll booths or from any 
other source, attempt should be made to make use of the available data, carry out time series 
analysis and compare the growth factor with those obtained from other methods.
B.2.1.3	
Comparison of growth factors
Wherever possible, the growth rates estimated from different approaches should be compared 
in order to understand the degree of similarity or dissimilarity. Certain degrees of uncertainties 
are associated with growth rates obtained by each method and therefore the selection of 
growth rate plays a vital role in this regard. The analyst (traffic engineer/planner) may select 
one growth rate or an average of two or more growth rates by omitting the extreme results, or 
perform any other selection procedure. However, the selection of growth rates must be done 
with proper scientific justification.
B.2.1.4	
Recommendation of future growth factors
The growth rates finally selected in Section B.2.1.3 may be considered as realistic growth 
estimates of different categories of vehicles derived from the past trends. The knowledge 
of these growth rates is essential as a basis for suggesting future traffic growth rates for 
the project road. The traffic engineer/planner may modify the growth rates obtained from 
Section B.2.1.3 considering the influencing factors and uncertainties, which may affect the 
future traffic levels on the project road and suggest future growth rates.
Normally, for a congested road (with high volume to capacity ratio) the traffic growth is 
expected to be lower. So, in most cases, lower growths may be reasonable till the capacity 
augmentation is done. Even after capacity augmentation, traffic growths are unlikely to 
be uniform during the entire design period. The growths are expected to be higher in the 
initial periods after road widening/improvement, and will become lower thereafter because 
of increasing traffic volume and reduced attractiveness of the road (i.e. more volume, less 
freedom of movement, more congestion, more travel time, etc.). Accordingly, separate sets 
of growth rates which are realistic for the context, may be evolved for obtaining traffic volume 
forecast for different horizon years.

B.2.1.5	
Forecast AADT for horizon years
The AADT for different horizon years may be estimated using the base year AADT and 
recommended growth rates for each period.
B.2.2	
Estimation of Generated Traffic
Estimation of generated traffic is a challenging task. Adequate investigations have not been 
carried out in Indian context to provide readily usable models or charts for the estimation of 
generated traffic. However, attempts should be made to estimate this component of future 
traffic volume in a realistic manner, especially for projects where the share of generated 
traffic is expected to be significant due to competing routes, modal shift, etc.
Several scientific techniques are available for the estimation of generated traffic. For the 
estimation of the two components of generated traffic (namely, diverted traffic and induced 
traffic), it is necessary to use behavioral data and suitable analysis technique to develop route 
choice and/or mode choice models. The broad steps involved in the development of mode 
choice or route choice model include, (i) design of travel behavior survey, (ii) collection of 
behavioral data, and (iii) analysis of the database by developing suitable econometric models. 
Two types of behavioral data may be necessary for such works namely Stated Preference 
(SP) data and Revealed Preference (RP) data. SP data are effective for valuation purpose 
or estimation of willingness-to-pay values, while use of RP data is desirable for demand 
estimation purpose. In some cases, it may be required to develop a joint RP-SP based model 
for demand estimation purpose. Different econometric modeling techniques may include 
Multinomial Logit (MNL), Nested Logit (NL) and Random Parameter Logit (RPL), etc.
Diverted traffic may also be projected using diversion curves. Diversion curves are empirically 
derived relationships for developing a logical estimate of the proportion of traffic that is likely to 
be diverted on the newly developed project corridor. The development of the diversion curve 
is based on the data collected from the road usage pattern in the past. The model may be 
based on the savings of travel time, savings of travel distance, travel time ratio, travel distance 
ratio, distance and speed ratio, travel cost ratio, toll rates, etc. Derivation of diversion curves 
should be based on alternative scenarios and variations in the above mentioned parameters 
for different vehicle categories. The established diversion curve may be used to calculate the 
diverted traffic for different categories of vehicle on the project corridor.
A different kind of analysis of SP data (other than Willingness-to-Pay survey) may be 
required in some contexts, where the primary effect is due to change in trip rate or 
vehicle-km travel. In such cases, Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) technique or any 
other established approach may be used. Any published work which may be relevant to 
the project context may also be referred and used as a basis for estimating the generated 
traffic with proper scientific justification. In cases where the generated traffic is anticipated 
to have very little or no significance, this step may be omitted for estimation of total traffic 
forecast for horizon years. However, such omissions should always be supported with proper 
justification.

B.2.3	
Estimation of Developmental Traffic
In order to cater to the additional trips resulting from land use changes (like residential, 
commercial or industrial, etc.) in the influence area of the proposed road development, it is 
necessary to develop trip rate based projections for the horizon years. The trip rates may 
be obtained from secondary sources (say, previous studies which established trip rates 
for similar land use and comparable conditions) or established from primary surveys. The 
procedure may be similar to what is followed normally as a part of traffic impact studies. The 
output from this work is the additional daily traffic and peak hour traffic on the project road 
due to significant change in land use in the zones of influence. This component of traffic 
estimate may also be omitted with justification, if no significant development is expected in 
the zone of influence.
B.2.4	
Estimation of Forecast for Total Traffic
The total traffic forecast for different horizon years should be obtained by combining the 
normal traffic forecast of AADT, the generated traffic and the developmental traffic volumes 
for each horizon year. The generated traffic and developmental traffic are case specific and 
may be omitted for some project corridors with proper justification.
B.2.5	
Impact of Toll on Travel Demand
Quantifying the impact of toll on traffic volume forecast is again a complex but necessary 
task for toll roads. Toll is a negative externality (with deterrent effect) and may impact travel in 
several ways. First, it may result in a shift of route or mode of travel and thereby impacting the 
overall traffic volume on the project road. Secondly, the toll may also impact the trip rate or 
vehicle-km of travel. Therefore, methods as discussed in Section B.2.2 for the estimation of 
generated traffic may be used to develop model to estimate impacts of toll on traffic volumes. 
The amount of toll may be included as a part of direct cost while developing such models.
It may be noted that the impact of toll on travel demand of passenger and goods vehicles 
are expected to be distinctly different. Person trips (and thereby passenger vehicles) are 
expected to be more sensitive to toll. Therefore, it is meaningful to attempt to develop model 
and assess the impact of toll on passenger vehicles, as far as possible, in a rational manner. 
There may be limited scope for shift of mode (say, road to rail) for goods. The choice of route 
(say, use of local road instead of the project highway with toll) may also be restricted using 
policy and traffic management measures. All these aspects should be duly considered while 
assessing the impact of toll on passenger and goods traffic.
It may also be mentioned that there are added complexities associated with forecast of traffic 
on toll roads. As the concept of toll road is relatively new in India, there is little scope to analyze 
traffic growth on such roads based on observed data. It is therefore, necessary to update the 
forecast based on observed traffic volumes from time to time on the project corridor.

Section : C
Application
This section comprises of several example problems illustrating different methods that a traffic 
engineer/planner may adopt while carrying out traffic forecast. It may, however, be mentioned 
that the values and/or equations that have been used for solving the example problems 
are purely hypothetical. The traffic engineer/planner should develop realistic models and/or 
equations based on the project corridor for which forecast is being made.
C.1	
AADT from ADT and Seasonal Variation
Problem Statement: The traffic volume data for a vehicle category say, two axle heavy 
commercial vehicles during different seasons are summarized in Table C.1. The observed 
ADT for the vehicle category in 2014 is 1482 and the traffic volumes are measured during 
June-July. Estimate the corresponding AADT in 2013.

Solution: If the seasonal index for the peak season (i.e. winter as per the present example) 
is considered as 100, then the seasonal index for summer is 100*(1372/1564) or 87.72 and 
the seasonal index for monsoon is 100*(1204/1564) or 76.98.
The average seasonal index is (100*4+87.72*4+76.98*4)/12 = 88.23
The seasonal index during June-July may be considered as (87.72+76.98)/2 = 82.35
Therefore, the seasonal factor to convert the ADT counts during June-July to AADT is 
88.23/82.35 or 1.07. Accordingly, the estimated AADT of 2T-HCV during 2014 is 1482*1.07 
or 1586.
C.2 
Traffic Growth Factor using Transport Demand Elasticity Model
Problem Statement: The time series data on Traffic Volume at a certain location and the 
corresponding data on GDP of the region are given in Table C.2. The GDP is expected to 
grow at a rate of 6 percent during 2005-2014. Determine the possible rate of growth of traffic 
during 2005-2014.

The data in columns representing Ln P and Ln GDP are now analyzed to develop a linear 
regression model which is as follows:
	
Ln P = -11.304 + 1.8976 Ln GDP
The R2 value (0.9977) of the regression model is high, the coefficients estimated (-32.2 and 
59.2) are statistically significant at 95 percent confidence level and the signs of the coefficient 
estimated are logical. Therefore the model may be accepted.
The traffic demand elasticity coefficient is 1.8976. Therefore, if the growth of GDP is 6 percent 
for the year 2005-2014, then the estimated growth of traffic during the same period is 1.8976 
x 6 percent or 11.39 percent as per the transport demand elasticity model.

C.3 
Weighted Traffic Growth Rates using Growth Rates at Origin and 
Destination Zones
Problem Statement: The O-D survey on a National Highway reveals the following 
distributions of commercial vehicle movements: 30 percent between State-A and State-B, 
20 percent between State-B and State-C, 25 percent between State-A and State-C and the 
rest 25 percent are distributed (in terms of both origin and destination) among other States 
in India. The growths of commercial vehicles are 7 percent, 6.0 percent, and 6.5 percent for 
State-A, State-B and State-C respectively. The growth of commercial vehicles at national 
level is estimated as 7.5 percent. What is the expected growth of commercial vehicles on the 
project highway?
Solution: For the vehicles moving between State-A and State-B, the growth of commercial 
vehicle is (7 percent + 6 percent)/2 or 6.5 percent.
Similarly, for vehicles moving between State-B and State-C, the growth of commercial vehicle 
is (6 percent + 6.5 percent)/2 or 6.25 percent. and between State-A and State-C, the growth 
of commercial vehicle is (7 percent + 6.5 percent)/2 or 6.75 percent.
The remaining States may be represented as a zone and the commercial vehicle growth of 
that zone may be assumed same as the national average i.e. 7.5 percent.
Therefore, the expected overall commercial traffic growth on the project highway is (30*6.5 + 
20*6.25 + 25*6.75 + 25*7.5)/100 percent or 6.76 percent.

Growth Factor Estimation for Highways Passing through Urban Areas
Problem Statement: A section of the project corridor is passing through a dense urban area. 
Based on the nature and magnitude of traffic movement derived from O-D survey for the 
section of the project corridor, the shares of different types of traffic (in ADT and %) for urban, 
regional and through traffic are presented in Table C.4. Use appropriate analysis to obtain 
growth rate for the different types of traffic.

Updating Traffic Volume at Coverage Count Station Based on Data of Control 
Count Station
Problem Statement: A seven day 24-hr traffic volume studies were carried out at a control 
count station and the daily traffic volumes (in PCUs) from Monday to Sunday were measured 
as 21000, 23000, 23500, 24000, 20000, 18000 and 16000. The traffic volume at a coverage 
count station in the influence area of the control count station was measured as 14000 PCU 
based on a 24 hour volume survey on Thursday of the same week. Calculate the adjusted 
ADT (i.e. weekly average) for the coverage count station.
Solution: The weekly average daily traffic volume at the control station is 20786 PCU.
The weekly average is 20786/24000 or 0.866 times the daily traffic on Thursday. As the traffic 
pattern at the coverage count station is assumed to be similar to that of the control count 
station, the adjusted ADT for the coverage count station (i.e. average of weekly count) is 
estimated as 14000*0.866 or 12124 PCUs.

Traffic Forecasting using Moving Average Technique and Single Exponential 
Smoothening Technique
Problem Statement: The Observed Monthly ADT (MADT) of commercial vehicles for 
consecutive 19 months on a toll booth is provided in column 2 of Table C.6.
	
a)	
Calculate a three month moving average for months one to nineteen. 
What would be the forecast for the commercial vehicle on that toll booth in 
20th month?
	
b)	
Apply exponential smoothing to forecast the volume of commercial vehicles 
in the twentieth month.
	
c)	
Which of these two forecast techniques should be preferred in practice and 
why? Give proper justification
Solution:
	
a)	
There are different moving average techniques used for forecasting purpose, 
such as two-month, three-month, four-month average and so on. In this case, 
three-month moving average technique is used for the analysis.
	
	
The three-month moving average MADT for Month-3 is calculated as 
(852+861+958)/3 or 890. In the similar manner, the values are calculated 
for other months and reported in column 3 of Table C.6. The forecast for 
month 20 is just the moving average for the month before that i.e. the moving 
average for month 19 = 1286.
	
b)	
Single Exponential Smoothening Technique follows the following formula to 
smoothen the dataset.
	
	
	
St = αyt + (1-α)S(t-1)
Where,
St is the predicted smoothened data point, yt is the observed data point, S(t-1) is the previous 
smoothened data point and α is the smoothening factor. The value of α ranges from 0 to 1 
and may be selected by minimizing the SSE (Sum of squared errors) over the period for 
which yt is known (in the given example, that period is 19 months). For the purpose of this 
example, the value of α is considered as 0.1.

The single exponential smoothened MADT for Month-3 is calculated as (0.1*861) + (0.9*852) 
or 853. In the similar manner, the values are calculated for other months and reported in 
column 4 of Table C.6. The forecast for month 20 is just the single exponential smoothened 
MADT for Month-19 = 1237.
	
c)	
To compare the two forecasts, the Mean Squared Deviation (MSD) is 
calculated.
	
	
For the moving average technique,
	
MSD Moving Average = [(890-1037)2 + (952-1045)2….. + (1225-1349)2]/16 = 16225
	
MSD Single Exponential Smoothening = [(852-958)2 + (853-1037)2….. + (1174-1349)2]/17 = 27739.
Overall it can be concluded that the three-month moving average appears to give a better one-
month ahead forecast as it has a lower MSD. Hence, the forecast of 1286 will be considered 
as the Monthly ADT in terms of commercial vehicle in that toll booth in the twentieth month.

Solution: The model is generally referred to as an ARIMA (p,d,q) model where p, d and q are 
non-negative integers that refer to the order of the auto regressive, integrated and moving 
average parts of the model respectively. Here, using ARIMA model, the growth of vehicles for 
future forecast is provided and step wise procedure is briefly demonstrated.
Model Identification: To fit an ARIMA model of dataset, it is necessary to find out whether 
dataset is time series data and also if it is univariate or multivariate. To observe time series 
trends, the dataset is plotted according to time. Then ACF and PACF parameters are 
estimated to define the order of series. The ACF plots represent Auto Correlation and PACF 
plots represent Partial Auto Correlation of data sets against lags of themselves. In this given 
problem based on ACF and PACF plot of an ARIMA (1, 1, 0) model has been applied on the 
case dataset for the future prediction which is presented in Fig. C.7.
Diagnostic Checking of the Model: Ljung-Box test is used for examining the null hypothesis 
of independence in a given time series. The model statistic shows that the p-value for the 
Ljung–Box test is 0.822, well above 0.05, indicating “non-significance” and this can be taken 
as desirable result.
Prediction of ARIMA–Models: Once a model has been identified and found statistically 
significant, future values can be estimated using the model. The growth rates of two wheelers 
are estimated up to 2028 using the specified ARIMA model and the future trend is shown 
graphically in Fig. C.7. The forecast growth rate along with the observed growth rate is 
reported in Table C.7B, shows a less steeper but increasing trend of growth rate for two-
wheelers in the city up to 2028.

C.8 
Estimation of Diverted Traffic using Logit Model
Problem Statement: An existing road connects two cities A and B. The length of existing route 
is 12 km. A new highway is planned to connect the two cities. The length of the new highway 
alignment is 18 km. During peak hour, Travel Time (TT) and Travel Vost (TC) along the existing 
route are 25 minutes and Rs.4 per kilometer respectively. For the new highway facility, TT and 
TC during peak hour has been estimated as 15 minutes and Rs.3.5 per kilometer respectively. 
Based on travel behavior studies, a utility function has been developed to estimate the shift of 
passenger car from the existing route to the proposed highway as U = -0.21* TT - 0.178*TC 
- 0.464. Alternative specific constant for existing highway is -0.464. Observed peak hour traffic 
volume of passenger cars along the existing route is 4000. Estimate the shift of passenger 
cars to the proposed highway during the peak hour.
Solution: Using the given utility function,
Utility of the existing route,		
U1 = -0.21* 25 - 0.178*4*12 – 0.464 = -14.258
Utility of the proposed route,	
U2 = -0.21* 15 - 0.178*3.5*18 = - 14.364
Hence, the percentage shift of passenger car to the proposed route as per bi-nomial logit 
model
	
=	 exp(U2)/{exp(U1) + exp(U2)}*100 = 47.35%
Therefore, the estimated shift of passenger car to the proposed highway during peak hour
	
=	 4000*47.35% = 1894 cars

C.9 
Estimation of Diverted Traffic using Diversion Curves
Problem Statement: A new Expressway is proposed to be developed which will act as a 
competing route to an already existing National Highway. Classified volume count on the 
existing National Highway is 1500 cars/hour, 100 buses/hour and 400 trucks/hour. Use the 
diversion curves provided in Table C.9 to estimate vehicle category wise diverted traffic to 
the newly developed Expressway. The Travel Cost Ratio (Expressway : National Highway) 
for cars, buses and trucks have been estimated as 0.816, 0.913 and 0.776 respectively.
Table C.9  Diversion Curve Equations
Item
Cost Ratio Interval
Equations
Cars
< 0.634 
% Div = 98.750 - (CR/0.634)*8.125
0.634 < = CR < = 1.465 
% Div = 90.625 - ((CR-0.634)/0.831)*84.375
1.465 < = CR < = 2.00
% Div = 06.250 - (CR-1.465)/0.535)*5.25
Buses & Trucks
< = 0.750 
% Div = 100-(CR/0.75)*0.5
0.750 < = CR < = 1.250
% Div = 95 - ((CR-0.75)/0.5)*90
1.250 < = CR < = 2.00
% Div = ((2-CR)/0.75)*5
Source: Project Report on Indian National Expressway Network, MORTH (2009)
Solution: The Percentage Diversion of Cars, Buses and Trucks are as follows:
Cars	
(CR = 0.816)	
% Div	= 90.625-((0.816-0.634)/0.831)*84.375	 = 72.15%
Buses	
(CR = 0.913)	
% Div	= 95-((CR-0.75)/0.5)*90	
	
	
= 65.66%
Trucks	
(CR = 0.776)	
% Div	= 95-((CR-0.75)/0.5)*90	
	
	
= 90.32%
Therefore, the mode-wise diverted traffic to the newly developed Expressway is as follows:
Cars:	
72.15% * 1500	 	
= 1082 Cars/hour
Buses:	
65.66% * 100	
	
= 66 Buses/hour
Trucks:	
90.32% * 400	
	
= 361 Trucks/hour
