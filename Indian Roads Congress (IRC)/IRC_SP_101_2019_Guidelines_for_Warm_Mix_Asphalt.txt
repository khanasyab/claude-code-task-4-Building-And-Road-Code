GUIDELINES FOR WARM MIX ASPHALT
1. Introduction
Warm Mix Asphalt technology has been in use in USA and a number of European countries for 
several years. A number of trials were also made in the recent past in India. This technology 
has inherent advantages in terms of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and economy 
in construction (because of less fuel consumption in construction) as well as elimination of 
suspected health hazards to construction workers (according to some studies the fumes from hot 
bituminous mixes is a health hazard). Considering the importance and need of green technology, 
IRC published Interim Guidelines for Warm Mix Asphalt in the year 2014. This document presents 
the interim guidelines for the production and construction of Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) pavement.
Subsequent to the adoption and usage of the warm mix technology in India, the feedback received 
on the interim guidelines from various stakeholders and also considering the advancement 
in materials and technology, IRC decided to revise this document. The task was assigned to 
Flexible Pavement, Airfield & Runways (H-2) Committee of IRC during the tenure 2018-20. The 
initial document was prepared by Dr. Sunil Bose, Dr. Ambika Behl and Dr. Sridhar Raju. The draft 
was deliberated in various meetings of H-2 Committee and was finalized in its meeting held on 
8th June, 2019.

The draft  document was placed before the Highways Specifications and Standards Committee 
(HSS) in its meeting held on 20.07.2019. The HSS Committee decided that  Co-Convenor, H-2 
Committee will modify the document based on written comments and verbal comments offered 
during the meeting and submit the final document to IRC for placing in the IRC Mid-Term Council 
meeting. The Mid-Term Council in its meeting held on 9th and 10th August, 2019 at Goa approved 
the document for publishing.
The guidelines would need to be further refined and amended in course of time with experience 
gained with widespread use of the technology.
2. Scope
2.1	
The Guidelines Describe
i.	
A range of warm mix technologies, which have the potential for use in bituminous 
construction like Dense Bituminous Macadam (DBM), Bituminous Concrete (BC) 
meeting the quality and performance requirements of IRC:111 and Recycled Asphalt 
Pavements (RAP).
ii.	
The essential requirements of collaborative effort between the technology provider/ 
the product supplier on the one hand and the contracting agency on the other with a 
view to promoting the use of the warm mix technology.
2.2	
Since the WMA technology uses a variety of patented products as additives, which 
come in different forms such as solid, liquid and powder and use different processes for 
administering the additives and mixing, these guidelines do not prescribe any specific product or 
process except in a generic manner at the level of technology. 
2.3	
The guidelines further recommend that the contracting authorities may accept any 
technology that claims to meet the requirements of these guidelines provided such a claim is 
(a) substantiated by laboratory and field tests, and (b) backed by a collaboration between the

IRC:SP:101-2019
3
contracting agency and the product/technology provider in a manner that ensures joint and 
several responsibility.
3. Overview of WMA technology
3.1	
The basic principle of this technology is that by adding certain additives at the final 
stages of the mix production, the coating of the aggregates by the binder is greatly enhanced and 
can be achieved at a considerably less temperature (typically 300C less) compared to the hot mix 
process wherein bitumen is heated to a sufficiently high temperature to make it fluid enough to 
surround the aggregates and coat their surfaces. In hot mix process, it is the viscosity of bitumen 
alone, which is less at higher temperature, that plays the main role in coating of aggregates. In 
warm mix technology, this can be achieved in three different ways, viz. by increasing the volume 
of bitumen, by making the bitumen less viscous, by reducing the surface tension at aggregate 
bitumen interface etc. 
3.2	
Currently there are more than 30 different WMA technologies, using patented 
processes and products, which have capabilities of bringing reduction in mixing, laydown and 
compaction temperatures of bituminous mixes in one of the three different ways described 
above. Although the end effect of reduction of mixing, laydown and compaction temperatures is 
the same, different technologies work in different ways. This specification covers the Warm Mix 
Bituminous technologies currently adopted globally, classifying them into four main categories. 
Water Based Technologies
i.	
Foaming
	
In essence, the “water technologies” use fine water droplets to expand the volume of 
binder in the mix by causing it to foam. This has the effect of increasing the volume 
of the bitumen, enabling it to coat aggregate at lower temperatures. The foaming 
technology can be further sub-divided into two classes, foaming additives and water 
injection system. The foaming process works by creating foamed asphalt that improves 
coating and compaction at lower temperature. Water expands 1,600 times when 
converted into steam at atmospheric pressure, and the steam is encapsulated by 
viscous bitumen producing foam, which occupies a much greater volume compared 
to the original bitumen. The water for creating the foam is either added as water 
through a water injection stem in a specialized equipment, or from zeolites (which 
contain about 20% water). Water is added at a rate of 1.25 to 2.0% by weight of 
bitumen (about 500 ml of water per ton of mix), whereas the zeolites are added a rate 
of 0.1 to 0.3% by weight of the mix. Foaming by water allows 18ºC to 30ºC reduction 
in temperature whereas foaming by zeolites allows a reduction of 30ºC to 40ºC. 
ii.	
Water Carrying Chemical Additives
	
Natural and synthetic zeolites are mineral additives used to introduce water into the 
mix thereby creating “in-situ” foaming within the bitumen. 



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 28
======================================================================
IRC:SP:101-2019
4
	
Zeolites in general are added to the mix with the filler during mixing process. As 
the mixing temperature increases the zeolites slowly release their absorbed water 
into the bitumen, which is dispersed throughout the mixture in the form of very fine 
foam droplets. This causes an increase in the volume of the bitumen and leading to 
improvement in its ability to coat the aggregate.
iii.	
Wet Fine Aggregate Addition Systems
	
In this process the bituminous binder is added to the heated coarse aggregate in 
the mixer. Once the coarse aggregate are well coated, fine aggregate at ambient 
temperature with moisture content of around 3% is introduced. The moisture vaporizes, 
causing the binder coating the coarse aggregate to foam, which in turn encapsulates 
the fine aggregate. 
Chemical Additives
WMA technologies utilize chemical additives that have little effect on rheological properties of 
the binder. These products may be supplied in pellet, powder or liquid form, and then mixed 
into the binder or directly added to the mix. Chemical additives are Surfactants (surface active 
agents) that reduce surface tension between the polar aggregates and non-polar bitumen, 
improve wetting and reduce internal friction, and allows a reduction of 280C-500C in mixing and 
compaction temperatures. Typically they are added at the rate of 0.20 to 0.75 percent by weight 
of bitumen.
Rheological Modifiers
The wax based products can be described as viscosity modifying organic additives that reduce 
binder viscosity at high temperatures and thus allow lower mixing and paving temperatures. 
The additives, which are either waxes or other hydrocarbon modifiers improve lubrication by 
reducing the viscosity of bitumen and allow a reduction of 28ºC to 40ºC in mixing and compaction 
temperatures. Typical dosage amounts are 2 to 4% by weight of bitumen. Sometimes these 
additives are also added as modifiers for increasing the stiffness of asphalt mixes, for specialty 
applications, such as in racing tracks.
Hybrid Technologies
Hybrid technologies utilize a combination of two or more WMA technologies to achieve the 
reduction in temperature. For example, Low Energy Asphalt (LEA) utilizes a chemical additive 
with a water injection system to improve coating at lower temperatures.
The additives come in different forms, such as liquid, powder, pellet and are administered in 
the mix production process at different stage. Accordingly, some modification in the bituminous 
mixing plants is necessary to administer the controlled dosage of the additives. Some additives in 
liquid form can be pre-blended with bitumen and would need no modification in the conventional 
mixing plant provided the blended bitumen contains the right dose of additive. Other additives, 
which are administered in the mix at certain stage during the mix production process, would 
require some modification in the conventional mixing plants. These modifications would generally 



======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 28
======================================================================
IRC:SP:101-2019
5
require a separate material (additive) feed system and a material metering system (to ensure the 
right dosage) which should be integrated with computerized plant control system of the mixing 
plant. The water-based WMA technologies would additionally need a water injection system as 
well.
3.3	
Apart from such plant modification as required to administer the additives (described 
above), some modifications are needed for recalibrating the fuel burner, aggregate drying system, 
bitumen heating system and to take care of the possible consequences of lower temperature 
operation, such as contamination of the mix by un-burnt fuel and trapped moisture, condensation 
of bag house fines, etc to operate the plant at reduced temperature compared to that adopted for 
the conventional hot mix production.
4. Benefits of Warm Mix Asphalt
(1)	
Environmental Benefits: The single most important justification for use of this 
technology is that it reduces the emission of green house gases by around 25 to 
30% and controls thereby global warming. This would earn tradable carbon credit. 
Secondly, the technology is quite compatible with Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement 
technology, which reduces the requirement of fresh aggregates and reduces the 
environmental hazard associated with dumping of damaged pavement materials.
(2)	
Health Benefits: The fumes from Hot Mix Asphalt are known to be potential health 
hazards, especially for the construction workers. Reduced temperature of the mix 
avoids this health hazard. 
(3)	
Technical advantages:
	
a.	
Lower mixing temperature reduces the oxidation and ageing of bitumen and 
thereby gives long lasting pavement by delaying fatigue cracking.
	
b.	
Much improved workability of the mix at lower temperatures gives better 
compactability and larger compaction window.
	
c.	
Reduced rate of cooling of the mix (due to low initial temperature of the mix) 
permits longer haul distance from the plant to work sites and better cold weather 
construction opportunities.
(4)	
Cost benefits: WMA is most likely to have long term cost advantages, though its 
estimation should be case specific. The cost advantage is a trade-off between the 
additional cost of using the additives and technologies (including plant modification) 
and cost savings achieved through reduced fuel consumption, longer life of pavement 
and use of recycled material.
5. Choice of an appropriate WMA technology
In the Section dealing with ‘overview’, the principles behind various alternative technologies and 
different additives have been presented. They provide the general guideline for an appropriate 
choice of technology. Secondly, since the plants and equipment used for producing WMA mixes 
would remain essentially the same (at least till such time the technology proliferates and its 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:101-2019
6
use becomes widespread) as that for HMA mix, it would be necessary to ascertain the nature 
and feasibility of as well as commitment to these modifications/changes. Thirdly, the suppliers 
of the products to be used in works should be willing to take responsibility along with the main 
contractor not only for their products but for the entire technological solution. 
All technologies and all commercial additives should be allowed to compete for acceptance on a 
work if the following conditions are satisfied:
•	
Technology and/or product suppliers provide evidence of :
	
(a)	
achieving the reduction of at least 300C in mixing and laying temperatures 
demonstrated based on some actual work done in the past. The evidence should 
be in the form of a certificate from the owner/owner’s representative of the said 
work, 
	
(b)	
additives proposed to be used not having any harmful effects on human health 
and environment. This evidence should be in the form of test certificates from 
reputed laboratory,
	
 (c)	 complete understanding of the technological solution such as dosage of additives, 
the process of administering the additives in a controlled manner (weight, 
volume, pressure, temperature, etc.), adequacy of the plant and equipment 
proposed to be used on the work and if not, the modifications required, quality 
assurance in the process, etc. This evidence should be in the form of a written 
quality statement.
•	
The main contractor provides evidence of understanding of the technological 
requirement, including modifications in the plant and equipment and acceptance of 
these requirements. This evidence should be in the form of a written joint commitment 
statement.
The selection of the best WMA technology depends on many factors, and in most cases is 
dependent on the monetary incentives and benefits of using WMA. Important factors to consider 
include the reduction in temperature that is desired, the tonnage of mix that is anticipated and 
whether or not to invest in plant technology that are needed for certain additives. It should also 
be pointed out that the “green” benefits of adopting WMA technologies should not be overlooked, 
and that a reduction in emission through a reduction of temperature can help contractors/ 
agencies receive significant amount of “carbon credits.”
6. Design of WMA mixes
The quality and performance of the WMA mix shall be the same as specified for HMA in IRC:111 
except for mixing and laying temperatures, which should be at least 300C less than those specified 
for HMA. The threshold of 300C is considered technologically feasible as well as desirable from 
the point of view of fuel savings of some significance. 
Design of mix, quality of inputs (except the additives) and tests required to be performed shall 
follow the same procedures as specified in IRC:111. In addition, the following WMA specific tests 
shall also be performed:

IRC:SP:101-2019
7
•	
Coating
•	
Compactability
•	
Moisture Sensitivity
The viscosity-temperature plots shall not be used to find the mixing and compaction temperatures 
of warm asphalt mixes. Since not all WMA additives effect the viscosity of bitumen and mainly 
work on the bitumen-aggregate interface and improve the workability of the asphalt mix at lower 
temperatures. Volumetric properties should be used as the criteria for optimizing the mixing and 
compaction temperatures for warm mixes. The above parameters should be verified first in the 
laboratory and after the criteria are satisfied a field trial section of at least 500 m length shall be 
constructed, and the parameters obtained in the laboratory may be verified. 
6.1	
Aggregate Coating
•	
WMA  samples shall be prepared as per AASHTO T195 (Refer Annex 1) at a 
temperature of at least 30°C lower than conventional hot-mix.
•	
The warm-mix shall be evaluated for coating as per AASHTO T195.
•	
Minimum 95% of the coarse aggregate particles shall be fully coated at a temperature 
of at least 30°C lower than conventional hot-mix.
6.2	
Compactability
Since the mixing and compaction temperatures of the warm-mix samples are lowered by at 
least 30°C compared to the conventional hot-mix, it is important for the warm-mix samples to 
attain specified mix densities at adopted lower temperatures. In order to verify that the warm-mix 
samples attain sufficient density when prepared at temperatures which are at least 30oC lower 
than those of conventional hot-mix:
•	
Three hot-mix specimens shall be prepared conforming to the JMF as per AASHTO 
T245 (also adopted in MORTH Section 500 Table 10). (Refer Annex 1)
•	
Similarly, three more warm-mix specimens shall be prepared conforming to the JMF. 
In all cases the JMF shall be made in the same procedure as per conventional mixes 
except at a temperature at least 30°C lower than the hot-mix samples as per AASHTO 
T245. The compactive effort should be similar for both mixes. In case there is a specific 
change required by an additive manufacturer to suit the JMF requirements the same 
shall be permitted except that the Specified Properties in the Guidelines shall have to 
be adhered to.
•	
The bulk specific gravity (Gmb) of all the specimens shall be determined as per AASHTO 
T166.
•	
The theoretical maximum specific gravity (Gmm) of the bituminous mixture of HMA and 
WMA shall be determined as per AASHTO T209.
•	
The air voids of both the mixes shall be determined as per the following equation:
100
mm
mb
a
mm
G
G
V
G



 
•	
The ratio of the air voids shall be as per the following equation:

•	
The ratio shall be such that 0.9 < RVa < 1.1
In most of the cases, improved workability of warm asphalt mixes at low temperatures leads to 
improved and early coating of aggregates and reduced compaction effort to achieve densities; 
this should not be accepted as a parameter to reduce the binder content in the mix.
6.3	
Moisture Susceptibility
Since Warm-mixes are typically prepared at least 30°C lower temperatures, it is likely that the 
aggregate can retain some residual moisture, especially when the aggregate are porous and 
when the moisture content in the aggregate is high due to recent rains. It is recommended that 
the warm-mix additives or processes should also function as anti-stripping agents, and should 
be able to improve the resistance of the mix to moisture susceptibility even when produced at 
temperatures at least 30°C lower than conventional mixes. If the warm-mix additives cannot 
perform as an anti-stripping agent, it must be mandated to add either hydrated lime or a liquid 
anti-stripping agent to the mix to improve resistance to moisture damage. However in case of 
WMA using foaming technology use of anti-stripping agent or lime may be detrimental. The 
following procedure may be adopted for evaluating the moisture damage resistance of Warm-
mix asphalt mixes:
•	
Six samples of the compacted HMA mix conforming to the JMF as per AASHTO T245 
(Refer Annex 1) shall be prepared in the first instance.
•	
The specimens shall have 7.0±0.5% air voids.
•	
Six samples of warm-mix specimens conforming to the JMF shall be prepared at a 
temperature at least 30°C lower than the hot-mix samples as per AASHTO T245. The 
compactive effort shall be either similar for both mixes or adjusted in such a way that 
both the mixes have similar air voids (7.0±0.5%).
•	
The Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR) of the hot-mix and the warm-mix shall be determined 
as per AASHTO T283. The TSR value of HMA shall meet the requirement of minimum 
80% as specified in IRC:111. A TSR of above 80% for the warm-mix that is prepared 
at least 30°C below corresponding hot-mix will ensure sufficient resistance against

7. Production of Warm Mix Asphalt
7.1	
Mixing Plant Requirements
WMA requires mix temperatures to be significantly reduced. The two basic types of bituminous 
mixing plant most commonly used are the batch type mixing plant and the continuous drum type 
plant, both of which types can be adapted to manufacture WMA. 
For production of warm mixes that also contain reclaimed bituminous mixes, mixing plant design 
should include adequate features. When any of the various types of mixing plants are used, 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:101-2019
9
it should be ensured that the Recycled Asphalt (RA) and the virgin aggregates are properly 
blended together; the blending process shall facilitate proper heat transfer and shall prevent 
both physical and thermal segregation. 
As with any new technology, there are a few concerns about the production of WMA, specifically 
because of the lower temperatures that are utilized during production. Fortunately, all of these 
problems are expected and solvable in many cases through the adoption of techniques that 
could also be utilized for improving conventional HMA production.
The first concern is about incomplete drying of aggregates (specifically the internal moisture) 
at the reduced temperatures. It has been seen that for aggregates with an absorption value of 
less than 1%, drying of aggregate has not been reported to be a problem at WMA temperatures. 
To prevent the incomplete drying of aggregates, it is suggested that stockpiles be kept as dry 
as possible by sloping sides, paving surrounding areas, and keeping them under cover. To dry 
aggregates with high moisture content the retention time in the dryer drum could be increased 
and the dryer shell should be insulated properly. Ways to detect incomplete drying include a 
greater than 20ºC fall in temperature in mix between discharge and loading, dripping water from 
silos and excessive steam from slat conveyors and a loss of more than 0.5% of the weight of mix 
during moisture content test.
The second concern is regarding incomplete combustion of fuel at the reduced temperature and 
the resulting risk of getting unburnt fuel in the mix.
Evidence of such a problem includes brownish color of mix and higher than normal emissions. 
Proper maintenance and tuning of burner and preheating of burner fuel are recommended 
solutions to this problem. The last but not least problem is the potential of condensation of 
baghouse fines, leading to the clogging and decreased efficiency of the emission control system.
Recommended solutions include proper preheating of baghouse, sealing of leaks, adjusting 
flights and slopes of the dryer to increase baghouse exhaust temperature, insulation of baghouse 
and ductwork and addition of duct heaters to increase baghouse temperatures, if needed.  A high-
pressure drop within a range greater than 0.28 to 0.35 kg/cm2 across the bags is an indicator of 
caking due to condensation.
7.2	
WMA Technology Addition Systems
For WMA Technologies, both rheological modifier and chemical additive types that are blended 
into the binder shall be added through the mixing plant’s normal binder addition system. These 
may also be blended at terminals and supplied to project sites through conventional transportation 
system.
Water carrying chemical additives, which are in powdered form, can be added manually into the 
pugmill of batch type mixers either through the filler system, or by intruding it through the RA collar. 
Equipment to produce foamed bitumen may be installed on both batch and continuous drum 
mixing plant types. The systems obviously operate differently, with separate generations of 
foamed bitumen for each batch in the former type of plant and a continuous production of foam 
in the latter plant type’s case.



======================================================================

10
Conventional types of bituminous mix plants shall have the following monitoring and control 
systems:
	
-	
Binder storage tank heating temperature
	
-	
Integrated individual cold feed hopper (new aggregate and RA) and burner fuel flow
	
-	
Burner fuel flow meter
	
-	
Infrared temperature monitor
	
-	
Infrared silo discharge temperature monitor
Foaming systems should include integrated flow metering and pressure sensing systems for 
both the binder and the water used to produce the foam.
7.3	
RAP and WMA
WMA (Warm Mix Asphalt) and RAP (Recycled Asphalt Pavement) present their own individual 
benefits and costs. WMA has the ability to reduce production costs and environmental impacts 
by reducing fuel consumption and emissions production by reducing the asphalt mix production 
and compaction temperatures. Furthermore, certain types of WMA additives or processes have 
the ability to improve permanent deformation resistance, fracture resistance, and moisture 
sensitivity. The use of RAP can also reduce costs and ecological production effects by utilizing 
a recycled material. However, the increased stiffness of RAP asphalt binder as compared to 
HMA and WMA asphalt binder could be problematic if it is used excessively. Combining WMA 
and RAP can offer potential improvements in pavement performance compared to using either 
material alone. AASHTO M320 recommends the use of a softer virgin binder grade for higher 
(greater than 25%) RAP contents. Adding warm-mix is the perfect solution, as lower mixing 
temperatures result in less binder aging during production and consequently, a softer binder. A 
RAP mix produced at warm-mix temperatures should then have ample stiffness to resist rutting, 
as well as sufficient viscoelastic behavior to resist cracking. Plant operations are also improved 
when WMA and RAP are used together. As per IRC:120, for hot in plant recycling a maximum of 
30% RAP content is recommended to be used, whereas with the use of warm mix additives this 
30% rap content can be increased to 40-50%.
The limit in the use of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement material (RAP) proportion is restricted due 
to stiffness and workability issues related to RAP. This problem is addressed with the help of 
Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) which increases the proportion of RAP used by producing mixes 
having same/better properties viz., better workability, reduced viscosity than Hot Mix Asphalt 
(HMA) at lower temperatures.
For this purpose the RAP mix shall be designed as per IRC:120, the RAP proportion may be 
increased up to 40% with the addition of warm mix additives. 
8. Construction Operation
The construction operation for WMA shall be the same as that prescribed for HMA and shall be 
in accordance with the IRC:111 except that the mixing, laying and rolling temperatures for WMA

**The properties of modified binder shall conform to IRC:SP:53.
9. Quality Assurance
The extent and level of quality control of Warm Mix Asphalt shall be same as that of HMA and 
specified in IRC:111. In addition, one test each for coating, compactibility, moisture susceptibility 
shall be carried out for each mix design. Further, when the WMA mixes include reclaimed 
bituminous mixes, additional testing shall be required.
The properties of the binder contained in the RA (Recycled Asphalt) have to be taken into account 
at mix design stage and the consistency of the recovered binder properties shall be checked 
regularly. 
Typically the moisture content, grading and binder content of each RA fraction shall be checked 
prior to the start of the day’s mix production.
A proposed job mix formula for a WMA must be evaluated for its fatigue cracking resistance (with 
the mix incorporating WMA additive, specifically for wax based additive) prior to being approved 
for construction. 
Warm mix additives can be used with all types of mixes (BC, DBM and SMA etc.) and with all 
types of binders i.e. PMB, rubber modified and viscosity grade binders. It is advised to perform 
lab trial for asphalt mix design to check the volumetric properties before field application.
10. Collaborative efforts by Contracting agency, technology  
provider and the contracting authority
10.1	
WMA technology will actually be applied in works by the Contracting agency. While the 
quality and performance of the work is the responsibility of the Contracting agency, the product 
technology provider has to take responsibility for the efficacy of the product and the technology. 
It is essential, therefore, that both contractor and the product/technology provider come to an 
understanding or agreement with regard to their respective roles and formalize them in the form

11. Road map for WMA technology
It is necessary that every user of the technology monitors and evaluates the performance of the 
WMA technology, creates a database in a standard format (e.g. like one suggested in Annexure) 
and uploads it on its website to make it accessible to any interested party. Over time the success 
stories will lead to the wide spread use of the technology, lessons can be learnt from not so 
successful ones and the unsuitable ones would fall by the way side. In order to assess fossil fuel, 
emission and energy use reductions, it is suggested that beginning and end fuel usage data be 
recorded for test run. This may be accomplished with direct fuel usage meter readout, wherever 
available or by tank gauging as appropriate.

AASHTO T195/ASTM D2489
The standard method of test for “Determining degree of particle coating of Asphalt Mixture”, 
helps in determining the particle coating in asphalt mix based on the percentage of fully coated 
aggregate present in a mix. The specification also helps in determining the mixing time required 
for satisfactory coating of aggregate in the asphalt mixture.
After producing WMA mix by lowering the temperature by at least 30°C lower than conventional 
hot-mix, samples of the mix are taken immediately after discharge from the pug mill. Coating is 
only measured on aggregate retained on 9.5 mm sieve. So the material is sieved on a 9.5 mm 
sieve while still hot and roughly 200-500 gram of sieved sample is collected.
The percentage of coated particles is determined by 
                                            
                    
      
At least 95% of the coarse aggregate particles shall be fully coated at a temperature at least 
30°C lower than conventional hot-mix.
AASHTO T245/ASTM D1559
The standard method of test for “Resistance to Plastic flow for bituminous mixture using Marshall 
Apparatus” covers the measurement of resistance to plastic flow of cylindrical bituminous mixture 
samples by the means of a Marshall apparatus. 
This test method is specified to verify that the warm-mix samples attain equivalent resistance 
to plastic deformation relative to conventional mixes at temperatures at least 30°C lower 
than conventional hot-mix. The specification details the procedure for preparing a cylindrical 
bituminous mixture sample of 100 mm diameter consisting of around 1200g of material. The 
sample is prepared by compacting using a standard Marshall hammer. The samples are checked 
for Marshall Stability and flow under a constant displacement rate testing using a Marshall 
Apparatus after being immersed in water at 60±1°C for 30 to 40 minutes. 
WMA mixes shall have at least 9kN Marshall Stability value (12kN if sample prepared with PMB) 
and flow between 3-6 mm.

AASHTO T283/ASTM D1075
The standard method for “resistance of compacted asphalt mixture samples to moisture-induced 
damage” covers preparation of specimens and the measurement of the change of diametrical 
tensile strength resulting from the effects of water saturation and accelerated water conditioning, 
with a freeze-thaw cycle, of compacted asphalt mixtures. The results may be used to predict long-
term stripping susceptibility of the asphalt mixtures and evaluate liquid anti-stripping additives 
that are added to the asphalt binder. 
The test is performed by compacting cylindrical bituminous mixture specimens to an air void 
level of six to eight percentages. Three specimens are selected as a control and tested without 
moisture conditioning, and three specimens are selected to be conditioned by saturating with 
water undergoing a freeze cycle (-18°C for at least 16 hours), and subsequently having 60±1°C 
water soaking cycle for 24 hours. The specimens are then transferred to a 25±1°C water bath 
for two hours and then tested for indirect tensile strength by loading the specimens at a constant 
rate and measuring the peak force required to break the specimen. The tensile strength of the 
conditioned specimens is compared to the control specimens to determine the tensile strength 
ratio (TSR).
                                              
                                               
The Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR) of the hot-mix and the warm-mix shall be determined as per 
the AASHTO T283. A TSR of above 80% for the warm-mix that is prepared at least 30°C below 
corresponding hot-mix will ensure sufficient resistance against moisture susceptibility.
