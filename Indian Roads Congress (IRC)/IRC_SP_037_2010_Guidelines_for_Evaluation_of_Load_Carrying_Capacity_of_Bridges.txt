GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATION OF LOAD CARRYING
CAPACITY OF BRIDGES
1 INTRODUCTION
1 .1
Revision of IRC:SP:37 "Guidelines for Evaluation of Load Carrying Capacity
of Bridges" has been under the consideration
of Maintenance and
Rehabilitation
Committee, then named as B-9 Committee, since December, 2004.
1.2
In the recent past, several mother Codes and Supplementary Guidelines
have either been revised, modified or are under revision.
The Motor Vehicles Act and Regulations 1988, revised the limit of axle loads, GVW
and new dimensional limits for actual vehicles. Also with the increasing cost of fuel,
POL, the tendency of transport operators has been to carry increased freight resulting
in the overloading. This has been observed and measured
in a number of surveys
conducted on NHs, and SHs.
IRC:6 "Standard Specifications and Code of Practice for Road Bridges, Section
-
II"
has also been extensively revised.
In view of the changes and modifications in the associated Codes and Motor Vehicles
Act,
it has became necessary to revise IRC:SP:37.
1.3
The
Maintenance and
Rehabilitation
Committee, now named
as
B-8
Committee, was reconstituted in 2009 with the following personnel:

The erstwhile B-9 Committee could discuss the revision and finalized only a
few clauses. The newly constituted B-8 Committee thereafter took up the assignment
afresh, discussed clause by clause and
finalized the
revised
draft for the
entire
Guidelines, including live load analysis for simply supported spans ranging from 10 m
to 75 m in increments of 5 m in span length, with 1 -lane to 4-Lane carriageway, showing
B.M. at mid span and S.F. next to support, as per IRC Loadings, GVW loading moving
case and GVW crowded case. These were prepared and presented
in the form of
Graphs and Tables by a Sub-group comprising of Convenor Shri A.D.Narain, Members
S/Shri S.G.Joglekar, D.K.Kanhere & Dr. B.P.Bagish and S.Rastogi (as invitee). The
Committee after due consideration has recommended the finalized Guidelines for its
placement before the Bridges Specifications and Standards Committee and Council.
1.5
The revised draft was approved by B.S.S. Committee in its meeting held on
01.5.2010 and the Executive Committee in
its meeting held on 10.5.2010 authorized
Secretary General IRC to place the same before the Council. The revised document
was approved by the IRC Council in its meeting held on 22.5.2010 at Munnar (Kerala)
for printing.
2 SCOPE
2.1
These guidelines and suggested methods are applicable for
all types of
bridges which are covered by IRC bridge codes, except for the old steel bridges where
materials used are different from those being used now and where the existing strength
of connections between members affected by deterioration or by fatigue cannot be
established by any rational method, as also timber bridges.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:37-2010
2.2
The
objective
of the
guidelines
is
to
establish
a common
procedure
for assessing the strength, evaluating the safe load carrying capacity and provide
information about rating and posting of bridge to owners, the traffic control authorities
and users and the army officers in-charge of movement of military vehicles. Guidelines
also include recommendations
for dealing
with over-dimensioned and overweight
vehicles. The terms rating, posting and over dimensioned/over weight vehicles have
the following meaning:
a)
Rating of a bridge:
The safe permissible load carrying capacity of the bridges in terms of
standard IRC loadings.
b)
Posting of a bridge:
The
limitations
of dimensions and weight
of vehicles,
axle
loads
or train
of vehicles commonly used
in the
country, which can be
permitted to ply without requiring specific permission or escorted by
traffic controllers belonging to concerned authorities.
c)
Over Dimensioned/Over Weight Vehicles
Vehicles carrying consignments resulting
in any of the dimensions
of loaded vehicle
in height, width and length being exceeded over
the
legal
limits
(section
4.3)
are
termed
as
Over
Dimensioned
Consignment (ODC). Overweight Consignments (OWC) are those
carrying
total
loads beyond 100 Tons.
Special
multi-axle vehicles
(Item 9 of Table 2) are also included in this category.
2.3
Rating and posting of a bridge are desirable for all old and new bridges.
It becomes essential to do so when:
a)
The
design
live
load
is
less
than
that
of the
heaviest
statutory
commercial vehicle plying or likely to ply on the bridge
b)
The design live load is not known
c)
Where records and drawings are not available
d)
The bridge, during inspections (routine or special), is found to indicate
distress of serious nature leading to doubts about its structural and/or
functional adequacy
2.4
The rating and posting of a bridge is a complex procedure involving subjective
decisions in certain cases. As such,
it needs to be carried out by bridge engineers with
adequate experience and/or knowledge on the subject.

3 ASSESSMENT OF CONDITION OF BRIDGE
3.1
General
3.1.1
Inspection and maintenance
i)
Routine inspection of newly constructed bridge
will lead to norma!
maintenance, of which
full record should be documented. Any signs
of distress should be noted and brought to the attention of concerned
authorities for initiating further action. This action can lead to rating
and posting exercise.
ii)
For old bridges which had not been thus maintained from the beginning
shall be inspected
in
detail and condition survey and
investigation
shall be carried
out. This may lead to minor repair work or major
repair/rehabilitation. Rating and posting activities shall take cognizance
of the extent of repair work or major repair/rehabilitation.
3.1.2
Assessment of condition
Detailed guidelines and a strong data base are essential in order to make a scientific
assessment of the condition of the bridge. IRC has published following guidelines to
which reference may be made:

;
Where there is a reliable and complete documentation on the design and construction
of the bridge,
field
investigations
will be oriented
primarily towards
identifying the
effect of any deterioration, damage or settlement that has taken place. Where such
documentation is lacking then in addition to the above field investigations, dimensions

IRC:SP:37-2010
of all the structural members should be taken to prepare a complete set of as-built
drawings showing the geometric dimensions
only. However, where
details
of the
reinforcement and pre-stressing cables cannot be ascertained to a degree of accuracy
required for preparation of as-built drawings or for structural calculations,
it will become
necessary to resort to intrusive investigations at few critical sections combined with
desk study using parametric variation
of the
likely ranges of the estimated
data,
including error estimation of the capacity thus calculated.
For all these bridges identified for detailed investigation, field and laboratory testing
may be required to an extent, which would depend on the degree of deterioration of
the structure.
The present guidelines provide the assessment of the load carrying capacity of the
bridge keeping in view its structural scheme and behaviour.
Deficiency regarding the hydraulic parameters of the bridges also need to be assessed
for which guidance should be taken from recorded and observed data, local enquiry,
changes
in the hydraulics of the river and the hydrology of the river basin. For this
purpose, a separate study need to be undertaken as per relevant guidelines.
Observations of local scour, erosion/deposition of bed material and changes in local
stream flows should also be taken
into consideration
for evaluating the safety of
foundations and efficacy of protective measures.
3.2
Data Needed for Assessment
3.2. 1
Collection of data
The following documents/data are to be procured to the extent available:
i)
IRC Code, Specifications as applicable
ii)
Contract drawings updated to reflect as built details
iii)
Design calculations
iv)
Site records of construction
v)

======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 96
======================================================================
IRC;SP:37-2010
Hydrological, seismic and environmental data including changes if any
(revision of zone for seismic classification and retro-fitting requirements
as needed, and seismic retrofitting details,
if carried out.)
Prevalent commercial vehicular loads plying on the bridge
Other natural hazards identified,
if any.
Traffic survey data
3.2.2
Structural condition
Assessment of structural condition of bridge will take account of the following information
which has to be collected during the detailed field investigation:
i)
Cracking,
spalling,
honeycombing,
leaching,
loss
of
material
or
lamination of concrete members in superstructure, sub-structure and
foundations.
ii)
Corrosion
of rebars, exposure of rebars, corrosion
in
prestressing
cables and structural steel members
iii)
In-situ strength of materials
iv)
Effectiveness and condition of structural joints viz. bolted, riveted and
welded connections for steel bridges
v)
Conditions of expansion joints, bearings and articulations hinges
vi)
Settlement, deformation or rotation producing redistribution of stress
or instability of the structure.
vii)
Any possible movements of piers, abutments, skew backs, retaining
walls,
anchorages
and
any
settlement
of
protective
works
and
foundations
viii)
Hydraulic data
covering
scour,
HFL,
afflux,
erosion
at abutments
variation,
if any,
in ground water table and discharging arising out of
new irrigation projects or any other reason
The
list is not comprehensive but includes majority of factors likely to influence load
carrying capacity of the bridge.
3.3
Preliminary Assessment
Preliminary assessment of the structural condition can be made by observing for visible
deterioration in the form of extensive cracking, spalling of concrete, large deflections
and excessive vibrations. In such distressed bridges, there will normally be time for a
preliminary assessment of the distress and
its likely effect on load carrying capacity.

======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:SP:37-2010
For proper assessment of the movements of foundation/substructure, the
vertical
profile survey should be conducted
at the deck
level
both on the upstream and
downstream sides of the carriageway and plotted on a suitable scale. This may be
carried out preferably over a reasonable period say six months, for which data be
recorded. Once a month and profiles compared in order to detect indication of increase
in deflection or any unusual break in the profile. This has been discussed further under
sub-clause 3.8 hereinafter. The movement of the expansion joints (both horizontal and
vertical) should, likewise, be monitored from time to time.
A study of drawings and
calculations (where
available or prepared by the
rating
engineer based on
site measurements) together with an
in-situ
inspection would
generally give indication whether the structural component has been overloaded or
where reserves are
still
available. Where necessary, immediate measures should
be taken to complete the detailed assessment and decide upon the various options
available e.g. derating, closure, replacement, repair, strengthening or no action.
The decision to go for detailed investigation may be taken on the basis of preliminary
investigation of some of the spans and/or on the basis of visual inspection alone.
3.4
Detailed Assessment
The detailed structural assessment should include a careful inspection of full bridge
using techniques appropriate to the kind of deterioration or damage. Since all structural
inadequacies that adversely affect strength or serviceability arise from:
a)
Deficiencies
within
the
structure
i.e.
faults
in design
or
detailing,
material or workmanship
b)
Change
in
external circumstances
e.g.
increase
in
traffic loading,
environmental influences etc. resulting in excessive demands on the
structure.
A systematic approach to the structural assessment must include the following:
i)
Visual inspection of the structure
- this should be carried out in order
to detect all symptoms of damage and defects and should include a
check on the actual dimensions of the structural element concerned.
ii)
Study of existing documents
- this should include all the documents
as mentioned under para 3.2 hereinabove.
iii)
Mapping of cracking pattern
in the structural components. All visible
cracks should be mapped, with cracks of width equal or more than
0.20 mm and duly recorded.
7



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:SP:37-2010
iv)
Assessment of behaviour of the structure under dynamic loading e.g.
excessive vibrations and amplitude.
v)
Environmental influences
- this should include effect of aggressive
agents in the atmosphere, ground, soil and effluents discharged in the
river as well as effects of temperature, rain, snowfall and seismicity at
the location.
vi)
Material
properties of steel and concrete
- several
inspection and
testing
techniques
and
types
of equipment
required
have
been
described in subsequent part of this document.
vii)
Estimate
of loads
-
the
prevalent
heaviest commercial
vehicular
load plying on the bridges and the extent of traffic congestion during
peak hours including the traffic mix should be studied
in detail. For
permitting overdimensioned and overweight
vehicles,
refer
to the
provisions under Clause 11.
3.5
Techniques of Inspection and Testing
The inspection procedures to be followed, a simplified Bridge Inventory Form standard
tools for preliminary assessment and the assessment methods including destructive
and non-destructive tests have been covered in IRC:SP:35.
State of the Art Methods of Non-Destructive Testing of Bridge Structures should also
be studied in this respect to take benefit of the development in this newly developing
technology. The possible assessment methods and tests for such cases have been
indicated in IRC:SP:35, IRC:SP:74 and IRC:SP:80.
However,
all the testing methods are not essential for the assessment. Selection of
tests may be made based on the specific requirement of the structure and distress
condition. Further reliability of the results in ascertaining the exact extent of distress
in the structure should also be given due weightage while drawing conclusions from
the same.
3.6
Assessment of Strength of Materials
In-situ testing
at selected locations normally produce
results with some degree of
divergence due to variability of materials, methods of sampling, inherent dispersion
in co-relation of measured properties to the desired value of target properties (e.g.
rebound hammer test measures surface hardness, and strength
is indirectly derived
there from).

======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:SP:37-2010
Usually,
it would be necessary to establish upper and lower probability limits for the
material
properties under examination obtained by use of such
indirect methods.
Cutting of samples for assessing the material strength of concrete or steel members
should be carried out only when essential, as such sampling may entail some risks
to the structure. Samples cut from steel structures may lead to fatigue weakness
while cores drilled in weak concrete members may act as crack inducers. Therefore,
such work should be carried out under close supervision and only after obtaining
approval from the Design Engineer with respect to the location and details of proposed
sampling.
3.7
Sectional Areas of Structural Members and Location of
Reinforcement and Tendons
When reinforcement details are not known,
position of reinforcement close to the
surface may be determined by covermeter (electromagnetic reinforcement detectors)
or making incision at selected locations, taking care not to endanger the safety of the
structure.
This equipment would also give an approximate indication of bar sizes and spacing.
For reinforcement at depth greater than 120 mm,
it will be necessary to use other
methods such as radiography subject to availability of such equipment, although this
will prove to be expensive due to use of radiographic films.
In prestressed concrete structures, size of tendons can be determined
if the end
anchorages are accessible. Otherwise radiographic methods can be used. However
such methods are not reliable for ducts containing several tendons since individual
tendons are difficult to distinguish clearly.
In case radiography is to be used,
it shall be carried out only be specialists licensed
to handle radio-active isotopes and all health and safety regulations should be strictly
observed.
Invasive investigations at few locations by cutting out a chase
in cover region (e.g.
at mid-span bottom and side of bulbs, or vertical groove in web areas at one or two
locations). This will also help to establish the cable-profile in vertical planes.
3.8
Settlement, Deformation or Rotation of Structural Members
A survey should be carried out on the deck along the bridge centre line and on either
ends of carriageway and the profile plotted to reveal any untoward sag or kink. Levels
shall be taken at intervals of about 5 meters; levels should also be taken on top of

each pier cap at the four corners
in order to determine any differential settlement of
foundations.
Distortion
or
buckling
in
steel components should be
carefully
investigated as
this would result
in reduction of their load carrying capacity. Measurement will be
made by means of a straight edge or dial gauge to give an accuracy of ±0.5 mm in
one metre.

Full Scale Load Test on Bridges
This has been dealt with separately
in Section 8 Reference
is also made to IRC:
SP:51.
4 TRAFFIC FACTORS
4.1
Bridge design standards and specifications determine, in principle, the load
carrying capacity of bridge ensuring that
it can safely carry the anticipated motorized
vehicular traffic. The design live loads are standardized trains of axle loads or other
equivalent loads which lead to load effects at various sections covering and enveloping
the effects of actual loads. This allows the bridges to support such
traffic with the
required factor of safety.
The Motor Vehicles Act and regulations, limit the axle load the Gross Vehicle Weight
(GVW) and impose a number of dimensional limits on actual vehicles.
It
is therefore essential to review existing regulations particularly with regard to the
freight vehicles in order to define the actual live load pattern for the existing bridges
and to establish an approximate correlation with the standardized design live loads as
specified in IRC:6.
4.2
Review of Axle and Vehicle Weights
4.2.1
Classification by motor vehicles act
Motor Vehicles Act 1988 classifies motor vehicles into
(i) Motor Cycle
(ii) Light Motor
Vehicle and
(iii) Medium & Heavy Motor Vehicles. However for purpose of bridge
design, the
first two types of loads which may be predominant
in urban/city areas
are not important.
In
third type also, the passenger vehicles are
lightly loaded as
compared to the commercial vehicles. Hence this guideline covers only commercial
vehicles with GVW more than 16 Tons.

IRC:SP:37-2010
Maximum safe axle loads specified in Motor Vehicles Act (MVA) are further augmented
by data taken from manufacturers for special purpose vehicles plying on Indian roads.
This is produced below in Table 1 and 2.

The laden weight of vehicle, including multi-axle vehicles, must not be more than the
sum total of all maximum safe axle weights. Thus for the four axle semi-articulated
vehicle shown at item Sr. no. 6
- Table 2, comprising of tractor with two tyres on front
axle and four tyres on the rear axle, and trailer having tandem axle with eight tyres on
the rear could carry maximum of 35.2 tonnes, (6+10.2+19 tonnes).
4.2.2
Commercial vehicles operating in India
The vehicles commonly plying on
Indian roads shown
in Table 2 giving types of
vehicles axle position, axle weight and GVW.
It
is possible for a specific bridge location to have different and heavier traffic due
to nature of local industry, predominance of certain type of heavy vehicles (e.g. for
mining
industry, petroleum
industry,
steel
mills,
etc.). Hence for such
location
it
is
recommended that special surveys be conducted to determine actual loading to which
the bridge is subjected, as per IRC:5
- General Features of Design.

Vehicle Dimensions
a)
Height
According
to the MVA 1988, the maximum height of vehicle other
than a double-decker is 3.8 metres unless
it is carrying an ISO series
1
Freight Container,
in which case the height must not exceed 4.3
metres. A double-decker vehicle must not exceed 4.75 metres.
b)
Width
A public service vehicle or transport vehicle other than a motor cab,
must not exceed 2.5 metres in width.
c)
Length
A
rigid
truck must
not exceed
11
metres. On
routes
or
in areas
approved by the State Government, buses may go upto 12 metres
in length. Articulated vehicles must not exceed 16 metres whereas
trucks/trailer combinations have a maximum limit of 18 metres.
4.4
Speed Limit and Overload Factor
4.4.1
Speed limits
The general speed
limits on National and State Highways as defined by MVA for
various types of vehicles are given below. For the full
list reference may be made to
MVA.
•
Medium/heavy goods vehicle (Rigid)
: 65 km/hr
•
Medium goods vehicle with not more than one
: 50 km/hr
trailer or heavy articulated goods vehicle
•
Heavy goods vehicle with not more than one trailer
: 40 km/hr
4.4.2
Overload factors
Industrially manufactured vehicles generally follow limitations of gross vehicle weight.
The manufacture of trailers being wide spread and
is more
difficult to control and
hence many types of trailers ply the roads. With increasing cost of fuel, the tendency of
transport operators is to increase freight weight. The over-loading has been observed
and measured
in a number of surveys on the basis of which the observed overload
factors are indicated in Table 2.
It is useful to note that:
a)
Empty (returning) vehicles have not been counted in the survey
b)
The overload factor is calculated as actual total gross weight divided
13



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 96
======================================================================
!RC:SP:37-2010
by theoretical maximum gross weight which is based upon the number
of axles and tyre configuration. The mean overload factor based on
the data from few surveys is indicated in Table 2.
c)
The maximum over load factor
is not to be taken as the absolute
largest observed overload factor but is an upper fractile above which
only 5
percent observations may
fall.
It
is
calculated as max.
=
(mean +1 .65 standard deviation). Any other fractile can be calculated
on the basis of assumed statistical distribution of overload factors.
However, as discussed above under special circumstances, the actual upper fractile
observed in specially conducted survey may be used to avoid damage to bridge.
4.4.3
Over dimensioned and overweight vehicles
Over dimensioned and overweight vehicles need separate treatment as discussed in
Section
1 1
4.5
Special Traffic Surveys
Present day
traffic
is estimated
to contain a substantial
portion of freight vehicles
particularly on
National
or
State
Highways
and
those
having
port
connectivity
Information on the traffic composition can be obtained through traffic surveys at bridge
approach.
If such survey data are not available,
it may be necessary to carry out special traffic
studies in the following manner:
a)
Manual vehicle counts (per hour and category, per traffic direction)
during specified periods of day or night.
b)
Manual counts and
static weighing
of a small sample of vehicles
(10 percent of vehicles of any particular category)
c)
Counts and automatic measuring of axle loads during a specified time
period in addition to measuring axle spacing and sequence.
The
last type of survey involves sophisticated measuring equipment,
but enables
determination of statistical distribution of axle loads and other parameters such as
vehicle speeds, spacing between vehicles, spacing between axles of the same vehicle,
etc.

5 RATING AND POSTING METHODOLOGY - GENERAL
5.1
Rating Methods
The following three methods may be followed for rating of bridge structures using IRC:6.
Loading Standards and relevant codes covering the type of bridge under review.
i)
Analytical Method is applicable when the as-built or contract drawings
and specifications followed are available, or when such drawings can
be prepared by site measurement to an acceptable level of accuracy
(e.g. for steel, masonry or composite bridges). In any case correctness
of the available drawings shall be verified at site, since quite often
"as-built" drawings/data
is not available. This method
is covered
in
Section 6 and Section 7.
ii)
Load Testing Method
is suitable when no construction drawings
and
specifications
originally followed
are
available,
or when
data
for design cannot be obtained from reference to
literature and the
condition
survey, and/or when the extent of corrosion and
loss of
strength cannot be assessed during condition survey. Guidelines for
this method have been provided in Section 8.
iii)
Correlation Method
-
In
certain cases,
it
is possible to ascertain
the safe carrying capacity of the bridge structure by correlating the
sectional details of the structure with those bridges having identical
specifications and
sectional
details and whose safe load
carrying
capacities are known.
Even in this case,
it is necessary to know the differences and relative deterioration of
the structures under review vis-a-vis the details of those structures whose safe carrying
capacities are known, so that proper assessment by correlation and factoring the
known differences and relative deterioration can be made. This presumes, however,
that the physical condition of the bridge under review
is otherwise satisfactory. The
method is not further discussed in these guidelines.
5.2
Rating of Recently Built and New Bridges
The rating methodology for existing bridges will be that the bridges would be rated
for standard IRC live loads as specified
in IRC:6 (Section
II), and/or for the modified
loading suitable for local conditions as directed by IRC:5. Therefore, for new bridges
and un-deteriorated recently
built bridges, the highest class of design
live load as
envisaged
in the original design shall be taken as the load for rating of the bridge.
15



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:SP:37-2010
Thus the description will be rated for highest loading of Class-AA, Class-A, Class-B
or one of the classes such as 70R, 40R
etc., as described
in Appendix-I of IRC:6
(Section
II). The requirements of the design codes covering the type of bridge under
review have to be fully satisfied.
In case of recently built bridges, some local defects such as honeycombing, spading
of concrete, onset of corrosion,
local deep scour etc. may become apparent during
routine and/or special inspection. Such defects can be taken care of by localized repair,
and
it is not necessary to re-evaluate the rating of bridge due to the same.
It should
be realized that
all codes have built-in margins for time dependent loss of strength,
and for localized reduction of strength at sections, which are not critical. These are not
explicitly stated in the codes. However, local reduction up to 10 percent estimated on
the basis of calculations need not call for re-rating of the entire bridge.
5.3
Rating or Re-rating of Old Bridges
Rating of old bridges for which original designs are not available, and the re-evaluation
of previously rated structures in situations where bridge had suffered deterioration of
strength of any of the main components from superstructure to foundations, requires
careful and detailed evaluation of many complex factors and conditions. Items that
need to be included in this evaluation are briefly discussed below:
5.3.1
Loads
The loads to be considered
in analysis of bridge for rating purposes, are of three
types:
i)
Design live loads at the time of construction
ii)
Design live loads in force at the time of re-evaluation
iii)
Changes
in other loads
in
loading standard IRC:6
(e.g. wind and
seismic loads)
iv)
Changes
in other loads based on field observations such as design
flood level
5.3.2
Stresses
The allowable stresses are to be taken as per the relevant IRC Codes, governing the
type of structure under review.
The allowable stresses normally take into account the long terms effects. However,
these may need to be downgraded
in case of specifically observed deterioration of
materials as discussed below.
16



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:SP:37-2010
The changes
in the design codes from the time of original design also need to be
taken into account.
5.3.3
Materials
i)
The information about the original material specifications have to be
obtained from the records. Knowledge of the year of construction
allows reference to be made to codes and specifications which were in
force at that time and allows one to make an assessment of materials
most likely to have been used and their design strengths considered
at that time.
If the information
is not available, samples of materials
<
taken from the bridge
itself can be examined/tested
to determine
the type and strength of steel, grade of concrete etc. While making
assessment of the strength of concrete based on the core samples,
many factors need to be taken
into account. Reference
is made to
Annex 2 for more information on this topic.
ii)
The loss of effective section of reinforcement, or prestressing steel
has to be based on the investigations specifically made to assess the
same. Long term prestressing losses are known to be higher than
those estimated using earlier codes. The creep and shrinkage effects
are also known to be higher. The original warning about likely higher
loss of prestressing force may have come from actual observations
during periodic inspection, special inspection or due to unsatisfactory
performance such as excessive deflection, vibration etc.
It is possible
in such cases that the defect may be observed
in only a part of the
bridge (one or two spans out of many, or a few piers/foundations).
In such cases,
re-rating need not be based on the strength of the/
weakest span/pier/foundation, but can be carried out after repairing/
strengthening the affected portion so that better overall rating could
be maintained. (This approach is termed as improving the strength up
to that of the next weakest link after repair).
5.3.4
Fatigue
Fatigue
is generally relevant for steel bridges.
In absence of knowledge of loading
history of road
bridges,
it
is
difficult to make assessment of fatigue
history,
or of
fatigue cycles expected in future. The only possible assistance for assessing damage
by fatigue or assessing the remaining
life
is laboratory testing of material samples
taken from the bridge. Estimation of effect of fatigue on joints and connections is not
possible to make, and one has to depend on visual inspection, and observations such
17



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:SP:37-2010
as cracking of welds, loosening of bolts, extent of corrosion etc., for assessing these
items.
5.3.5
Design philosophy
5.3.5. 1
Working load/allowable stress design
Till now
(i.e. 2009) IRC
Bridge codes are based on
the working
load/allowable
stresses philosophy of design. The loads arising from natural phenomena are taken
into account by specifying loads arising from infrequent events, as
in case of wind
(50 years return period); either of maximum observed flood irrespective of return period,
or estimated flood of 50 years return period. Earthquake loads are taken from the
IS 1893, which are based on a method explained in foreword of IS1893. Reference to
the same
is made for details. These loads are combined directly by superposition
in
load combinations, each combination representing some physical condition of loading
for the bridge. However, since publication of IS 1893-2002, the method of evaluation
of seismic response has undergone changes, which methods are also adopted by
IRC:6. These changes need to be considered in the analysis. For purpose of rating of
such structure (i.e. upto 2009) shall be based on the working stress design.
For each of the combination, permissible stresses in materials are stipulated. In case
of rare combinations of maximum
live loads and design flood, taken together with
maximum wind or earthquake, a lower factor of safety may be allowed within elastic
limits, taking into account the condition of the bridge (refer IRC:6)
For working stress design, the allowable stresses to be considered will be the higher
value of (i) and
(ii), but limited to the value prescribed under
(iii), as follows
:
(i)
Allowable stresses considered in original contract documents such as
original design calculations and technical specifications.
(ii)
As provided in Annex 1.
(iii)
Allowable stresses obtained from strength tests by field and laboratory
investigations.
5. 3. 5. 2
Limit state design philosophy
Limit
State Design
Philosophy based on
defining
various
"limits" which should
not be exceeded by the structure during the expected design
life of the structure
when exposed to loading from usage, and loads arising from natural environment.
The deteriorating
effect of aggressive elements of the environment
in which the
structure
is situated are also controlled. The
risk of exceeding the
limits cannot
18



======================================================================
PAGE 27 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:SP:37-2010
generally be made zero,
but
is kept very
low. The
risk
is assessed
in terms of
probability that
is
sufficiently small and acceptable without making the structure
uneconomical or unaffordable. Many countries of the world has based their design
codes on this approach and IRC has incorporated some of the concepts
in their
working stress methods indirectly. However new design codes based on limit state
philosophy are under preparation. These methods are very useful
in assessing the
suitability of existing structures in a rational way examining the same in light of the
increased risk that can be taken while continuing the use of the structures instead
of replacing
it at high cost.
The details of this method are covered by the new design codes which are under
preparation.
Till such time, working stress design as above may be adopted. This
is specifically relevant for the assessment of effects of over-dimensioned/overweight
vehicles. This is discussed in Section 11.
6 ANALYTICAL METHOD OF BRIDGE RATING
In rating exercise design has to pass all the requirements of design codes. However,
while making analysis for posting of bridge, certain deviations can be made
in load
combinations as discussed in Section 8.
6.1
Carriageway Width
Irrespective of the provisions of original design, the number of lanes to be considered
for loading with live load should be based on actual width available in each direction of
traffic in case of divided carriageways or total undivided width for two-way traffic. The
number of lanes should be as per Table 2 of IRC:6.
6.2
Loads and Load Combinations for Rating
The
loads and
load combinations should be as
per requirements
of
IRC:6.
For
assessment of live load to be used, attention
is brought to the changes
in design
practices over the time, especially with respect of use of Class AA and Class 70R
load. Design for both Class AA & 70R, or design for one of Class AA or Class 70R
only, or total design for one and checking of superstructure (or deck slab) only for
the other may have been adopted in the original design. The design of road slab for
girder bridge had been governed by Class 'AA', but while using 70R only for design,
the deck-slab may or may not have been checked for Class AA. The method actually
used in the original design needs to be established, either by records or through fresh
calculations.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:37-2010
6.3
Design Method
The working load allowable stress method shall be used for the computation of rating
of existing bridges, except for the bridges designed on limit state design philosophy.
6.4
Logical Sequence of Rating by Analysis
The following sequence of activities will normally be followed:
Activities at Stage-I
- Establishing need for re-rating
1 )
Identify necessity to re-rate the bridge based on field observations,
defect reports, change in use, change in design codes or for any other
reason.
2)
Inspect all components and all spans to establish the types of defects,
their severity and rank the defective elements such as foundations,
piers,
bearings,
superstructure and
its
sub-parts
by
the
severity
of
defect
(Refer
IRC:SP:35-1990
"Guidelines
for
Inspection
and
Maintenance of Bridges").
3)
From the total defects noted under (2), remove those defects which
can be covered normal maintenance to establish the remaining defects
which are likely to affect the load carrying capacity.
4)
From the
list as arrived under (3) above, for each of the group of
foundation/pier/bearing/superstructure elements
identify the
critical
elements and assess
if special
repairs/strengthening
of the same
is likely to raise the overall rating significantly.
If so, rate the bridge
assuming that the worst elements are repaired.
Activities at Stage-ll
: Initial Desk Studies
1)
Collect
all
design
drawings,
calculations,
and
construction
data
available with owner department.
2)
Look for published literature/reports of the bridge. Often, for important
bridges, articles might have been published soon after construction.
3)
Prepare
a
"design
basis"
report
containing
original
design
data,
including applicable codes, design loads, materials, etc.
4)
Establish the materials and strengths as per original data.
If any of
the essential information
is missing the same has to be collected by
methods described in Stage-Ill.
20



======================================================================
PAGE 29 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:SP:37-2010
Activities at Stage-Ill
: Field Investigations
1)
Verify by
visual
inspection and
estimate
the
extent
of
corrosion
by
observing
"in-place"
loss
of
section.
Collect samples
for
lab
investigation,
if required, with duecare for passage of traffic ensuring
structural safety.
2)
Assess
quality
of concrete by NDT methods. Take concrete core
samples for testing at locations of interest. For interpretation of test
results, Ref. IRC:SP-74 and IRC:SP-80.
3)
Inspect other elements like foundations/piers/bearings/superstructure
elements
etc.,
to
assess
their
criticality
in
influencing
rating
(i.e. capacity of bridges to carry LL).
4)
Properly repair concrete, which has been broken for inspection of
steel etc. using non-shrinking material.
Activities at Stage-IV
: Desk Study for Fresh Design Assessment
1 )
Complete the Design Basis Report for re-design based on Stage-ll
& Stage-Ill including any changes in loads other than live loads. The
superimposed load may have to be increased to take care of additional
material of wearing coat to
fill up low levels created on the deck by
long term creep effects or provision of new surfacing over damaged
in-situ concrete wearing coat or for any other reason.
2)
Establish structural parameters to be studied.
3)
Calculate the actual strength parameters on the basis of strengths
and allowable stresses established from the field data at Stage-Ill and
applicable codes.
4)
Carry out analysis and establish strength demands using the then
IRC:6 design loads. This may have to be done for the desirable level
of live load rating (70R, Class A, etc.), and
if the same is not satisfied,
for the next lower level of design live load.
5)
If the assessed strength
in
(3) above
is more than 90 percent of
the "desirable" strength decided
in step
(4), accept the bridge as
satisfactory for that class.
6)
If not, repeat step (5) for the next lower Class and so on
till the results
satisfying requirements of that class.
7)
For rating as per latest IRC:6, the iterative process may be resorted
to,
- for arriving at the safe load commensurate with strength worked
out as per (3)

Explanatory Notes for Application of Analytical Method
Computation of Capacity of Superstructure
a)
Detailing of steel in old (existing) bridges
When
fully detailed drawings are available the same should be
used. Problem arises when
full details are not available and only
information
at
critical sections can be established
at Stage-ll by
non-destructive or semi-destructive investigative techniques. This
is illustrated by example of solid slab superstructure where magnetic
covermeter
will locate spacing
of bars
in a non-destructive way
and diameters can be confirmed by partially chipping off cover and
exposing the bars. The extrapolation of this knowledge to other
sections has to be based on the knowledge of practices followed in
the period when construction was carried out, regarding curtailment
practices, minimum distribution steel, detailing of corners
in case
of skew bridges, etc. This can be established by comparison with
detailing of similar structures constructed by the owner department
in that period.
b)
Use of Analytical Methods
While assessing the strength that might have been built-in in various
sub-elements, or parts of the superstructure
it is useful to analyse
it
by using the same methods of analysis as prevalently used
in that
period. For example use of Courbon's method for girder bridges, or
use of Guyon-Massienet method for slab bridge or use of equivalent
plate for wide, bridge where Courbon's method could not be used.
This will yield more useful information about the distribution of load
on the
existing superstructures than using modern computerized
methods.
The new grillage analysis, FEM methods or other accurate methods of
analysis can be (or should be) used to get more accurate distribution
of bending moments,
axial forces and shear forces caused by the
live loads and comparing the same with the distribution of existing
strength as assessed by use of old methods.
c)
Slab Bridges
For determination of strength of old or deteriorated slab bridges, more
accurate analysis should be carried out. Table-3 can be used to arrive
at the safe axle loads at primary evaluation.

Notes:
i)
Slab thickness includes a cover of 25 mm
ii) A 75 mm thick wearing coat is assumed over the slab
iii) No separate allowance for impact need be made on the safe axle loads as the same has already been accounted for.
d)
Masonry and Plain Concrete Arch Bridges
For these types of structures only the methods used
in the relevant
period
of construction have to be used. These are available from
literature and old PWD hand books. Often, the design has been based
on the 'rule of thumb' or use of 'standard' sections or nomogram. Use
of one such nomogram is shown in Fig.1 for arches. In this method:
i)
The provisional safe axle loads (before applying various factors)
for different spans, thickness of arch ring and depth of cushion
may directly be read from the nomogram in Fig.1.
ii)
Assessment arrived
at from the nomogram are
in terms of a
maximum provisional axle load (before applying various factors),
which may be taken as the combined load
in case of tandem
axles,
iii)
The allowable axle loads and thereby the rating shall be arrived
at from the provisional axle loads obtained above, by multiplying
23



======================================================================
PAGE 32 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:SP:37-2010
these loads by appropriate profile factors, material factors, joint
factors, support factors, etc., specified in Annex 2.
iv)
For plain concrete arches, the material factor of 1 .5 shall be used
in the analysis.
e)
Reinforced/Prestressed/Composite Bridges using Arch as part
of Bridge
These should be analysed by applicable rational methods of design
including the arch action.
2.
Substructure including Bearings
The overall rating of the bridge is not expected to be affected by bearings.
a)
Condition
survey
of bearing
will
reveal which
bearings
will need
replacement, and which need maintenance. Also local zones of stress
concentration of substructure which are immediately in the vicinity of
the bearing can be inspected and identified for repair,
if needed.
b)
Condition survey of pier caps and
piers
is important.
If these are
weakened for any reason, the bridge rating can be affected. This
is
especially true for old masonry/plain concrete piers. Local repairs, or
jacketing, may turnout to be a cheaper and viable option than to "de-
rate" the bridge.
If this
is not the case, the re-rating
will have to be
done as governed by the strength of substructure.
c)
If development of deep scour
is the cause
of distress
- such as
excessive stresses or excessive vibrations -
it can be tackled by filling
the deep scour holes by stone/gabions and general bed protection
and re-rating of bridge can be avoided.
If, however, the general bed
level has also changed, the resultant changes in hydraulics may call
for re-rating.
3.
Foundation Condition
The distress in foundations is the most difficult item to inspect, or strengthen.
a)
Where excessive scour
is the source of danger, the same can be
treated as discussed in 2(c) above.
b)
Where excessive settlements have been observed, one of the two
situations may exist.
One
is that foundation has stabilised after settlement. This
is more
likely to happen
in open foundations
in sandy soil and rocky strata.
This is also possible in case of piles where bottom of pile has not been

properly cleaned before concreting and pile has settled through this
material and then has come to rest on good sound strata.
In these situations, re-setting the bearings and bridge at the original
design levels will sort out the problem.
The second type is of foundation in clayey soil which have not reached
stable condition and settlements may continue.
In such cases,
if any
foundation treatment is not feasible, the only option
is to de-rate the
bridge and reduce the loads.
c)
When structural damage to the elements of foundation are noticed or
suspected (such as corrosion of steel in pile foundations) or damages
in
piles below ground
level
revealed by non-destructive methods.
Generally
it is not possible to repair the same and de-rating of bridge
will be called for.
7 ANALYSIS FOR POSTING BASED ON ACTUALLY PLYING
VEHICLE POPULATION
7.1
General
The rating of the bridge based on the hypothetical trains of live load cannot be directly
used for putting controls/restrictions to traffic actually plying on the bridge.
For this purpose, the maximum effects of loads plying on bridges need to be calculated
instead of IRC:6 Live Loads, and combined with loads from other sources
(flood,
wind, etc.). These effects can then be compared with the 'rating capacities' obtained
from Section 6 or with the directly assessed strengths based on actual observations
(Section 9).
*
(3
\)
For this purpose the live loads to be considered are described below:
7.2
Live Loads Plying on the Bridge
1)
IRC:5 General features
of design
permits
vide Clause
102.7.1 &
102.7.2 use of 'any specific variation' from IRC:6 clauses to cover
special load conditions. Deviation from the standard loading classes
is made under sanction of this clause.
2)
The data of actually plying vehicles in the country has been presented
in Table 2 of Section 4. The 'design train of vehicle' to be considered
is based on the following considerations:
a)
Bridges should be posted for one of the Nominal GVW Classes
shown in Table 2, except over dimensioned vehicles.
26



======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:SP:37-2010
b)
For over-dimensioned and overweight consignments carried on
multi-axle vehicles special studies have to be made on case to
case basis, as discussed
in Section
8. However, on specially
selected
routes
such
as
port
connectivity
routes
or
routes
serving heavy
industrial complexes maximum
permitted
load
can be estimated based on the maximum number of axles that
can occupy the critical length (based on influence line diagrams
for bending and shear),
multiplied by the maximum permitted
standard axle load.
If the axle load and placement of tyres
is
different from the standard axles individual case based studies
have to be carried out.
c)
After selecting the reference GVW class of vehicle, distance between
two successive vehicles and the impact factors are to be taken as
below:
i)
Reference GVW Vehicles at 4.0 m spacing between last axle and
first axle of next vehicle without impact factor with appropriate
overload factor.
ii)
Reference GVW vehicles at 20.0 m spacing between
last axle
and first axle of next vehicle with impact factor with appropriate
overload factor.
The rationale behind these cases is explained in notes below.
i)
Moving Traffic Condition
The road on which structure
is situated may have been designed for
vehicle speed of 80 to 100 km/hr. However,
at more normal (lower
speed)
of about 60
km/hr.
the
reasonable
distance between two
successive vehicles
is considered as two
to four times the
length
of vehicles (approx. 10 m to 25 m). For simplifying the calculations,
on an average distance of 15 m
is specified between two vehicles
for
all classes of GVW. At this distance
full impact factor should be
considered as per IRC:6.
ii)
Crowded Loading or Traffic Jam Condition
Vehicle standing 'bumber-to-bumber' with spacing of 4.0 m between
back axle of vehicle to front axle of vehicle behind
it
is observed
in
practice. Number of vehicle or
part there
of that should be taken
in design of a section
is decided by the influence
line diagrams for
bending and shear for that section.
•
No impact factor should be considered
in this crowded loading/
traffic jam case.
27

©
The overloads factor to be considered should be based on the
actual survey data,
but should
not be less than the average
overload factor indicated in Table-2.
It
is important to note that this overload factor
is taken only for the
purpose of checking structural safety of a bridge, and
is not to be
construed as an official recognition, or license for overloading vehicles.
The laws of the country will govern in these matters.
d)
Transverse Spacing of Vehicles
The transverse spacing of all vehicles should be taken as per Fig. 1,
Fig. 2 & Fig. 3. The design of road slab supported between webs, or
cantilever slab should be verified considering the effect of rear axle
loads of the design GVW vehicles Hus impact factor. The concept of
effective width as per IRC:21 can be used for the same as a simplified
method, in lieu of exact analysis made of full span using grid analysis
of finite element method.
For non-standard distribution of tyres on an axle exact analysis taking
into account actual position of tyres is recommended.

7.3
Load Combinations with Other Loads of IRC:6
As a general design philosophy, GVW loading replaces only the IRC:6
live loads.
As such, other load and load combinations should be used as per IRC:6 and the
relevant design codes. Exceptions
to above may be considered
in the following
situations.
i)
Where
crowded/traffic jam
loading
is
governing,
the
permissible
stresses may be increased for the substructure and foundation design
for wind/water current combinations by further 15 percent beyond
those allowed by design codes and combination with seismic loads
need not be checked.
ii)
If the heaviest GVW load which superstructure can carry is considered
to be plying very infrequently, the substructure and foundations can
be checked on the basis similar to
(i) above. Full combination as per
IRC:6 and the design code may be made for the frequently plying
GVW only.
iii)
For old bridges, which are assessed as due for replacement, in the wind
and seismic combinations lower values of wind loads reduced upto
50 percent may be used. Seismic checks may be omitted altogether.
iv)
For OD/OW vehicles, refer Section
1 1
8 LOAD TESTING FOR RATING AND POSTING
8.1
Load Test
Load test for rating purposes and load test for posting purposes are required to be
carried out in the following circumstances:
a)
Load Test for Rating
i)
Load Test for rating
is done when
it is not possible to determine
the rated capacity of a bridge due to lack of essential details as
described in Section 6.
ii)
For rating of masonry arches load testing
is recommended.
b)
Load Test for Posting
Load Test for posting
is done when details required for verifying the
strength of all elements of existing structure by analytical methods
is
not possible due to lack of reliable data.
30



======================================================================
PAGE 39 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:SP:37-2010
8.2
Test Vehicles for Rating
Rating
is essentially done to verify which of the Standard IRC loadings described
in
IRC:6 in combination with other loads can be assigned to the bridge. Use of mobile test
vehicles duplicating the axle loads for various classes of loadings should be preferred
as compared to the use of equivalent static load which are difficult, time consuming
and needs longer closure of traffic on the bridge. The advantage of using such mobile
vehicles
is that they can be quickly positioned
in the exactly required locations. Also
being
rolling
loads,
all cross-sections
of superstructure are tested without having
to workout special
loading
patterns
to represent envelope diagrams
of the span
for bending and shear.
In exceptional cases
if commercial vehicles as specified
in
Table 2 are used, the number and spacing of such vehicles need to be worked out
so as to produce equivalent B.M. and shear at critical sections on those due to the
Standard IRC loading.
8.3
Test Vehicles for Posting
The test vehicles will be from amongst those commercially available as specified
in
Table-2. The test vehicle chosen will be the next heavier vehicle than the predominant
heavy vehicles presently plying over the bridge. The second next heavier vehicle may
be considered for testing,
if required,
after the load testing with the
first vehicle
is
complete and found to be satisfactory. Use of heavier vehicles,
if available, is permitted
for testing.
The test vehicle used for purpose of posting shall ailow for appropriate overload factor
based on actual traffic data in the region.
8.4
Positioning of Test Vehicles
8.4.1
General
Test vehicles shall be placed
at marked locations on the bridge so as to produce
maximum moment effects on girders. While placing the test vehicles at the desired
location on the deck, these will preferably be moved from both directions leading to
their final positioning.
For posting purposes, the response of the structure to loading may be checked at a
few
critical selected
locations. Usually the following checks may be considered as
adequate:
a)
Mid-span region and 1/4
th span for sagging B.M. for slabs/girders/ box
section bridges.
31



======================================================================
PAGE 40 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:SP:37-2010
b)
Support section for hogging B.M. for cantilever bridges, continuous
bridges and bridges with over hangs.
c)
Shear at support and at points of changes in web thickness.
8.4.2
Arch bridges
For arch bridges, the rear axle of a standard truck shall be placed on the crown and
in the case of twin tandem rear axle, the rear twin tandem axles shall be placed
symmetrically about the transverse centre line of the bridge.
8.5
Procedure for Load Testing
The test procedure in general shall be as per IRC:SP:51
- "Guidelines for Load Testing
of Bridges".
Any requirements
arising
out
of
earlier observations about defects/cracking
etc.,
during inspection shall be taken into account.
8.5.1
For concrete girders prior to load testing, observations shall be made for
any crack in the structure. The cracks,
if any, shall be measured for their width and
marked. The external dimensions of the concrete sections and properties of concrete
may be used for computation of theoretical deflection.
8.5.2
Prior to testing a whitewash shall be applied at the critical sections for ease
of observation of behaviour of cracks and their new formations during the test.
8.5.3
The load test shall be done during such period of the day when the variation
in temperature during test is low. Preferably, the testing could be done in early hours
of morning or late evening.
8.5.4
The test load shall be applied
in stages following the given values 0.5W,
0.75W, 0.90W,
1 .OW, where "W" is the gross laden weight of the test vehicle.
8.5.5
For each stage, the correspondingly loaded test vehicle shall be brought to
the intended/marked position and observation of deflections shall be made immediately
on loading and after five minutes.
The test vehicle should be taken off the bridge and instantaneous deflection recovery
and deflection recovery 5 minutes after the removal of the load should be noted.
8.5.6
After the load placement, observation shall also be made for development
of any new crack and widening of the existing ones.
32



======================================================================
PAGE 41 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:SP:37-2010
8.5.7
Prior to starting of testing, the theoretical deflections for various stages of
loading shall be calculated and plotted at points of interest. On this graph, the actually
observed deflections shall be plotted during the progress of testing.
The linearity of load deflection should be generally obtained in the test.
If two successive
readings show excessive deflection of more than 10 percent from the extended linear
behaviour,
it can be due to onset of non-linear (plastic) behaviour. The test shall be
discontinued, temporarily and reference made to the design office for review of the
entire procedure. However,
deflections
shall be continued
to be marked
for next
24 hours.
Next
stage
of
load
increment
should
be
stopped
under
any
of
the
following
conditions:
8.5.8
(a)
For arch Bridges
i)
Crown deflection or spread of abutment as specified in sub-clause 8.6
is reached.
ii)
The recovery of crown deflection or spread of abutment/pier
is less
than 80 per cent.
iii)
Signs of distress in the shape of appearance of visible new cracks a
perceptible widening of existing cracks
in the arch
rib are observed.
Methods
of measuring
crack
width
have
been
discussed
under
Sub-clause 3.5 hereinbefore.
8.6
Acceptance Criteria
8.6.1
For arch bridges
Where no crack is observed, the load for rating shall be taken as the least of:
i)
The load on rear axle causing a deflection of
1 .25 mm
in the case
of test vehicles having single rear axle and for test vehicles having
twin rear axles, the total load on the two rear axles causing a crown
deflection of 2.0 mm.
ii)
The load causing a spread
of abutment/pier of 0.4 mm
at spring
level.
iii)
The
load
causing
recovery
of
crown
deflection
or
spread
of
abutment/pier to a value of 80 percent.
The load for rating shall be taken as half the axle load at which a new visible crack or
perceptible widening of existing cracks are observed.

The load for rating shall be taken all the least of:
i)
The load causing a deflection of 1/1 500 of the span in any of the main
girders for simply supported spans OR for cantilever spans the load
causing a deflection of 1/800 of the cantilever span in any of the main
girders. The rotation of pier should be accounted for while calculating
the deflection.
ii)
The load causing tension cracks of width more than 0.3 mm
in any
of the girders for normal cases and 0.2 mm for structures exposed to
very severe and adverse conditions.
iii)
The load causing appearance of visible new diagonal cracks of width
more than 0.3 mm for normal cases and 0.2 mm for structures exposed
to very severe and adverse conditions or opening/widening of existing
cracks close to the supports in concrete girders.
iv)
The
load
at which
recovery
of deflection on removal
of test load
is
not
less than 75
percent
for R.C.C.
structures, 85 percent

considered as per provisions contained in IRC:51.
9 BRIDGE POSTING
9.1
General
All postings for bridges shall be made as shown
in Fig. 4,
in terms of equivalent axle
loads and/or gross vehicle weights (GVW) of the commercial vehicles plying on Indian
roads and
satisfying
provision of the Motor Vehicle Act as shown
in Table
2. For
overall dimensioned/overweight commercial vehicles the limits shall also be indicated
as per Section 11
9.2
Method of Analytical Computation for Posting
Bridge
structure
rated
for vehicles classes as
per
IRC:
6
will be posted
for the
commercial vehicles shown
in Table 2 by comparing the forces caused by GVW
vehicles with the design forces imposed by IRC loading.
Annex 3 shows comparison of some of the IRC:6 standard loading, for 1-lane, 2-lane,
3-lane and 4-lane superstructure with simply supported spans from
1 0 to 75 m vis-a-vis
GVW vehicles. Only the main total span moments and shears are presented. These
can be used as guidance. The transverse distribution, load and resulting increase in
different girders or portions of slab bridges has to be done for each bridge as per its
geometry.

Temporary Traffic Restriction
Depending upon the assessment of the bridge condition. The rating/posting engineer
would decide the necessity of the following traffic restrictions on the bridge from safety
considerations
till the exercise of posting
is completed.
i)
Speed Restriction
- to be effective
till the detailed investigations and
strengthening or rehabilitation work and load testing
(if required) on
the repaired bridge
is complete. The limiting speed of vehicles over
the structure will be decided by the bridge authority depending upon
the physical condition of the structure.
ii)
Geometrical Restriction -this would involve curtailing the carriageway
width to ensure lesser extent of live load on the bridge at a particular
time and/or installation of height barrier on either end approaches to
restrict passage of overloaded or oversized commercial vehicle on
the bridge.
iii)
Footpath Loading
- depending upon the structural condition of the
footpath
slab,
restriction on
load on
footpath may be imposed
till
the distressed part
is rehabilitated. Restriction on footpath load may
also be; necessary
in order to reduce the
total load on the bridge
superstructure.
9.4
Posting Sign
Postings for bridges shall be made as shown in Fig. 4, on both sides of the bridge. The
load regulatory and advance warming signs as shown
in Fig. 4, shall be installed on
both sides of the bridge on the approaches from the bridge abutments and at all road
junctions leading to the posted bridge.
Load Regulatory Sign
This will be placed at a sufficient distance (not less than 100 m) from the abutment, on
both ends of the bridge so that truckers can make arrangements to use detours or to
limit their loads to the maximum weight allowed.
Advance Warning Sign
For all bridges to be posted, an advance warning sign indicating a "Load Limit Bridge
Ahead" will be placed at least 200 m from the abutments on both ends of the bridge
and at all road junctions leading to the posted bridge starting from the earliest major
junction.

Enforcement
9.5.1
Enforcement of restrictions in respect of maximum axle load GVW, speed
on bridge and geometrical restrictions may be required for safety of the bridge. This
may be ensured by the respective department through the administrative machinery
of the
State.
For bridges
of paramount importance
(e.g.
strategic
locations, on
highways carrying heavy traffic loads, bridges whose closure will involve very long
detour etc.), specialized equipment may be used for such enforcement. These may
comprise:
i)
Portable
or permanent weight
bridges
or weight-in-motion (WIM)
appliances or computerized
traffic management systems presently
available indigenously.
ii)
Doppler Radars for checking vehicle speed on the bridge.
iii)
Frame Barriers - suitably designed for specific applications (motorized
and remote controlled from a
traffic booth;
if necessary), such as
restricting height/width of vehicles.

The options available to the rating engineer as alternatives to bridge load
posting are as follows:
Restrictions to speed limit
Restrictions
to

frequent
inspections
Lane limits
Repair
Strengthening
9.5.3
In addition to the posting sign at the distressed bridge
site, the following
methods may be considered by the enforcing authority for notifying public of the bridge
posting to be suitably located at a number of road junctions leading to the posted
bridge:
News release
Special notice to trucking association legal notice
Notice pasted at weigh stations
Weight limit maps or lists
The posted bridges are required to be inspected thoroughly and frequently, at least
once a year.
10 REPAIR, STRENGTHENING AND REHABILITATION
OF BRIDGES
10.1
Pursuant to the detailed
inspection, testing and assessment of the load
carrying capacity of an existing distressed bridge, the various options available to the
bridge owner and the follow up actions to be taken would be carefully evaluated. Four
possible options have been mentioned
in IRC:SP:35. One of these options will be to
undertake immediate repair strengthening and rehabilitation of the bridge.
The
technical scheme
for
repair and
strengthening
of
distressed
bridge would
depend on
the
nature and
extent
of the
distress
in
the
bridge
superstructure,
substructure and foundations. The objective must not always be to restore the original
condition of the bridge.
It can be quite sufficient both economically and technically to
provide proper strengthening whilst, at the same time, derating the safe load carrying
37



======================================================================

capacity. In this respect cost analysis can be of help. An estimate can also be obtained
by studying the risks involved and giving consideration to the life of the structure as to
the success of the repair/strengthening measures proposed.
The above subjects are covered
in
detail
in IRC guidelines SP:40 "Guidelines on
Techniques for Strengthening and Rehabilitation of Bridges". IRC:SP:74 - Guidelines
for Repair & Rehabilitation of Steel Bridges, IRC:SP:75 - "Guidelines for Retrofitting of
Steel Bridges by Prestressing" and IRC:SP-80 - "Guidelines for Corrosion Prevention,
Monitoring and Remedial Measures for Concrete Bridge Structures".
11 GUIDELINES FOR PERMITTING OVER-DIMENSIONED/
OVER-WEIGHT VEHICLES
11.1
General
Due to industrialization of many parts of the country, heavy loads much
in excess
of the capacities of IRC:6 loads and GVW49 T vehicles need
to be carried on
existing
bridges. These loads
shall be carried over the bridge with the specific
permission of the Authorities. The checking of bridge components to carry such
loads and the load combinations as required by IRC:6 need to be reviewed for
their suitability by the bridge authority/owner. The following provisions cover the
aspects to be reviewed and the possible deviations that can be permitted from the
normal design rules.
11.2
Over-Dimensioned Consignments
For these loads, the physical dimensions of the consignment should be such as not
to damage any permanent part of the bridges such as handrails, or any structural part
for through type bridges. The over-dimensioned vehicles be allowed only with a pilot
vehicle and at that time no other vehicle be allowed to ply on the bridge.
11.3
Load & Load Combinations
1)
The load
carried by over dimensioned and over weight vehicle
is
certified by manufacturer including the packing, supporting framework
etc. The weight of the vehicle itself should be added to the same.
2)
The distribution of load on various axles depends upon the rigidity of
the trailor and the load
itself, apart from the location of load. Some
carrier trailors are hydraulically controlled to spread the load equally.
If not, loading of trailors should be symmetrical with reference to
all
38



======================================================================
PAGE 47 of 96
======================================================================
IRC:SP:37-2010
axles. The impact factor may be reduced to
1 .0
if speed restriction
is
placed on
it at 5 km to 10 km per hour.
The superstructure design should be checked with load travelling at
centre with minimum eccentricity of 0.3 m. The permissible over stress
on (DL+LL) combination can be taken as 33 percent in R.C.C. bridges.
For prestressed superstructures, tensile stresses should not lead to
crack widths more than 0.3 mm for structures having non tensioned
reinforcement at all sections.
For segmentally constructed
bridges, without reinforcement across
joints, tension should not exceed beyond 2/3
rd modulus of rupture, for
segments with epoxy joints and no tension for dry joints.
Loads
should
not
be
transported
when
wind
speed
exceeds
40 km/hr. The wind load on the structure and the consignment is to be
taken at 5 percent of the design wind speed, with no further increase
in the allowable stresses.
Seismic loads need not be taken into account.
Water current forces should be considered as applicable at time of
transportation.
Allow
able
foundation
pressure
should
not
exceed
more
than
25 percent.
Provision
of
temporary
supports
taken
from
river
bed
are
not
recommended since the load shared between such supports and the
superstructure cannot be reliably calculated.
If the bridge structure is not sufficiently strong, the alternative methods
of transportation should be adopted. These include:
a)
change of route.
b)
Provision
of temporary road
at
river bed and temporary pipe
culverts for waterway in case of dry season and shallow depth
of water.
c)
Transportation by barges for deep water rivers.

be ignored. Recent cracks usually show clean faces with perhaps small loose fragments of masonry. Although cracks may
shear through bricks or stone, they normally follow an irregular line through the mortar. Care must be taken not to confuse
such cracks with mere deficiences of the pointing material.

next to the support.
The following conditions have been taken into consideration for preparing the Tables
and Graphs for bending moments and shear forces.
•
For IRC Loadings, values of BM and SF are inclusive with impact
factor and lane reduction factor as per IRC:6.
•
For GVWs in moving traffic case, BM and SF are inclusive with impact
factor, lane reduction factor as per IRC:6 and an over load factor of
1.4 Results are also furnished for GVW 49.00 T with an over load
factor of 2.0.
•
For GVWs in crowded/traffic jam case, BM and SF are inclusive with
lane reduction factor as per IRC:6, an over load factor of 1.4 and
without impact factor. Results are also furnished for GVW 49.0 T with
overload factor 2.0.
•
Minimum spacing between rear and front axles of two successive
GVW vehicles
is taken as 20 m
in moving traffic case and 4.0 m
in
crowded/traffic jam case.

5.3 m to 9.6 m), IRC results are based on governing effect from 2-Lanes
CI. A, 1-Lane CI. 70R Wheeled and 1-Lane CI. 70R Tracked.
•
For spans with 3-lane carriageway (carriageway width between
9.6 m to 13.1
m), IRC
results are based on governing effect from
3-Lanes CI, A, (1-Lane CI. 70R Wheeled + CI.A 1-Lane) and (1-Lane
CI. 70R Tracked + CI. A 1 - Lane).
•
For spans with 4-lane carriageway (carriageway width between
13.1 m to 19.6 m), IRC results are based on governing effect from
4-Lanes CI. A, (1-Lane CI. 70R Wheeled + CI. A 2-Lane), (1-Lane CI.
70R Tracked + CI. A2- Lane), 2-Lanes CI, 70R Wheeled and 2-Lanes
CI. 70R Tracked.
•
The disposition of the vehicles
in longitudinal direction
in shown
in
Fig. 11 and 12.
Overweight consignment (OW/OD vehicles) produces very severe effects than any
other GVW class load, as well as the IRC loading, and as such this type of vehicle,
needs to be analysed under special load combinations as discussed
in Section
9.
These are not covered in the said comparison.
As the impact factors for concrete bridges (reinforced and prestressed) are different
from the steel bridges. Accordingly two sets of tables and curves have been prepared as
indicated in the tables giving the MB, SF for varying bridge spans and lane widths.
