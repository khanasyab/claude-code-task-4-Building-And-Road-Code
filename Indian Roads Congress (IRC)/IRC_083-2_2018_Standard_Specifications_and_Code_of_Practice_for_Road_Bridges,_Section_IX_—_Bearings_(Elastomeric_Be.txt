STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS AND CODE OF 
PRACTICE FOR ROAD BRIDGES
SECTION: IX BEARINGS 
PART- II (ELASTOMERIC BEARINGS)
INTRODUCTION
The Standard Specifications and Code of Practice for Road Bridges, Section IX–
Elastomeric Bearings, Part-II based on working stress method was first published 
in June, 1987. Thereafter, unprecedented growth of knowledge in the field of Bridge 
Bearing Design, Manufacturing & Workmanship, Acceptance Specifications, Certification 
& Marketing and Development of high strength materials took place in the past two 
decades. Prelude to this, the first revision of this Code based on Ultimate Limit State 
(ULS) condition was brought-out in January, 2015 and is widely being adopted across the 
country. Meanwhile, feedbacks/inputs have been received from Industries, Users, etc on 
usage of this code and seeking more clarifications. Thereafter, the newly constituted B-6 
Committee for the tenure 2015-17 also felt the necessity to include Seismic provisions, 
Compound properties of Natural Rubber & Raw materials, Manufacturing Tolerances, 
Compression Stiffness Test Parameters, etc in line with the best global practices. For 
this purpose, a Sub-Group comprising of Shri Alok Bhowmick and Shri S. Majumdar 
prepared the list of Errata and Amendments pertaining to the published Code IRC:83- 
2015 (Part-II), ‘Standard Specifications and Code of Practice for Road Bridges; Section: 
IX Bearings (Elastomeric Bearings) Part-II. The suggestive list of Errata and Amendments 
was circulated among the members of B-6 Committee and comments were received 
from the members. The B-6 Committee constituted a Sub-Committee comprising of the 
following members to address the received comments in the revised draft document 
appropriately.
(i) Shri G. Sharan, Convener, (ii) Shri A.K. Benerjee, (iii) Shri Alok Bhowmick, 
(iv) Shri S.S. Gaharwar.
The Sub-committee held its meetings on 4th February 2017 to finalize the Errata and 
Amendments. The recommendations of the Sub-Committee were discussed in the 
meeting of B-6 Committee held on 15th September 2017. After deliberations, B-6 
Committee approved the recommendations of the Sub-Committee with the opinion 
that the modified draft document incorporating the Errata and Amendments may be 
submitted for the approval of BSS Committee as the revised draft document. Thereafter, 
the revised draft document was approved by the Bridges Specifications and Standards 
(BSS) Committee in its meeting held on 23.10.2017. The Executive Committee in its 
meeting held on 2nd November, 2017 considered and approved the same for placing 
it before the IRC Council. Finally, the document was considered by the IRC Council 
in its 213th meeting held on 03.11.2017 during the Annual Session held at Bengaluru 
(Karnataka) and was approved for publication.

IRC:83-2018 (Part-II)
1 SCOPE
This part of the Specification (referred to as ‘Code’ hereinafter) applies to elastomeric bearings 
with or without complementary bearing devices to extend their field of use such as flat sliding 
elements covered by relevant Part, as used in bridge structures or any other structure with 
comparable support conditions.
This part of Code applies to laminated bearings, laminated sliding bearings, plain pad and 
strip bearings and does not cover elastomeric bearings made with other elastomer materials 
than those specified in Clause 4.0. This part of Code applies to elastomeric bearings with 
dimensions in plan up to 1200 x 1200 mm for laminated bearings, plain pad bearing and 
width in plan up to 1200 mm for strip bearing. The elastomeric bearings covered in this code 
can be used in conjunction with other bearing elements, as appropriate, as per other relevant 
parts of IRC: 83.
Elastomeric Bearings can be used with following possible arrangements:
	
a)	
Elastomeric Bearings provided on individual supports to transfer vertical loads 
and non-seismic lateral loads and to accommodate imposed deformations 
and translations. Seismic actions in this case are transferred to substructure 
by separate structural connections (either monolithic or through pin/guide 
bearings) of the deck to other supporting members (piers or abutments).
	
b)	
On all or individual supports, with the same function as in a) above, combined 
with seismic links/seismic stoppers which are designed to resist seismic 
actions.
	
c)	
On all supports to resist both seismic as well as non-seismic actions. Refer 
Annexure D for design considerations when elastomeric bearings are used 
to resist seismic actions.
This part of Code applies to normal (low damping with an equivalent viscous damping ratio < 
0.06) elastomeric bearings only. Use of special (high damping) elastomeric bearings are not 
covered in this code, for which specialist literature or international code may be consulted.
This part deals with bearings for use in operating temperatures ranging from -10 °C to + 
50 °C. For locations where the minimum atmospheric temperature drops below -10 °C for 
continuous periods of 24 hours or more, the provision of this Code shall not apply.

5.1.3	
Basis of design
The design rules are based on the assumption that the elastomer is a viscoelastic material, 
the deflection of which under a compressive load is influenced by its shape. Reinforcing 
plates in the bearing shall be chemically bonded to the elastomer during vulcanisation to 
prevent any relative movement at the steel/elastomer interface. Unless otherwise specified 
design values stated in this code means values in ULS and are represented with subscript 
‘d’ (Clause 3.4) in respective notation. For loads, load factors and load combinations, IRC: 6 
shall be referred. For the strength analysis of the elastomeric bearings, the resultant rotational 
movement shall be taken as not less than ±0,003 radians and the resultant translational 
movement as not less than ±10 mm.
Effect of top and bottom cover layer shall not be considered in design when their thickness 
is less or equal to 2.5 mm.
All designed bearings shall meet the requirements given hereafter:
a)	
Maximum design strain
At any point in the bearing the sum of the strains (εt,d) due to the design load effects is given 
by the expression:
εt,d = KL (εc,d + εq,d + εα,d)
where:
εc,d = design strain due to compressive design loads as defined in Clause 5.1.3.2.
εq,d = design shear strain due to design translatory movements as defined in Clause 5.1.3.3.
εα,d = design strain due to the design angular rotation as defined in Clause 5.1.3.4.
KL is a type-loading factor. The value of KL is normally considered as equal to 1.0. In case of 
applications with specific requirement of limiting the strain under live load effects, KL may be 



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 52
======================================================================
14
IRC:83-2018 (Part-II)
considered as 1.5 only for live load effects. For all other load effects, KL may be considered 
as 1.0.
εt,d shall not exceed the maximum value εu,d given by the expression:
,=    
,
 
where:
εu,k = maximum permissible value of 7 for ULS (See Note 1)
γm = partial safety factor. Unless otherwise specified, the recommended value is γm = 1.00
b)	
Maximum tensile stresses in reinforcing plates
	
Reinforcing plates shall be designed for ULS as defined in Clause 5.1.3.5.
c)	
Stability criteria (see Clause 5.1.3.6)
Stability criteria shall be evaluated taking into account the following:
Stability regarding rotation
Stability regarding buckling
Stability regarding sliding
d)	
Forces, moments, and deformations exerted on the structure (see Clause 5.1.3.7)
Forces, moments and deformations shall be evaluated taking into account the following:
	
− The pressure at the contact surfaces between the bearing and the structure.
	
− The force exerted on the structure by the bearing resisting translatory movement.
	
− The restoring moment due to the bearing resisting rotational movement
	
− Vertical deflection due to the vertical load
Note 1: The maximum permissible value for εu,d defined as 7 for ULS has been derived from εs,d the 
empirical value of 5 for a serviceability check by multiplying both side of the equation by γm = 
1.40. It should not be taken to reflect the ultimate strain of the material. Elastomeric bearings 
are designed to operate well below the ultimate strength of the materials from which they are 
made, to allow for fatigue effects in the rubber. Consequently bearings can sustain accidental 
overloads and deformations considerably greater than the design values, without failure. 
Experiment shows that even when the compressive loads are sufficient to fracture the steel 
reinforcing plates the bearing still supports the load.
Note 2: The nominal shear modulus can be modified for dynamic load effects (railway loading in Rail-
Road bridges, earthquake), depending on the exciting frequencies (generally frequencies 
> 6Hz) and movement amplitudes: the factor, which may vary for different elastomer 
compounds, can be obtained experimentally.
Note 3: User can have an extra bearing to be tested at ULS in order to verify the satisfactory 
performance if they so wish. A bearing tested to ULS cannot be used in the structure since its 
performance at SLS cannot be guaranteed after such treatment.

lp = force-free perimeter of the bearing including that of any holes if these are not later 
effectively plugged.

it is taken as the actual thickness ti for inner layers, and 1.4ti for outer layers with a 
thickness ≥ 3 mm (if the thickness of outer layer is less than 3mm, effect of outer layers 
shall not be considered in calculation); in plain pad and strip bearings, it is taken as 1.8ti 
(ti is the thickness of an individual elastomer layer).
Note: For a rectangular bearing without holes:
A1 = a′ × b′
lp = 2 × (a′ × b′)
where
a′ = effective width of the bearing (i.e. the width of reinforcing plates).

in Clause 3.2.
Note 2:The calculated value of the restoring moment is sufficient for most purposes but if a precise 
knowledge of its value is necessary then the value should be determined experimentally.

Vertical Deflection

The theoretical vertical deflection of elastomeric bearings shall be estimated from the 
expressions given above for use in conjunction with Clause 5.1.3.6. Where a precise value is 
required it shall be checked by testing sample bearings without any correlation or comparison 
with the expression given.
Note 1: The value of the bulk modulus Eb generally used is the following:
 Eb = 2000 MPa
Note 2: The actual deflection of a bearing includes an initial bedding down phase that can produce 
deflections of approximately 2 mm. Thereafter, the stiffness of the bearing increases with 
increasing load. Where the vertical deflection under load is critical to the design of the 
structure, the stiffness of the bearing should be ascertained by tests. However, a variation of 
as much as ± 20 percent from the observed mean value may still occur. When a number of 
similar bearings are used at a support and the differential stiffness between the bearings is 
critical for the structure, a variation of compressive stiffness should be allowed in the design, 
equal to either ± 15 percent of the value estimated from the above equation, or ± 15 percent 
of the mean value observed in tests.
Note 3: The calculation for the deflection of a bearing is likely to underestimate the deflection under 
permanent loads and overestimate the deflection under transient loads.

the platen of the press so that the pressure developed during vulcanisation of the product is 
evenly distributed and the thickness maintained at all places are within acceptable tolerance 
limits taking into consideration, the shrinkage allowance of vulcanisate.
6.12	
The raw compound which has been introduced inside the metal dies for vulcanisation, 
should be accurately weighed each time and it must be ensured that sufficient quantity has been 
put inside the die for proper flow of material at every place so that a homogeneous and compact 
bearing is produced without any sign of sponginess or deficiency of material at any place.

IRC:83-2018 (Part-II)
bearings manufactured at the same time to be traced through the production control records 
should the need arise. As a minimum, a label should be vulcanised on the top or bottom of 
the bearing detailing:
	
−	
manufacturer’s name
	
−	
unique identification number and the manufacturer’s name or symbol on one 
of the edges.
Marking shall be resistant to water and normal wear and tear
Additional information that may be marked on the bearing or supplied separately with the

mechanical damage, contamination with oil, grease and dirt, undue exposure to sunlight and 
weather.
9.2	
Bearings shall be installed in the structure as specified or approved by the engineer 
to ensure that right bearing is being installed at the right location.
9.3	
Bearings must be placed between true horizontal surfaces (maximum tolerance 
0.2 per cent perpendicular to load) and at true plan position of their control lines marked on 
receiving surfaces (maximum tolerance ±3 mm). Concrete surfaces shall be free from local 
irregularities (maximum tolerance ±1 mm in height).
9.4	
Departures from common planarity of twin or multiple bearings shall be within 
such tolerance as may be specified or approved by the engineer.

32
IRC:83-2018 (Part-II)
approved by the engineer. Care shall be taken to guard against faulty application and 
consequent behaviour of the adhesive layer as a lubricant. The bonding by the adhesive 
shall be deemed effective only as a device for installation and shall not be deemed to secure 
bearing against displacement for purpose of design.
9.8	
Lifting of a cast-in-place post-tensioned bridge deck for relieving time dependent 
deformation shortly after installation of bearings should be avoided. In case such lifting is 
unavoidable, the lifting arrangement, proper seating of the girder on the bearing, etc. shall be 
rigidly controlled to avoid any risk of misalignment.
9.9	
After installation, bearing and their surrounding areas shall be left clean.
9.10	
Under load, bulging of the rubber layer between the reinforcing steel laminates on 
free exposed perimeter is a normal phenomenon and is not detrimental to the performance 
of the bearing unless any crack or evidence of bond failure is detected.
10 MAINTENANCE
10.1	
The structure should be designed and detailed in such a way that the bearings 
are easily accessible after installation for inspection and maintenance. Arrangements for 
insertion of jacks to lift the bridge deck shall be made in detailing of structure.
10.2	
The bearings shall be subjected to planned maintenance care.
10.3	
The exposed bearing surface shall be maintained clean and free from contamination 
with grease or oil, etc.
10.4	
Annual routine maintenance inspection or special maintenance inspection of all 
bearings shall be made to check the following criteria:
	
−	
The top and bottom load bearing surfaces shall be in full contact with the plinth 
(bottom supporting surface) and the soffit (top supporting surface). If there is 
imperfect contact between the surfaces stated above, the angle between the 
soffit and the plinth shall be checked against the design specifications.
	
−	
Shear deflection is expected phenomenon in Elastomeric bearing. However, 
the magnitude of the shear deflection of each bearing shall be checked to 
ensure that it is within the design specifications.
	
−	
A visual inspection shall be made of all the accessible edges. A note shall be 
made of the size and position of any cracks or splits, or uneven bulges. Near 
uniform bulging is however expected phenomenon in elastomeric bearing.
	
−	
Examine the plinth and soffit for signs of displacement from bearing original 
position (black marks may give an indication of movement).
	
−	
If applicable, examine the sliding surfaces for cleanliness and that the 
movements are within the design range and report results.
	
−	
If applicable, examine the protective coating and/or dust protection for signs 
of deterioration and report results
10.5	
Damaged bearings shall be replaced immediately. To avoid differences in stiffness, 
all adjacent bearings on the same line of support shall also be replaced.

Measurement
Load and deflection measurements shall be made at approximately equal intervals not less 
than 5
C.4.4	
Evaluation
C.4.4.1	
Examine the test bearing for evidence of cracking or peeling both in the strained 
and unstrained state. After removal of the shear force the bearing should be examined 
visually, whilst still under the compressive load, and any bulges which could indicate bond 
failure should be noted. It may be necessary to cut the edge cover to confirm the presence 
of flaws arising from bond failure.
C.4.4.2	
If neither of the test bearings shows evidence of peeling or separation at or near 
the interface between rubber and reinforcement layers and there is no sign of bond failure 
the test shall be deemed to be satisfactory.

Annexure D
D.1	
Considerations for Seismic Resistance
D.1.1	
Elastomeric bearings considered in this Part are Low damping elastomeric 
bearings with an equivalent viscous damping ratio ξ less than 0.06. Such bearings have 
a cyclic behaviour similar to hysteretic behaviour with very slender hysteresis loops. Their 
behaviour should be approximated by that of a linear elastic member with equivalent elastic 
stiffness in the horizontal direction equal to G x A/Tq where G is the shear modulus of the 
elastomer, A its effective horizontal area and Tq is the total thickness of the elastomer.
D.1.2	
The seismic behaviour of bridges, in which the design seismic action is resisted 
entirely by elastomeric bearings on all supports, is governed by the large flexibility of the 
bearings and shall be analysed as seismic isolation system. The elastomeric bearings may 
be considered as linear elastic members between the substructure and superstructure, 
deforming in shear (and also in compression) enhancing flexibility and thereby natural period 
of the system. Their damping may be assumed equal to the global viscous damping of the 
structure. The deformation of bridges supported exclusively by normal elastomeric bearings 
is predominantly elastic and does not lead in general to ductile behavior. In this case the 
seismic response of substructure and Superstructure shall remain essentially elastic and 
therefore response reduction factor (R) for design shall be considered as ‘1’.
D.1.3	
Simple low-damping elastomeric bearings covered in this part may be used as 
isolators, without being subjected to special tests for seismic performance.
D.1.4	
The shear strain ξq,d of the elastomer due to translatory movement, caused due to 
combination of all possible loads and effects that may coexist during earthquake, shall not 
exceed 1.00
D.1.5	
In bridges with elastomeric bearings intended to resist seismic action, structural 
members which resist shear forces from the bearings shall be designed on the basis of the 
maximum deformation of the bearings corresponding to the design displacement of the deck 
and a bearing stiffness increased by 30%.
D.1.6	
Elastomeric bearings used as isolators for application in seismic Zone IV and 
Zone V shall be secured in position by means of positive anchorage.
