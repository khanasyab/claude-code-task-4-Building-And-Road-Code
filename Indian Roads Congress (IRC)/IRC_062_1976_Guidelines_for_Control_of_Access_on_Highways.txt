The Working Group in their meeting held on
the
4th
August
1975,
revised
the draft guidelines.

further
modifications.
These
were
subsequently
carried out by a
Sub-group consisting of the following:
S.L. Kathuria
—Convenor
J. Datt
—Member
Dr. N.S. Srinivasan
—

—
„
The Guidelines were approved by
the
Executive
Committee
and later by the Council in their meetings held on
the
7th January
1976.
1.2
These guidelines have been formulated with a view to providing
a
reasonable basis for the control of access on through
roads.
Un-
controlled
access
materially
reduces
the
level
of
service
on
the
highways
beside
increasing
the
scope
of
accidents.
Particularly
dangerous are the right turning movements from and into
the
main
highway.
2.
SCOPE
2.1.
The
guidelines
deal
with
control of access on urban as well
as
rural
highways, and
recommendations
are
given
for
each
separately.
2.2.
For allied aspects of control of ribbon development,
reference
may be made
to IRC
Special
Publication
No. 15-1974 "Ribbon
Development along Highways and
its Prevention".

4.
NEED FOR CONTROL OF ACCESS
4.1.
If effective access control is not
exercised
along
a
highway
facility, ribbon development invariably
follows.
Interference
from
the residential and commercial establishments increases, resulting
in
congestion.
Accidents rise steeply
due
to
the numerous
conflicts
inherent in the roads meeting the highway at numerous
points.
As
a sequel to this, the speed drops and level of
service
reduces.
The
highway facilities built at great cost become functionally obsolescent
before
long.
The
ribbon
development
that
is
going on
in
an
4



======================================================================
PAGE 9 of 14
======================================================================
IRC
: 62*1976
unregulated
way at
the
urban
fringes of
many
cities should be
viewed
seriously
if the
situation
is not to
worsen
further.
Access
control is one of the proven methods of combating this evil.
4.2.
The control of access can be either full or partial.
The degree
of access control would depend inter alia on the level of service pro-
posed, accident frequency, legal considerations, traffic pattern,
vehi-
cle operating costs, travel time, land
use,
and
the convenience
of
access to abutting property owners.
5.
HIGHWAY AUTHORITIES TO REGULATE ACCESS
It is
necessary to
pass
suitable
legislation
so that highway
authorities
have
the backing of law to
regulate access to
arterial
highways.
Model
Highway
Bill
drafted
by
the
Govt,
of
India
(reproduced in IRC Special
Publication
No. 15) contains adequate
provisions
concerning access control.
It is suggested that requisite
legislation should be enacted on these lines.
6.
CONTROL OF ACCESS ON URBAN HIGHWAYS/STREETS
6.1.
To ensure safe and efficient circulation of traffic, which
serves
the various
land uses
adequately
and
ensures
logical community
development, the network of roads in an urban
area has to be divi-
dedinto different sub-systems each serving a particular
function or a
purpose. The principal factors to be considered in designating roads
into categories are the travel desire
lines, access
needs
of adjacent
properties, network pattern and land use.
For the purpose of these
guidelines, urban highways/streets are considered to be divided
into
the following types:
(i)
Expressways
(ii)
Arterial Highways/Streets
(iii)
Sub-arterial Streets
(iv)
Collector Streets; and
(v)
Local Streets.
The
function
of each of these categories
is apparent from the
definitions in para 3.
Spacing of intersections
6.2.
Standards for the location of access points depend largely
on
the needs of an area and no hard and fast rules can be laid down but
the following guidelines are indicative of good practice.
5



======================================================================
PAGE 10 of 14
======================================================================
IRC
: 62-1976
6.3.
Spacing between intersections should have regard
to
the
rele-
vant geometric design and traffic requirements, such
as the
type
of
traffic, length of right-turn or speedchange lanes
etc,
As a rough guide, the suggested minimum spacing
along
vari-
ous types of roads is given below:
(i)
Expressways
1000 metre
(ii)
Arterial Highways/Streets
500 metre
(iii)
Sub-arterial Streets
300 metre
(iv)
Collector Streets
150 metre
(v)
Local Streets
Free access
Where necessary, a greater distance than
given
above
should
be adopted, as for
example
between
junctions
with
linked
traffic
signals.
6.4.
On expressways and arterial streets, signals
should
preferably
be of progressive system, permitting continuous movement
of
vehi-
cles at a planned speed of travel.
As far as possible,
all such
inter-
sections should have approximately the same spacing.
6.5.
Apart from regular intersections, a
limited
number
of
access
points
with
intervening streets may be permitted at a spacing closer
than mentioned in para 6.3 provided only left turns to and from
the
main street are permitted.
This may not,
however, be done in
the
case
of
expressways
where a number of such intersections exist at
closer intervals;
it will be desirable to add an additional
continuous
lane for turning
traffic.
6.6.
The location and spacing of all major points
of
access,
inclu-
ding accesses to bus terminals, railway
stations,
parking
areas etc.,
should be carefully planned so as to ensure safety and freedom from
congestion.
Direct access driveways
6.7.
On expressways and arterials, direct access to residential
plots
is not to be permitted.
Driveways may, however, be permitted
on
a restricted basis for commercial and industrial complexes and
other
public
locations when these are major
generators of
traffic.
Right
turn from these driveways should not be permitted unless the
cross-
ing fulfills the spacing criteria given in para 6.3. Moreover, adequate
road
geometries
should
be
provided
to
enable
safe operation
of
vehicles.
6.8.
On sub-arterials, direct access
to
residential
property
should
be
granted
only
where
alternative access cannot be provided at a
6



======================================================================
PAGE 11 of 14
======================================================================
IRC
: 62-1976
reasonable cost.
Direct access to commercial and industrial proper-
ties may be allowed.
6.9.
On collector streets, access to abutting properties may be allo-
wed to a limited extent keeping in view the safety of traffic.
6.10. On local streets, which will
have no through
traffic, access
to
abutting properties can be freely given.
Median openings
6.11. Median openings should generally
be limited
to
intersections
with public streets or major generators of
traffic and should not
be
accepted for individual business needs. Their number should be kept
to the minimum.
6.12. At locations other than
signalised
intersections,
openings in
median
should
be allowed preferably when the median
is of suffici-
ent
width to afford protection to a vehicle
turning
right
from
the
side street before
it can complete the turning manoeuvre.
To facili-
tate right turns from the main street, a protected right turn lane
of
adequate width and length should be provided in the median
as
far
as possible.
Grade separations across streets
6.13. Grade separations should be provided at intersecting
streets
if
the estimated traffic volumes within the next 5 years are in excess of
the capacity of the intersection.
When traffic projections show
that
volumes
within the next 20 years will exceed the capacity of an
at-
grade layout, the need for a grade separated facility should be
kept
in view for future construction.
Grade separations across railways
6.14. Grade
separations
should
be
provided
at
railway crossings
when
justified
by
traffic
and economic considerations.
No grade
separations may be required at isolated sidings etc.
7.
GUIDELINES FOR ACCESS CONTROL ON RURAL HIGHWAYS
7.1.
Majo& corridors of inter
city
traffic,
which are increasing
in
importance, need to be protected from
unregulated
roadside
deve-
lopment
by
exercising
limited
access
control.
This
is
especially
necessary
in
the
case
of
byepasses
and
highways
in the urban
fringe.
7



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 14
======================================================================
IRC: 62-1976
7.2.
The
guidelines proposed here are meant to be applied only
to
major
arterial
highways,
viz., National
Highwys, State Highways
and
Major
District Roads
having
a
two-lane
or
divided
cross-
section.
Spacing of intersections
7.3.
The spacing of intersections with public roads
should
not
be
less than 750 m. Connections from parallel service roads (i.e., front-
age roads) should similarly not be closer than 750 m.
Accesses to private property
7.4.
Individual driveways to private property such as petrol pumps,
farms, commercial establishments, and industries should not be
spa-
ced closer than 300 metre from each
other
or from an
intersection.
As far as possible, a number
of
property owners along the highway
should be grouped together and parallel service roads
(i.e., frontage
roads) constructed to give access at selected points.
The geometries
of the driveways should conform to requisite standards conducive
to
smooth traffic flow.
Median openings
7.5.
On
highways
with
a
divided cross-section, median openings
should generally be limited to intersections with
public
roads,
and
should
not
be permitted
for
individual
business
needs.
Where
intersections
are
far apart, additional openings may be provided
at
intervals
of
about
2
kilometres
for
U-turns
and
diversion
of
traffic to one of the carriageways at
times
of emergency
or
major
repairs.
Grade separations across highways
7.6.
Grade
separations
should
be
provided
at
intersections
of
divided
rural
highways
if
the ADT
(fast
vehicles
only)
on
the
cross road within the next 5 years exceeds 5000.
Where this
traffic
figure
will
be
reached
within
the
next
20 years,
the need for
such facilities should be kept in view for future construction.
Grade separations across railways
7.7.
Grade separations should be provided across
existing
railway
crossings if the product of ADT (fast vehicles only) and the number
of trains per day exceeds 50,000 within the next 5
years.
For new
constructions such as byepasses, grade separations should
be
provi-
ded when this figure
is greater than
25,000.
