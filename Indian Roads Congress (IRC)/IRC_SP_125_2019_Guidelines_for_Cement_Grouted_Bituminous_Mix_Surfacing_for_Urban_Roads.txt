GUIDELINES FOR CEMENT GROUTED BITUMINOUS  
MIX SURFACING FOR URBAN ROADS
The first development of the semi-flexible process was carried out in the 1950’s in France, 
as a protection of asphalt concrete surface course against the attack of waste oils and 
fuels. Jean Lefebvre, a French construction company as a cost-effective maintenance 
alternative to concrete roads developed this technology. In India, the CGBM technology 
was initially developed by a premier laboratory and a few stretches were constructed with 
this technology. CGBM technology consists of having a high void bituminous mix in which 
highly flow able high strength grout is poured which occupies all voids and make it water 
tight. This also leads to substantial improvement in the engineering properties. Performance 
study on CGBM overlay was carried out by CRRI and noted that compared to conventional 
bituminous mixes there is substantial improvement in engineering properties of this material. 
This technology has been adopted by Surat Municipal Corporation and in several other city 
roads. National laboratory at Chennai was requested to develop the grout and conduct 
laboratory tests on CGBM samples to ensure that engineering properties recommended for 
grout and CGBM based on various references are achievable. 
The task of preparation of these Guidelines was taken up by H-9 Committee during the 
tenure 2012-14. The initial guidelines prepared by Dr. Animesh Das, Professor, IIT Kanpur 
in the year 2012 and discussed in the then H-9 Committee. Based on various references 
and research work at IIT Kharagpur & CSIR-CRRI, New Delhi, the initial guidelines were 
modified by late Prof. B.B. Pandey, IIT Kharagpur. The H-9 Committee was reconstituted in 
the year 2015 and draft document was discussed during various meetings of H-9 Committee 
and finally approved in its meeting held on 19.11.2016 for placing before HSS Committee. 
The HSS Committee in its meeting held on 23.06.2017 decided to wait for performance 
report on CGBM trial sections laid by CSIR-CRRI and referred back the document to H-9 
Committee in light of comments made by the HSS.
Thereafter, the H-9 Committee was reconstituted for the tenure 2018-20. The H-9 Committee 
in its meeting held on 14.04.2018 constituted a subgroup comprising Shri P.L. Bongirwar-
Subgroup Leader, Shri Manoj Kumar Shukla, Dr. Ambika Behl, Shri Anil Jadhav, Shri Vikas 
Thakar, Dr. I.K. Pateriya, Dr. Rajan Choudhary, Dr. Siddhartha Rokade and Dr. G. Bharat 
to review the comments of HSS and consider outcome of CRRI Study on CGBM Trial in 
Surat and finalize the document. The modified draft was discussed during various meetings 
of H-9 Committee and approved in its meeting held on 29.09.2018 for placing before HSS 
Committee. The HSS Committee in its meeting held on 23.10.2018 decided to refer back 
these draft guidelines to H-9 Committee in the light of comments made by HSS members. 
The draft guidelines were again discussed in the H-9 Committee and were finally approved in 
its meeting held on 08.06.2019 for placing before the HSS Committee. The HSS Committee 
in its meeting held on 20.07.2019 decided that Convenor, H-9 Committee will modify the 
document based on written comments and verbal comments offered during the meeting and 
submit final document to IRC for placing before the forthcoming Mid-Term Council meeting. 
The Mid-Term Council in its meeting held on 9th and 10th August, 2019 at Goa approved the 
document for publishing.

1 INTRODUCTION
Flexible pavements are the most common types of pavement used for highways in India and rest 
of the world. Bituminous wearing course of such pavements often suffer wet weather damage 
which gets aggravated in cities due to flooding during monsoon. The pavements at traffic 
intersections, parking places and bus stops are noticeably damaged due to frequent braking 
action and fuel spillage. So, there arises a need for durable wearing course which is (i) strong 
enough to resist braking and accelerating effect of traffic (ii) fuel resistant (iii) impervious to water

and (iv) moisture resistant. Research at IIT Kharagpur and at CSIR-CRRI has shown that open 
graded bituminous layer grouted with a cementitious grout can form a durable wearing course. 
Some other research Institute had developed similar product which has been used at a few 
locations in Kharagpur, Surat and Amravati. Flexible and Rigid pavements are common in India 
and now composite pavements are emerging.
The present guidelines deal with the design, preparation and application procedure for CGBM to 
be laid over bituminous surface. Almost single graded bituminous mix (having voids more than 
25% which is more than the voids in traditional dense graded bituminous mixes) is paved and 
grouted with cement grout as under:
i) Mixed with optimum dose of bituminous binder (sometimes fibers may be added to prevent 
drain down) (ii) paved over a base (iii) compacted to design density (iv) filled with cementitious 
grout slurry (sufficiently flowable cement grout is applied on the compacted surface). This cement 
grout is primarily prepared by mixing suitable proportions of cement, fine sand and water. Other 
materials like fly ash, micro silica, super plasticizers, fibres etc. may be adequately and suitably 
added in order to improve the grout flowability and strength of grout. 
CGBM is to be generally used as surface layer, but it also has potential to be used as base course. 
International Applications of CGBM
The pavement surface made with this kind of technology seemed to have been developed in 
France during 1960s and was known as 'resin modified pavement'. In USA it was first applied 
during 1987 (1). Various countries where CGBM has been used include France, USA, Germany, 
Japan, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Saudi Arabia, Great Britain, China, Denmark, 
Malaysia, South Africa and Austria etc. CGBM technology had been reportedly used in bus 
stations, parking areas, warehouses, roads, aprons, etc. 
For Road Surface Treatments (RSTA), UK has developed a code of practice for grouted 
Macadam, approved by ADEPT (Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning 
and Transport, UK) (2) and the same has also been approved by the Highway Authorities Product 
Approval Scheme (HAPAS), UK in 2006. CGBM was implemented by an organization called 
CIP Jointless Surfacing, England, primarily in Harbours, Airports, Warehouse Distributions, Bus-
Depot Stations, Manufacturing-Production areas etc. However, in UK, there is no BSEN (British 
Standards, Europe) specification on CGBM as yet. In other parts of Europe like Denmark, 
Netherlands, Sweden etc. this technology has been extensively used. The Copenhagen Airport, 
Denmark already laid approximately 3 lac m2 of CGBM. M/S BREMAT, Rosmalen, Netherlands 
carried out the execution and maintenance of this technology in Roundabouts, Intersections and 
Signals. Stockholm, Sweden implemented CGBM at different Bus stops and Bus-Depot stations, 
to bear the static loads and to diminish the chances of wearing and tearing. 
In USA, primarily CGBM has been incorporated in Army bases, Air force Stations and Airports. 
McCord Air force Base, Washington and Logan International Airport, MA, has constructed CGBM 
pavement for having durable surface. To develop a fuel damage resistant surface Malmstrom Air 
Force base, Montana, has constructed wearing surface incorporating CGBM.
Mississippi Department of Transportation performed a project investigating grouted macadam at 
two signalized, heavily trafficked intersections.

In the Asia Pacific, CGBM has been widely implemented in Malaysia, China, Australia, Japan, 
Saudi Arabia etc. Kualalampur City Council has implemented CGBM technology extensively in 
heavily trafficked surface, Bus Lanes in the city area and maintenance of this is taken care of by 
Kualampur City Hall, since 2001. In China, Ministry of Construction of Chinese Technologies had 
executed several projects in late 20th Century.
Considering the widespread application of CGBM around the world, it may prove to be an 
emerging sustainable technology in road infrastructure development. The advantages of using 
CGBM surface in comparison to conventional pavement are as follows: 
 
	
Resistance to oil induced damages caused due to fuel spillage
 
	
Resistance to permanent deformation
 
	
Resistance to abrasion/wearing
 
	
Resistance against moisture induced damages
 
	
Lower thermal susceptibility in comparison to flexible pavements
 
	
Impermeability and good skid resistance property
These advantages enable CGBM surface to take care of some of the individual limitations 
linked to cement concrete and bituminous mixes. Past researchers have conducted laboratory 
studies on stiffness, tensile and compressive strength, Marshall Stability, thermal expansion 
coefficient, low temperature fracture, fatigue properties of CGBM and found to show satisfactory 
performance. Recently, CSIR-CRRI has conducted detailed laboratory testing and evaluation of 
Trial section of CGBM in two roads of Municipal Corporation in Surat, Gujarat. The laboratory 
study included testing for compressive strength, stability, indirect tensile strength, moisture 
sensitivity, oil induced damage, wheel tracking test, resilient modulus, modulus of rupture, 
dynamic creep, flow number, dynamic modulus, etc. The study conducted by CRRI on CGBM 
trial section included visual inspection for any surface distress, core analysis for verification of full 
depth grouting, volumetric analysis using micro-CT technique, surface friction measurement and 
FWD survey. Trial stretches were studied on rural roads in heavy rainfall areas of West Bengal, 
a bridge deck and Dadar flyover in Mumbai City, roads of Municipal Corporations of Mumbai and 
Surat, etc. have given good performance. In hot summer, the cement grouted wearing course 
did not display any bleeding or rutting.
2 SCOPE
These guidelines discuss construction of laying of surface layer for Cement Grouted Bituminous 
Mix (CGBM), preferably over an existing bituminous pavement. CGBM is based on the concept 
of preparing a coarse aggregate skeleton structure which is then filled with cementitious grout 
material. A few trial stretches are also in progress where it is proposed to change the conventional 
seal coat on bituminous premix carpet with cement grouted seal coat. Minor changes in gradation 
are made to create more voids. This new type of wearing course is suitable for traffic up to 30 
msa, in case of a new flexible pavement or as an overlay/renewal coat over an existing flexible 
pavement; though it can be used for heavier traffic as well if the base is strong. Such pavements 
have the benefit of flexibility of the bituminous pavement while possessing advantage of rigid 
pavement as well. Typically, the open graded aggregates are coated with about 3.25% to 4.0% 
bitumen. However, CRRI study on CGBM with a specified gradation finds that lower limit of

IRC:SP:125-2019
5
binder content can be decreased up to 3% whilst using good aggregates of specific gravity more 
than 2.7. Once the paved high voids bituminous surface cools down to ambient temperature, the 
cementitious grout is poured over the surface which penetrates and fills up the voids and forms 
an impervious layer. It is ensured that grouting is achieved for full depth of high voids bituminous 
layer.
Properties of grout, method of construction of cement grouted bituminous layer as well as 
pavement design principles are included in the guidelines. Users of the guidelines should 
maintain a record of pavement performance periodically and send their feedback to Indian Roads 
Congress for the future revision of the guidelines.

Sand
The sand should pass 0.6 mm size so that the grout will enter into the air voids easily. Sand 
content may be minimized to achieve better quality of grout. Fine sand passing 45 µm can also 
give good results.
3.4.3	
Fly ash and Silica fumes
Addition of fly ash and silica fumes will increase the grout flowability. The fly ash should conform 
to IS:3812 with minimum 65% passing 45 µm sieve.
3.4.4	
Super plasticizer/chemical stabilizers
Super plasticizer (IS: 9103) and other chemical additives help in reducing the water requirement 
without reduction in strength of the grout, thus improving the flowability and helps in early gain 
of grout strength.
3.5	
Design of Cementitious Grout
The cementitious grout primarily consists of cement, sand and water and may contain other 
mineral additives such as fly ash, micro-silica, very fine sand and suitable chemical additives 
in suitable proportion so as to produce a material that can flow easily into the voids of the 
bituminous mix. At the same time, grout should have enough strength to withstand the traffic

7
load. Though aggregate bears most of the traffic load, the grout should be strong enough to 
resist the stresses caused by traffic without crushing. Proportion of sand and fly ash may be 
varied to optimize strength and flowability of grout. Fly ash and silica fume, also known as 
micro silica are used to improve strength, durability and the performance. Super plasticizer/
chemical additive is used to get the required fluidity at the lower water contents for cement 
grout without loss of strength. Polymer additive in the powder form or liquid form imparts early 
strength to the mortar.
For design of cement grout, various proportion of cement, fine sand passing 600 µm sieve, 
silica fumes, fly ash and ultra-water reducer are to be worked out to obtain desired properties. 
Extensive study at IIT Kharagpur indicated that the proportions of cement: sand: micro silica: 
fly ash of 40:40:10:10 and a super plasticizer of 0.5% by weight of the dry powder; all by weight 
and a water/binder ratio of 0.55 gave satisfactory results. Similarly, laboratory experiments done 
by other premier laboratory, with proportion of cement: sand: micro silica: fly ash of 38:10:10:42 
with super-plasticizer of 0.3% and w/c of 0.25 have given satisfactory results to meet all desired 
properties as mentioned in Appendix. Possibly some other combinations may also be able to 
achieve the performance parameters as stated in Appendix. Since material properties may 
differ due to different sources, several mix design trials with different proportions are necessary. 
The grout should satisfy the following criteria:
	
	
It should be sufficiently flow-able so that it can occupy the voids of the high voids 
bituminous mix.
	
	
Sand present in the grout should not pose difficulty for easy flow of grout through 
the voids in the mix.
Any commercially available ready mixed dry powders (grout) can also be used if they meet 
the performance parameters, as stated in Appendix. The flowability of cement grout is to be 
measured using Flow Cone as per ASTM C939. The performance properties expected from 
grout and CGBM composite are given in Table 3.
4 BITUMINOUS MIX DESIGN FOR CGBM
4.1	
Aggregate Gradation
The combined grading of the coarse and fine aggregates for CGBM is shown in Table 2. This 
Table consists of three gradations namely Gradation I, II & III for preparing bituminous mixes 
with voids suitable for CGBM, out of which Gradation I & II are as per Table 500-21 of MoRT&H 
Specifications for Surface Dressing and Gradation III is similar to Open Graded Friction Course 
as per ASTM. Gradation III has slightly lower air voids as compared to Gradation I and II. 
Generally, open gradations are preferred for CGBM so that minimum air void content of 25% is 
available in the bituminous mix skeleton. Selection of any gradation for CGBM can be made with 
the objective that cementitious grout flows freely into the voids of bituminous mix. Some general 
principles of selection of gradation for CGBM are discussed in Appendix.

Determination of Dry Aggregate Air Voids
The air voids in dry compacted (rodded condition) aggregates (having coarse and fine portion) is 
to be determined as per ASTM C29 (see Annexure A for outline of the test) or IS: 2386 Part 3. 
The formula used for the calculation of air voids in dry aggregates is given below in Equation 1.

Where,

bulk density of the aggregate, kg/m3
	
S	 =	
bulk specific gravity (dry basis)
	
W	 =	
density of water, 998 kg/m3
4.3	
Selection of Optimum Binder Content by Draindown Test
Draindown of the loose bituminous mix shall be determined according to ASTM D 6390 (see 
Annexure B for outline of the test). The drainage test should be performed at the anticipated 
plant production temperature and should satisfy the specified maximum drain down of 0.30%. If 
the mixture fails to meet this requirement, then fibers can be added to a level that reduces drain 
down to the acceptable limit.
There is a scope for reduction in bitumen dose which improves resistance against water 
penetration and may increase the ratio of ITS wet/ITS dry, However, as this may make the mix 
more brittle, reduction of bitumen dose below 3.25% is not recommended. Adequate quantity of 
bitumen is needed to maintain the nature of the prepared CGBM as flexible layer.
4.4	
Determining Compaction Effort
The samples of high voids bituminous mix for CGBM can be prepared in different ways; namely 
(i) Marshal samples of 100 mm dia., (ii) Extracting cores from compacted slabs and (iii) extracting 
100 mm dia. core from 150 mm dia. Marshall sample. Depending on the type of sample being 
prepared (in terms of mix composition and sample size), the compaction effort may vary from 



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:SP:125-2019
9
case to case. Compaction effort needs to be worked out by analyzing the lowering rate of air 
voids in the sample being prepared with respect to increase in the number of blows (compaction 
effort). Out of three gradations given in Table 2, only 40 blows are suggested for Gradation I & II 
and 60 blows for Gradation III, all applied on one face of the Marshall sample only.
4.5	
Sample Preparation and Testing
Four samples for each of the trial gradations at the bitumen content selected as per draindown 
test are to be prepared. Three samples from each trial gradation shall be prepared with the 
optimum compaction effort as found out earlier and used to determine the volumetric properties 
of Marshall samples, and the fourth uncompacted loose mix sample shall be used to determine 
the theoretical maximum specific gravity (Gmm) according to ASTM D 2041 (see Annexure C for 
outline of the test).
4.6	
Selection of Job Mix Gradation
Compact the specimens as discussed above and then remove them from the moulds once 
they cool down to ambient temperature (open graded mixes need to be handled carefully). 
Determine the bulk specific gravity (Gmb) of the specimens (ASTM D3203). The uncompacted 
mix samples are used to determine the theoretical maximum specific gravity (Gmm). 
Using Gmb and Gmm, the percent air voids (Va) and VMA are calculated by the formulas shown in 
Equations 2 & 3, respectively.

5 OPTIMIZATION OF GROUT FOR CGBM
The grout slurry needs to have sufficient fluidity so that it can easily fill the air voids in the 
compacted mix. The fluidity of grout slurry is measured using Flow Cone as per ASTM C939 
(See Annexure D for outline of the test). The strength of grout is basically evaluated in terms of 
its compressive strength measured on casted grout specimens (IS 4031 Part 6 or ASTM C109 or 
ASTM C579). The commercially available grout powder or own synthesised composition of grout 
as discussed in Para 4, needs to be optimised for quantity of mixing water such that the prepared 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:125-2019
10
grout slurry has optimum balance between its flow value and strength parameter, as acceptable 
for the considered aggregate gradation. General trend of grout flowability and strength with 
respect to mixing water content is shown in Fig. 1. The quantity of mixing water content should 
be optimised towards its minimum value while maintaining full depth of grout penetration into the 
high voids bituminous mix and thus consequently to achieve higher grout strength.

7 CGBM PRODUCTION
7.1	
At Laboratory Scale
Brief description for method of preparation of CGBM composite along with the recommended 
values for different parameters and test results are described in Appendix. The recommended 
and acceptable values would depend on method of preparation of sample. Appendix also 
describes the method for sample preparation which is suggested as per the equipment available 
at project site laboratory. The various engineering properties of grout and composite CGBM 
recommended in Table 3 are based on the methods of sample preparation and test procedure 
as described in Appendix.
7.2	
During Pavement Construction
For field application of CGBM surface layer, different stages of work need to be accomplished. 
The existing bituminous surface is first cleaned and then emulsion (RS1) or low viscosity paving 
bitumen of VG 10 grade is spread over it as tack coat as per MoRT&H Specifications. A layer of 
open graded high void bituminous mix is then laid using the paver. Depending upon the grade of 
bitumen used, the mixed material shall be in the range of 140-1700C. The laying temperature shall 
be in the range of 130-1500C. The bituminous mix is then compacted with smooth wheeled roller, 
once its temperature is in the range of 80-1000C. The paved bituminous mix is then compacted 
with 10 tons static steel wheel roller for 4 to 6 passes to obtain the desired density and the target 
air voids. Once the compacted bituminous surface cools down to ambient temperature, the 
requisite quantity of cementitious grout material mixed thoroughly with water can then be poured 
and spread uniformly over the entire porous surface. Cement grout preferably can be prepared in 
Pan Mixer so that all ingredients gets fully inter mixed. If patented intimately mixed dry powder is 
available, then use of Pan Mixer can be avoided and any simple blending equipment to produce 
liquid grout can be used. Grout can also be produced in the mixer of RMC plant. Grout would 
automatically flow into voids under the effect of gravity and its flowability. Sweeping or simple 
such techniques can be adopted to accelerate the process of grout penetration. Any excess 
grout observed on the surface shall be removed and any unfilled air voids observed are to be 
again filled with grout. The grout spread over the high voids bituminous mix surface is allowed 
to set for one day and then the section is cured by sprinkling of water for 7 days. The grouting 
operation should not be done in rainy or snowy environment. The field procedure to be adopted 
and the corresponding stages for laying the CGBM surface are outlined in Annexure E.
8 RESILIENT MODULUS, FATIGUE LIFE AND STRENGTH OF CGBM
In a typical case the Resilient Modulus (E) measured from Indirect Tensile test (ASTM D4123) 
for the cement grouted bituminous mix were found to vary from 12000 MPa to 15000 MPa in the 
laboratory at temperature 350C. However, a reduced modulus of 5000 MPa may be considered 
for pavement design considering (i) variability in grading of aggregates (ii) partial penetration of 
grout in the field and (iii) cracks caused by the construction traffic. The modulus of rupture (MR, 
for Flexural strength) was found to be 2.5 MPa. A value of 1.25 MPa may be considered as the 
MR value of the grouted macadam for the purpose of checking adequacy of pavement crust. 
Poisons ratio (µ) may be taken as 0.25. The resilient modulus and the modulus of rupture values 



======================================================================
PAGE 23 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:SP:125-2019
13
can be used to check design adequacy to ensure that the Cement Grouted Bituminous Mix does 
not crack prematurely. 
The fatigue life calculation of CGBM suggested by IIT Kharagpur is given below in Equation 4.
	
N = 1017.6019 × (1/e)4.6099 × (1/E)0.6171  (R2 = 0.77)
……..(4)
CSIR-CRRI based on their laboratory evaluations of CGBM samples prepared in the laboratory 
and cores taken from trial sections have found that Resilient Modulus (E) and Indirect Tensile 
Strength (ITS) of CGBM varies with temperature and loading. Therefore, CGBM can be concluded 
as Visco-elastic material.
9 PAVEMENT DESIGN
Elastic layered analysis applied for the analysis of flexible pavements can be used for the design 
of composite pavement as well. Parameters to be considered for design are CBR of the soil, 
elastic modulus of the granular layers, elastic modulus of the grouted bituminous layers, Poison’s 
ratio of different layers and design traffic in terms of standard axles.
At present, the structural design (layer thickness) of pavements having CGBM layer can be 
worked out using the Fatigue Equation as given by IIT Kharagpur and mentioned above in 
Para  8. Modulus of different types of bases, sub bases and sub grades can be taken from 
IRC:37-2018.
Based on studies done at Nottingham University, CSIR-CRRI, New Delhi and IIT Kharagpur, the 
resilient modulus of CGBM can be taken as 5000 MPa (based on laboratory evaluated values 
ranging from 8000 to 15000 MPa at test temperature of 35°C).

Appendix
Mix Design, Methodology and Test Results for CGBM
Mix design for high void bituminous mix is based on the requirement to achieve high volume of 
interconnecting voids. The morphology of the voids produced should be such that it allows easy 
flow of the grout through them and then their subsequent filling with the flowing grout itself. The 
design objective of high voids bituminous mix differs from that of conventional dense graded 
bituminous mixes. The main design criterion for high void bituminous mixes being: (a) optimum 
binder content while limiting the drain down and (b) compaction effort needed to achieve optimal 
density and requisite volume of interconnected air voids. The results shown in this Appendix for 
Gradings I, II & III of CGBM have been obtained from test conducted at CSIR-CRRI, IIT Kharagpur 
and another premier laboratory. Detailed methodology, test procedure, sample preparation, test 
results of laboratory prepared samples and field core samples are given in this Appendix. The 
compiled test results for the three considered gradations of CGBM are given in Table A1 to A3.
1.	
Aggregate Gradation and its Effect on Packing Characteristics
Air voids content in compacted bituminous mix will depend to a greater extent on the gradation of 
aggregate, binder content, type of binder and compaction method and energy used to compact 
the same. The packaging characteristics of different gradations can be defined by imparting 
similar compaction efforts and determining the voids. Different methods for determining air 
voids in an aggregate gradation are discussed below. These can be used to check the relative 
suitability of different gradations for preparation of high voids bituminous mixes.
	
a.	
Using IS 2386 Part 3
	
	
The aggregates selected for the specific gradation should be mixed thoroughly 
and then, filled into a cylindrical vessel of 250 mm diameter and 15 liters capacity, 
in three layers. Each layer should be subjected to 25 strokes of round edged 
tamping rod of 16 mm diameter. Dry Aggregate Air Voids (DAAV) can then be 
determined by the following equation:

The air voids in dry compacted (rodded condition) aggregates (having coarse

aggregates is given below:

2.	
Selection of Aggregate Gradation for Grouted Mix
Preparation of acceptable CGBM mix in laboratory depends on two criterions: i) Preparation of 
high voids bituminous mix, and ii) Proper grouting of the prepared mix. It is also observed that 
the amount of grout penetration in mix is related to the air void content and vertical permeability 
of the compacted high voids bituminous mix. The two parameters i.e. vertical permeability 
(mm/s) and vertical flow rate can be measured as per BS EN 12697 which can indicate the 
relative performance of different grout mix. There is a good relation between voids in mix and 
permeability as expected, i.e. higher the VIM, higher will be the vertical permeability. It is also 
observed that the amount of grout penetrating in mix is related with the air void content and 
vertical permeability of mix. Voids in Mineral Aggregate (VMA) is an important mix parameter 
which relates to the volume of binder and air void content that can be incorporated in compacted 
mix. The threshold values in terms of different dry aggregate and mix parameters required for 
satisfactory grout penetration have been identified for the three considered CGBM gradations 
and are listed below in Table A1.

These values can be helpful in selection of appropriate aggregate gradation for design of high 
voids bituminous mixes. The series of experiments conducted at IIT Kharagpur has led to 
following conclusions:
I.	
Dry Aggregate Air Voids (DAAV) and Dry Aggregate Void Ratio (DAVR) which represent 
packaging characteristics of dry aggregate are related to each other.
II.	
Vertical permeability and air voids are related.
III.	
The aggregate packing parameters DAAV and DAVR have good correlation with air 
voids in the compacted mix, vertical permeability and voids in mineral aggregate.
IV.	
The amount of grout penetrating the mix as correlated strongly with air voids content 
and also with vertical permeability.

V.	
Threshold values are evolved for different pacing characteristics and mix volumetric 
parameters for designing bituminous mix for satisfactory grout penetration.
VI.	
Use of finer sand fraction can improve the flow value and increase the degree of grout 
penetration. Full depth grout penetration is observed with sand with maximum size of 
0.6 mm.
3.	
Determination of Optimal Bitumen Content
The determination of optimal bitumen content for all three gradations is based on the binder 
draindown test as per ASTM D6390. For all gradations, bituminous mixtures were prepared at 
different binder contents in increment of 0.5%. Drain down loss criteria of 0.3% (maximum) for 
high void bituminous mix is considered for selecting the optimum binder content.
4.	
Compaction Effort
There are no proper criteria for selection of number of blows/gyrations for the compaction of 
high voids bituminous mixes. For determining the optimum compaction effort, the bituminous 
mixes were compacted using Marshal Compactor with incremental variation of compaction 
effort. Cylindrical specimens of 100 mm diameter were prepared using a 100 mm diameter 
split mould for all considered aggregate gradations. For each aggregate gradation, cylindrical 
samples were compacted at various blows (20 to 70) of Marshall Hammer with increment of 10 
blows applied on one face of the specimen. Then the volumetric study for each specimen of 
compacted samples was carried out, which is based on bulk specific gravity of compacted mix 
(Gmb), theoretical maximum specific gravity of mix (Gmm) and bulk specific gravity of aggregates 
(Gsb). Three samples were prepared for each specimen. The formula used for calculation of Air 
Voids (Va) in the compacted bituminous mix and Voids in Mineral Aggregates (VMA) are given 
below.

Theoretical maximum specific gravity of loose bituminous mix was measured as per ASTM 
D2041. Since the specimens have high air void content, their bulk density was determined as 
per ASTM D3203 which mentions the estimation of the specimen bulk volume from dimensions. 
One of the typical graphs obtained while optimizing the compaction effort i.e. number of Marshall 
Hammer blows for bituminous mix of Gr. II in shown in Fig. A1. The optimum number of Marshal 
Hammer blows required for Gr.-I & Gr-II are 40 and for Gr.-III it is 60, all Marshal Hammer blows 
applied on one face only.

Optimization of Grout Slurry
The cementitious grout consists of cement, water and super plasticizer in suitable proportion 
so as to produce a material that can flow easily into the voids of the bituminous mix. Additional 
mineral additives, like fly ash, slag, micro silica etc. can also be used to develop suitable grout 
material. It is generally noted that maximum size of sand should not be more than 0.6 mm for 
improved penetration. 
It is very clear that flow of grout material increases with increase in water content with simultaneous 
decrease in its compressive strength. The flow characteristic of the grout should be evaluated 
using a Flow Cone as per ASTM C939 guidelines. Minimum three trials for measuring the grout 
flowability should be performed and average value should be reported. Inappropriate flow value 
or lower flowability of prepared grout slurry can result in failure of full depth grout penetration. 
When talking particularly about Gr.-II, different extent of grout penetration achieved with gradual 
increase in mixing water content is shown in Photo A1. The setting time of the grout should be 
determined as per IS 4031 Part 5 guidelines. It is preferable to have initial setting time of 4-5 hours 
and final setting time of 6-8 hours. Minimum two trials should be carried out in arriving at the initial 
and final setting time. The variation of grout compressive strength with respect to mixing water 
content should also be studied. The compressive strength of the grout should be determined as 
per IS 4031 Part-6 or ASTM C109 or ASTM C579. The average value of compressive strength of 
3 cubes of 50x50x50 mm size should be reported. The flexural strength of the cementitious grout 
can be determined as per IS 4031 Part 8 using beams of size 160x40x40 mm size.

Preparation of CGBM Samples
The evaluation of the CGBM for different parameters was performed on laboratory prepared 
samples of different sizes and shapes. As such, varying shape and sizes required for CGBM 
samples were 100 mm diameter & 63 mm height cylindrical samples for ITS, stability, resilient 
modulus, Moisture Induced Sensitivity Test (MIST); 100 mm diameter & 180 mm height cylindrical 
samples for compressive strength test; 100 mm diameter & 150 mm height cylindrical samples 
for dynamic modulus and flow number tests; rectangular slab for rutting test; rectangular beams 
for flexural strength or modulus of rupture test. Various types of grouted bituminous mix samples 
are shown in Photo A2. For preparation of these samples, the following steps can be followed:
	
a)	
Fill the moulds (Marshall or Gyratory or Slab) with freshly prepared hot high 
voids bituminous mix prepared as per design mix requirements and spread it 
uniformly.
	
b)	
Compact the mix using proper compaction method as per the type of sample 
being prepared (Marshall or Gyratory or Slab) up to the optimal density of mix, as 
discussed in Para 4. Preferably the weight of the hammer should be 4.5 Kg and 
above. Complete the compaction within 3 minutes, before the mix temperature 
drops below the specified requirements.
	
c)	
Once the temperature of the compacted mix drops down to ambient temperature 
(near about 50-60°C), the cementitious grout can then be poured slowly on the 
surface and if needed, the grout can be spread uniformly using a small scrapper/

brush. The corners and edges of the moulds may be sealed from outside to 
prevent any possible leakage of grout from it.
	
d)	
The grouted mix can then be de-moulded after 24 hours and should be cured with 
moistened jute bags for at least 3 days. Direct water curing is not recommended.
	
e)	
Marshall Core samples of size 100 mm dia. and rectangular beam samples can 
be extracted from slabs using core drilling machine and saw cutter respectively.

Laboratory Based Evaluation of CGBM Samples
All laboratory prepared samples of CGBM were first checked for their basic physical parameters 
like dimensions, bulk density, bulk specific gravity, etc. The extracted samples are then ready to 
be used for different tests.
	
a)	
Mechanical Strength Parameters of CGBM
	
	
Various laboratory tests were performed in order to determine different strength 
parameters of CGBM samples are described below with their test results 
mentioned in Table A3.
	
I.	
Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS)
	
	
The Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS) test should be performed as per 
ASTM D 6931 on Marshall Samples of 100 mm diameter. ITS test method 
consists of applying a load along the diametrical axis of the cylindrical 
sample at constant deformation rate of 51 mm/minute and determining 
the maximum vertical load taken by the sample at time of failure. Failure 
point is defined as the point after which there is no further increase in 
load. Before testing, the specimens should be temperature conditioned for 
different test temperatures like 25, 35 or 45°C. The maximum load P, taken 
by the sample is then used to calculate the Indirect Tensile Strength as per 
the equation given below.

Marshall stability and compressive strength for CGBM were tested as 
per ASTM D6927 and ASTM C39 respectively. The formula used for the 
calculation of compressive strength is given below.

The developed composite material (CGBM) was tested for its flexural 
strength as per ASTM C78. The beam sample being tested for its flexural

Resilient Modulus
	
	
Resilient modulus is used as an input parameter for pavement design 
and evaluation. This test should be performed using the repeated indirect 
tensile test method as per ASTM D4123. The test setup for the testing of 
resilient modulus of elasticity value under indirect tensile loading condition 
is shown in Photo A4. CGBM samples cured for period of 7/28 days were 
used for determination of the resilient modulus. The equation used for the 
calculation of resilient modulus is given below.

Performance Evaluation
	
	
In order to have an assessment of the expected field performance of the CGBM, 
different performance related laboratory tests were performed on the CGBM 
samples. The actual field performance can only be checked by regular monitoring 
and evaluation of the laid sections. The laboratory-based performance studies 
done on CGBM are given as follows:
	
I.	
Rutting
	
	
Rutting performance of the CGBM mixes were studied at 60°C temperature 
using wheel tracking device. The rectangular slab of requisite size can be 
saw-cut out of a larger slab. Grouted CGBM slab being tested for ‘rutting’

using Wheel Tracking Device is shown in Photo A5. The test slabs are 
subjected to vertical pressure of 620 kPa applied through 50 mm wide 
wheels having diameter of 200 mm and running at speed of 60 passes 
per minute. Each sample is subjected to 20,000 passes (10,000 to and 
fro repetitions) of the wheel load. The rutting test results for CGBM is 
negligible (< 2 mm after 20000 passes) indicating good performance of 
CGBM against rutting.
Photo A5 Wheel Tracking Test on CGBM sample
	
II.	
Moisture Resistance Measurement using MIST
	
	
Moisture induced damage is related to the loss in strength due to reduced 
adhesion between aggregate and bitumen along with reduction in cohesive 
property of binder material. Moisture Induced Sensitivity Test (MIST), 
as per ASTM D7870 can be followed in which an accelerated moisture 
conditioning method with cyclic loading is used. The MIST equipment 
and Marshall Samples being kept inside the MIST chamber are shown in 
Photo A6. After completion of moisture conditioning cycles on the CGBM 
samples, the Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR) can be evaluated to quantify the 
performance of CGBM mixes.

23
Alternate methods of sample preparation and testing as done by leading laboratories are 
presented in following section. The stages of sample preparation and corresponding photos are 
shown in Photo A7.
Sample Preparation and Test Procedure
1.1.	
Open Graded Friction Course (OGFC)
The Open Graded Friction Course, OGFC should be designed for air voids in the range of 25-
30%. The mix gradation given in Table 2 can be used to obtain the specified air voids. VG-30 
or above grade of bitumen should be used for the OGFC mixes. Bitumen content of 3.0-3.5% 
is adequate for uniform coating of aggregates and compaction of the mix. MoRTH Section 500 
should be used for preparation of bituminous mix.
Care should be taken in selection of the bitumen content, as excess bitumen may lead to bleeding 
and drain down condition. It is preferred to make first the OGFC slabs which represent similar to 
field condition. OGFC slab specimen of size 700×150×63 mm (See Photo A7) can be prepared 
as described below:
	
a)	
Fill the moulds with bituminous mix having the temperature around 130°C and 
spread uniformly.
	
b)	
Compact the mix with vibration compaction hammer. Preferably the weight 
of the hammer should be 4.5 Kg and above. Complete the compaction within 
3 minutes, before the mix temperature drops to 110°C.
	
c)	
Extract Marshall Specimen of size 100×63 mm by using core drilling machine. 
Minimum three cores per slab shall be extracted.
	
d)	
The voids in the Marshall specimen can be calculated as per ASTM D 3203 
guidelines. 
1.2.	
Cementitious Grout
The cementitious grout consists of cement, water and super plasticizer in suitable proportion 
so as to produce a material that can flow easily into the voids of the bituminous mix. Additional 
mineral additives, like fly-ash, slag, micro-silica etc., are also useful in developing the suitable 
grout. Care should be taken to improve the flowability of grout by suitable additives and time 
required to discharge from the transit mixer within its workable period. 
The flow characteristic of the grout should be evaluated using a Marsh cone as per ASTM 
C939 guidelines. The Marsh cone should conform to the specification. Initially the Marsh cone 
should be calibrated using water as per the ASTM guidelines. The flow tests with water should 
be 8.0±1.0 second conforming to the ASTM requirements. Minimum three trials with water and 
grout should be performed and average value should be recorded. 
The setting time of the grout should be determined as per IS 4031, Part 5 guidelines. It is 
preferable to have initial setting time of 4-5 hours and final setting time of 6-8 hours. Minimum 
two trials to be performed in arriving at the initial and final setting time. 



======================================================================
PAGE 34 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:SP:125-2019
24
The compressive strength of the grout should be determined as per ASTM C 109 by casting 
three cubes of size using 50×50×50 mm. The average value of compressive strength of 3 cubes 
shall be recorded. The flexural strength of the cementitious grout can be determined as per IS 
4031 Part 8 on 160×40×40 mm beam specimens. The average flexural strength of minimum 
3 beam specimen shall be recorded.
1.3.	
Cement Grouted Bituminous Macadam (CGBM)
Based on the voids, calculate the quantity of grout required for filling of the OGFC slab. The 
slabs of OGFC mix should be filled with grout when the temperature comes down to ambient 
temperature or bituminous mix temperature falls to 50-60°C. The corners and all edges of the 
beam molds should be sealed from outside to prevent the leakage of grout. The cementitious 
grout can then be poured slowly on the OGFC slab and spread uniformly using a small scrapper. 
After a few minutes, a vibration compaction hammer should be used on the sides of the steel 
mold for 30 seconds to provide mild vibration and to ensure complete percolation of the grout to 
the bottom of the slab. Grouting should be continued until the entire calculated grout quantity is 
consumed by the OGFC slab. The slab can be de-molded after 24 hours and shall be cured with 
wet jute bags for 3 days. Direct water curing is not recommended. From slabs, standard Marshall 
Core samples and 189×63×63 mm beam samples shall be extracted. The Marshall Core samples 
shall be tested for their compressive strength, Marshall Stability and retained Marshall Stability 
tests. The failure pattern of Marshall Specimens under compression can be seen in Photo A7 (d). 
The compression tests should be performed at a rate of loading of 1.8kN/sec. The beam 
specimens should be tested for their flexural strength as per ASTM C 78 guidelines. Minimum 
of three specimens should be tested in each case and the average results shall be recorded.

For having the actual field performance study of CGBM, two trial sections were laid in Surat city, 
Gujarat. The CGBM layer was laid as resurfacing course over existing bituminous surface on 
which approximately 650 CVPD traffic is plying. Further, the laboratory test results of field core 
samples (shown in Photo A8 (a) & (b)) were found to be close to the values determined on the 
laboratory prepared samples. The test results of field core samples are given in Table A2. The 
CGBM surface was also checked for their skid resistance using British Pendulum Tester (BPN 
instrument) as per ASTM E303.

Annexure A
Outline of ASTM C29 for Determination of Dry Aggregate Air Voids
A.	
Scope and Summary of Test
This method covers the determination of bulk density (unit weight) of aggregate in a specified 
compacted condition and calculation of voids between aggregate particles based on this 
determination. The amounts of calculated voids are used in the mix design of CGBM. Only the 
dry rodded compaction is covered in this outline of the test method.
B.	
Testing Equipment
	
1.	
Balance or scale accurate up to 0.1 percent of the test load.
	
2.	
Tamping rod: a round, straight steel rod, 16 mm (5/8 inch) in diameter and 
approximately 600 mm in length. Tamping end shall be rounded to a hemispherical 
tip with a diameter of 16 mm.
	
3.	
A sturdy, cylindrical metal measure with a capacity of 10 liters. The height and 
diameter of the measure should be approximately equal.
	
4.	
Shovel or scoop for filling the measure with aggregate.
	
5.	
Piece of glass plate of 6 mm thickness and at least 25 mm larger than the 
diameter of the measure.
C.	
Testing Procedure
	
1.	
Calibrate the measure and determine its capacity in mm3 by filling it with 
water and covering with glass plate to eliminate air bubbles and excess 
water. Determine the mass of water in the measure. Calculate the volume 
of the measure (V), by dividing the mass of water by its density.
	
2.	
Use the dry rodding procedure to place and compact the oven-dry 
aggregates in the measure. Fill the measure 1/3 full with aggregate and 
level the surface with fingers. Rod the layer of the aggregate with 25 strokes 
of the tamping rod evenly distributed over the surface. Fill the measure 2/3 
full, level with fingers and rod as above again. Finally, fill the measure 
slightly overflowing the measure and rod again as before. Level the surface 
of aggregate with fingers in such a way that any slight projections of the 
larger pieces of the coarse aggregate approximately balance the larger 
voids in the surface below the top of the measure.
	
3.	
Determine the mass of the measure plus its contents and the mass of the 
measure alone and record the values to the nearest 0.05 kg.

Annexure B
Outline of ASTM D 6390 for Determination of Draindown  
Characteristics in Uncompacted Asphalt Mixtures
A.	
Scope and Summary of Test
This method determines the amount of drain down in an uncompacted asphalt mixture sample 
when the sample is held at elevated temperatures, which are encountered during the production, 
transportation, and placement of the mixture. This test is especially applicable to open-graded 
asphalt mixtures (such as open-graded friction course) and gap-graded mixtures such as Stone 
Matrix Asphalt (SMA). A fresh sample of the asphalt mixture (either made in the laboratory or 
from an asphalt plant) is placed in wire basket. The wire basket is hung in a forced draft oven for 
one hour at pre-selected temperature. A catch plate of known mass is placed below the basket 
to collect material drained from the sample. The mass of the drained material is determined to 
calculate the amount of draindown as a percentage of the mass of the total asphalt mix sample.
B.	
Testing Equipment
	
1.	
Forced draft oven, capable of maintaining temperatures in a range of 120 to 
175ºC with +/- 2ºC of the set temperature.
	
2.	
Plates to collect the drained material.
	
3.	
Standard wire basket meeting the dimensions is shown in Photo 1. A standard 
6.3 mm sieve cloth shall be used to make the basket. The dimensions shown 
can vary by +/- 10 percent.
	
4.	
Balance readable to 0.1 gram.
C.	
Testing Procedure
	
1.	
For each mixture to be tested, the draindown characteristics shall be determined 
at two temperatures: at the anticipated plant production temperature and at a 
temperature 10ºC higher than the anticipated production temperature. Duplicate 
samples shall be tested at each temperature. Therefore, a minimum of 4 samples 
shall be tested.
	
2.	
Weigh the empty wire basket (Mass A).
	
3.	
Place in the wire basket 1200 +/- 200 grams of fresh, hot asphalt mixture (either 
prepared in the laboratory or from an asphalt plant) as soon as possible without 
losing its temperature. Place the mix loosely in the basket without consolidating 
it. Determine the mass of the wire basket plus sample to the nearest 0.1 gram 
(Mass B).
	
4.	
Determine the mass of the empty plate to be placed under the basket to nearest 
0.1 gram (Mass C).
	
5.	
Hang the basket with the mix in the oven preheated to a selected temperature. 
Place the catch plate beneath the wire basket. Keep the basket in the oven for 
1 hour +/- 5 minutes.

= mass of the empty wire basket, g
	
D	
= mass of the wire basket plus sample, g
	
C	
= mass of the empty catch plate, g
	
D	
= mass of the catch plate plus drained material, g
Average the two draindown results at each temperature and report it to nearest 0.1 percent.

Annexure C
Outline of ASTM D 2041 for Theoretical Maximum Specific Gravity  
and Density of Bituminous Paving Mixtures
A.	
Scope and Summary of the Test Method
This test method covers the determination of the theoretical maximum specific gravity and density 
of uncompacted bituminous paving mixtures at 25ºC. The theoretical maximum specific gravity 
(Gmm) is used: (a) to calculate air voids in compacted bituminous mixtures, (b) to calculate the 
amount of bitumen absorbed by the aggregate, and (c) to provide target value for the compaction 
of paving mixtures in the field. A sample of loose paving mixture is placed in a tared vacuum 
vessel. Water is added to completely submerge the sample. A specified amount of vacuum is 
gradually applied to remove the air bubbles entrapped between asphalt mix particles. After the 
vacuum is released, the volume of the sample of the void less paving mixture is obtained by 
either immersing the vacuum container with the sample in a water bath or weighing or by filling 
the calibrated vacuum container level full of water and weighing in air.
B.	
Testing Equipment
	
1.	
Container (either a or b below)
	
a.	
Vacuum bowls - Either a metal or plastic bowl with a diameter ranging from 
180 to 260 mm and a bowl height of at least 160 mm. The bowl shall be 
equipped with a stiff, transparent cover fitted with a rubber gasket and a 
connection for the vacuum line. The hose connection shall be covered with 
a small piece of fine wire mesh to minimize loss of any fine material from 
the mix.
	
b.	
Vacuum flask - To be used for weighing in air only: A thick-walled volumetric 
glass flask with a capacity of approx. 4000 ml, fitted with a rubber stopper 
with a connection for the vacuum line. The hose connection shall be 
covered with a small piece of fine wire mesh to minimize loss of any fine 
material from the mix.
	
2.	
Balance capable of being read to the nearest 0.1 gram. If weighing is to be done 
under water, a suitable suspension arrangement shall be provided for weighing 
the sample while suspended from the centre of the balance.
	
3.	
Vacuum pump, capable of evacuating air from the vacuum container to a residual 
pressure of 4.0 kPa (30 mm of Hg) or less. Provide a suitable trap between the 
pump and container to minimize water vapour entering the vacuum pump.
	
4.	
Residual pressure manometer or calibrated absolute pressure gauge with a 
bleed valve to adjust the vacuum level.
	
5.	
Water bath capable of maintaining a constant temperature of 25 +/- 1ºC and 
suitable for immersion of the suspended container.

C.	
Calibration of Containers
	
1.	
Bowls: Determine the mass (B) of the container immersed in water at 25+/- 1ºC. 
If the bowl is used for weighing in air, place the volumetric lid on the bowl while 
under water. Remove the water-filled bowl with the lid in place and dry prior to 
determining the combined mass of the bowl, lid and water. Repeat 3 times and 
average the 3 masses. Designate the average mass as D.
	
2.	
Flasks: Calibrate the volumetric flask by accurately determining the mass of the 
flask filled with water at 25+/- 1ºC. Use a glass cover plate to ensure the flask is 
completely full.
D.	
Testing Procedure
	
1.	
Separate the particles of the loose paving mixture (while it is warm) by hand 
so that the particles are not larger than about 6 mm and don’t fracture the 
aggregates. Place the mix sample directly into the tarred bowl or flask. Weigh 
the container with the sample and designate the net mass of the sample only 
as A. (Note: The minimum sample size shall be 1500g for mixes with nominal 
maximum aggregate sizes of 12.5 mm or smaller; and shall be 2500g for mixes 
with nominal maximum aggregate sizes from 19 to 25 mm).
	
2.	
Add sufficient water at 25ºC to cover the sample completely. Place the cover 
(bowl) or stopper (flasks) on the containers.
	
3.	
Place the container with the sample and water on a mechanical agitation device 
or agitate manually at frequent intervals (2 to 3 minutes). Begin removing 
entrapped air by gradually applying vacuum and increasing the vacuum pressure 
until the residual manometer reads 3.7+/-0.3 kPa (27.5 +/- 2.5 mm of Hg). After 
achieving this level within 2 minutes, continue the vacuum and agitation for 
15+/-2 minutes. Gradually release the vacuum with the bleed valve.
	
4.	
Weighing in water- Suspend the bowl (without lid) and contents in water for 
10+/-1 minutes and then determine mass. Designate the mass under water of 
the bowl and sample as C.
	
5.	
Weighing in air
	
a.	
Bowl – Submerge the bowl and sample slowly in the 25 +/- 1ºC water bath. 
Keep it there for 10 +/- 1 minute. Immerse the lid in water and slide it onto 
the bowl without removing water from the bowl so that no air is trapped 
inside the bowl. Remove the bowl with the lid in place from the water bath. 
Dry the bowl and lid with a dry cloth. Determine the mass of the bowl, 
sample and lid and designate it as E.
	
b.	
Flask – Fill the flask slowly with water ensuring not to introduce any air into 
the sample. Place the flask in water bath for 10+/- 1 minute to stabilize the 
temperature at 25ºC without submerging the top of the flask. Completely 
fill the flask with water using a cover plate without entrapping air beneath 
the cover plate. Wipe the exterior of the flask and cover plate. Determine 
the mass of the flask, plate and its contents completely filled with water. 
Designate this mass as E.

the Flow Value of Grout using Flow Cone
A.	
Scope and Summary of Test
This test method covers a procedure, used both in the laboratory and in the field, for determining 
the time of efflux of a specified volume of fluid grout through a standardized flow cone. The 
measured time of efflux of a specified volume of grout from a standardized flow cone is termed 
as Flow Value of grout, which directly relates to the Flow-ability of the grout.
B.	
Apparatus
	
1.	
Flow Cone, with dimensions as shown in Fig. 1.
	
2.	
Receiving Container of minimum 2000 mL capacity.
	
3.	
Ring Stand or other device, capable of supporting the flow cone in a vertical, 
steady position over the receiving container.
	
4.

Annexure E
Construction of CGBM Pavements
Different stages for construction of CGBM are described below. The summarized stages of 
CGBM construction at field are also depicted in Photo 2(a) to Photo 2(e).
	
1.	
A tack coat of bitumen or bitumen emulsion should be applied as per the MoRTH 
specifications, before the construction of High Voids Bituminous Mix. If only 
aggregate layer such as WMM or WMM is the base, prime coat shall be applied.
	
2.	
Aggregates and bitumen should be heated and mixed in a hot mix plant.
	
3.	
The hot High Voids Bituminous Mix is then laid with Paver and then lightly 
compacted with smooth wheel Static Roller. Normally 4 to 6 passes are given.
	
4.	
When the temperature of the paved high voids bituminous mix drops down to 
ambient temperature (say near about 50 to 60ºC), then the compacted bituminous 
surface is ready to be grouted.
	
5.	
The cement grout should preferably be prepared in Pan Mixer so that all 
ingredients gets get fully intermixed. If patented intimately mixed commercial dry 
powder is available in market, the pan mixer may be replaced with any simple 
blending equipment to produce liquid grout slurry.
	
6.	
Once the grout slurry is thoroughly mixed and has achieved the desired Flow 
Value, then the cementitious grout slurry can be applied on the prepared 
high voids bituminous surface. Application of cementitious grout can be done 
manually or by mechanical means over the high voids bituminous surface. 
Sweeping/Squeezing or other such simple techniques can be adopted for this 
purpose. The applied grout should be able to automatically flow into the voids 
of the bituminous surface under the effect of gravity alone. The edges of the 
bituminous layer should necessarily be covered with any suitable material like 
fly ash in order to restrict the outflow of the grout slurry. Grout application work 
should not be executed in rainy or snowy environment.
	
7.	
To improve the surface roughness, the grouted surface can be mechanically/
manually broomed to create texture on the surface. 
	
8.	
Moist curing needs to be done in accordance with IRC:44. Curing by water spray 
can also be carried out for seven days, even with traffic in operation. If polymer 
based grout is used, curing for at least twenty four hours must be done.
No construction joints are required in CGBM pavements. Looking to needs of urban area the 
CGBM roads can be opened to light traffic within 24 hrs, provided that compressive strength of at 
least 3MPa for the composite CGBM layer is achieved. Cores should be taken at random places 
and be examined to check the full depth penetration of grout into the high voids bituminous layer. 
The skid resistance should be evaluated using British Pendulum Tester and the minimum skid 
resistance value should be 60 BPN for dry condition and 55 BPN for wet condition.



======================================================================

There is availability of readymade commercial products for grouting with strength of up to 90 MPa 
at 7-8 days. These grouts can be used in CGBM works, if they are found suitable and satisfying 
the strength and flowability requirements. Leachability test may also be done to check whether 
the chemicals contain any harmful components.
