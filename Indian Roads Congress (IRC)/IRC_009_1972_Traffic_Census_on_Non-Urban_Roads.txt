TRAFFIC CENSUS ON NON-URBAN ROADS
].
INTRODUCTION
l.I.
Periodic traffic census are a valuable source of basic
data
for highway planning.
As such, these
should be a regular
feature in
all highway departments.
This Standard
was originally
published in
1960.
The
revised
Standard
was considered
and
approved
by
the
Specifications and
Standards
Committee in
their
meeting
held on
the 18th and
19th
November,
1971 and
by the
Executive Committee
in their meeting
held on
the 26th and 27th
April, 1972.
Later,
it
was approved
for
publication
as the
finalised
Standard
by the Council at
their 78th
meeting held at Nainital on the 10th July, 1972.
2.
SCOPE
2.1.
It is desirable
that traffic census operations be carried out
in a uniform manner throughout the country.
2.2
The repetition
of census
operations, on
the scale
recom-
mended here,
should normally
be limited to important
trunk routes
like
the
National
Highways,
State
Highways and
Major
District
Roads.
3.
SELECTION OF CENSUS POINTS
3.1.
Judicious location of traffic count stations is crucial to the
success of a
census programme.
For trunk
routes serving
inter-city
traffic,
it
is relevant that
the census sites
should be fixed well
away
from
all urbanised
developments
and villages.
In
particular,
sites
within zone
of influence of towns where there may be a regular flow
of commuter traffic
must be avoided.
If need be,
additional stations
could be set up for these zones.
3.2.
Every
road should be divided
into
convenient
sections,
each carrying approximately similar traffic between points of substan-
tial traffic change.
Count stations
should be set up for each section.
The limits
of the sections
could
generally
be the
important
towns
along
the road
or major
roads intersecting
or taking
off from
the
highway in question.

3.3.
Since division of the highway into sections and
fixation of
census
points for
them
are
decisions of
lasting
significance,
these
should be
taken at a
senior level
in each highway
department after
considering the traffic pauern along the entire
route.
3.4
Every
subsequent
census
should
be
taken at
the
same
locations.
New
stations could,
of course,
be
added
as and
when
needed.
4.
FREQUENCY AND DURATION OF CENSUS
4.1.
Traffic should be counted at each point at least twice every
year.
One count should be taken during the peak season of harvest-
ing and marketing and the other during the
lean
season.
Each time
the count should
be made for
a full week spread over
7 consecutive
days and 24 hours of each day.
4.2.
Traffic census
should not
generally encompass abnormal
conditions of traffic like a fair or exhibition.
In such cases, the count
in the area should be postponed by a few days
till normalcy returns.
5.
RECORDING OF DATA
5.1.
For the
purpose of
counts, a day
could be divided
into
three shifts
of 8 hours each and separate
enumerators with a super-
visor assigned for each shift.
Enumerators should be literate persons
with preferably
middle or matriculation
level qualification.
It may
be worth-while
to specially
train
supervisors to go round
from one
census point to the
next and initiate the
other staff new to
this kind
of work.
5.2.
Recording should be done for each direction of travel sepa-
rately.
For this
it will be
necessary to
divide staff
for every
shift
into two parties.
5.3.
A field data sheet form for the manual recording of hourly
flows is
given
in Plate
I.
Before start of
enumeration,
it should be
ensured by the supervisors that the information in the form at the top
is duly filled in by the enumerators.
5.4.
In each
hourly column,
the traffic should be recorded by
making tally
marks in
the five dash
system (vertical
strokes for
the
first four
vehicles, followed by
an oblique stroke for the
fifth vehicle
so as to depict a
total of five).
Hourly totals should be made at the
end of the shift.

6.
COMPILATION OF DATA
6.1.
A form
for daily
traffic summary
is shown
at
Plate
II.
Information
in this
sheet should
be compiled
from
the
field
data
sheets.
The
highest peak hour
traffic in
the day for
fast as well as
slow
vehicles may
be highlighted
in the summary sheets by drawing
a firm line in red around the figures in the appropriate column.
6.2.
The
information
collected in
the
daily summary
sheets
should
be transferred to
the weekly
traffic summary
form shown at
Plate III.
The
average
daily
traffic for
the week
should
then
be
determined and indicated in the space provided for that in the form.
6.3.
The daily and weekly traffic summaries should be prepared
in quadruplicate
so that
one copy
could be
kept by
the
Executive
Engineer
incharge of
maintenance of
the road and the other
copies
sent to the
planning division at the headquarters office
which in turn
would remit this information to the other agencies concerned, e.g., the
Roads Wing of the Ministry of Shipping and Transport in the case of
National
Highways.
The
field data
sheets
should be
preserved
as
permanent record for at least five years.
6.4.
An index map indicating
the location
of the
census site
should be attached to the traffic summary sheets.
