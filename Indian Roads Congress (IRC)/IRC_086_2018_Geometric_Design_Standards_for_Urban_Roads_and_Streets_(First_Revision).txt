1 INTRODUCTION
Geometric Design Standards for Urban Roads in Plains was first published by IRC in 1983. 
The goal of urban roads and streets design process is to create safe, comfortable and 
convenient access for all road users, promote environmental sustainability, while creating 
vibrant and liveable public spaces. These standards are adopted by local bodies and other 
urban agencies for roads in sub-urban areas. In recent past, lot of changes have taken 
place in the composition of urban traffic, volume of traffic, operating speed, pedestrian 
and NMT facilities, mobility, safety and ecology. The Urban Roads and Streets Committee 
(H-8) during the tenure 2015-17 decided to revise the document in order to keep pace with 
all changes in urban scenario and traffic demand. Accordingly, a sub-group was formed 
under the convenorship of Dr. Ch. Ravi Sekhar comprising Prof. M. Parida, Sh. D.P. Gupta, 
Shri Amit Bhatt, Shri Ahok Bhattacharjee, Dr. Shreya Gadepalli and Ms. Sonal Shah to 
prepare the revise document. This code provides standards on the geometric design of urban 
roads so as to provide balance allocation of road space for pedestrians, cyclists and public 
and transport users, thereby promoting and prioritizing accessibility over mobility The draft 
prepared by the sub-group was discussed in numerous meetings of H-8 Committee and finally 
approved in its meeting held on 18.08.2017 for placing before the HSS Committee.
The composition of the H-8 Committee is given below:

The Highways Specifications & Standards Committee (HSS) considered and approved the draft 
document in its meeting held on 24th October, 2017. The inputs were also received from officers 
of S&R Zone of Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. The Executive Committee in its 
meeting held on 2nd November, 2017 considered and approved the same document for placing 
it before the Council. The Council in its 213th meeting held at Bengaluru on 3rd November, 2017 
considered and approved the draft for printing.
The geometric design of urban roads shall follow the principles given below:
 
● 
Accessibility: People should be able to move safely and seamlessly through 
the city.
 
● 
Safety and Comfort: Streets are safe, clean and walk able.
 
● 
Ecology: Streets are climate resilient and impact on the natural environment is 
minimized.
 
● 
Social Concerns: Streets cater to the access needs of local communities, 
elderly and persons with disabilities.
Geometric design is influenced by a number of factors such as modal shares, nature of terrain, 
type, composition and volume of traffic, operating speed, and land use characteristics, integrated 
factors (mobility, safety and ecology). Geometric design for urban transportation facilities includes 
the following visible elements.
 
● 
Horizontal Alignment
 
● 
Vertical Alignment
 
● 
Cross Sectional Elements
 
● 
Intersections and Interchanges
 
● 
Essential Components
 
♦ 
Pedestrian Side Walks and Crossings
 
♦ 
Non Motorized Traffic (NMT)
 
♦ 
Inclusive facility for persons with disability, elderly.
The concepts of mobility, accessibility, safety and ecology have been incorporated in the 
manual in view of increasing urbanisation. Mobility is the fast, safe and convenient movement 
of maximum number of people through the city. Providing safety and comfort is making streets 
safe, clean, walk-able by creating climate sensitive design. Consideration of ecology in highway 
design reduces impact on the natural environment; and reduces pressure on built infrastructure.
These geometric design standards are applicable to urban roads and streets in plain, rolling and 
hilly terrains. The terrain is classified based on the general class slope of the country across 



======================================================================

the alignment. Terrain is classified as plain, rolling, mountainous and steep as per the criteria 
percent cross slope of the country given in IRC:73. All the main elements of geometric design for 
urban roads are included in the text. The layout of intersections and interchanges is not covered 
as standards for the same are brought out separately.
2 CLASSIFICATION OF URBAN ROADS AND STREETS
The following six classes of urban roads and streets have been recommended in the IRC Manual 
on Planning and Development of Urban Roads and Streets.
 
● 
Urban Expressway
 
● 
Arterial Road
 
● 
Sub Arterial Road
 
● 
Collector Street
 
● 
Local Street
 
●  
Non-Motorized Transport (NMT) Streets and Greenways
2.1 
Definitions
 
● 
Urban Expressway: An urban expressway is an urban arterial highway for 
high speed regional passenger and goods traffic from inter-city highways/
expressways to connect to other inter-city highways entering the city at specific 
locations. These are full access control and having divided carriageways for 
high speed travel provided generally with grade separators at intersections and 
service roads on both sides.
 
● 
Arterial Road: A general term denoting a road/street primarily for through traffic, 
usually on a continuous route. Arterial roads facilitate mobility across the city and 
connect to long distance destinations within/outside the city, while providing safe 
NMT facilities. On-street parking shall be prohibited or restricted, except when 
there is space available for a service lane with parking. Safety for pedestrians 
will be ensured by providing segregated at-grade level.
 
● 
Sub Arterial Road: A general term denoting a road/street primarily for through 
traffic usually on a continuous route but offering somewhat lower level of traffic 
mobility than the arterial road. These are larger collector streets meant for 
movement through neighborhoods and to connect to arterial roads.
 
● 
Collector Street: A Street for collecting and distributing traffic from and to local 
streets and also for providing access to arterial/sub arterial roads. They shall be 
designed with dedicated footpaths. Various speed reduction measures will be 
employed to limit vehicle speeds to less than 40 kmph and ensure safety of NMT 
users.
 
● 
Local Street: A street primarily for access to residence, business or other 
abutting property. Its primary function shall be for local activities and access 
to properties and not through movement of traffic. Local streets may not have 
a dedicated footpath and can be designed as shared space that gives priority 
to NMT modes. Various traffic calming elements will be employed to ensure 
that vehicle speeds are below 20 kmph, safe for intermingling of pedestrians, 
cyclists, and motor vehicles.



======================================================================
PAGE 12 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:86-2018
4
 
● 
NMT Streets and Greenways: All motorised traffic will be prohibited, using 
barriers and enforcement of regulations to prevent their entry and encroachment 
of NMT space. Such streets will be designed in compliance with universal 
accessibility guidelines, with bicycle parking, and access for emergency 
response vehicles.
2.2 
Functions
The functions of different categories of urban roads are discussed in Manual for Planning and 
Development of Urban Roads and Streets.
2.3 
General Consideration
The principal factors to be considered in designing urban roads are the travel desire lines of 
people by various modes of travel, the safety and access needs of adjacent land, network 
pattern, existing and proposed land-use. Besides classification of the road, other factors like 
type of traffic, effect on environment, drainage and maintenance must also be given prime 
consideration. For example, mixed conditions of traffic require careful consideration of grades, 
climbing lanes, curvature etc. Consideration should also be given to see that the road and its 
structures blend with the environment and produce a pleasing appearance. Noise and fume 
pollution is a problem in urban areas and the cross-section should provide for remedial measures 
such as noise barriers, and adequate distance should be kept between busy routes and adjacent 
populated areas.
3 DESIGN CONTROLS
The design of road is that of a three dimensional structure which should be safe, efficient, 
functional and economical for pedestrians and non motorised vehicles and motorized vehicular 
traffic. The design controls are human factors, road space allocation, speeds, design vehicles 
and sight distances.
3.1 
Definitions of Various Speeds
Speed is an important element in geometric design. The factors influencing speeds are driver 
characteristics, vehicular characteristics, road characteristics, traffic composition and weather. 
Design speed and posted speed are key instruments, which can be used to regulate the speed 
of motor vehicles through road design and enforcement.
 
● 
Design Speed: The speed selected as a safe basis to establish appropriate 
geometric design elements for particular sections of road. It should be a logical 
one with respect to topography, anticipated operating speed, the adjacent land 
use and functional classification of road.
 
● 
Posted Speed: It is a speed limitation set for reason of safe traffic operations on 
a particular stretch of road keeping in view the prevailing geometric condition and 
land use characteristics. Selection of posted speed is an operational decision.
The other speed metrics such as Operating Speed is defined as 85th percentile speed of cars 
at low volumes (8 sec headway). Operating speed and design speed should be correlated to 
each other. If there is much difference, it might lead to violations on the ground. Further, running

speed, which measures the average speed maintained over a given route, is not an effective 
metric for designing urban roads as it does not help understand the specific geometry of a given 
road stretch and its impact on speeds.
3.2 
Design Speed
Speed is used as a design criterion to influence the geometric design of an urban road. Embracing 
a proactive design approach on new and existing urban roads and streets with the goal of 
reducing speeds “may be the single most consequential intervention in reducing pedestrian 
injury and fatality.” Higher design speeds often mandate larger curve radii, wider travel lane 
widths, on-street parking restrictions, guardrails, and clear zones. Lower design speeds reduce 
observed speeding behaviour, providing a safer road for people to walk, park, and drive. Design 
speed is a critical input for many geometric elements such as horizontal alignment, vertical 
alignment and cross section elements.
Keeping in view type of function expected of each class of the urban road system, the design 
speeds proposed are given in Table 3.1. The design speed should preferably be uniform along 
the given road/street. The design speeds for both mountainous and steep terrain may be the 
same. In view of administrative difficulties in classifying arterial and sub-arterial as distinct 
function, same speeds are proposed for both these classes.

3.3 
Posted Speed
While design speeds should be uniform over a road stretch, a lower value compared to that 
designated in Table 3.1 may be adopted for posted speed depending on the presence of 
physical controls, roadside development and related factors. For example, a posted speed of 
20 kmph may be adopted in the vicinity of schools, colleges, universities, hospitals, 500 m 
around mass transit stations, dense urban cores and central business districts. The sudden 
change in posted speeds along a stretch of road should be avoided. Changes should be made 
in stages in steps of 10 kmph at a time.
4 SPACE STANDARDS
The space standards recommended for the various categories of urban roads are given in 
Table 4.1. The term” space standard” is often referred to as “right-of-way” (IRC Manual on 
Planning and Development of Urban Roads and Streets).

5 CROSS-SECTIONAL ELEMENTS
The width and layout of urban road cross-section depend on many factors, the chief amongst 
them being the classification of road, design speed, and the volume of traffic expected. Other 
considerations are requirements of parking lanes, bus-bays, loading-unloading bays, occurrence 
of access points, volume of pedestrians and cyclists, width of drains, location of sewer lines, 
electricity cables and other public utility services.
5.1 
Footpath
Footpaths are defined as any area primarily used by ‘all’ pedestrians. They can be adjacent to 
roadways or away from the road. A footpath should consist of a dead or frontage zone, pedestrian 
zone and a multi-functional zone (IRC:103). See Fig. 5.1.
Obstruction Free Min. 
Walking Zone shall be 
1.8 m X 2.2 m - both

No utility ducts, utlity 
poles, electric water or 
telecom boxes, trees, 
signage or any kind of 
obstruction should be

● 
Frontage Zone or Dead Zone: A dead space in front of active commercial 
frontage is required for passive slow speed window shoppers clear from the 
regular pedestrian movement space to avoid conflict and increase the walking 
space capacity.
 
● 
Pedestrian Zone: An uninterrupted walking zone of minimum 1.8 m (width) and 
2.2 m (height) shall be provided. No tree branches, trees, utility poles, electric/
water/telecom boxes or sign age should be placed within the clear height and 
width of the pedestrian zone. However, subject to this minimum, the width of 
the zone shall be based on the design flows and levels of service outlined in 
Tables 5.1 and 5.2.
 
● 
Multi-Functional Zone: A multi-functional zone (also known as a Planting 
Zone or Street Furniture Zone) of minimum 1-2 m width (depending on the 
hierarchy of urban road) shall be provided between the pedestrian zone and 
carriageway to provide amenities for road users and also to help smooth and 
orderly movement of all kinds of traffic. It shall accommodate tree planting and 
planting for storm water management, auto-rickshaw stands, cycle-rickshaw 
stands, hawker zones, paid car parking, bus stops, traffic police booths, MTNL 
boxes, fire hydrants, junction boxes, etc, street lights/pedestrian lights. Verges 
are not required for urban roads, as their role is served by the multi-functional 
zone of a footpath.

● 
Footpaths and other elements of the pedestrian environment should be 
accessible to all users, in compliance with Harmonised Guidelines and Space 
Standards for Barrier-Free Built Environment for Persons with Disability and 
Elderly Persons (2016) of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.
 
● 
Footpath shall be continuous even at property entrances for uninterrupted 
pedestrian movement. The height of the footpath shall remain the same. To 
provide access to private properties, vehicle ramps should be provided in the 
furniture zone with a gradient of 1:6 (Fig. 5.2).
 
●  
Footpaths should have a well maintained surface with cross fall neither so flat 
as to be difficult to drain nor so steep as to be dangerous to walk. The cross fall 
of 2.5 to 3 per cent should meet this requirement.
Fig. 5.2  Footpaths at Property Entrances
5.1.1 
Capacity and clear pedestrian zone
The width of the pedestrian zone is fundamental to the effective functioning of the pedestrian 
system. A minimum width of 1.8 m for an uninterrupted pedestrian zone is recommended for 
residential areas, which shall increase based on adjoining land uses. Subject to the minimum 
widths in Table 5.1, the capacity of the pedestrian zone shall be determined by the design flows 
recommended in Table 5.2. Footpaths should normally be designed for a Level of Service B, 
thereby providing wide pedestrian facilities for pleasant and comfortable walking. Under resource 
constraint, Level of Service C can be adopted.
5.1.2 
Medians and mid-block pedestrian crossings
 
● 
The divider between a two way traffic lane is called median.
 
● 
The maximum height of median kerb is 150 mm. Medians shall be designed as 
surmountable pedestrian refuge to enhance pedestrian safety. Roads with 4 or 



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:86-2018
9
more traffic lanes shall have medians with pedestrian refuge of minimum 3 m 
waiting area (IRC:103), with bollards located in the refuge space to enhance 
pedestrian safety.
 
●  
The minimum width of a median should be 1.2 m. As far as possible, the median 
should be of uniform width in a particular section. However, where changes are 
unavoidable, a transition of 1 in 15 to 1 in 20 must be provided.
 
● 
Instead of fences, medians should be landscaped and used for storm-water 
filtration and management wherever possible.
 
● 
Pedestrian crossings will be constructed as raised crosswalks, or painted zebra 
crossings. Zebra crossing will comply with IRC:103.
 
● 
Mid-block pedestrian crossings will be located based on the typology of urban 
road and range from 50-200 m.
 
● 
At unsignalized crossings, raised crosswalks shall be constructed. Raised 
crosswalks shall have a minimum width of 3 m, elevated to the level of 
the adjacent footpath, with  ramps for motor vehicles with a slope of 1:8 
(IRC:103) (Fig. 5.3).
Fig. 5.3  Raised Pedestrian Crossing Reduces Vehicle Speed,  
thereby Increasing Pedestrian Safety
5.1.3 
Pedestrian crossings: intersection
 
● 
At unsignalized intersections, raised crossings shall be provided to ensure 
pedestrians can cross safely. They shall be elevated to the level of the adjacent 
footpath, with ramps for motor vehicles with a slope of 1:8 (Fig. 5.4).
 
● 
Smaller turning radii increase pedestrian safety by reducing vehicle speeds. 
Turning radii at intersections of arterial and major collector roads shall not 
exceed 9 m. The turning radii for minor collector roads and local streets shall 
not exceed 4 m.
 
● 
Pedestrian crossings will be located in alignment with pedestrian desire line- 
pedestrian travel path.

Fig. 5.4  Raised Pedestrian Crossing at Intersection
 
● 
Slip roads are undesirable from a pedestrian and cyclist safety standpoint and 
should be discouraged. Slip roads are meant for the “signal free” movement of 
traffic, and to spare the left turning motorized traffic from having to wait at traffic 
lights for taking a turn, but this design this design feature makes it difficult for 
pedestrians, cyclists, aged and person with disabilities to cross the street safely.
5.1.4 
Cross falls
Cross falls should only be provided where it is absolutely necessary for drainage purposes and 
should be 1:50 maximum. If the change in cross fall is so severe that one wheel of a wheelchair 
or one foot of a walker leaves the ground, it may cause the user of the wheelchair or walker to 
fall. Steeper gradients tend to misdirect buggies and wheelchairs. Where falls are not adequate, 
silt will accumulate after rain and cause the surface to become slippery. Puddles also cause 
the footpath to become slippery, lead to glare in bright sunshine after other parts of the footpath 
have become dry and become a hazard in frosty weather. Any break in the surface, e.g. drainage 
channels or the gaps between boards on a walkway, should not be more than 12 mm and should 
cross perpendicular to the direction of movement. This will prevent walking sticks and wheels 
getting caught in the gaps.
5.1.5 
Service covers
Service covers to manhole and inspection chambers should not be positioned on footpaths, 
particularly at dished crossings. They can be dangerous when opened for inspection, forming 
a tripping hazard and reducing the clear width. Covers and gratings should be non-slip, flush/
levelled with the footpath surface, and be such that openings are not more than 10 mm wide. 
Gratings and slot type drainage should be sited away from pedestrian flows and perpendicular 
to the main line of pedestrian flows so as not to trap small wheels.

5.1.6 
Pedestrian guardrails
Pedestrian guard-rails are an important design element to prevent indiscriminate crossing and 
spilling over of pedestrian on to the carriageway. Their judicious use can help to ensure that 
pedestrians cross the streets at predetermined and safe locations. As the guard-rails would 
confine the movement of pedestrians to the footpath, it is obligatory that sufficient width of 
footpath be made available (IRC:103).
5.1.7 
Bollards
Bollards are often used to stop vehicles from mounting the footpath and to keep pedestrian 
away from traffic. Unless positioned carefully, they can form a barrier to wheelchair users and 
are a particular hazard for persons with visual impairments. Where they are essential, such as 
to ensure clear escape routes, bollards should be identifiable by using contrasting colours by 
providing reflective tapes and be minimum 1000 mm high. To stop use by bicycles/bikes bollards 
at suitable locations should be provided with clear gap/space between two bollards should be 
1200 mm.
5.1.8 
Zebra crossings
The width of the zebra crossing must be adequate and should generally lie within a range of 
2-4 m. For divided carriageways, the crossing should, as far as possible, proceed uninterrupted 
through the median strip. In the event of the median strip being used as pedestrian refuge, 
adequate width of median must be provided. In case of raised medians, such portion could be 
suitably depressed with kerb height not exceeding 150 mm.
5.1.9 
Grade-separated pedestrian and cycling facilities
Foot-over bridges and subways increase the walking distance for a pedestrian/commuter, 
which is inconvenient and therefore discouraged to the extent possible. The design guidelines 
are given in Annexure I.
5.1.10 
Landscaping
 
● 
All footpaths shall have a continuous tree line to provide shade and improve the 
aesthetics of the streets cape. (Fig. 5.5).
 
● 
Placement of landscaping shall be coordinated with other street amenities 
(especially advertising panels and utility boxes) to maintain a clear path of travel 
for pedestrians and cyclists so as not to obstruct their through movement.
 
● 
Height of trees shall be maintained so that it does not hinder the visibility of all 
road users. Canopy of trees shall have a minimum clearance of 3 m from the 
surface of the footpath to ensure better visibility for pedestrians.
 
● 
Native trees shall be planted to minimize irrigation and maintenance 
requirements, and for a prolonged tree life.
 
● 
All trees will be protected with tree pits that allow maximum soil exposure 
enabling water and air to get to the roots.
 
● 
Tree pits, with a minimum dimension of 1 m x 1 m, shall be provided to 
accommodate the growth of root structures as tree matures.

5.2 
Non-Motorized Vehicle Tracks
Non-Motorized Vehicles (NMV) include cycles, tri-cycles, cycle rickshaws, pushcarts, and any 
other form of mobility that is powered by humans. These users are also called ‘captive cyclists’ 
(Non Motorised Transport Planning and Design Guideline, 2014). NMV plays an important and 
unique role in efficient transport systems. It is the most affordable mode of transport for groups 
of all ages and income groups covering diverse accessibility needs. Urban local bodies should 
create city-wide NMV network plans based on need assessment, to ensure that the roads and 
streets are safe for cycling.
The guidelines are provided below:
 
● 
Cycle tracks will have at least 2 m of clear space per direction for one-way 
movement and 3 m for two-way movement, and have a smooth surface asphalt 
or concrete. Paver blocks will be avoided.
 
● 
Painting cycle tracks, without segregation, shall be discouraged as they are 
likely to be encroached by parked vehicles. They shall be elevated 100-150 mm 
above the carriageway.
 
● 
A buffer of 0.5 m between the cycle track and parking areas or the carriageway 
shall be constructed.
 
● 
In compliance with IRC:11-2015, cycle tracks shall be provided on streets that 
have more than 100 motor vehicles and 400 cyclists during peak hour.
 
● 
Median cycle tracks reduce conflicts with parking and property access. 
Frequent access points with ramps are essential. Turning movement conflicts 
at intersections can be mitigated through bicycle boxes and appropriate signal 
phasing.
 
● 
Comprehensive standards for infrastructure for NMV are given in Table 5.3 
adapted for use by persons with reduced mobility and persons with disabilities, 
particularly tri-cycle users (tri-cycle width range from 800 mm - 1000 mm).

Road Width and Design Traffic Volumes
The road width should be designed to accommodate the design traffic volume. Past traffic counts 
and consideration of future development of urban areas must be kept in view while selecting the 
cross-section of road. Estimation of future traffic volumes may be based on a simple projection 
of current volumes extrapolated from past trends, or on the basis of results of transportation 
study which allows for change in land-use and accounts for socio-economic factors. The road 
should be designed to accommodate the traffic volumes computed for the end of design life. 
A design period of 15-20 years should be adopted for expressway and arterials and 10 years 
for local and collector streets. For broad assessment, the peak hour flows may be taken as 
8-10 per cent of the average daily traffic.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:86-2018

Urban roads in India are characterised by mixed traffic conditions, resulting in complex interaction 
between various kinds of vehicles. To cater to this it is prudent to express the capacity of urban 
roads in terms of a common unit. The unit generally employed is the ‘Passenger Car Unit, 
(PCU) and each vehicle type is converted into equivalent PCUs based on their relative size and 
speed. The equivalent PCUs of different vehicle categories do not remain constant under all 
circumstances. Rather, these are the function of physical dimensions and operational speeds 
of a vehicle type. The PCU is a measure of relative interaction caused by a vehicle to the traffic 
stream compared to passenger car under a specified set of roadway, traffic and other conditions. 
This interaction will depend on traffic, roadway and environmental conditions. For a given facility, 
roadway and environmental conditions remain almost unchanged during field observation time 
and therefore, traffic characteristics like traffic composition, traffic volume, speed and size of 
each category of vehicle must be able to explain the variations in PCU values for a vehicle 
type. The physical dimension and operational speed of a vehicle class and different operational 
conditions are considered to account for any variation in PCU values.
The evolved base capacity values, adjustment factors and Design Service Values (DSV) 
encompassing varying widths of two lane two-way roads as well as varying widths of divided 
multilane carriageways presented in IRC:106 may be referred.
5.4 
Carriageway Width
The primary purpose of a carriageway is vehicle mobility. A carriageway provides dedicated space 
for motorised vehicles separated from walking, cycling, and stationary activities. Carriageways 
are located in the middle of the right-of-way of the road. Designs should define clear boundaries 
through kerbs and material differences. One-way carriageways should be reviewed and provided 
if necessary to accommodate rapid transit (such as BRT) corridors or pedestrian zones. Where 
one-way streets are proposed, the ULB will provide for two-way movement for NMT modes. The 
lane width should be 3.5 mm carriageway widths are shown in Table 5.5.

For access roads to residential areas, a lower lane width of 3 m is permissible.

and pedestrian movement.
5.5 
Kerb and Kerb Ramp
It is desirable that roads in urban areas are provided with kerbs. Kerbs may be barrier type, 
semi-barrier type or mountable type. Appropriate situations for use of each type are indicated

below:
 
● 
Barrier type: Built-up areas adjacent to footpaths with considerable pedestrian 
traffic.
 
● 
Semi-barrier type: On the periphery of the roadway where pedestrian traffic is 
light and a barrier type could tend to reduce traffic capacity.
 
● 
Mountable type: Within the roadway at channelization schemes, medians, 
outer separators and raised medians on bridges.
Fig. 5.6 shows two varieties of each type of kerb with gutter and without gutter. Kerbs with gutter 
should always be used at drainage edges of pavements.
Fig. 5.6  Typical Kerb Sections
5.6 
Medians
Urban roads of four lanes or more should, as a general rule, be provided with median. For 
four-lane roads, however, the provision of median should be judicious taking into account such 
considerations as safety, directional distribution of traffic, the proportion of slow-moving traffic, 
roadside development and quality of service, etc., Medians could be avoided where there are 
significant tidal flows of traffic, or where the individual carriageways are inadequate for catering 
to peak-hour traffic volumes, or where there are intense roadside developments without frontage 
roads.
Width of median is dictated by a variety of conditions. Width will depend on the available 
right-of-way, terrain, turn lanes, drainage and other determinants. Wide medians are preferred 
where space permits. Minimum width of median at intersection to accomplish various purposes 
should be as follows: (i) Pedestrian refuge, 1.2 m; (ii) Median lane for protection of vehicle 
making right turn, 4.0 m but 7.5 m is recommended; (iii) 9 to 12 metre is required to protect 
vehicles crossing at grade. Even greater widths are required for U-turns. Absolute minimum 
width of median in urban areas is 1.2 m; a desirable minimum width is 5 m.
As far as possible, the median should be of uniform width in a particular section. However, where 
changes are unavoidable, a transition of 1 in 15 to 1 in 20 must be provided.

5.7 
Verge
Verges are required between carriageway and property line not only to accommodate lighting 
columns, traffic signs, underground services etc., but also to provide appropriate clearance to 
ensure proper vehicle placement and development of full carriageway capacity. Where road 
width is restricted, full width between carriageway and property line should be paved and 
used for pedestrian side walk/cycle track. Where possible, a minimum verge of 1 m width 
should be kept. They should be suitably levelled, trimmed and provided with a cross fall of 
5 per cent if turfed and 3 per cent if cobbled or surface dressed. This should be increased if poles, 
kerb-height, or excessive cross fall discourage parking close to the kerb and also where either 
parked vehicles frequently overlap on to the adjacent traffic lane or the parking lane is likely to 
be used as a peak hour traffic lane.
5.8 
Street Lighting
 
● 
Street lighting shall be provided such that the longitudinal dimension is equivalent 
to three times the pole height, and horizontal dimension is slightly longer than 
the pole.
 
● 
Pole height and spacing option are given in Table 5.6. The spacing between two 
light poles shall be approximately three times the height of the pole.
 
● 
Poles shall be no higher than 12 m to reduce undesirable illumination of private 
properties.
 
● 
Additional lighting shall be provided particularly at black spots, areas of potential 
risks to women,areas of personal crime, and areas of isolation.
 
● 
The placement of street lighting shall be coordinated with other street elements 
so that they do not impede proper illumination.
 
● 
A single row of light posts is generally sufficient for streets up to 12 m wide.
 
● 
On wider streets, dual lights can be mounted on a single central post.

6 CAMBER
6.1 
Camber for Carriageway
Camber or cross fall should be adopted as per Table 6.1 for straight sections Higher values of 
camber should be adopted in areas with high intensity of rainfall. Steeper camber should also be 
provided on kerbed pavement to minimise the spread of surface water flows.

Camber for Shoulders
For shoulders along unkerbed pavements, the cross fall should be 0.5 percent steeper than 
the slope of pavement. For paved footpaths, cross fall of 3 per cent should be adopted. For 
verges and unpaved areas, the cross fall should be 4 per cent. Undivided carriageways should 
have a crown in the middle and slope towards the edges. Divided roads may have a single 
crowned section or separate crowned sections for each carriageway depending on requirements 
of drainage and access to abutting property.

7  SIGHT DISTANCE
7.1 
Stopping Sight Distance
Stopping sight distance should be provided at all points on the road. Stopping sight distance is 
the total distance travelled by the driver from the time a danger is comprehended by him to the 
actual stop, i.e. the distance travelled during perception and brake reaction time plus the braking 
distance. For the purpose of measuring the stopping sight distance, the height of eye should be 
assumed as 1.2 m and height of object as 0.15 m. The design values of sight distance are given 
in Table 7.1.

On undivided roads, intermediate sight distance which is equal to twice the stopping distance 
should be provided where vehicles are permitted to cross the centre line.
7.2 
Headlight Sight Distance for Valley Curves
On valley curves, the design must ensure that the roadway ahead is illuminated during night 
travel by vehicle headlights for a sufficient length which enables the vehicle to apply brake 
to stop, if necessary. This is known as the headlight sight distance and is equal to the safe 
stopping distance. From safety considerations, valley curves should be designed to provide for 
this visibility. For designing valley curves, the following criteria should be followed to ensure the 
headlight sight distance:
 
● 
height of headlight above the road surface is 0.75 m
 
● 
the useful beam of headlight is one degree upwards from the grade of the road; 
and
 
● 
the height of object is nil.
8  HORIZONTAL ALIGNMENT
8.1 
General
In general, horizontal curves should consist of a circular portion flanked by spiral transitions

of circular curves. Length of transition curves is determined on the basis of rate of change of 
centrifugal acceleration and super elevation. See Figs. 8.1 and 8.2.

Super Elevation
8.2.1 
Design values
Super elevation required on horizontal curves should be calculated from the following formula. 
This assumes the centrifugal force corresponding to three-fourth the design speed is balanced 
by super elevation and the remaining one fourth counteracted by side friction:
 
 
 
where,
 
e 
= 
super elevation in metre per metre
 
V 
= 
speed in km/hr, and
 
R 
= 
radius in metre
Super elevation obtained from the above expression should be limited to 7 per cent. However, 
on urban sections with frequent intersections, it will be desirable to limit the super elevation to 
4 per cent for convenience in construction and for facilitating easy and safe turning movement 
of vehicles.

8.2.3 
Methods of attaining super elevation
The normal cambered section of the road is changed into super elevated section in two stages. 
First stage is the removal of adverse camber in outer half of the pavement. In the second stage, 
super elevation is gradually built-up over the full width of the carriage way so that required super 
elevation is available at the beginning of the circular curve. There are three different methods for 
attaining the super elevation:
 
i) 
revolving pavement about the centre line;
 
ii) 
revolving pavement about the inner edge; and
 
iii) 
revolving pavement about the outer edge.
 
iv) 
Annexure-II illustrates these methods diagrammatically. The small cross-
sections at the bottom of each diagram indicate the pavement cross-slope 
condition at different points.
Method (i) which involves least distortion of the pavement will be found suitable in most situations 
where there are no physical controls, and may be adopted in normal course.
Method (ii) is preferable where the lower edge profile is a major control, e.g. on account of 
drainage.
Where overall appearance is the criterion, method (iii) is preferable since the outer edge profile 
which is most noticeable to drivers is not distorted.
The super elevation should be attained gradually over the full length of the transition curve so 
that the design super elevation is available at the starting point of the circular portion. Sketches 
in Annexure II have been presented on this basis. Two-third super elevation may be attained 
on the straight section before start of the circular curve and the balance one-third on the curve.
In developing the required super elevation, it should be ensured that the longitudinal slope of 
the pavement edge compared to the centre line (i.e the rate of change of super elevation) is not 
steeper than 1 in 150.
When cross-drainage structures fall on a horizontal curve, their deck should be super elevated 
in the same manner as described above.
8.3 
Minimum Curve Radius
Minimum radius of curve can be determined from the equation:
 
 
 
where,
 
V 
= 
vehicle speeds in km/h
 
e 
= 
super elevation ratio in metre per metre
 
f 
= 
coefficient of side friction between vehicle tyres and 
 
pavement (taken as 0.15)
 
R 
= 
radius in metres

Set-Back Distance at Horizontal Curves
Physical obstructions on the inside of horizontal curves often restrict sight distance. Sight areas 
on horizontal curves should be such as to provide driver with sight distance equal to the design 
stopping distance on curve. Fig. 8.4 indicated the minimum width of set back from obstructions 
to sight measured from centre line of innermost lane. These values are applicable only when 
the length of arc of the curve is greater than the design stopping distance. For shorter lengths of 
curves, width of sight area should be checked by trial and error by assuming various positions of 
object and drivers on straight portions adjoining the curve.

8.5 
Transition Curves
Transition curves (See Fig. 8.5) are necessary for a vehicle to have smooth entry from a straight 
section into a circular curve. The transition curves also improve aesthetic appearance of the road 
besides permitting gradual application of the super elevation and extra widening of carriageway 
needed at the horizontal curves. Spiral curve should be used for this purpose. Minimum length 
of the transition curve should be determined from the following two considerations and the larger 
of the two values adopted for design:
Fig. 8.5  Elements of a Combined Circular and Transition Curve
 
(i) 
The rate of change of centrifugal acceleration should not cause discomfort to 
drivers. From this consideration, the length of transition curve is given by:
 
 
 
 
where 
 
Ls 
= 
length of transition in metres
 
 
V 
= 
speed in km/hr
 
 
R 
= 
radius of circular curve in metres
 
 
C 
= 
 
(ii) 
The rate of change of super elevation (i.e. the longitudinal grade developed at 
the pavement edge compared to through grade along the centre line) should 
be such as not to cause discomfort to travellers or to make the road appear 
unsightly. This rate of change should not be steeper than 1 in 150 for roads in 
plain and rolling terrain, and 1 in 60 in hilly terrain. The formula for minimum 
length of transition on this basis with super elevation limited to 7 per cent works 
out to:

NR-Transition not required
The elements of a combined circular and transition curves are illustrated in Fig. 8.5. For deriving 
values of the individual elements like shift, tangent distance, apex distance etc. and working out 
coordinates to lay the curves in the field, it is convenient to use curve tables. For this, reference 
may be made to IRC:38.
8.6 
Widening of Carriageway on Curves
At sharp horizontal curves, it is necessary to widen the carriageway to provide for safe passage 
of vehicles. The widening required has two components: (i) mechanical widening to compensate 
for the extra width occupied by a vehicle on the curve due to tracking of the rear wheels, and 
(ii) psychological widening to permit easy crossing of vehicles since vehicles in a lane tend to 
wander more on a curve than on a straight reach.
On two-lane or wider roads, it is necessary that both the above components should be fully 
catered for so that the lateral clearance between vehicles on curves is maintained equal to the 
clearance available on straights. Position of single-lane roads however is somewhat different, 



======================================================================
PAGE 40 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:86-2018
32
since during crossing manoeuvres outer wheels of vehicles have in any case to use the shoulders 
whether on the straight or on the curve. It is, therefore sufficient on single lane roads if only the 
mechanical component of widening is taken into account.
Based on the above considerations, the extra width of carriageway to be provided at horizontal 
curves on single and two-lane roads is given in Table 8.4. For multi-lane roads, the pavement 
widening may be calculated by adding half the widening for two-lane roads to each lane.

The extra widening should be effected by increasing the width at an approximately uniform rate 
along the transition curve. The extra width should be continued over the full length of the circular 
curve. On curves having no transition, widening should be achieved in the same way as the 
super elevation i.e. two-third being attained on the straight section before start of the curve and 
one-third on the curve.
The extra widening should be applied equally on both sides of the carriage way. However the 
widening should be provided only on the inside when the curve is plain circular and has no 
transition. The extra widening may be attained by means of offsets radial to the centre line. It 
should be ensured that the pavement edge lines are smooth and there is no apparent kink.
9 VERTICAL ALIGNMENT
9.1 
General
Vertical alignment in urban areas is governed by need to match building line and entrance line 
levels and levels of intersections and median openings.
9.2 
Gradient
Most urban roads carry mixed traffic including slow moving vehicles like bicycles and animal/hand 
carts. Besides this, urban roads generally have intersections at frequent intervals. In view of this, 
as a general rule, a gradient of 4 per cent should be considered the maximum for urban roads. 
On roads carrying predominantly slow moving traffic, however, the gradient should desirably 
not exceed 2 per cent. At intersections, the road should be as near level as possible. As the 
urban roads are generally kerbed, a minimum gradient as indicated in Table 9.1 for facilitating 
longitudinal drainage.

9.3.1 
Summit curves
A curve with convexity upwards is called a summit curve. Summit curves in urban areas should 
be designed for safe stopping sight distance and they should be coordinated with horizontal 
curvature. Broken-back profiles should be avoided and wherever possible, approaches to 
bridges less than 30 m width should be designed to fit a single vertical curve.
Length of the summit curve should be calculated on the basis of the following formulae:
 
i) 
When the length of the curve exceeds the required sight distance i.e., L is greater 
than S
 
 
 
 
where,
 
N 
= 
deviation angle, i.e., the algebraic difference between two grades
 
L 
= 
length of vertical curve in metres
 
S 
= 
sight distance in metres
 
ii) 
When the length of the curve is less than the required sight distance i.e., L is 
less than S
 
 
 
The minimum length of summit curves for stopping sight distance and various deviation angles 
have been calculated and given in Fig. 9.1. Summit curves shall be square parabolas(y = ax2) 
and minimum length should not be less than that given in Table 9.2.

Valley curves
A vertical curve concave upwards is known as a valley curve, dip or sag. Valley curves on 
unlighted urban roads should be such that for night travel, the headlight beam distance is the 
same as the stopping sight distance. In accordance with this criterion, the length of the curve 
may be calculated as under:
 
i) 
When the length of the curve exceeds the sight distance
 
 
 
 
ii) 
When the length of the curve is less than the required sight distance

calculated as per above formulae and given in Fig. 9.2.
Fig. 9.2  Length of Valley Curve
Valley curves on urban roads which are usually lit during the hours of darkness may be designed 
merely for vertical acceleration of 0.5 g for riding comfort and in that case minimum lengths given 
in Table 9.2 will suffice.
9.4 
Co-ordination of Horizontal and Vertical Alignments
Horizontal and Vertical alignments should not be designed independently. They complement each 
other and poorly designed combination can mar the good points and aggravate the deficiencies 
of each. The design should be visualised in the perspective to achieve a flowing and pleasing 
view from the road. Following broad principles should be followed in alignment co-ordination:
 
i) 
The degrees of curvature should be in proper balance with the gradients. Straight 
alignment or flat horizontal curves at the expense of steep or long grades, or 
excessive curvature in a road with flat grades, do not constitute balanced designs 



======================================================================
PAGE 44 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:86-2018
36
and should be avoided.
 
ii) 
Vertical curve superimposed upon horizontal curve gives a pleasing effect. As 
such the vertical and horizontal curves should coincide as far as possible and 
their lengths should be more or less equal. If this is difficult to achieve for any 
reason, the horizontal curve should be somewhat longer than the vertical curve.
 
iii) 
Sharp horizontal curves should be avoided at or near the apex of pronounced 
summit/sag vertical curves from safety considerations.
10 LATERAL AND VERTICAL CLEARANCES
Lateral and Vertical Clearances are required to be provided for overhanging loads and the tilting of 
vehicle towards obstruction by cross fall or super elevation of carriageway and for kerb shyness. 
Standards for lateral clearances for underpasses on urban roads are given in IRC:54. The same 
are recommended between edge of carriageway and obstruction on footpath, verge or central 
reserve. Where an obstruction is located on the inside of a bend, a greater clearance than that 
specified may be required to ensure that the sight distance is not less than the minimum.
10.1 
Underpass for Vehicles
Lateral Clearance: The lateral clearance from the edge of pavement should be as follows:
 
a) 
Pavement without footpath
 
 
Minimum clearance from the edge of pavement
 
♦ 
Arterial and sub-arterial road : 1.0 m
 
♦  
Collector and local streets: 0.5 m
 
b) 
Pavement with footpath
 
♦  
No extra clearance beyond the footpath is necessary.
 
c) 
Clearance on divided carriageway
 
 
The left side clearances should be as above. The right side clearance to the face 
of any structure in the central median shall be as follows:
 
♦  
Arterial and sub arterial road: 1 m from the edge of pavement
 
♦  
Collector and local streets: 0.5 m from the edge of pavement
Vertical Clearance: The minimum vertical clearance on urban roads should be 5.5 m.
11 DESIGN OF PUBLIC UTILITIES
Careful location and planning of physical infrastructure services and urban utilities is critical in 
order to allow easy access for regular repair and maintenance of utilities, while causing minimum 
disruption or disturbance to other street users. For details refer IRC manual on Planning and 
Development of Urban Roads and Streets.
12 TOPOGRAPHICAL DATA
Following topographical surveys are recommended for collection of topographical data for urban 
roads to improve the existing road/street geometry elements or to propose new infrastructure

facilities:
Stereo Satellite Data: Stereo Satellite Imagery is a form of Stereoscopy or 3D image. Stereo 
image pairs are used to make Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and Digital Surface Models 
(DSM).,Stereo satellite data can be procured through National Remote Sensing Center (NRSC) 
of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).
Total Station Survey Data: Total Station (TS) is an all in one instrument fulfilling the needs 
of a theodolite, a levelling instrument and a DISTOMAT (Electronic Distance Measurement 
Instrument).TS also has an inbuilt software which makes all the necessary computations. 
Microprocessor in TS will support software to perform various mathematical operations such as 
multiple angle and distance measurements, horizontal and vertical distances, and corrections 
for atmospheric and instrumental corrections. The detachable data cards and data transferring 
equipments support to transfer the data. Using TS and mapping Software, the maps can be 
created automatically.
LiDAR Data: Light Distance And Ranging (LiDAR) is a technology for measuring the positions 
of physical objects rapidly. LiDAR uses a laser beam to measure the distance from an object to 
the scanner, and mechanical-optical mount to scan the laser across a scene accurately. LiDAR 
is useful not only because it can provide accurate positions over large areas, but also because 
it is fast, LiDAR can collect tens of thousands to over a million positions per second. Collecting 
location based data at this level of detail through traditional surveying would take more time.
LiDAR data can be collected from airborne or terrestrial vehicles, from fixed positions, usually 
on a tripod, and offshore platforms. In terrestrial acquisition, the LiDAR unit is mounted either on 
a tripod or on a vehicle. With terrestrial mobile systems, a coupled GPS-IMU solution is needed 
to track the device position during data acquisition. Ground control GPS locations are also used 
with mobile systems both for calibration and quality assessment. With tripod mounted systems, 
GPS control can be either from a GPS on the unit, plus one or more control points on the ground 
to provide geometry, or from multiple GPS targets on the ground.
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Survey (UAV) Data: An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), commonly 
known as a drone, as an unmanned aircraft system or by several other names, is an aircraft 
without a human pilot aboard. The flight of UAVs may operate with various degrees of autonomy 
either under remote control by a human operator, or fully or intermittently autonomously, by 
onboard computers.
13 GEOMETRIC DESIGN SOFTWARE
Most public agencies and consulting firms engaged in a large volume of design work now employ 
computer software to assist in the design of transportation facilities. Such design packages are 
used in conjunction with Computer-Aided Drawing (CAD) software to produce facility plans that 
include horizontal and vertical alignments. The most common arrangement is for the design 
and drawing programs to run simultaneously, with the design program calling routines from the 
drawing program as needed to construct the drawings. It is also possible to have the design 
and drawing programs communicate by exchanging graphic files. The process of designing 
a transportation facility with a design software package usually begins with a Digital Terrain 



======================================================================
PAGE 46 of 52
======================================================================
IRC:86-2018
38
Model (DTM) obtained from topographical survey data. If a DTM is available, this may be used 
to construct a contour map. The slope aspect map to be used as a base map for design of 
geometric elements. Other features, such as existing structures, may be added to the base map 
by means of the drawing program.
Once the base map is completed, the user begins to design the facility by defining horizontal 
and vertical alignments. The horizontal alignment will be defined first; based on this; the design 
program will display existing elevations along the center line or other primary reference line. A 
single project may have multiple alignments; for instance, divided roadways with wide medians 
can be designed with separate horizontal and vertical alignments, and separate ditch profiles 
may be specified. In constructing alignments including horizontal and vertical, critical points 
such as Point of Intersections (PI) may be established either by specifying coordinates or (in the 
case of vertical alignment) stations and elevations, by projecting known directions or grades and 
distances from existing points, or visually, by dragging the point with a mouse or other digitizing 
device.
The design software usually provide for automatic stationing of alignments and fitting of standard 
features such as circular horizontal curves, spirals,and parabolic vertical curves. The user also 
defines templates, describing the facility cross section. These define the geometric cross section, 
ditch shapes, and earthwork cross-slopes.
The design program has the capability of calculating transitions between successive templates 
in the case of multiple templates. Where there are super elevated curves, the user enters the 
location and other details of super elevation transitions, and the program modifies the cross-
section templates to account for the super elevation.
Once alignments and templates are defined, the program constructs a single three-dimensional 
mathematical representation of the facility from them. This can be used to produce three-
dimensional views. These may be rotated and zoomed to produce three-dimensional drawings 
of the facility from any point of view. Also, once alignments and templates are established, the 
program calculates earthwork cross sections by means of a digital terrain model of base model 
and design model. Once earthwork cross sections are established, the design program can 
calculate earthwork volumes.
Advantages of using software packages to design transportation facilities include:
 
● 
Design software provides for rapid design, redesign of facilities; in particular, 
earthwork quantities for new alignments may be calculated very rapidly. This is a 
major advantage, since manual calculation of earthwork quantities is a laborious 
process.
 
● 
Design software provides the ability to easily visualize facilities in three 
dimensions. Because three-dimensional representations may be constructed 
from any viewpoint and on any orientation, it is easy to evaluate the appearance 
of the facility.
 
● 
With the design and drawing software, drawings may be re scaled rapidly, and 
multiple versions of drawings emphasizing different features may be readily 
produced. Drawing programs allow graphical objects to be grouped into different

Annexure-I 
Guidelines for Grade-Separated Pedestrian and Cycling Facilities
Foot-over bridges and subways increase the walking distance for a pedestrian/commuter, which 
is inconvenient and therefore discouraged to the extent. The following design guidelines shall 
be adhered to: 
 
●  
Foot over bridges and subways shall have universally accessible ramps (gradient 
1:20 with landing at adequate intervals), lifts and steps (landings at appropriate 
levels) can be provided.
 
● 
Escalators are not an inclusive measure. Introduction of such facilities would 
lead to a compromised arrangement of NMV and pedestrian track leading to sub 
optimal conditions if there is a restricted ROW.
 
● 
A slope of 5% (1 in 20) on footbridge ramps with appropriate resting places/
landings is preferable.
 
● 
Within the subway, a handrail set 760 mm-900 mm above the walking surface 
should be provided along with adequate natural light and ventilation.
 
● 
To assist visually impaired people, tactile paving/ tiles and a colour contrast 
should be provided at the top and bottom of the flight of steps and these areas 
should be well lit.
 
● 
Ramp/lift is mandatory and steps/escalators can be provided. Lifts should be 
on both the entrances/exits and should have minimum internal dimensions of 
1500 mm x 1500 mm.
 
● 
Greater safety can be achieved by having hawker spaces in some subways 
and/or video surveillance camera. This grade separated alternative is of least 
priority.
 
● 
Pedestrian and Cycle subway should be minimum 2.5 m (width) x 2.75 m (clear 
height).
 
● 
Combined cycle and pedestrian subway should be minimum 5 m wide for 
one-way traffic and 6.5 m wide for two-way traffic. The minimum height should 
be 2.75 m.
