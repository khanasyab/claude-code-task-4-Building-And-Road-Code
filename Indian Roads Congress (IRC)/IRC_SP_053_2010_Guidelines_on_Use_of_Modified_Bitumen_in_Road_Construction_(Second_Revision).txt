The
revised
draft document was subsequently approved
with some suggestions
by the Highways
Specifications and Standards Committee
in
its meeting
held on
01 May, 2010. The draft document was approved by the Executive Committee
in
its
meeting held on 10 May, 2010. The Council
in
its meeting held at Munnar, (Kerala)
on 22 May, 2010 approved the document with some comments. The document after
incorporating comments
of Council Members was approved
by
the Convenor
of
Highways Specifications & Standards Committee for printing.
1.2
Flexible pavements with bituminous surfacing are widely used
in India. The
high traffic intensity in terms of commercial vehicles, overloading of trucks and significant
variations in daily and seasonal temperature of the pavement have been responsible for
early development of distress like rutting, cracking, bleeding, shoving and potholing of
bituminous surfacing. A factor, which causes concern in India,
is very high and very low
pavement temperature conditions
in some parts of the country. Under these conditions
the bituminous surfacing tends to become soft in summer and brittle in winter.
1.3
Studies have revealed that properties of bitumen and bituminous mixes can
be improved/modified with the incorporation of certain additives or blend of additives.
These additives are called "Modifiers" and the bitumen premixed with these modifiers is
known as "Modified Bitumen". Use of modified bitumen in the top layers of the pavement
is expected
to significantly enhance the
life
of the surfacing and extend the time
of
the next renewal. Full-scale performance studies on overlay carried out by the various
research
institutions,
Indian
Institutes
of Technology under the aegis
of Ministry
of
Road Transport and Highways; Central Road Research
Institute; Highways Research
Station, Chennai; Rubber Board, Kerala; Gujarat Engineering Research
Institute; and
various state Public Works Departments revealed
that the use of Modified Bitumen
in construction/maintenance of bituminous roads
significantly improve the pavement
performance and
is cost effective, when life-cycle cost is taken into consideration.
1.4
IS 15462:2004 classify the polymer and rubber modified bitumen
into the
following four types:
a)
PMB(P)
Plastomeric thermoplastic based
b)
PMB(E)
Elastomenc thermoplastic based
These are further divided into three grades based on the penetration value/softening
point value, as relevant.
The above types of modified bitumen binders are recommended for use in road works.
c)
NRMB
d)
CRMB
Natural rubber and SBR latex based, and
Crumb rubber/ treated crumb rubber based.

IRC:SP. 53-2010
In this document, the above four types of modified bitumen have been referred to by
generic names-modified bitumen without specifying the type of modifier. The specification
requirement
in respect of some of the properties have been upgraded
in view of the
fact that with the growing use of new equipment and technology,
it
is now possible to
manufacture products
to higher specification.
Besides, considerable experience has
been gained over the years regarding their manufacture, use and performance.
The specification requirements
of modified bitumen
for various
climatic conditions
are given
in Table
2. The user can specify any type of modified bitumen as per IS
classification subject to the condition that the chosen product meets the specification
requirements given
in Table 2.
1.5
Asimple test for defining elastic properties of a modified binder by measuring
its torsional recovery has been specified.
2 SCOPE
These guidelines deal with the specifications and use of Modified Bitumen binders in
road construction & maintenance works, their advantages, application, manufacturing
of
modified
bitumen,
transportation,
storage,
testing,
quality
control
and
quality
assurance requirements.
3 ADVANTAGES OF MODIFIED BITUMEN
3.1
Properties of modified bitumen depend upon type and quantity of modifier
used and process adopted for their manufacture. The advantages of modified bitumen
can include one or more of the following for road works:
Lower susceptibility to temperature variations
Higher resistance to deformation at high pavement temperature
Delay of cracking and reflective cracking
Better age resistance properties
Better adhesion between aggregates and binder
Higher fatigue
life of mixes
Overall improved performance
3.2
The choice of modified bitumen may be made on the basis of traffic, climate,
and overall
life cycle cost analysis, where data
is available.

IRC SP 53-2010
4 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS OF MODIFIERS
4.1
Modified Bitumen is obtained with the incorporation of selected thermoplastic
polymers (Plastomeric or Elastomeric), crumb rubber or natural rubber
in bitumen.
When used as bitumen modifier, selected polymers/rubbers or a blend of these should
have the following properties:
i)
Compatible with bitumen
ii)
Resist degradation at mixing temperature
in)
Capable
of
being
processed
by
conventional
mixing
and
laying
machinery
iv)
Produce coating viscosity at application temperature
v)
Maintain premium properties during storage, application and in service
vi)
Capable of providing homogeneous blend with bitumen.
4.2
A number
of
proprietary
products
are
available
in
market,
with which
bitumen can be modified. These modifiers shall comply with the above requirements
besides conformity to specifications. Products shall be evaluated for their suitability in
an approved laboratory.
5 TYPE OF BITUMEN MODIFIERS
5.1
Over the years, different types of materials have been investigated as modifiers
for bitumen modifications. The commonly used modifiers are given in Table 1
. The modifier
should be compatible with bitumen to achieve the required properties.
5.2
.
Proprietary products may contain a blend of different polymer additives to
achieve improvement in properties of bitumen for road works.

IRC:SP:53-2010
6 APPLICATIONS OF MODIFIED BITUMEN
6.1
Since a bituminous mix prepared with modified bitumen has a higher stiffness
modulus, enhanced fatigue
life, better resistance to creep and higher indirect tensile
strength,
it
is suitable as a wearing course, a binder course and overlay material on
surfaces which are cracked and subjected to heavy traffic. Modified binders are also
used
for application
like Stress Absorbing Membrane (SAM)
for sealing
of cracks,
Stress Absorbing Membrane Interlayer (SAMI) for delaying reflection cracking, Porous
Asphalt and Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA).
6.2
Modified bitumen performs better than conventional bitumen
in situations,
where the aggregates are prone
to
stripping. Due
to
their better creep resistance
properties, they can also be used at busy intersections, bridge decks and roundabouts
for increased
life of the surfacing.
7 MANUFACTURING
7.1
The manufacturer shall establish, document and maintain a quality system
to ensure that the products supplied conform to the specifications. The quality system
shall consist of procedures, regular inspections and tests and/ or assessment and the
use of results to control the quality of the finished product. All the equipment used
in
the manufacturing process
shall be
regularly inspected,
calibrated and maintained
to ensure that normal wear and tear or failure does not cause inconsistency
in the
manufacturing process.
7.2
Bitumen used for modification will fully comply with IS 73 Indian Standard
Specification for paving bitumen. The acceptance criteria for modifiers such as polymer,
natural
rubber, crumb rubber and additives
shall be documented
for ensuring their
conformity with the specifications.
The processes used to manufacture modified bitumen are generally proprietary and
different processes are used by various suppliers.
If a modifier in powder form
is used, the blending plant should be fitted with a homogenizer
like high shear mill or any other device capable of producing a homogeneous blend. The
addition
of modifier
in
latex form
requires
special blending equipment to eliminate the
entrapment of moisture which can result in excessive foaming during the blending process.
The modifier into the bitumen should be cured/ digested at an appropriate temperature in a
curing tank fitted with heating arrangement, agitator and circulation facility for an optimum
5



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 36
======================================================================
IRC SP 53^2010
time period to attain the desirable properties of the modified bitumen
Full fledged testing
facility is essentially required at the blending plant The storage tanks should have minimal
surface area to minimize oxidation and equipped with mixing and circulation equipment to
ensure the homogeneity of the product during storage. While modified binders are generally
manufactured
for immediate delivery, any extended storage must be documented and
monitored to ensure that product conforms to the specification characteristics.
7.3
All supply lines throughout the plant, including loading equipment, shall be
designed and procedures established so as to avoid contamination during change of
product or cleaning of supply lines Where lines need to be flushed,
it should be done
with hot bitumen or finished product.
7.4
The manufacturer shall establish procedures to ensure that conformance
to the specified
characteristics are maintained. Where testing
is required on each
batch, a batch
is considered to be the quantity of binder produced and stored
in one
tank once the production run
into that tank has been completed. The batch can be
considered to remain the same as long as no new production has been added.
8 SPECIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR MODIFIED BITUMEN
8.1
The requirements of modified bitumen are given
in Table 2.
8.2
For snow bound area, Fraass breaking point values of modified bitumen will
be taken
into account. The value of Fraass breaking point shall be less than 7 days
minimum atmospheric temperature of the area or as indicated
in Table 2.
8.3
For checking the elastic recovery of modified binder,
Field Engineer shall
test for Torsion recovery at 25°C using Torsion recovery method as per Annexure - 4.
The Torsional recovery value shall not be less than half of the Elastic recovery value
at 15°C as indicated
in the laboratory testing.

avoided.
Incase
bitumen viscosity at delivery is not adequate for pumping, bitumen shall be gradually
heated to bring
it to an appropriate temperature for pumping. The rate of heating shall
be such that the increase
in temperature of modified bitumen does not exceed 15°C
per hour. Where there
is only a small loss
in temperature, modified bitumen may be
transferred directly into storage tanks without reheating.
9.4
Storage tanks for modified bitumen must be properly insulated, have heating
and agitating/effective circulation facilities to ensure homogeneity. For circulation the
inlet should be close to bottom
at one end
of storage tank and outlet near the top
at another end of the storage tank to ensure effective circulation. Return
lines
in a
recirculation system should re-enter the storage tank below the bitumen surface to
prevent hot bitumen cascading through the air.
Where modified bitumen is placed in a storage tank previously used for straight bitumen
or a different grade of modified bitumen, the tank shall be emptied to the minimum
practicable level
in order to minimize any dilution effect on the modifier content of the
delivered modified bitumen.
9.5
Storage Temperature and Time
9.5.1
The binder shall be stored at minimum pumping temperature and not at the
application temperature. The binder shall only be heated to the application temperature
just prior to use to limit degradation of modifier. The binder should not be allowed to
solidify in the storage tank.
Obtain a method statement from the supplier as the correct handling and storage
temperature for the modified bitumen.

supplier must conduct the necessary
tests on
the
product
to
ensure that
it meets the specification requirements before dispatching
the product.
ii)
Samples should be taken from the tanker while discharging the product
on-site and retained for further testing
in the case of a dispute.
The
sample size should not the less than
1
kg.
iii)
The retention samples for each batch should be kept
in the custody
of the engineer
till the completion of the project or as specified
in the
contract
iv)
The
supplier should
supply
a
laboratory
certificate
for each
batch
stating the binder properties. This should include the indicative tests
like softening point, penetration, viscosity, elastic recovery and phase
separation.
The tests for complex modulus shall be provided for the
batch specified by the engineer.
v)
Samples should be taken from the site storage tank on a daily basis
and
tested
prior
to application and
tested
for penetration,
softening
point, viscosity storage stability and torsional recovery
vi)
Product
not
applied
can
be
returned
to
storage
and
retested
for
compliance
prior to further use
All samples must be clearly labeled
with
all relevant details for ease of identification and traceability.
vii)
It
is recommended
that
correlation
testing
be done
between
the
laboratories or supplier and user before commencement of the binder
supply to identify any variations
in test results
11

viii)
Prior to the commencement of a contract, the
full spectrum of tests
should be conducted on the first batch of the product to demonstrate
the supplier's
ability to comply with the specification. Thereafter, the
respective tests are to be conducted at an agreed frequency unless
there is a change in the source of raw material (base bitumen or polymer
grade). The supplier must also provide a set of curves showing the
changes in the softening point and viscosity properties with time for the

METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF COMPLEX MODULUS
Scope
This method covers the determination of complex modulus (G*), Phase angle (Sin 8)
and G7Sin 6 of modified bituminous binders. This standard
is appropriate for unaged
material and material aged in thin film oven or rolling thin film oven. A particulates material
in binder is limited to particles with longest dimensions less than 300 micrometer.
Significance and Use
The test temperature for this test
is related
to the temperature experienced by the
pavement in the geographical area for which the use of binder is intended. The shear
modulus
is an indicator of stiffness or resistance of binder to deformation under load
at specified temperature. The complex (G*) modulus and phase angle (Sin 5) define
the resistance to deformation of the binder
in the visco-elastic region. The complex
modulus and phase angle
are used
to evaluate performance aspect
of modified
bitumen, where elastic 'recovery
is insignificant.
Summary of Test Method
This standard contains the procedure used
to measure the complex modulus
(G*),
phase angle (sin 6) and shear modulus (G*/ Sin 8) of binders using a Dynamic Shear
Rheometer (DSR) and parallel plate test geometry. The standard
is suitable for use
when the complex modulus (G*) varies between 100 Pa and 10 Mpa. The range of
test temperature
lies
in between 35°C and 85°C depending upon grade, type and
conditioning of the test sample. Test specimen of 1mm thick, 25 mm diameter or 2
mm thick and 8 mm diameter as prepared between parallel metal plates. During the
testing, one of the parallel plates is oscillated with respect to the other at pre-selected
frequency and
rotational deformation amplitudes. The required amplitudes depend
upon the values
of complex shear modulus
of binders being
tested. The required
amplitudes depend upon the values of complex shear modulus of binders being tested.
The test specimen
is maintained at the test temperature within ± 0.1 CC by heating and
cooling of upper and lower plates. The recommended frequency of testing
is
1 0 rad/s.
The complex modulus
(G*) and phase angle (Sin
S) are calculated as apart of the
operation of the rheometer using software available with the equipment.

i)
Calibrated
Temperature
Detector - A
calibrated
thermocouple,
thermistor, or Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD) with a thickness
or diameter < 2.0 mm
is suitable for measuring the temperature of a
dummy specimen sample of binder. Thermocouples and thermistors
are not reliable to ± 0.1°C unless calibrated
to a standard traceable
to the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) and must
be calibrated with associated meters or circuitry. Platinum RTDs are
typically
not suitable because they are too
large
to
fit
in the gaps
between the plates in the DSR.
Preparation of Test Specimen
A disk of binder with diameter equal to the oscillating plate (often called a spindle) of
the DSR
is needed for testing. There are two ways to prepare the sample for testing
(1) Bitumen binder can be poured
directly onto the spindle
in
sufficient quantity to
provide the appropriate thickness of material, or (2) a mould can be used to form the
disk of material to be tested. Then the disk can be place between the spindle and fixed
plate of DSR.
In the first method, operator should have sufficient experience to apply
exact quantity of binder.
In the second method, binder is heated until fluid to pour. The
heated binder is poured in to a rubber mould and allowed to cool. The mould consisting
of binder may be placed
in a refrigerator
until
it attains solid consistency. Then the
sample is removed from the mould and placed between the fixed plate and oscillating
spindle of the DSR. The excess binder beyond the edge of the spindle should be
trimmed. Regardless of the method used for preparation of the specimen, the
final
step in preparing the specimen
is to slightly readjust the gap between the spindle and
the lower plate so that a slight bulge is evident near the edge of the spindle. The step is
normally occurring immediately prior to the testing. The thickness of the bitumen binder
disk sandwiched between the spindle and fixed
plate must be carefully controlled.
The proper specimen thickness
is achieved by adjusting the gap between the spindle
and fixed
plate. This gap must be set before mounting the binder sample, but while
spindle and base plate are mounted in the rheometer at the test temperature, the gap
is adjusted by means of a micrometer wheel. The micrometer wheel
is graduated
usually in units of micron. Turning the wheel allows precise positioning the spindle and
base plate related to each other. On some rheometer, the micrometer wheel moves
the spindle down. On other,
it moves the base plate up. Thickness of the gap depends
15



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 36
======================================================================
IRC:SP:53-2010
on the test temperature. High
test temperature of 46°C
or greater require a small
gap of
1 mm, High temperature measurement requires a large spindle (25 mm) and
low temperature a small spindle (8 mm). With the specimen mounted, the operator
shall set the gap at the desired value of
1 ,000 or 2,000 micron. After the specimen
is
trimmed flush with upper plate, the extra 50-micron
is dialed so that gap
is exactly at
the desired value and specimen bulges slightly.
Test Procedure
Bring the specimen to the test temperature ± 0.1 °C. After the sample
is correctly
in
place and
test temperature appear stable then allow the specimen
for 10 minutes
minimum at the set temperature of the specimen to equilibrate. The actual temperature
equilibration time
is equipment dependent and should be checked using a dummy
specimen with very accurate temperature sensing capabilities.
When operating
in a
strain
control mode,
testing
consists
of using the rheometer
software to select appropriate strain value as under:

TFOT residue

0.18-0.26
Testing
consists
of using rheometer software
to
set the DSR
to apply a constant
oscillating stress and recording the
resulting
strain and time
lag. The specification
requires oscillation speed to 10 rad/s, which
is approximately 1.59 hz. A computer
is
used with DSR to control test parameter and record test results. The operator need
not worry about setting the value of applied stress.
Instead, the operator should set
the approximate value of shear strain. Shear strain values vary from 1-12 percent
and depend on the stiffness of the binder being used. Relatively soft materials tested
at high temperature are tested at strain values of approximately 10-12 percent. Hard
materials are tested at strain value of about
1
percent.
In the
initial stage of the test,
rheometer measures the stress
required
to achieve the set shear strain and then
maintain
this stress very precisely during the
test. The shear strain can vary small
amounts from the set value to achieve the constant stress. Variation
in shear strain
is
normally controlled by rheometer software.
In the beginning of the test, the sample
is

first conditioned by
loading the specimen for 10 cycles and then 10 additional cycles
are applied to obtain test data. The rheometer software automatically computes and
reports values of complex modulus (G*) and phase angle (Sin 8).
Interpretation of Results and Data Presentation
The complex modulus (G*) and phase angle (Sin 5) decrease with increasing shear
strain. A linear region may be defined as small region where the modulus
is relatively
independent of shear strain. This region will vary with magnitude of complex modulus.
The
linear
region
is
defined
as
range
in
strains where
the complex modulus
is
95 percent or more of the zero strain value. The shear stress varies nearly from 0 at
the centre of the plates to a maximum at the extremities of the plate perimeter. The
shear stress
is calculated from the applied or measured torque, measured or applied
strain and the geometry of the test specimen. For the present specification only, values
of G* and Sin 8 are required. A complete report includes following parameters:
a)
G* to the nearest three significant figures,
b)
Sin
8 to the nearest 0.1 degrees,
c)
Test plate size to nearest 0.1 mm and gap to nearest
1 \im,
d)
Test temperature to the nearest 0. 1 °C,
e)
Test frequency to the nearest 0.1
rad/s, and
f)
Strain amplitude to the nearest 0.01 percent.
The test temperature as per requirement of specification for complex modulus value of
1kPa (G7Sin 8) for original binder and 2.2 kPa (G*/Sin 8) for residue of thin film over
test shall be calculated from the plot of (GVSin 5) and temperature for compliance of
specification.

METHOD FOR SEPARATION TEST
Scope
The separation of modifier and bitumen during hot storage is often seen and this can
be evaluated by comparing the
ring and
ball softening point of the top and bottom
portion samples taken from a conditioned, polymer or rubber modified bitumen
in a
sealed tubes of modified bitumen
in a vertical position at 163 ± 5°C
in an oven for a
period of 48 hours.
Apparatus
Aluminum Tubes: 25.4 mm in diameter and 136.7 mm long blind aluminum tubes.
Oven: Capable of maintaining 163 ± 5°C
Freezer:
Capable of maintaining 6.7 ± 5°C
Rack: Capable of supporting the aluminum tubes in a vertical position in the oven and
freezer.
Spatula and Hammer: The spatula must be rigid and sharp to allow cutting of the tube
containing the sample when at a low temperature.
Procedure
Place the empty tube, with sealed end down
in the rack. Heat the sample carefully
until sufficiently fluid to pour. Care should be taken to prevent localized over-heating.
Pass the molten sample through IS sieve 600 micron mess size. After through stirring,
pour 50.0 g
into the vertically held tube. Fold the excess tube over two times, and
crimp and seal. Place the rack containing the sealed tubes
in a oven maintained at
a temperature of 163 ± 5°C
Allow the tubes to stand undisturbed
in the oven for a
period of 48 ± 4 hour. At the end of the period, remove the rack from the oven and
place immediately in the freezer at 6.7 ± 5°C, taking care to keep the tubes in a vertical
position at all times. Leave the tubes in the freezer for a minimum of 4 hours to solidify
the sample completely. Upon removing the tube from the freezer, place

flat
surface. Cut the tube into three equal length portions with the knife. Discard the central
portion of sample, and place the top and bottom portions of the tube into separate

beakers. Place the beaker into a 163 ± 5°C oven until the bitumen
is sufficiently fluid
to remove the pieces of aluminum tube. After thoroughly
stirring, pour the top and
bottom samples into appropriately marked rings for the ring and
ball softening point
test. Prepare the rings and ball apparatus according to Test Method IS 1205. The top
and bottom samples from the same tube should be tested at the same time.

Report the difference,
in °C, between the softening points of the respective top and
bottom samples as average of three specimens.

TORSION RECOVERY OF MODIFIED BINDERS
1.
Scope
This test method sets out the procedure for the determination of torsional recovery of
polymer modified binders using a sample bolt and cup assembly.
2.
Definition
A simple means of determining the elastic properties of a polymer-modified binder
is
to measure its Torsional recovery.
3.
Apparatus
3.1
A cylindrical headed aluminium bolt assembly, as illustrated in Figure 2 with
a total mass of 45 ± 5 g. The bolt has a cylindrical head with a diameter of 28.6 mm
and a thickness of 9.52 mm. The threaded shank of the bolt is 44.5 mm long A metal
"spider", with three radial pins and two nuts, can be used to centre the assembly. A
pointer is required for angle measurements in the absence of the spider. See Fig
1 for
details of this assembly and the optional components.

3.2
A sample tin, cylindrical, flat bottomed and 55 mm in diameter.
3.3
An angle-measuring device and sample clamp assembly, or an alternative
means of clamping the sample/bolt assembly and determining the initial and recovered
angle. The recommended device provides a scale, of 80 mm radius and graduated
in degrees around at least half its circumference and a clamp capable of holding the
sample cup within 3 mm of
its centre and without deforming the cup by more than
3 mm
in any direction.
3.4
A water bath capable of operating at 25°C ± 0.5°C, fitted with an appropriate
thermometer.
3.5
A drying oven, thermostatically
controlled and capable of maintaining a
temperature of 60°C to 200°C, with a set point accuracy of ± 5°C.
3.6
A stop watch
3.7
A spanner to suit the bolt assembly
4.
Method
The torsional recovery apparatus operates by manually rotating an aluminium
bolt,
previously embedded
in a cup of modified binder, through an angle of 180 degrees
and measuring
the
extent
of recovery
of the
original
applied
rotation. The
initial
180-degree twist
is applied with a spanner over a 10 second period. The recovery
after 30 seconds is reported.
4.1
Prepare the sample as described in Method MB-2. Assemble the bolt; spider
and nuts to position the surface of the bolt head 8 ± 2 mm below the top of the sample
cup. Preheat the assembly and cup to
1 80°C and pour the modified binder into the tin
assembly,
until
it begins to form meniscus on the top surface of the bolt.
4.2
Testing
Allow the assembly to cool for one hour by leaving
it to stand at room temperature
(25° ± 3°C). Adjust the assembly height to keep the top surface of the bolt flush with the
sample surface. Place the assembly into the 25°C water bath and allow
it to stabilize
for one hour (see Note 6.1) Adjust the spider to a position 7 ± 2 mm above the rim
and return the assembly to the bath. Place the sample assembly on the base-plate
and
fit the pointer to the 180-degree position without disturbing the sample. Using the
spanner, turn the
bolt moving the pointer from the 180-degree position
to the zero

position using a steady motion for 10 seconds. Release the bolt when the pointer
reaches the zero position and commence timing (See Note 6.3). Record the recovered
angle after 30 seconds as 'A'.
5.
Calculation
The torsional recovery is given by the following equation:
Torsional recovery, % = Ax 100
180
Where A = Recovered angle
in degrees. When the scale presented
in Figure 3
is
used, the torsional recovery is read directly.
6.
Notes
6.1 The
test should be conducted
in an
air-conditioned
laboratory
at 25 ±
3°C.
Alternatively, the test can be conducted within the water bath.
6.2
The rate at which the torque is applied to the sample is critical for reproducible
results. The objective is to apply 180 degrees of rotation in 10 seconds. Fig. 3 presents a
practical scale marked from zero (0 degree) to 10 (180 degrees) to help with this task.

6.3
The spider assembly should not come into contact with the rim of the cup at
any time during the recovery phase.
6.4
The following precautions should be taken when handling all bitumens:
a)
Eye protection, such as safety glasses and/or face shields,
shall be
worn when handling hot bitumen.
b)
Heat resistant gloves, with close fitting cuffs and other suitable protective
clothing shall be worn when handling hot bitumen.
c)
There shall be no smoking while handling hot bitumen.
d)
While the material
is
still cold, loosen the
lid of the sample container
(invert the can and warm the
lid,
if necessary), or punch a hole in the
lid.
