GUIDELINES FOR DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF CEMENT CONCRETE
PAVEMENTS FOR LOW VOLUME ROADS
1 INTRODUCTION
IRC:SP:62 "Guidelines for the Design and Construction of Cement Concrete Pavement for
Rural Roads" was published by Indian Roads Congress (IRC) in 2004. These guidelines served
the profession well for about a decade. However, advancement in design and construction of
the Rigid Pavement, H-3 Committee realised the necessity to revise existing guidelines.
Accordingly,
the
Rigid Pavement Committee
(H-3)
constituted
a
sub-group
comprising
Dr.
B.B. Pandey S/Shri R.K.
Jain, Satander Kumar, M.C. Venkatesh and PL. Bongirwar
for revision of IRC:SP:62. The Sub-group prepared
initial
draft and thereafter, same was
discussed and deliberated
in number of committee meetings. The H-3 Committee
finally
approved the revised draft guidelines in
its meeting held on 8'^ June, 2013 for placing before
the HSS Committee. The Highways Specifications and Standards Committee (HSS) approved
this document in
its meeting held on
19*'' July, 2013. The Executive Committee in
its meeting
held on
31^' July, 2013 approved the same document for placing before the Council. The
Council
in
its meeting held
at New Delhi on
11'" &
12''^ August, 2013 approved the draft
"Guidelines for the Design and Construction of Cement Concrete Pavements for Low Volume
Roads" for publishing.

1.1
A
large
proportion
of
India's
villages
have been
connected
with
all-weather
roads due
to the
efforts made by
National
Rural Road Development Agency (NRRDA),
Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India. Rural roads usually have low volume
of traffic, consisting mostly of light transport vehicles,
like agricultural tractors/trailers,
light
goods vehicles, buses, animal drawn vehicles, auto-rickshaws, motor cycles and bi-cycles.
Some of the rural roads may also have light and medium trucks carrying sugarcane, quarry
materials, etc. The most common composition of such roads is granular layer with or without
thin bituminous surfacing. Another feature common to such roads
is that their maintenance
is neglected because of paucity of funds and poor institutional set-up, and the road asset
created at a great cost is lost. The selection of pavement types for such roads should consider
these factors.
1.2
Concrete pavements have been constructed on many rural roads under PMGSY
programme. They are also being widely used on minor roads of cities carrying low volume of
traffic because of their durability even under poor drainage conditions. Concrete pavements
offer an
alternative
to flexible pavements especially where the
soil strength
is
poor, the
aggregates are
costly and drainage
conditions
are
bad. The choice
of pavement type
depends on these factors and the life-cycle cost. Concrete pavements can be (i) conventional
screed-compacted concrete
(ii) Roller Compacted Concrete
(iii) Interlocking Concrete Block
Pavements (ICBP) and
(iv) concrete pavements with panel size 0.5 m x 0.5 m to 1.2 m x
1.2 m and depths ranging from 50 mm to 200 mm similar to Thin White Topping as per
IRC:SP:76 in which the upper one third has a discontinuity created by sawing or by inserting
three to five millimeter thick polyethylene strips which are left in the concrete. Self-Compacting
Concrete (SCC) as per Appendix Hi can also be used since
it is easy to pour and requires
very little compaction.
It has successfully been used in Maharashtra in different trials sections
of rural roads.
1.3
Rural roads connecting major roads are sometimes required to carry construction
or diverted
traffic which may damage the concrete
slabs. Some roads connect several
villages and they are constructed
in stages spread over several years and have to carry
heavy construction
traffic. Such factors may be considered while arriving
at thickness of
pavements.
1.4
It should be recognized
that concrete pavements demand
a
high degree
of
professional expertise at the stages of design, construction and maintenance. The institutional
set-up
should
be
suitably
strengthened
to meet
the
required
parameters
of concrete
pavements in remote places.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:62-2014
2 SCOPE
IRC:58 deals with design of concrete pavements for major roads carrying an average daily
traffic exceeding 450 Commercial Vehicles Per Day (CVPD) with laden weight exceeding
30 kN. The guidelines contained
in this document are applicable only to low volume roads
with average daily
traffic less than 450 Commercial Vehicles Per Day. The basic design
concepts of IRC:58 may be relevant for arriving at pavement thickness
in some cases as
mentioned
in Clause 1.3. This document covers the design principles of rigid pavements of
low volume roads 3.75 m wide (minimum 3 m wide in hills) made up of conventional concrete,
roller compacted concrete and self-compacting concrete. Transverse joints spacing ranging
from 2.50 m to 4.00 m may be selected.
3 FACTORS GOVERNING DESIGN
3.1
Wheel Load
Heavy vehicles are not expected frequently on rural roads. The maximum legal load limit on
single axle with dual wheels
in India being 100 kN, the recommended design load on dual
wheel
is 50 kN having a spacing of the wheels as 310 mm centre-to-centre. Agricultural
tractors and trailers also are being used to carry construction material and the single wheel
load may rarely approach 50 kN.
3.2
Tyre Pressure
The tyre pressure may be taken as 0.8 MPa for a truck carrying a dual wheel load of 50 kN
while for a wheel of tractor trailer; the pressure may be taken as 0.5 MPa. The effect of tyre
pressure on the wheel load stresses for practical thickness of pavement is not significant.
3.3
Design Period
Concrete pavements designed and
constructed as
per the guidelines contained
in
this
document will have a design
life of 20 years or higher, as evidenced from the performance
of roads constructed
in the past
in the country. The design methodology given
in these
guidelines
is based on wheel load stresses. The repetitions of axle loads, curling stresses
and the consumption of fatigue for different axle loads, which form the basis of design
in
IRC:58, need not be considered for low volume
traffic except
in special situations where
heavy truck traffic is anticipated.
3.4
Design Traffic for Thickness Evaluation
For traffic less than 50 CVPD, only wheel load stresses for a load of 50 kN on dual wheel
need be considered for thickness estimation since there
is a low probability of maximum
wheel load and highest temperature differential between the top and the bottom of the rigid
pavement occurring at the same time. For traffic higher than 50 and less than 150 CVPD,
thickness evaluation should be done on the basis of total stresses resulting from wheel load
of 50 kN and temperature differential. For traffic exceeding 150 CVPD, fatigue can be a real
problem and the guidelines consider thickness evaluation on the basis of fatigue fracture
3



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:SP:62-2014
considering a reliability of 60 percent against a reliability of 90 percent adopted for IRC:58.
40 percent of the pavement slabs are expected to crack at the end of the design period
against 10 percent cracking considered for high volume roads. For the fatigue analysis of a
concrete pavement the cumulative number of commercial traffic at the end of design period
can be estimated from the following formula.
N =
where,
^(l + r)"-l^
J
X 365
... 3.1
A
r
n
N
=
Initial CVPD after the completion of the road
=
rate of traffic increase in decimal (for 5 percent rate of increase in traffic,
r = 0.05)
=
design period in years (recommended as 20 years)
=
total number of cumulative commercial vehicles at the end of the design
period
An estimation of gross weight of vehicle and axle load can be made from the knowledge
of goods that the vehicles
carry. Approximate number of commercial vehicles having an
axle load of about 100 kN as a percentage of total number of commercial vehicles may be
estimated from the traffic survey. For A > 150 CVPD, a default value of ten percent of the
values obtained from Equation
3.1 may be considered for cumulative fatigue analysis as
illustrated
later.
In case the road
is expected to carry a large volume of very heavy trucks
on a regular basis, spectrum of axle loads may have to be considered to avoid damage to
pavements and design concept of IRC:58 may be used.
3.5
Characteristics of the Subgrade
The strength of subgrade
is expressed
in terms of modulus of subgrade reaction,
k, which
is determined by carrying out a plate bearing test, using 750 mm diameter plate according
to 18:9214-1974.
In case of homogeneous foundation, test values obtained with a plate of
300 mm
diameter,
k
may be converted
to
give
k
determined
using
the standard
750 mm dia. plate by the following correlation:
3.2
Since, the subgrade strength
is affected by the moisture content,
it is desirable to determine
it soon after the monsoon. Stresses in a concrete pavement are not very sensitive to minor
variation in k values and hence
its value for a homogeneous soil subgrade may be obtained
from
its soaked CBR value using Table 3.1.
It can also be estimated from Dynamic Cone
Penetrometer also as described in IRC:58.

3.6
Sub-Base
3.6.1
A good quality compacted foundation layer provided below a concrete pavement
is commonly termed as subbase.
It must be of good
quality so as not to undergo large
settlement under repeated wheel
load
to prevent cracking
of slabs. The
provision
of a
sub-base below the concrete pavement has many advantages such as:
i)
It provides a uniform and reasonably firm support
ii)
It supports the construction traffic even
if the subgrade is wet
iii)
It prevents mud-pumping of subgrade of clays and silts
iv)
It acts as a leveling course on distorted, non-uniform and undulating sub-
grade
v)
It acts as a capillary cut-off
3.6.2
Sub-base types
3.6.2.1
Traffic up to 50 CVPD
75 mm
thick compacted Water Bound Macadam Grade
III (WBM
lll)/Wet Mix Macadam
(WMM) may be provided over
1 00 mm granular subbase made up of gravel, murrum or river
bed material with CBR not less than 30 percent, liquid limit less than 25 percent and Plasticity
Index less (PI) less than 6.
If aggregates are not available within a reasonable cost, 150 mm
of cement/lime/lime-flyash treated marginal aggregate/soil layer with minimum Unconfined
Strength (UCS) of 3 MPa at 7 days with cement or at 28 days with lime/lime-flyash may
be used. The stabilized
soil should not erode as determined from wetting and drying test
(IRC:SP:89).
3.6.2.2
Traffic from 50 to 150 CVPD
75 mm thick WBM lll/WMM layer over 1 00 mm of granular material may be used as a subbase.
Alternatively, 100 mm thick cementitious granular layer with a minimum unconfined strength
(UCS) of 3 MPa at 7days with cement or 28 days with lime/lime-flyash over 100 mm thick
cementitious naturally available materials with a minimum UCS of 1.5 MPa with cement at
7 days or with lime or lime-flyash at 28 days may be provided.
3.6.2.3
Traffic from 150 to 450 CVPD
150 mm thick WBM lll/WMM over 100 mm of granular subbase may also be used. Alternately,
100 mm of cementitious granular layer with a minimum UCS of 3.0 MPa at 7 days with
cement or at 28 days with lime or lime-flyash over
1 00 mm of cementious layer with naturally
occurring material with a minimum UCS of 1.5 MPa at 7 days with cement or at 28 days
with
lime or lime-flyash. Cementitious marginal aggregates may be much cheaper than
WBM/WMM
in many regions having acute scarcity of aggregates.
The
granular
subbase
and WBM
layers
should
meet
the
requirement
of MORD
Specifications, Section 400(34). Quality of subbases varies from region to region and past
5



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:62-2014
experience on performance of concrete pavements in different regions
is tlie best guide for
the selection of the most appropriate subbases.
3.6.2.4
Commercially available IRC accredited stabilizers with no harmful leachate also
may be used
if found successful on trials.
3.6.3
Effective
modulus
of subgrade
reaction
over
granular and cement
treated
subbases
For the granular subbases, the effective k value may be taken as 20 percent more than the
k value of the sub-grade shown
in Table 3.1. For the cementitious subbases, the effective
k value may be taken as twice that of the subgrade. Recommendations for estimated of
effective modulus of subgrade reaction over granular or cemented subbase are given
in
Table 3.2. Reduction in stresses in the pavement slab due to higher subgrade CBR is marginal
since only fourth root of k matters in stress computation but the loss of support due to erosion
of the poor quality foundation below the pavement slab under wet condition may damage the
it seriously. The GSB layer with fines passing 75 micron sieve less than 2 percent can act
as a good drainage layer and addition of 2 percent cement by weight of total aggregate will
make
it non-erodible. Most low volume roads with concrete pavements in built up area having
WBM over GSB have performed well even under adverse drainage conditions.

It should be ensured that embankment, the subgrade and the subbase shall be well compacted
as per MORD specifications (34) otherwise heavy wheel loads may displace the subbase
under adverse moisture condion leading to cracking of the unsupported concrete slab.
3.7
Concrete Strength
Since concrete pavements
fail due to bending stresses,
it
is necessary that their design
is
based on the flexural strength of concrete. Where there are no facilities for determining the
flexural strength, the mix design may be carried out using the compressive strength values
and the following relationship:
f, = 0.7t,
...3.3
where,
ff
=
flexural strength, MPa
f
=
characteristic compressive cube strength, MPa
6



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:62-2014
For Low volume roads,
it
is suggested that the 90 day strength may be used for design
since concrete keeps on gaining strength with time. The 90 day flexural strength may be
taken as 1.10 times the 28 day flexural strength or as determined from laboratory tests.
90 day compressive strength
is 20 percent higher than the 28 day compressive strength.
Heavy traffic may be allowed after 28 days.
The concrete mix should be so designed that the minimum flexural strength requirement in
the field is met at the desired confidence level. For rural roads, the tolerance level (accepted
proportion of low results), can be taken as 1 in 20. The normal variate, Z^, for this tolerance level
being
1 .65, the target average flexural strength is obtained from the following relationship:
S = S^+Za
...3.4
a
where,
S
=
target average flexural strength, at 28 days, MPa
=
characteristic flexural strength, at 28 days, MPa
Zg
=
normal variate, having a value of
1 .65, for a tolerance factor of 1
in 20
a
=
expected standard deviation of field test samples, MPa;
Table 3.3 gives the values of expected standard deviation of compressive strength.

Flexural strength can be derived from the Equation 3.3.
For pavement construction for rural roads,
it is recommended that the characteristic 28 day
compressive strength should be at least 30 MPa and corresponding flexural strength (third
point loading) shall not be less than 3.8 MPa.
3.8
Modulus of Elasticity and Poisson's Ratio
The
Modulus
of
Elasticity,
E,
of concrete
and
the
Poisson's
ratio may
be
taken
as
30,000 MPa and 0.15 respectively.
3.9
Coefficient of Thermal Expansion
The coefficient of thermal expansion of concrete, a, may be taken as:
a = 10 X 10-^ per °C.

Fatigue Behaviour of Concrete Pavement
For most rural roads, fatigue behavior is not important because of low volume of commercial
vehicles.
In case a
rural road forms a connecting
link between two important roads or
if
the road connects several villages, there can be significant amount of traffic consisting of
buses and trucks due to agriculture, construction and social activities, and fatigue behavior
of pavement slab may be considered
in such cases. Fatigue equations of IRC:58 cannot be
used because they are valid for 90 percent reliability. Following fatigue equation (MEPDG,
Appendix
III, IRC:58) for 60 percent reliability is recommended rural village roads.

Where
is fatigue
life of a pavement subjected to stresses caused by the combined effect
of wheel
load
of 50 kN and temperature gradient.
If the number of heavy vehicles are
large, fatigue analysis should be done for the spectrum axle load recommended
in IRC:58.
Influence of light commercial vehicles
is negligible. Occasional heavy loads may not affect
the pavements since the subgrade is weak only during certain period
in the monsoons/post
monsoon periods and only worst value of subgrade strength is considered in design. Concrete
also keeps on gaining strength with time.
SR = stress ratio defined as:
-
flexural stress due to wheel load and temperature
SR —
flexural strength
4 DESIGN OF SLAB THICKNESS
4.1
Critical Stress Condition
Concrete pavements are subjected to stresses due to a variety of factors and the conditions
which induce the highest stress
in the pavement should be considered for analysis. The
factors commonly
considered
for
design
of pavement
thickness
are
traffic
loads and
temperature gradients. The
effects
of moisture changes and shrinkage,
being generally
opposed to those of temperature and are of smaller magnitude, would ordinarily relieve the
temperature effects to some extent and are not normally considered
critical
to thickness
design.
For the purpose of analysis, two different regions
in a pavement slab edge and corner are
considered
critical for pavement design.
Effect of temperature gradient
is very less at the
corner, while
it is much higher at the edge. Concrete pavements undergo a daily cyclic change
of temperature differentials, the top being hotter than the bottom during the day and opposite
is the case during the night. The consequent tendency of the pavement slabs to curl upwards
(top convex) during the day and downwards (top concave) during the
night, and
restraint
offered
to the curling by self-weight of the pavement induces stresses
in the pavement,
referred to commonly as curling stresses. These stresses are flexural in nature, being tensile,
at bottom during the day, (Fig. 4.1) and at top during night (Fig. 4.2). As the restraint offered
8



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 64
======================================================================
V
IRC:SP:62-2014
to curling at any section of the slab would be a function of weight of the slab,
it is obvious that
corners have very
little of such restraint. Consequently the temperature stresses induced in
the pavement are negligible in the corner region.
The corner tends to bend like a cantilever; giving rise to tension at the top while the tension
is at bottom in case for edge loading. Deflections due to wheel loads are larger at the corner
causing displacement of weaker subgrade resulting in loss of support under repeated loading
and consequent corner breaking. A shorter transverse joint spacing imparts safety to a panel
due to load sharing by the adjacent slabs because of better load transfer across the transverse
joints since dowel bars are not recommended in low volume roads except near a permanent
structure.
Wheel load stresses for interior loading are lower than those due the edge and corner loading.
For low volume roads carrying a low volume of traffic, heavy vehicles are not frequent and
the chance that highest axle load
will act when the temperature gradient also
is highest
is
likely to be of rare occurrence. The maximum tensile stresses in the edge region of the slab
will be caused by simultaneous occurrence of wheel loads and temperature differentials. This
would occur during the day at the bottom in case of interior and edge regions.

The Equations 4.1 and 4.2 are valid only for circular area. Equation 4.3 can be used for the
evaluation of in-place k value of the subgrade using FWD at the edge.
When a load
is applied by a dual wheel, Equations 4.1 and 4.2 can be used for the stress
computation due to dual wheel by computing the radius of the equivalent circular area as
shown below.
The contact areas of two wheels and the area in-between the two contact areas shown
in
Fig. 4.4 are obtained and the radius of the equivalent circular
is then computed as given
below.

For a given length and a width of a pavement slab, the C value is computed in the excel sheet
attached with the guidelines through regression equations from the relation between
I// or
b// and C determined from Bradbury's curve where 7' is value of radius of relative stiffness of
the slab and the foundation.
The temperature gradient across the depth
is
usually non-linear and the maximum day
temperature difference between the surface and the mid depth
is
nearly double
of that
between the mid depth and the bottom of the slab. This causes reduction
in temperature
stresses at the bottom as explained in the Appendix
II.

4.3
Pavement Design
A programed excel sheet
is provided
for quick computation
of thickness of pavements.
Minimum pavement slab thickness shall be taken as 150 mm. Three cases are considered in
the excel sheets for pavement design.
Case 1
Stresses due to 50 kN dual wheel load only for traffic less than 50 CVPD. Most of the low
volume roads are likely to fall in this category
Case 2
Combined stresses due to 50 kN dual wheel load and temperature gradient for traffic greater
than 50 and less than 150 CVPD
Case 3
Fatigue analysis for stresses due to 50 kN dual wheel load and temperature for traffic greater
than 150 CVPD and less than 450 CVPD. Very few low volume roads may come under this
category.
4.4
Reinforcement
Plain concrete jointed slabs for rural roads do not require reinforcement.
4.5
Recommended Design Procedure (Refer Illustrative Example Appendix
I)
1)
Select design wheel load (recommended as dual 50 kN), concrete flexural
strength,
effective modulus of subgrade reaction, modulus of elasticity of
concrete, Poisson's
ratio, coefficient of thermal expansion of concrete and
zone and input them in the excel spread sheet.
2)
Select a tentative design thickness of slab, k value, joint spacing and flexural
strength of concrete.
3)
If the total traffic is less than 50 CVPD for Case 1
, only wheel load stresses are
computed at the edge for a dual wheel loaded of 50 kN with a tyre pressure
of0.80MPa.
4)
If the computed edge stress
is less than the 90 day modulus of rupture, the
design
is safe.
5)
If
the
traffic
is
greater
than
50 CVPD
and
less
than
150 CVPD
for
Case 2, maximum edge stress
is computed by adding wheel load stresses
and curling stresses. Equation 4.7 gives the curling stresses in which
't', the
linear part of the temperature gradient, is 0.667 of the temperature differential
given
in Table
4.1. The compressive stress due
to
bi-linear temperature
variation as explained in Appendix
II is subtracted from that due to the linear
part to get the actual curling stress due to non-linear temperature gradient.
13



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:62-2014
6)
If the
tota!
of wheel
load
stress and the
curling
stress
is
less than the
90 day modulus of rupture, the design
is safe and acceptable. Excel sheet
does all the computations.
7)
If the
traffic
is more than 150 CVPD and less than 450 CVPD, fatigue of
concrete is considered for examination of the safety of the pavements. For a
computed total stress due to wheel load and temperature, stress ratio (SR) is
computed and the allowable load repetitions are obtained from the Equation
3.5. Assuming that only ten percent (default value) of the total traffic has axle
loads are equal to
1 00 kN, compute the number of repetitions of
1 00 kN axle
loads (dual wheel load = 50 kN) expected
in 20 years. Ratio of expected
repetition and allowable repetition
is the cumulative fatigue damage and
its
value should be less than
1
. The spread sheet gives all the computations and
various trials can be made instantly. Traffic survey
is very important when
volumes of vehicles are large.
If there are too many axle loads heavier than
100 kN, the fatigue damage
is to be computed for the axle load spectrum
using the fatigue Equation 3.5.
4.6
Pavement Thickness for Traffic up to 50 CVPD.
A sub-base of 75 mm WBM over 100 mm GSB is considered. The subgrade soil has a CBR
value of 4 Percent. The effective k value over WBM is taken as 42 MPa/m (35 + 20 percent of
35 MPa/m). Thickness values for a dual wheel load of 60 kN are 160 mm for
all the joint
spacing of 2.50 m, 3.25 m and 4.00 m since temperature stresses are not considered. For
other k values, excel sheet can be used to get the thickness. A minimum thickness of 1 50 mm
is recommended even for higher modulus of subgrade reaction.
4.7
Pavement Tliicl^ness for Traffic from 50 to 150 CVPD
Table 4.2 gives slab thickness for traffic from 50 to 150 CVPD. The thickness given
in the
table
is applicable to common subgrade soils, such as, clay,
silt and silty clay, with a CBR
value of 4 percent. A sub-base of 75 mm WBM over 1 00 mm GSB is considered. The effective
k value over WBM
is taken as 42 MPa/m (35 + 20 percent of 35 MPa/m). Thickness values
are indicated for joint spacing of 2.50 m, 3.25 m and 4.00 m.

Pavement Thickness for Traffic Greater than 150 CVPD
For traffic greater than 150 CVPD, fatigue also
is to be considered and the thicknesses are
shown
in Table 4.3 for M30 concrete for a traffic of 250 CVPD having a subgrade CBR of
8 percent.
It has a cementitious base with a total thickness of 200 mm. The effective k value for
design
is 100 MPa/m (Table 3.2). Fatigue cracking of pavement slab
is considered because
of heavy
traffic. Thicknesses for
all
six zones are given. Zone 3 has highest temperature
differential and hence
it gives the highest thickness because of higher curling stresses.

Roller Compacted Pavement
Roller Compacted Concrete Pavement (RCCP) as per MORD specifications (34) can also
be used for the construction of pavements for low volume roads. RCCP
is very popular for
low volume roads
in developed countries.
In such pavements, the cracks may develop on
its own to form joints.
It has been successfully used
in West Bengal also under PMGSY
programme. Assuming a thickness of RCCP as 200 mm, the spacing of the cracks to be 6 m,
an initial of traffic of 100 CVPD, a k value of 100 MPa/m
, Zone
I, 90 day modulus of rupture
= 4.22 MPa, the
total of wheel
load and
curling stress from excel sheet for a 200 mm
slab - 3.60 MPa < 4.22 MPa. The thickness of 200 mm is appropriate.
5 JOINTS
5.1
Types of Joints
Low volume roads have generally a single-lane carriageway with a lane width of 3.75 m
which
is concreted
in one operation.
In some cases, the width may be lower than 3.75 m
for narrow city streets and interior roads of villages. Thus, there is no need for a longitudinal
joint for single-lane rural roads except when the pavement width
is about 4.5 m
in case of
causeways.

IRC:SP:62-2014
Joints for low volume roads can be of four types as given below:
1)
Contraction joints
2)
Construction joints
3)
Expansion joints
4)
Longitudinal joints
5.2
Spacing of Joints
5.2.1
Contraction joints
These are transverse joints whose spacing may be kept as 2.50 m
- 4.00 m. The curling
stresses along the longitudinal
direction depend
to a great extent on the spacing of the
transverse joints.
If the joint spacing
is 2.5 m, curling stresses are practically negligible as
can be verified from the excel sheet of the guidelines. The contraction joints can be formed by
sawing the pavement slabs within twenty four hours of casting of concrete. Practice abroad
indicates that the narrow contraction joints 3 to 5 mm wide perform well with better riding
quality. High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) strips 3 mm to 5 mm thick with suitable tensioning
and intermediate support for keeping the strip in position can also be used for creating joints.
HDPE strips are
left in place. Metal strips and steel T-section are the other options for joint
forming. The joint depth can extend from one fourth to one third the depth of the concrete. The
details of the contraction joints are shown
in Figs. 5(a) to 5(o). Bituminous based sealants
as per IS1 834 can be used.

5.2.3
Longitudinal joints
Where the width of concrete slab exceeds 4.5 m as
in the case of causeways,
etc.,
it
is
necessary to provide a longitudinal joint as per the details shown in Fig. 5(b) in the mid-width
of the slab.
5.2.4
Expansion joints
Transverse expansion joints are necessary for the concrete slabs abutting the bridges and
culverts. The details of the joints are shown in Figs. 5(c), 5(d) and 5(i) .Two expansion joints
may be provided near a culvert or a minor bridge to take care of expansion of the concrete
slab as shown in Fig. 5(i).
5.3
Load Transfer at Transverse Joints
Since low volume roads have lower wheel loads, the slab thickness can be
in the range
from 150 to 250 mm. The aggregate interlock at the contraction joints with discontinuity up
to the one third/one fourth of the depth
is itself adequate for load transfer and no dowel bars
are necessary. Figs. 5(a) and 5(h) show a contraction joint filled with hot poured modified
bitumen.
If slabs are cast
in alternate panels, keyed joints can be formed as
in Fig. 5(e).
Day's work should normally be terminated at a construction joint
. At expansion joints, where
the joints width may be 20 mm, dowel bars are required as shown
in Fig.
5(f). Dowel bars
shall be 25 mm diameter, 450 mm long and spaced at 250 mm centre to centre. These shall
be made out of MS steel plain bars, Fe 240.
In the case of Roller Compacted Concrete Pavements, the contraction joints may be formed
by cutting joints concrete saw at the spacing of 8.0 m.
If aesthetics of the road
is not an
important consideration, the sawing ofjoints may be omitted and the joints will form themselves
by transverse cracking at regular intervals.
6 MATERIALS AND MIX DESIGN
6.1
Cement
Any of the following types of cement capable of attaining the design strength may be used.
i)
Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), 43 Grade, IS:8112
ii)
Portland Blast Furnace Slag Cement conforming to IS:455
iii)
Portland Pozzolana Cement (PPC) conforming to IS: 1489 and
iv)
Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), 53 grade (blended with flyash)
If the
soil has soluble
salts
like sulphates (SO3)
in excess of 0.5 percent of the
soil, the
cement used shall be sulphate resistant and shall conform to IS: 12330.
If the price of OPC,
43 grade and PPC is almost the same, preference may be given to PPC as
it will result in a
more durable concrete.
If fly ash of required quality
is available, a combination of OPC-43
and fly ash can be economical. OPC 53 grade
is to be used only when a part of cement
is
replaced by flyash.

6.3.7
Storage of materials
6.3.7.1
General
All materials shall be stored in proper places so as to prevent their deterioration or satisfactory
quality and fitness for the work. The storage space must also permit easy inspection, removal
and storage of materials. All such materials, even though stored in approved godowns/places,
shall be subjected to acceptance test prior to their immediate use.
6.3.7.2
Aggregates
Aggregate stockpiles may be made on ground that is denuded of vegetation,
is hard and well
drained.
If necessary, the ground shall be covered with 50 mm wooden planks or gunny bags
or hessian cloth.
Coarse aggregates shall be delivered to the site
in two separate sizes. Aggregates placed
directly on the ground shall not be removed from the stockpile within 150 mm of the ground
until the final cleaning up of the work, and then only the clean aggregate will be permitted to
be used. Rescreening of aggregates before use may be resorted to
if aggregates are found
contaminated with soil or excessive fine dust.
In the case of fine aggregates, these shall be deposited at the mixing site not less than 8 hours
before use and shall have been tested and approved.
6.3.7.3
Cement
Cement shall be transported, handled and stored
in the site
in such a manner as to avoid
deterioration or contamination. Cement shall be stored above ground level
in perfectly dry
and water-tight sheds and shall be stacked not more than eight bags high. Wherever bulk
storage containers are used their capacity should be sufficient to cater to the requirement at
site for a week and should be cleaned at least once every 3 months.
Each consignment shall be stored separately so that it may be readily identified and inspected
and cement shall be used
in the sequence
in which
it
is delivered at site. Any consignment
or part of consignment of cement which had deterio.rated
in any way, during storage, shall
be subjected to tests, and
if found sub-standard shall not be used
in the works and shall be
removed from the site.
Proper records on
site
in respect of delivery,
handling, storage and use of cement shall
be maintained at site and these records shall be available for inspection at
all times. The
daily test certificate issued by cement factory shall be collected and documented for future
reference.
A monthly return shall be made showing the quantities of cement received and issued during
the month and in stock at the end of the month.

6.4
Mix Design
6.4.1
Roller compacted concrete pavement (RCCP)
Mix design for RCCP
is totally different from the design of mix for a conventional cement
concrete pavement as the Abrahm's water/cement
ratio law does not hold good.
Roller
Compacted Concrete is a zero-slump concrete. Details of mix design are given in the MORD
Specifications (34).
The mix shall be proportioned by weight of all ingredients such that the desired target mean
strength
is achieved. The mix design shall be based on the flexural strength of concrete.
The moisture content shall be selected so that mix
is dry enough to support the weight of a
vibratory roller, and yet wet enough to permit adequate distribution of paste throughout the
mass during mixing, laying and compaction operations. The water content may be in range
of 4 to 7 percent by weight of dry materials including cement. Trial mixes may be made with
water contents in the range of 5-7 percent and shall be determined by trial mixes with water
contents at
1 .0 percent intervals. The optimum moisture content which gives the maximum
density shall be established. The exact moisture content requirement
in the mix shall be
established after making field trial construction as explained in Clause 7.2.
Using the moisture content so established, a set of six beams and cubes shall be prepared
for testing on the 7*" and 28'^ days.
If the flexural strength achieved is lower than the desired
strength, the
trials should be repeated
after increasing the cement/fly ash content
till the
desired strength is achieved.
6.4.2
Concrete compacted by vibratory screeds, needle vibrators, hand tampers and
plate compactors
Mix design for concrete compacted by screeds, needle vibrators and hand tampers shall be
done on the basis of any recognized procedure, such as, IRC:44 "Guidelines for Concrete
Mix Design for Pavements". The mix design
is initially carried out in the laboratory, keeping
in view the desired characteristic strength, the degree of workability, water-cement ratio, size
of aggregates. A slump of 30 to 50 mm at paving site may be acceptable for compaction by
hand-operated machines.
6.4.3
Self compacting concrete
Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) can flow easily and requires little compaction.
It consists of
additional ingredients like ultra-water reducer and silica fumes.
It may cost a
little higher but
it can be conveniently placed. Trial stretches in Maharashtra for rural roads were done with
success.
6.4.3
Design mix
The laboratory trial mixes shall be tried out in the field, and any adjustments that are needed
are carried out during the trial length construction.

7 CONSTRUCTION
7.1
Sub-base
The Concrete pavement for rural roads shall be laid on a properly compacted sub-base which
shall be constructed on a subgrade of selected coarse grained soil of 300 mm thickness. The
sub-base may be composed of granular material or stabilized soil material as listed below:
-
a)
Granular material
i)
Water Bound Macadam (WBM)
ii)
Wet Mix Macadam (WMM)
iii)
Well-graded
granular
materials,
like,
natural
gravel,
crushed
slag,
crushed
concrete,
brick
metal,
laterite,
kankar,
etc.
conforming
to
IRC:63
iv)
Well-graded soil-aggregate mixtures conforming to IRC:63
b)
Stabilised soil with cementitious material as per IRC:89
Local soil or moorurn stabilized with cement, lime, lime-fly ash, lime rice husk ash as found
appropriate giving a minimum unconfined strength as Clauses
3.6.2.3 and
3.6.2.3
after
7 days and 28 days of curing for cement and lime/lime-flyash respectively, may be used.
Commercially available proprietary stabilizers may also be used
if they are found to give good
performance in different trials in India. These stabilizers should not have leachate which may
pollute underground water or the water in nearby fields. Accelerated curing at 50°C up to three
days may be correlated with 28 day strength for quick results. Reference may be made to
IRC:SP:89 for guidance as regards design of mixes with cement or lime or lime-soil mixtures.
For
proprietary
soil
stabilsers marketed
commercially,
laboratory
tests should be done
thoroughly to evaluate the design parameter.
Soil and stabilisers can be mixed easily by
rotovators which are widely used by farmers. The thickness will be as per Clause 3.6.2.
7.2
Construction of Trial Length
In order to determine and demonstrate the
suitability of the construction equipment and
methodology, a trial length of at least 30 m shall be constructed outside the main road and
shall be laid on two different days. Mixes shall be produced from the mixers intended to be
used
in the actual construction. The laying operation also shall be done by employing roller
proposed
in the case of Roller Compacted Concrete Pavement and screeds,
etc.
in the
case of normal concrete. Flowability of Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) and the working of
pouring equipment can be examined. After the construction of the trial length in the case of
Roller Compacted Concrete, the in-situ density of the freshly laid material shall be determined
by sand replacement method with 200 mm diameter density holes. Three density holes shall
be made at locations equally spaced along a diagonal that bisects the
trial length and the
average of the three densities shall be determined. This reference density shall be used for
determining the field density of day-to-day work. The density during the normal work shall
25



======================================================================
PAGE 34 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:62-2014
not be less than 97 percent of this reference density. These density holes shall not be made
within the strip 500 mm from the edges.
In case of screed-vibrated concrete pavement, the
in-situ density of the cores shall be such that the air voids are not more than 3 percent. The
air-voids shall be derived from the difference between the theoretical maximum dry density of
the concrete calculated from the specific gravities of the constituents of the concrete mix and
the average value of the three direct density measurements on cores. The crushing strength
of cylindrical cores shall be determined and the corresponding crushing strength of cubes
determined by the formula:
Crushing strength of cylindrical specimens =0.8 x crushing strength of cubes
When the height to diameter ratio is 2
The crushing strengths of cylinders with
height to diameter
ratio between
1 and 2 may
be corrected to a standard cylinder of height to diameter ratio of 2 by multiplying with the
correction factor obtained from the following equation:
f = 0.11 n + 0.78
... 7.1
where,
f
=
correction factor
n
=
height to diameter ratio
The number of cores shall be a minimum of three. The concrete
in the work represented
by the core test shall be considered acceptable
if the average equivalent cube strength of
the cores
is at least 85 percent of the cube strength of the grade of concrete specified for
the corresponding age and no individual core has strength less than 75 percent. Flexural
strength
is of vital importance for thickness design of pavement.
Since
it is difficult to get cores of sufficient height for the compression test, a better method
can be to make use of Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS), also known as split tensile strength.
Even in a core of height 150 mm, two test samples can be made for ITS test.
Flexural strength of concrete can also be obtained from the relation
F,,3 =
0.67
f,
'
... 7.2
where,
F|-^3 is the ITS of the cored sample
Trials must be done to sort out various problems that may arise before the construction of
the pavement slab begins. The
trial length shall satisfy surface levels and
regularity, and
demonstrate that the joint- forming methodology is satisfactory. The hardened concrete shall
be cut over 3 m width and reversed to inspect the bottom surface for any segregation taking
place. The
trial length
shall be again constructed after making necessary changes
in the
gradation of the mix to eliminate segregation of the mix.
It shall be ensured that the lower
surface shall not have honey-combing and the aggregates shall not be held loosely at the
edges.
26



======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:62-2014
Paving should be done continuously and the contraction joints
will have to be cut with a
concrete saw or discontinuity can be made by preplacing 3 to 5 mm HOPE strips, metal strips
or steel T-section to one third the depth of the pavement slab from the surface.
After the trial length is found to be satisfactory and
is approved, the material, mix properties,
moisture
content,
cement/fly ash
content,
mixing,
laying,
compaction
plant and
entire
construction procedure
shall
not be changed.
In case any change
is desired, the
entire
procedure shall be repeated.
7.3
Batching and Mixing
The batching plant/concrete mixer shall be capable of proportioning the materials by weight,
each type of material being weighed separately. The capacity of the batching and mixing shall
be at least 25 percent higher than the proposed capacity for the laying arrangements. The
type of the mixer may be selected subject to demonstration of its satisfactory performance
during the
trial length construction. The rated capacity of the mixer shall not be less than
0.3 cum. The weighing mechanism shall be checked periodically and calibrated, to yield an
accuracy of ± 2 percent
in the case of aggregates and ±
1 percent in the case of cement,
fly ash and water. When fly ash
is added, the mixing time shall be increased by a minute to
ensure proper mixing.
7.4
Transporting
The mix shall be discharged immediately from the mixer, transported directly using wheel
barrows, iron pans or tippers to the point where
it is to be laid and protected from the weather
by covering with tarpaulin during transit. The concrete shall be transported continuously to
feed the laying equipment to work at a uniform speed in an uninterrupted manner.
7.5
Formwork
All side forms shall be of mild steel channel sections of depth equal to the thickness of the
pavement. The sections shall have a length of at least 3.0 m. Wooden forms shall be capped
along the inside upper edge with 30-50 mm angle
iron well recessed and kept flush with
the face of the wooden forms. The forms shall be held firmly
in place by stakes driven to
the ground. The supply of forms shall be sufficient to permit them to be taken out only after
12 hours after the concrete has been placed. All forms shall be cleaned and oiled each time
they are used. The forms shall be jointed neatly and set correctly to the required grade and
alignment.
Bulkheads of suitable dimensions shall be used
at construction joints. Formwork can be
dispensed with
if a paver is used.
7.6
Placing Concrete
Concrete shall be deposited on the sub-base to the required depth and width in successive
batches and
in continuous operation. Care shall be taken
to see that no segregation of
27



======================================================================
PAGE 36 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:62-2014
materials
results. The placing and spreading can be done by a paver,
if available, or by
manual means.
In the
latter case spreading shall be as uniform as possible and shall be
accomplished by shovels. While being placed, the concrete shall be rodded with suitable
tools so that the formation of voids or honeycomb pockets
is avoided. Semi self-compacted
concrete can be poured directly over the compacted sub-base requiring
little compaction.
7.7
Compaction
7.7.1
The compaction shall be carried out immediately after the material
is
laid with
necessary surcharge (extra loose thickness) and leveled. The spreading, compacting and
finishing of the concrete shall be carried out as rapidly as possible and the operation shall
be so arranged as to ensure that the time between the mixing of the first batch of concrete
in any transverse section of the layer and the final finishing of the same shall not exceed 90
minutes when the concrete temperature is above 25 and below 30°C and 120 minutes
if less
than 25°C. This period may be reviewed in the light of the results of the trial length but in no
case shall
it exceed 2 hours. Work shall not proceed when the temperature of the concrete
exceeds 30°C. The concreting shall be terminated when the ambient temperature is 5°C during
descending temperature.
It is desirable to stop concreting when the ambient temperature
is
above 35°C. Night concreting may be resorted to when the day temperature
in summer is
not congenial for concreting. After compaction has been completed, roller shall not stand on
the compacted surface for the duration of the curing period except during commencement of
next day's work near the location where work was terminated the previous day in the case of
RCCP.
7.7.2
Compaction by vibratory roller
Double drum smooth-wheeled vibratory rollers of minimum 80 to 100 kN static weight are
considered to be suitable for rolling the Roller Compacted Concrete. In case any other roller
is proposed, the same shall be got approved after demonstrating its satisfactory performance.
The number of passes required to obtain maximum compaction depends on the thickness of
the concrete, the compatibility of the mix, and the weight and type of the roller, etc. The total
requirement of rollers for the job shall be determined during trial construction by measuring
the in-situ density and the scale of the work to be undertaken.
In addition to the number of passes required for compaction there shall be a preliminary pass
without vibration to bed the lean concrete down and again a final pass without vibration to
remove roller marks and to smoothen the surface.
Special care and attention shall be exercised during compaction near joints, kerbs, channels,
side forms and around gullies and manholes.
In case adequate compaction
is not achieved
by the roller at these points, use of plate vibrator shall be made.
The
final concrete surface on completion
of compaction
shall be well closed,
free from
movement under roller and free from ridges, low spots, cracks, loose material, pot-holes,
ruts or other defects. The final surface shall be inspected immediately on completion and
all loose, segregated or defective areas shall be corrected by using fresh lean concrete
28



======================================================================
PAGE 37 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:62-2014
material laid and compacted. For repairing honeycombed surface, concrete with aggregates
of size 10 mm and below shall be spread and compacted.
It is necessary to check the level
of the rolled surface for compliance. Any level/thickness deficiency should be corrected after
applying concrete with aggregates of size 10 mm and below after roughening the surface.
Similarly, the surface regularity also should be checked with 3 m straight edge. The deficiency
should be made up with concrete with aggregates of size
1 0 mm and below during the rolling
operation.
7.7.3
In the case of roller compacted concrete, the compaction shall be continued so as
to achieve 97 percent of the compaction achieved
in the trial length. The densities achieved
at the edges,
i.e., 0.5 m from the edge shall not be less than 95 percent of that achieved
during the trial construction.
7.7.4
Compaction by screed vibrators
Compaction shall be achieved by a vibrating hand screed. As soon as concrete
is placed,
it shall be struck off uniformly and screeded to the cross-section desired. Needle vibrators
may be employed to ensure compaction near the forms. The entire surface shall then be
vibrated with screed resting on the side forms and being drawn ahead with a sawing motion,
in combination with a series of lifts and drops alternating with lateral shifts. The aim of this first
operation being compaction and screeding to the approximate level required. The surface
shall then be closely inspected for any irregularities with a profile checking template and any
needed correction made by adding or removing concrete, followed by further compaction and
finishing in the second run.
7.8
Finishing
In the case of normal concrete just before the concrete becomes non-plastic, the surface shall
be belted with a two-ply canvas belt not less than 200 mm wide and at least
1 .0 m longer
than the width of the slab. Hand belts shall have suitable handles to permit controlled uniform
manipulation. The belt shall be operated with short strokes transverse to the carriageway
centre line and with a rapid advance parallel to the centre line.
After belting, and as soon as surplus water,
if any, has risen to the surface, the pavement shall
be given a broom finish with an approved clean steel or fibre broom not less than 450 mm
wide. The broom shall be pulled gently over the surface of the pavement from edge to edge.
Adjacent strokes shall be slightly overlapped. Brooming shall be perpendicular to the centre
line of the pavement and so executed that the corrugations thus produced shall be uniform in
character and width, and not more than 1.5 mm deep. Brooming shall be completed before
the concrete reaches such a stage that the surface is likely to be torn or unduly roughened by
the operation. The broomed surface shall be free from porous or rough spots, irregularities,
depressions, and small pockets, such as, may be caused by accidentally disturbing particles
of coarse aggregate embodied near the surface.
After belting and brooming have been completed, but before the concrete has taken its initial
set, the edges of the slab shall be carefully finished with an edge tool of 6 mm radius, and the
pavement edge left smooth and true to line.
29

PAGE 38 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:62-2014
7.9
Transverse Joints
The contraction joints 3 to 5 mm wide shall be cut as soon as the concrete has undergone
initial hardening and
is hard enough to take the load of the joint sawing machine without
causing damage to the slab. The sawing operation should be completed within 24 hours. The
depth of sawing should be from 1/4 to 1/3 of the depth of the slab.
Alternatively, the joint can also be formed by pressing a mild steel T-section
into the fresh
concrete. Due care is to be exercised to remove bulging which may affect the riding quality.
Metal strips of 3 mm to 5 mm width can also be placed before placement of concrete. HDPE
strips 3 mm to 5 mm wide also can be used for creating contraction joints.
Transverse construction joints shall be placed wherever concreting is completed after a day's
work or is suspended for more than 90 minutes. These joints shall be provided at the location
of contraction joints. At
all construction joints, steel bulk-heads shall be used to retain the
concrete while the surface
is finished. The surface of the concrete laid subsequently shall
conform to the grade and cross-sections of the previously laid pavement. When positioning
of bulk-head/stop-end
is not possible, concreting to an additional
1
or 2 m length may be
carried out to enable the movement of joint cutting machine so that joint grooves may be
formed and the extra
1 or 2 m length is cut out and removed subsequently after concrete has
hardened.
Expansion joints are provided at abutments of bridges and culverts. The width of the expansion
joint shall be 20 mm.
The typical details of various joints are given from Figs. 5(a) to (o). Crumb Rubber Modified
Bitumen (CRMB) can be hot poured, to seal the joints. A thin synthetic rope should be inserted
into the groove to prevent sealing compound from entering into the cracks. Such thin joints
have better riding quality and no further widening
is necessary. CRMB has the
flexibility,
durability and
it is resistant to age hardening.
If strips of HDPE 3 mm to 5 mm wide are used,
no sealing
is necessary since the strips are left embedded in the concrete.
7.10
Curing
As soon as the concrete surface is compacted, curing shall commence.
The initial curing shall be done by the application of curing compound followed by covering the
pavement surface entirely with wetted burlap or jute mats. The covering shall be maintained
fully wetted and in position for 24 hours after the concrete has been placed. The burlap shall
be placed from suitable bridges without having to walk on the freshly laid concrete.
After the
initial curing, the final curing shall be done by ponding or continuing with wetted
burlap. Ponding shall consist of constructing earthen dykes of clay of about 50 mm height
transversely and longitudinally, spreading a blanket layer of sand over the exposed pavement
and thoroughly wetting the sand covering for 14 days. The wetted burlap also shall be placed
for 14 days.

7.11
Removal of Forms
Forms shall be removed only after the concrete has set for at least 12 hours. They shall be
carefully removed without causing damage to the edge of the pavement. After the removal of
forms, the ends shall be cleaned and any honey-combed areas pointed with
1 :2 cement-sand
mortar, after which the sides of the slab shall be covered with earth to the level of the slab. In
case the adjoining soil has more than 0.5 percent sulphates, the sides may be painted with
bituminous tack coat.
7.12
Opening to Traffic
The freshly
laid concrete shall be protected by suitable barricades to exclude
traffic. No
heavy commercial vehicles carrying construction materials shall be allowed for a period of 28
days. Tractor trailers without any construction materials and light commercial vehicles may
be allowed after 14 days.
7.13
Sealing of Joints
The sawn joints which are 3 to 5 mm wide can be filled with hot poured crumb rubber or
polymer modified bitumen. Precautions shall be taken so that the sealant shall not spill on the
exposed surface of the concrete. The sealant shall be poured from a kettle having a spout. A
reference may be made to IRC:57 for details.
7.14
Surface Regularity
The surface shall be checked for surface regularity with a straight edge of 3 m length. The
tolerance in this length shall not exceed 8 mm.
7.15
Quality Control
At least six beam and six cube specimens shall be sampled, one set of three cubes and
beams each for 7 day and 28 day strength tests for every 100 cum of concrete or a day's
work. A quality control chart indicating the strength values of individual specimens shall be
maintained. Further guidance may be taken from IRC:SP:11 "Handbook of Quality Control for
Construction of Roads and Runways".
7.16
Cracks in Concrete Slabs
The cement concrete slabs may develop cracks
if proper care
is not taken either during
construction stage or during post-construction period. The cracks develop in cement concrete
slabs primarily due to plastic shrinkage or drying shrinkage soon after the construction.
Protecting green concrete by mist spray of water or by covering with wet hessian helps
in
avoiding formation of cracks.
In case the slab is constructed continuously with a view to cut
joints with concrete saw, this exercise should be done soon after the concrete sets, may be
as early as 6-7 hours in summer months.

7.17
Acceptance Criteria for Cracked Concrete Slabs
Concrete slabs may develop cracks of minor to serious nature unless appropriate precautions
are taken to prevent their occurrence either during the construction phase or post-construction
period. Cracks can appear generally due to the following reasons:
a)
Plastic shrinkage of concrete surface due to rapid loss of moisture during hot
summer
b)
Drying shrinkage
c)
High wind velocity associated with low humidity
d)
High ambient temperature
e)
Delayed sawing of joints
f)
Rough
and
uneven
surface
of
the
base
on
which
concrete
slabs
are
constructed
g)
Combination of the above factors
The slabs with
full depth cracks are totally unacceptable as
it amounts to structural failure.
Besides, other cracks which are deep and are likely to progress in depth with time are also
to be considered as serious
in nature. Fine crazy cracks, however, are not serious. The
acceptance criteria for cracked concrete slabs are:
i)
The length of single crack in any panel shall not be more than 750 mm, even
though
its depth
is less than half of the slab depth.
ii)
The cumulative length of cracks with depth of crack less than half the depth
of slab in a panel shall not be more than 1250 mm.
iii)
Slabs with cracks which are penetrating to more than half of the slab depth
shall not be accepted.

ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE OF DESIGN OF A CEMENT CONCRETE
PAVEMENT FOR RURAL ROADS
Example
Cement
concrete
pavements
are
to
be
designed
for
Rural
Roads
in
Uttar
Pradesh
having traffic volumes of
(i) 45
(ii) 140 and
(iii) 200 commercial vehicles per day consisting
vehicles,
like,
agricultural
tractors/trailers,
light goods vehicles, heavy trucks, buses. The
soil has a soaked GBR value of 4 percent. 75 mm water bound macadam grade
III over
(i) 100 mm GSB and
(ii)1 50/200 mm cementitious granular are to be used as subbases (ref
Clause 3.6.2).
Design
Design wheel load = 50 kN, Tyre pressure = 0.80 MPa
From Table 1, the k value corresponding to a CBR value of 4 = 35 MPa/m
Sub-base
75 mm thick WBM over 100 mm GSB/150 mm/200 mm cementitious subbase
Effective k Value
The k value over granular bases can be increased by 20 percent (para 2.5)
Effective k value =
1 .20 x 35 = 42 MPa/m
Effective k over 150 mm/200 mm cementitious subbase = 2 x 35 = 70 MPa/m
Minor variation in k value is
little effect on stresses
Concrete Strength
Adopt a 28 day compressive strength of 30 MPa.
28 day flexural strength
=
f^ = 0.7
= 3.834 MPa
90 day flexural strength
=
1.10 x 3.834 MPa
4.22 MPa
Design Thickness for Traffic of 45 CVPD
Trial thickness = 150 mm, joint spacing = 3.75 mm
Since the volume of traffic = 45 CVPD, temperature stresses need not be considered since
occurrence of heavy vehicles and maximum temperature gradient at the same time is least
likely

IRC:SP:62-2014
Edge Load Stress
k = 42 MPa/m for granular subbase
From the excel sheet, edge load stress for a dual wheel load = 4.34 MPa>MR = 4.22 MPa,
If the same load
is applied by a single wheel of a tractor trailer whose tyre pressure
is only
0.5 MPa, the stress is 4.37 MPa > MR (4.22 MPa)
Hence the design is unsafe for k = 42 MPa/m
The pavement
is unsafe even
for a tractor trailer carrying the same load
at a lower tyre
pressure.
K = 70 MPa (Cementitious subbase)
Stress for a dual wheel load of 50 kN = 3.985 MPa < 4.22 MPa hence safe for a thickness of
150 mm over 150 mm cementitious subbase.
Stronger subbase gives a reduced bending stress
Trial thickness = 160 mm for GSB
Stress due to dual wheel load of 50 kN, wheel load stress = 3.93 < 4.22 MPa, hence the
160 mm thickness stress is safe for 160 mm slab laid over 75 mm WBM and 100 mm GSB.
Concrete keeps on gaining strength with time and one year flexural strength
is 20 percent
higher than the 28 day strength
The designer has to exercise his/her judgment in the estimation of traffic and thickness
design traffic = 140 CVPD
Consider a trial thickness of 170 mm and joint spacing of 3.75 m
Temperature differential
't'
( For UP, Zone no. = 1 from Table 4.1)
Inputting the Zone number in the excel yields, the temperature differential,
't' is automatically
inputted. The load stresses
is maximum when the wheel
is at the longitudinal edge. Hence
Bradbury's coefficient
is computed for the longitudinal edge. All computation
is done on the
excel sheet
Granular subbase = 175 mm, Cementitioius subbase = 200 mm
K = 42 MPa/m over granular subbase
K = 70 MPa/m over cementitious subbase
Granular subbase
The
total
of
wheel
load
and
the
temperature
stresses
due
to
50
kN
dual
wheel
load = 4.25 > 4.22 MPa and hence the design
is unsafe.
If the joint spacing
is 2.5 m, the stress = 3.64 MPa and hence the design
is safe for 170 mm
slab
For the joint spacing of 3.75 m, increase the thickness to 180 mm
the computed stress = 3.89 MPa, and hence the design is safe.
36



======================================================================
PAGE 45 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:62-2014
Adopt 180 mm with 3.75 m joint spacing for granular subbase
It can thus be seen that
1 70 mm slab is safe for 2.50 m joint spacing while
1 80 mm is needed
for 3.75 m spacing
Cemented subbase
Temperature curling stresses can be reduced by adopting a lower joint spacing while wheel
load also reduces marginally by decreasing the spacing
K = 70 MPa/m for 150/200 mm cementitious subbase
Trial thickness = 170 mm for 3.75 m joint spacing
Stress = 4.15 MPa < 4.22 MPa, hence safe
Designers have to consider all the factors in selecting the joint spacing. Saw cutting or plastic
strips can be used to create shorter joint spacings. Cost and convenience will determine the
adoption of the types of joints.
It is necessary to provide a non-erodible subbase to avoid lack
of subgrade support
Pavement design for traffic = 200 CVPD
Fatigue
fracture
of concrete should be considered
for design.
Total
of wheel
load and
temperature stresses are considered
in fatigue analysis. Since concrete keeps on gaining
strength even after 90 days, there is residual strength even though fatigue analysis indicates
end of pavement life
Design
life = 20 years
The entire computation
is shown
in the excel sheet. Every designer can develop his/own
spread sheet for the computation since the approach
is simple.
Assume a thickness of 200 mm and a joint spacing of 4 m over 250 mm GSB
The cumulative fatigue damage is 193.31. Hence
it is unsafe.
It should be less than
1
Assume a joint spacing of 2.5 m.
The pavement is
still unsafe safe since the cumulative fatigue damage is 2.49.
Take thickness = 220 mm for 4.00 joint spacing. Pavement is still unsafe since the cumulative
fatigue damage = 9.62
Consider a joint spacing of 2.50 m
The pavement is safe since cumulative fatigue damage is 0.01
A designer can exercise various options of joint spacing using the spread sheet and adopt
the thickness and transverse joint spacing according his/her resources.

2.1
Analysis of Stresses Caused by Non-Linear Temperature Distribution
The temperature distribution across the slab thickness
is usually non-linear though linearity
has been assumed
in thickness design
in earlier versions of IRC:SP:62 and IRC:58. The
actual temperature variation across the depth of a pavement (Fig.
11-1 a) can be taken as
the sum of a uniform and a nonlinear temperature variation. The nonlinear variation can
be further approximated by
bilinear variation and the temperature variation can be
split
as shown
in Figs.
11-1 (b),
(c) and
(d). The total stress due to thermal-loading condition
is
obtained by adding algebraically the bending stresses due to the linear temperature and
the nonlinear temperature
part.
Fig.
11-2 (Venkatasubramanian 1964) shows temperature
measurements made at the surface,
1/4^^ depth, the mid depth, the 3/4^^ depth and at the
bottom for a 203.2 mm thick slab. The measurements were made at Kharagpur in Eastern
India. When the surface of the concrete has
its maximum or minimum daily temperatures,
the temperature difference between the surface and the mid depth can be more than double
the difference between the mid depth and the bottom. Similar observations were reported
by Croney and Croney (1991).
In the present analysis
it is considered that the temperature
difference between the top surface and the mid depth
is double that between mid depth and
the bottom during the day hours when the traffic is higher on low volume roads.

Components of Nonlinear Temperature Distribution during Day Time
The
total stress due to thermal-loading condition
is obtained by adding algebraically the
bending stresses due to linear temperature part which extends through full depth of slab and
linear temperature part which extends only to top half of the slab.

IRC:SP:62-2014
From the Fig.
11-2 and others (Venkatasubramanian 1964, Choubane et.al 1993)
it can be
observed that the difference
in temperature between surface and underface of the slab
is
higher during day time as compared to the difference at night. During night time this difference
is approximately half of that during day time.
It can also be observed that during day time the
temperature variation
is highly nonlinear as compared to night time variation.
The slab with the
linear temperature variation extending
to the
full depth
of the slab
is
analyzed by Bradbury's theory. The linear temperature variation over half the depth of the
slab causes internal bending stresses in the pavement and was analyzed by using classical
plate bending theory.
2.2
General Plate Bending Theory Formulation
If the plate
is subjected to the action of tensile or compressive forces acting
in the x and y
direction and uniformly distributed along the sides of the plate, the corresponding bending
moment is equal to
M = D

2.3
Day and Night Time Curling
During the day time, the upper half of the slab will tend to bend due to linear temperature
distribution between the top and the middle surface but lower half will have no effect and
it
remains in its original position (horizontal)
if free to do so and consequently the upper and the
lower halves will tend to have different radii of curvature as shown in Fig. 11-3. The reverse is
the trend during the night hours as shown in Fig. 11-4.

11-4 Bending of Upper and Lower Halves of Slab When Free to Bend
The real slab is a monolithic mass and will curl up or warp down as one unit with a common
radius of curvature of —
(Figs. 11-5 and 11-6) and internal stresses will be set up due to
internal bending moments M as shown in Figs. 11-3 & 2-4 to annul the different curvatures of
the upper and the lower parts. This causes compressive stresses at the top and the bottom
and tensile stresses at mid depth during day time and tensile stresses at top and bottom and
compressive
stresses
at mid
depth
during
night
time. The
values
of stresses can
be
approximately estimated from geometrical compatibility as shown below.

SELF-COMPACTING CONCRETE
1 INTRODUCTION
A constant strive to improve performance and productivity led to the development of Self-
Compacting Concrete (SCO). Traditionally Placed Concrete (TPC) mix
is compacted with
the help of external energy inputs from vibrators, tamping or similar actions. On the other
hand, SCC mix has special performance attributes of self-compaction/consolidation under
the action of gravity.
For mould ability, a concrete mix irrespective of being TPC or SCC should have the ability to
fill the formwork as well as encapsulate reinforcing bars and other embedment in fresh state
maintaining homogeneity.
In case of TPC,
it
is achieved by means of ensuring a minimum
level of slump at fresh state and placing
it with the help of external energy. However, a fresh
SCC mix shall have appropriate workability under the action of its self-weight for filling all the
space within form work (filling ability), passing through the obstructions of reinforcement and
embedment (passing ability) and maintaining
its homogeneity (resistance to segregation).
High deformability can be achieved by appropriate employment of super plasticizer, maintaining
low water powder ratio and Viscosity Modifying Agent (VMA),
if needed. These are the basics
to achieve the flowability and viscosity of a suspension to achieve self-compacting properties.
The rheological characteristics of fresh concrete mix
is not only necessary for workability to
achieve desired mould
ability but they also help
in achieving desired
in-situ strength and
durability attributes at the hardened state. The difference between the SCC and TPC exists
in the performance requirements during
fresh
state;
not much
in terms
of performance
requirements in hardened state such as strength and durability.
The advantages of SCC are enhanced productivity, and reduction of costly labour and noise
discomfort at construction site. Improved surface finish and quality of hardened concrete as
well as improvement of working condition are few of the great potentials of SCC. Usage of
higher dosages of fly ash
in SCC enhances
its flow ability which
in turn reduces the usage
of costly chemical admixtures. The SCC
is,
therefore, another option considering these
properties for rigid pavement of village road noting the fact that a dense compacted concrete
in line and level is a prime requirement for village road. Minimum efforts in vibration mean an
ordinary screed
is enough to get surface
in line and level to obtain a dense concrete. SCC
can thus be a solution for rigid pavement of village roads.
While the material cost of SCC has generally been higher than conventional concrete, but due
to development of new admixtures, the differential cost is much reduced. Marginal increased
initial cost
is compensated to a great extent considering such advantages as reduction
in
construction time and a higher ultimate durability of the structure and
it may finally become
cost effective. Standard manual/guidelines for usage of SCC
in India are not available, but

3 RHELOGY PROPERTIES
3.1
Rheology
Self-compaction of fresh concrete is described as its ability to fill the formwork and encapsulate
reinforcing
bar/available
space
only
through
the
action
of
gravity
while
maintaining
homogeneity. The
ability
is achieved by designing the concrete to have suitable inherent
rheological properties. SCC can be used
in most applications where traditionally vibrated
concrete is used.
44



======================================================================
PAGE 53 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:62-2014
Rheology
is the study of flow and deformations of all forms of matter. The basic property
influencing the performance of the fresh concrete in casting and compaction is its rheological
behavior. Rheology has thus been central in the development of SCC. Rheology of concrete,
mortar as
well as
paste
is
important
for understanding
the
behavior and
optimisation
processes.
3.2
Workability
In workability terms, self-compactability signifies the ability of the concrete to flow after being
discharged from the pump hose, a skip or a similar device only through gravity to
fill intended
spaces in formwork to achieve a zero-defect and uniform-quality concrete. Self-compactability
in a fresh state property can be characterized by three functional requirements:
Filling Ability
Resistance to Segregation
Passing Ability
3.2.1
Filling ability
SCC must be able to deform or change its shape very well under its self-weight. The meaning
of the filling ability includes both the flow, in terms of how far from the discharge the concrete
can flow (deformation capacity), and the speed with which
it flows (velocity of deformation).
Using the slump flow measurement, the deformation capacity can be evaluated as the final
flow diameter of the concrete measured after the concrete has completely stopped deforming.
The velocity of deformation can
in the same method be evaluated as the time
it takes the
concrete to reach a certain deformation.
To achieve a good
filling
ability, there should be a good balance between the deformation
capacity and velocity of deformation.
3.2.2
Resistance to segregation
Concrete should not show tendency to segregate during movement. SCC should not have
any of the following segregation parameters in either flowing or stationary state;
>
Bleeding of water
>
Paste and aggregate segregation
>
Coarse aggregate segregation leading to blocking
>
Non-uniformity in air-pore distribution
To avoid the segregation of water from the solids,
it
is essential to reduce the amount of
movable water in the mixture. Movable water can be reduced by using low water content and
low W/P. (Water/Powder)
It
is also possible to use powder material (Materials having size
less than 0.125 mm (125 micron) with high surface area since more water can be retained
on the surface of the powder material. Segregation resistance between water and solids can
also be improved by increasing the viscosity of water through the use of VMA.
45



======================================================================
PAGE 54 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:62-2014
The other categories of segregation can be solved by having a paste phase which is capable
of carrying the aggregate particles. This can be done by increasing the cohesion between the
paste phase and aggregate phase through the use of low w/p or by using VMA.
3.2.3
Passing ability
For sec with excellent
filling
ability & segregation
resistance,
blocking
will occur
in the
following conditions:
>
The maximum size of the aggregate is too large
>
The content of large-sized aggregates is too high
The blocking tendency is increased
if the concrete has a tendency for segregation of coarser
aggregate
particles. Thus blocking can occur even
if the maximum aggregate size
is not
excessively large.
4 SPECIFICATION
4.1
General
The filling ability and stability of self-compacting concrete
in the fresh state can be defined
by four key
characteristics. Each
characteristic can be addressed by one
or more
test
methods:
Characteristic
Preferred test method(s)
Flowability
Slump-flow test
Viscosity (assessed by rate of flow)
T^^^ Slump-flow test or V-funnel test
Passing ability
L-box test
Segregation
Segregation resistance (sieve) test
The above tests are fully described in EN 12350-2. Since the SCC is intended to be used for
rigid pavement for roads and the roads are in grades and camber, the acceptable values of
parameters will have to be fixed by trials and carrying out field observations. Slump flow of
400 mm and V cone of 8 seconds
if observed would meet the requirement for village roads
as seen by several experiments.
Slump Flow & V-funnel test methods for SCC are described in Annexures
III-1 and
III-2
4.2
Segregation Resistance
Visual observations during the Slump flow test and/or measurement of the T^^^ time can give
additional information on the segregation resistance. There should not be any visible signs
of segregation.
5 CONSTITUENT MATERIALS
5.1
General
The constituent materials for SCC are the same as those used in traditional vibrated concrete
conforming to IS:456.
46



======================================================================
PAGE 55 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:62-2014
5.1.1
Minimum Cement
The durability requirements conforming to IS:456 of the minimum cement content for the
given exposure conditions should be adhered to.
5.2
Mineral Admixtures
5.2.1
General
Due to the fresh property requirements of SCC,
inert and pozzolanic/hydraulic additions
are commonly used to improve and maintain the cohesion and segregation resistance. The
addition will also regulate the cement content
in order to reduce the heat of hydration and
thermal shrinkage.
The additions are classified according to their reactive capacity with water:
Pozzolanic
Fly Ash conforming to Grade
1 of IS:3812(Part-1)
Silica fumes
Rice husk ash
Metakaoline having fineness between 700 - 900 m^/kg
Hydraulic
GGBS conforming to IS: 12089
5.2.2
Fly ash
Fly ash has been shown to be an effective addition for SCC providing increased cohesion and
reduced sensitivity to changes in water content. However, high levels of fly ash may produce
a paste fraction which
is so cohesive that
it can be resistant to flow. Fly ash conforming to
IS:381 2 (Part-1 ) 2003 shall be used. Some of the important requirements of fly ash are listed
below:

Aggregates
Normal-weight aggregates should conform to IS:383 and meet the durability requirements of
IS:456.
All normal concreting sands are suitable for SCC. Both crushed or rounded sands can be
used.
The amount of fines less than 0. 1 25 mm is to be considered as powder and is very important
for the rheology of the SCC. A minimum amount of fines (arising from the binders and the
sand) must be achieved to avoid segregation.
47



======================================================================
PAGE 56 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:62-2014
5.3.1
Coarse aggregate
Coarse aggregates conforming to IS:383 are appropriate for the production of SCC.
5.3.2
Fine aggregate/sands
The influence of fine aggregates on the fresh properties of the SCC
is significantly greater
than that of coarse aggregate.
Particles size fractions of less than 0.125 mm should be
include the fines content of the paste and should also be taken into account in calculating the
water powder ratio.
The high volume of paste
in SCC mixes helps to reduce the internal friction between the
sand particles but a good grain size distribution
is
still very important. Many SCC mix design
methods use blended sands to match an optimized aggregate grading curve and this can
also help to reduce the paste content. Some producers prefer gap-graded sand.
5.4
Admixtures
High range water reducing admixtures conforming to IS:9103 are an essential component of
SCC. Viscosity Modifying Admixtures (VMA) may also be used to help reduce segregation
and the sensitivity of the mix due to variations
in other constituents, especially to moisture
content.
5.4.1
Superplasticiser/high range water reducing admixtures
The admixture should bring about the required water reduction and fluidity but should also
maintain
its dispersing
effect during the time required
for transport and
application. The
required consistence retention will depend on the application.
High
efficiency
Poly
carboxylate based
high
range water reducer
having
a
consistent
performance should be used.
5.4.2
Viscosity modifying admixtures
Admixtures that modify the cohesion of the SCC without significantly altering
its fluidity are
called Viscosity Modifying Admixtures (VMA). These admixtures are used in SCC to minimize
the effect of variations
in moisture content, fines
in the sands or
its grain size distribution,
making the SCC more robust and less sensitive to small variations
in the proportions and
condition of other constituents.
5.5
Mixing Water
Water conforming to IS:456 should be used in SCC mixes.
6 BASIC MIX DESIGN
There is no standard method for SCC mix design and many academic institution and company
dealing with admixtures, ready-mixed concrete, precast concrete etc. have developed their
own mix proportioning methods.
48



======================================================================
PAGE 57 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:SP:62=2014
Mix designs often use volume as a key parameter because of the importance of the need to
fill the voids between the aggregate particles. Some methods try to
fit available constituents
to an optimized grading envelope. Another method
is to evaluate and optimize the flow and
stability of first the paste and then the mortar fractions before the coarse aggregate is added
and the whole SCC mix tested.

8 CURING
Curing is important for all concrete but especially so for the top-surface of elements made with
SCC. These can dry quickly because of the increased quantity of paste, the low water/fines
ratio and the lack of bleed water at the surface.
Initial curing should therefore commence as
soon as practicable after placing and finishing in order to minimise the risk of surface crusting
and shrinkage cracks caused by early age moisture evaporation.

Test Methods
TESTING FRESH CONCRETE
: SLUMP-FLOW TEST -
Introduction
The slump-flow diameter is a test to assess the flowability and the flow rate of self-compacting
concrete in the absence of obstructions.
It is based on the slump test described in EN
1 2350-2.
The result is an indication of the filling ability of self-compacting concrete.
1
Scope
This document specifies the procedure for determining the slump-flow diameter for
self-
compacting concrete. The test
is not suitable when the maximum size of the aggregate
exceeds 40 mm.
2
Principle
The fresh concrete
is poured
into a cone as used for the IS:9103 slump test. The largest
diameter of the flow spread of the concrete and the diameter of the spread at right angles to
it are then measured and the mean is the slump-flow.
3
Apparatus
The apparatus shall be in accordance with EN 12350-2 except as detailed below:
3.1
Baseplate, made from a flat plate with a plane area of at least 900 mm x 900 mm
on which concrete can be placed. The plate shall have a
flat, smooth and non-absorbent
surface with a minimum thickness of 2 mm. The surface shall not be readily attacked by
cement paste or be liable to rusting. The construction of the plate shall be such as to prevent
distortion. The deviation from flatness shall not exceed 3 mm at any point when a straight
edge is placed between the centres of opposing sides.
The centre of the plate shall be scribed with a cross, the lines of which run parallel to the
edges of the plate and with circles of 200 mm diameter and 500 mm diameter having their
centres coincident with the centre point of the plate. See Fig. 1.
3.2
Rule, Graduated from 0 mm to 1000 mm at Intervals of 1 mm.
3.3
Stop Watch, Measuring to 0.1 s.
3.4
Weighted Collar (Optional), Having a Mass of at Least 9 kg.
Note
:
the weighted collar allows the test to be carried out by one person.

Base Plate Reference Clause 4.1
4 TEST SAMPLE
The sample shall be obtained in accordance with IS: 11 99.
5 PROCEDURE
Prepare the cone and base plate as described
in EN 12350-2.
Fit the collar to the cone
if
being used. Place the cone coincident with the 200 mm circle on the base plate and hold in
position by standing on the foot pieces (or use the weighted collar), ensuring that no concrete
can leak from under the cone.
Fill the cone without any agitation or rodding, and strike off surplus from the top of the cone.
Allow the
filled cone to stand for not more than 30
s; during this time remove any spilled
concrete from the base plate and ensure the base plate
is damp
all over but without any
surplus water.
Lift the cone vertically in one movement without interfering with the flow of concrete. Without
disturbing the base plate or concrete, measure the largest diameter of the flow spread and
record as
to the nearest 10 mm. Then measure the diameter of the flow spread at right
angles to d
to the nearest 10 mm and record as d to the nearest 10 mm.
Check the concrete spread for segregation. The cement paste/mortar may segregate from
the coarse aggregate to give a ring of paste/mortar extending several millimetres beyond the
coarse aggregate. Segregated coarse aggregate may also be observed
in the central area.
Report that segregation has occurred and that the test was therefore unsatisfactory.
6 TEST RESULT
The slump-flow is the mean of d^ and d^ expressed to the nearest 10 mm.
7 TEST REPORT
The test report shall include:
a)
Identification of the test sample;
b)
Location where the test was performed;
c)
Date when test performed;
d)
Slump-flow to the nearest 10 mm;
e)
Any indication of segregation of the concrete;

then strike off the top with the straight edge so that the concrete
is flush with the top of the
funnel. Place the container under the funnel
in order to retain the concrete to be passed.
After a delay of (10 ± 2) s from filling the funnel, open the gate and measure the time
t^, to
0.1
s, from opening the gate to when
it is possible to see vertically through the funnel into the
container below for the first time,
t^ is the V-funnel flow time.
