FOREWORD
Highway improvement programmes are assuming increasing importance
in view of the fast growing road transport needs of the country.
However, as
resources
are
scarce
it
is
essential
that the projects should be economically
justifiable.
In this context, economic evaluation has become a handy tool for
making correct investment decisions.
Indian Roads Congress had published in 1984 a Manual on Economic
Evaluation of Highway Projects in India.
This enabled the highway engineers to
carry out economic analysis of road improvement projects in a scientific manner.
The analysis of different options with this procedure by manual calculations is
however, a time consuming task, due to which the technique has not been used to
its full advantage. The computer model now developed overcomes this difficulty
and enables quick detailed analysis of various alternatives.
The Manual for Road Investment Decision Model is the first Computer
based manual published by the Indian Roads Congress. A programmed floppy
which is enclosed with this manual will help the user to make use of computer for
economic analysis. The model is very easy to use and caters to the requirements
for analysing alternative proposals, evaluating alternate strategies and ranking
schemes in order of priority.
The Manual fulfills a long felt need and its widespread use by highway
engineers will have a beneficial effect on planning and preparation of highway
projects in India.

THE RIDM
1.1.
Introduction
1.1.1.
The Road Investment Decision Model (RIDM Version- 1 ) is a
computer based model designed to carry out economic evaluation of highway
projects in accordance with the procedure described in the IRC Special Publica-
tion-30 "Manual on Economic Evaluation of Highway Projects in India" with
modifications as described in para 1.2. Economic analysis involves quantification
of the
total transportation cost components
for alternative
strategies
for road
improvement and evaluating each of them against the "do nothing" alternative.
Proper analysis of various options by manual calculations is a time consuming task,
which makes
it difficult to use the technique to full advantage manually. The
computer model overcomes
this shortcoming and enables detailed analysis of
possible combinations of alternatives quickly.
The Model has been developed
using Lotus 1-2-3 Software and its advanced macro programming features. It has
been tested and applied on a number of major national highway projects pertaining
to widening, strengthening, construction of bypasses etc.
1.1.2.
This publication is a user Manual for RIDM and describes the
procedure for running the model based on the floppy disk which is enclosed with
the Manual.
1.1.3.
The Computerisation Committee of the Indian Roads Congress
(personnel given below) in their meeting held at New Delhi, on the 6th February
1990, discussed the Package on Economic Analysis developed by the Ministry of
Surface
Transport
and
set
up
a working
group comprising
Dr. L.R.
Kadiyali, S/Shri J.B. Mathur and M.K. Saxena to finalise the same. The draft as
finalised by the Group, was placed before the Highways Specifications & Standards
Committee
in
their meeting held on
the 30th October,
1990.
In
light of the
comments offered by
the Members of Highways Specifications & Standards
Committee during the meeting, the draft was further modified by S/Shri S.C.Shar-
ma, M.K.Bhalla and J.B. Mathur.

The modified draft was subsequently considered and approved
by the Executive Committee in their meeting held on the 18th November, 1990.
Thereafter, the draft was taken up for discussion by the Council in their meeting
held on
the 8th December,
1990.
The Council
authorised the Convenor of
Highways Specifications & Standards Committee to do the necessary modifica-
tions based on comments received. Accordingly the draft was finally modified by
the Convenor, Highways Specifications and Standards Committee for printing as
one of the IRC Publications
1.2.
Modifications
in IRC:SP:30-1984 'Manual on Economic
Evaluation of Highway Projects in India'
The following modifications have been incorporated in the model:
(i)
The IRC Special Publication-30 specifies the design service volumes for various
pavement widths in terms of vehicles per day, whereas this Model considers the
design service volumes in terms of Passenger Car Units (PCU) per day, in line
with the revised IRC standard IRC:64-1990
'Guidelines on Capacity of Roads
in Rural Areas' (First Revision)
(ii)
The Speed-volume relationships given in Table 2 of IRC:SP:30-1984, which
relate the speed and the hourly volume in terms of number of vehicles, have not
been used in the model as new Speed- flow equations have become available
through a recent research study (Ref.4). The new Speed-flow equations, which
relate the speed and traffic volume in terms of PCU/hr. have been incorporated
in the model. The equations are given in Table 1.
1 .3.
Capabilities and Applications of the Model
The RIDM carries out economic evaluation of highway
schemes at project level for road investment decision making. Its major capabilities
and applications are:-
(i)
The model
is very easy to use and adequately caters to the requirements of
highway organisations for analysing alternative proposals to select the best
option from a number of alternatives at project level. It is fully interactive for
specifying input data and retrieval of results in proper report forms. The model
2



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 50
======================================================================
takes 4 to 5 minutes to load the programme, retrieve input data file and analyse
a pair of alternatives and generate output reports.
(ii)
The model can evaluate alternative strategies such as stage construction or full
construction alternative specifications for carriageway width, pavement structure
etc.
(iii)
It can be used to rank schemes in order of priority.
(iv)
The model can also analyse the sensitivity of the result to changes in unit prices
of resources, traffic growth rate and design parameters.
(v)
With a
slight
modification in the programme, the Model can also
be used to
generate vehicle operating cost tables.
1 .4.
Basic Relationships Incorporated into the Model
1.4.1.
The model considers the following three cost components
which constitute the total transportation cost:
(i)
Construction cost
(ii)
Maintenance cost
(iii)
Road user cost
The road user cost is composed of vehicle operating cost (VOC), travel
time cost and accident cost.
1.4.2.
The construction cost and maintenance cost are specified by
the user directly whereas the vehicle operating cost and travel time cost are
calculated by the model endogeneously using the VOC equations and Speed-flow
relationships.
1.4.3.
The construction cost and maintenance cost of the facility are
specified by the user in financial terms. The financial costs are converted into
economic costs using the following relationship:
ECONOMIC COST = ECF * FINANCIAL COST
where:
ECF = Economic cost conversion factor.
A default value of 0.8 has been adopted for ECF. The user can specify a
different value for ECF while feeding input data.
1 .4.4.
Vehicle Operating Cost
: The vehicle operating cost relation-
ship for cars, buses, and trucks formulated on the basis of the Road User Cost Study
and used for preparing VOC Tables in IRC:SP:30- 1984, have been built into the
model. The fuel consumption equations have been slightly modified to consider
3



======================================================================
PAGE 18 of 50
======================================================================
the effect ofroad profile in terms of combined rise and fall (absolute values) instead
of specifying rise and fall separately. The modified fuel consumption equations
incorporated in the model are given in Appendix-1. The modification does not
introduce any variation in fuel consumption values. A fixed value of 0.02 Rs/Km
(at 1984 prices) is taken as lubricant cost for operation of a car in all conditions.
The model using the VOC equations
predicts physical quantities of the
resources consumed by cars, buses & trucks. These quntities are then multiplied
by the unit prices of the consumables as specified by the user to give VOC. For two
wheelers VOC is taken as 20 per cent of VOC of cars.
1 .4.5.
Congestion effect
: When traffic volume exceeds the design
service volume
(para
1.4.3.),
the vehicles are subjected
to congestion
effect
resulting in higher VOC as compared to steady state conditions. To account for this
the following congestion factors are used in the model:
VEHICLE
FACTOR
Cars
1-64
Buses
1.28
Trucks
1.31
In case of congestion the calculated values of the components for fuel,
tyre, lubricants, spare parts and maintenance labour are increased by multiplying
these values with the above factors.
1 .4.6.
Speed volume relationships
: The Model calculates speeds of
the vehicles for quantifying travel time savings using speed-flow equations for cars,
buses, trucks and two-wheelers for operation on single lane, intermediate lane,
two-lane, and four-lane wide paved roads in plain, rolling and hilly terrain. The
speed-flow equations are given in Table 1. If the calculated speed for any category
of vehicle is less than 10 km/hr, a minimum cutoff value of 10 km/hr is assigned
for determining the travel time savings.

Accident cost: Accident costs are not calculated endogeneous-
ly but can be specified directly by the user by combining them with other cost
parameters if required.
1.4.8.
Design service volume: The design service volumes for the
existing road (ALT 1) and the proposed facility (ALT 2) are to be defined by the
user as input parameters. The design service volumes for both the alternatives are
to be chosen carefully duly taking into account various factors such as pavement
width, shoulder width, type of terrain, curvature etc. To assist the user to select the
design service volume a built in help facility has been provided in the model. The
help facility displays the recommended design service volumes as per
the IRC
'Guidelines for Capacity of Roads in Rural Areas' Table 2. The help facility can
be invoked by pressing the following keys in the given sequence:
Press 'Home' key
Press
'Enter' key
Press
'Alt andH'

Single -Lane Roads
(1 )
Above values are applicable for paved carriageways with good quality shoulder
of minimum
1 m width on either side. When the pavement is not black topped
the DSV may be lowered by 20 to 30 per cent
(2)
In case of low quality shoulders (earthen shoulders of plastic soil) DSV should
be taken as 50 per cent of the value given above.
Two-Lane Roads
(1)
In case of paved and
surfaced
shoulders of at least 1.5 m width on either side,
the DSV can be increased by 15 per cent.
(2)
Li case of restricted lane width or restricted shoulder width apply the following
capacity reduction factors to the values given in Table 2.

Unit price of consumables: The default values of unit prices of consumables
(1984 price level) are taken from IRC:SP~30-1984
(2)
Passenger time value and time value of commodity
:
For converting time in
monetary terms, the default values for passenger time value and time value of
commodity in transit are based on 1984 prices as per IRC:SP-30.-1984
The values adopted for occupancy of cars, two-wheelers and buses are:
Average occupancy of a car
4.8
Average occupancy of a two-wheeler
1 .5
Average occupancy of a bus
43
(3)
Updating of prices :The rates adopted as default values in respect of (1) and (2)
above are given in Appendix 2. These values are required to be updated to current
prices. This can be done either by (i) specifying current prices of each resource,
or (ii) if current prices of consumables are not known, the 1984 values can be
updated by specifying cost update factors for VOC and time values of passenger
and commodity.

Structure of the Model
The RIDM is structured in three parts (i) Input (ii) Modelling & Simula-
tion and (iii) Results.
1.5.1.
The data input module is arranged in cells A1..G100. This is
designed to create the input data file to run the analysis programme. The module
is fully interactive and presents a formatted screen giving a list of variables for
which values are to be specified by the user to describe road characteristics, terrain,
traffic volume, construction and maintenance costs, etc. for the alternatives to be
evaluated. The variables and their limits are described in Section 3.
1.5.2.
The second part of the model which forms the core module
(Figs. 1 & 2) is stored in a
file named 'ECOCAL.WKT. This

the basic relationships and is password protected to ensure that the formulae are
not tampered with. The programme is invoked by pressing
' Alt and P' keys together
after defining input data. The model using the various relationships and input values
of variables simulates road condition over time and calculates vehicle operating
and travel time costs for the two alternatives in the following sequence:
(i)
Calculates roughness yearwise on the basis of the pavement deterioration rate
and maintenance strategy specified by the user.
(ii)
Based on the initial traffic and growth rates, makes traffic projections by vehicle
type and calculates average daily traffic and PCU/day for each year over the
design period.
(iii)
Calculates economic
costs of construction and maintenance based on
the
financial costs given by the user.
(iv)
Using VOC
relationships, determines
physical
quantities of resources
consumption for cars, buses and trucks for each year of the design period and
then calculates VOC on the basis of unit prices of the consumables.
(v)
Compares the projected traffic (PCU/day)
with the design service volume and
if the traffic volume exceeds the design service volume, the VOCs are adjusted
to account for congestion effect.
(vi)
Selects appropriate speed volume relationships and determines speed of cars,
buses, trucks and two wheelers. A minimum speed of 10 km/hr is assigned if the
calculated speed is less than 10 km/hr.
1.5.3.
Results
: The reporting module
is
also
stored
in
the
file
'ECOCAL.WK1 ' and is fully menu driven for retrieving the output reports. In this
phase relative costs, benefits, net present value and internal rate
of return are
computed and reports generated. Construction and Maintenance costs are identified
as
'Costs' and VOC savings and time savings as
'Benefits'. For the pair of
alternatives to be compared, the model computes year-by-year the costs/benefits
of one alternative over the other. From the time stream of net costs/benefits the
model then calculates net present values for three different discount rates defined
by the user and also computes the internal rate of return. All results are tabulated

and three graphs are generated
(i) NPV v/s Discount Rate (ii) Roughness v/s Year
and (iii) VOC v/s Year. The reports can be displayed/printed or saved in a file
through menu selection. The graphs can also be displayed, saved and printed.
The output reports are described in Section 3.
1.6
.
Limitations of the Programme
The major limitations of the model are:
(i)
Only one pair of alternatives can be compared in each run.
(ii)
It is suitable for
analysis at project level only.
Besides, a road section having
sub-sections of different design standards/traffic volume cannot be evaluated as
a single link alternative.
(iii)
In the absence of pavement deterioration models for Indian conditions, the model
makes use of the
deterioration rates specified by the user.
(iv)
Only
four types of vehicles are considered
-
cars, buses, trucks and
two
wheelers.
(v)
Compilation of the programme is not possible and as such there remains the risk
of effecting unauthorised modification in the programme, though this risk
is
considerably reduced with the core module kept in the password protected file.
