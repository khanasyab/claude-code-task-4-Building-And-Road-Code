ing, roadside commercial activities, pedestrian volumes etc. This 
renders the Level of Service concept for urban roads somewhat 
different than the rural roads. 
	
5.3. Fig. 1 shows the various levels of service in the form of 
indicative volume-flow relationship for urban conditions. Each of the 
levels can be described broadly as under 
Level of Service A : Represents a condition of free flow with average travel 
speeds usually about 90 per cent of the free-flow speed for 
the arterial class. Individual users are virtually unaffected 
by the presence of others in the traffic stream. Freedom 
to select desired speeds and to manoeuvre within the 
traffic stream is high. The general level of comfort and 
convenience provided to the road users is excellent. 
Level of Service B : Represents a zone of stable flow, with the drivers still 
having reasonable freedom to select their desired speed 
and manoeuvre within the traffic stream. Average travel 
speeds are usually about 70 per cent of the free flow speed 
for the arterial class.

   Level of comfort and convenience provided is 
somewhat less than Level of Service A, because the 
presence of other vehicles in the traffic stream begins 
to affect individual behaviour. 
Level of Service C : This also is a zone of stable flow, but marks the beginning 
of the range of flow in which the operation of individual 
users becomes significantly affected by interactions with 
others in the traffic stream. The selection of speed is now 
affected by the presence of others, and manoeuvring within 
the traffic stream requires substantial vigilance on the part 
of the user. The general level of comfort and convenience 
declines noticeably at this level. Average travel speeds are 
about 50 per cent of the average free flow speed. 
Level of Service D: Represents the limit of stable flow, with conditions 
approaching close to unstable flow. Due to high density, 
the drivers are severely restricted in their freedom to 
select desired speed and manoeuvre within the traffic 
stream. The general level of comfort and convenience 
is poor. Small increases in traffic flow will usually cause 
operational problems at this level. Average travel speeds 
are about 40 per cent of free  flow speed. 
Level of Service E : Represents operating conditions when traffic volumes are at 
or close to the capacity level. The speeds are reduced to a low, 
but relatively uniform value, average value being one-third 
the free flow speed. Freedom to manoeuvre within the traffic 
stream is extremely difficult, and is generally accomplished 
ley forcing a vehicle to give way to accommodate such 
manoeuvres. Comfort and convenience are extremely poor, 
and driver frustration is generally high. Operations at this level 
are usually unstable, because small increases in flow or minor 
disturbances within the traffic stream will cause breakdowns. 
Level of Service F : Represents zone of forced or breakdown flow. This 
condition occurs when the amount of traffic approaching a 
point exceeds the amount which can pass it. Queues form 
behind such locations. Operations within the queue are 
characterised by stop-and-go waves, which are extremely 
unstable. Vehicles may progress at a reasonable speed for 
several hundred metres and may then be required to stop in 
a cyclic fashion. Due to high volumes, break-down occurs, 
and long queues and delays result. The average travel speeds 
are between 25 per cent and 33 per cent of free flow speed.
