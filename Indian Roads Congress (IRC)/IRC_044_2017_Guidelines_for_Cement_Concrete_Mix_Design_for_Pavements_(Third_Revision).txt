GUIDELINES FOR  
CEMENT CONCRETE MIX DESIGN FOR PAVEMENTS  
(THIRD REVISION)
Introduction
Concrete has become an indispensable construction material. According to the present 
state-of-the-art, concrete has bypassed the stage of mere four component system, that is, 
cement, water, coarse aggregate and fine aggregates. It can be a combination of far more 
number of ingredients, for example a judicious combination of ingredients from more than 
ten materials. In the recent past, apart from the four ingredients mentioned above, and some 
more ingredients namely fly ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag, silica fume, rice husk 
ash, metakaoline, superplasticizer and fibres are generally used in concrete. Hence, it is all 
the more, plasticizers and retarders, accelerators and air entraining agents essential at this 
juncture to have general guidelines on proportioning the ingredients in concrete mixes. The 
need for the guidelines has been further enhanced by the importance given to proportioned 
concrete mixes in different specifications including IS:456.
The objective of design of concrete mixes is to arrive at the most economical and practical 
combinations and proportions of different ingredients to produce concrete that will meet the 
performance requirements under specified conditions of use. An integral part of concrete 
mix proportioning is the preparation of trial mixes and effecting adjustments to such trials to 
strike a balance between the requirements of placement, that is, workability and strength, 
concomitantly satisfying durability requirements.
Concrete has to be of satisfactory quality both in its fresh and hardened states. This task is 
best accomplished by trial mixes arrived at by the use of certain established relationships 
among different parameters and by analysis of data already generated thereby developing 
a basis for judicious combination of all the ingredients involved. The basic principles which 
underline the proportioning of mixes are Abram’s law for strength development and Lyse’s rule 
for making mix with adequate workability for placement in a dense state so as to enable the 
strength development as contemplated. From practical point of view, compressive strength 
is often taken as an index of acceptability. This does not necessarily satisfy the requirements 
of durability unless examined under specific context. Mix proportioning is generally carried 
out for a particular compressive strength or flexural strength requirements ensuring that fresh 
concrete of the mix so proportioned possesses adequate workability for placement without 
segregation and bleeding while attaining a dense state.
Proportioning of concrete mixes can be regarded as a procedure set to proportion the most 
economical concrete mix for specified durability and grade for required site conditions. The 
basic principle of the concrete mix design is to select the proportion of all the ingredients 
on the basis of their absolute volume and taking total absolute volume of concrete 1 m3. In 
the present code apart from Guidelines for Cement Concrete Mix Design for Pavement of 
standard grade of concrete, approach to mix proportioning for high strength concrete and 
pervious concrete is also introduced. In the present Guidelines, the absolute volume of air

has been considered as 1.5 per cent for 9.5 mm, 1.0 per cent for 19 mm and 0.8 per cent for 
31.5 mm maximum size of aggregate.
As a guarantor of quality of concrete in the construction, the contractor should carry out mix 
proportioning and the Engineer-in-Charge should approve the mix so proportioned. The mix 
design method given in these Guidelines is to be regarded as Guidelines only, to arrive at 
an acceptable proportions satisfying the requirement of placement, development of strength 
with age and durability.
The Draft IRC:44 “Guidelines for Cement Concrete Mix Design for Pavements” (Third 
Revision) was taken up by the Rigid Pavement Committee (H-3). The revised draft was 
prepared by Sub Group comprising of Shri V.V. Arora, Dr. S.C. Maiti, Shri J.B. Sengupta, Shri 
Binod Kumar, Dr. Pardeep Kumar Gupta and Shri Suresh Kumar. The draft was deliberated 
in a series of meetings. The H-3 Committee finally approved the draft document in its meeting 
held on 15th October, 2016 and decided to send the final draft to IRC for placing before the 
HSS Committee.

The Highways Specifications & Standards Committee (HSS) considered and approved the 
draft document in its meeting held on 23rd June, 2017. The Executive Committee in its meeting 
held on 13th July, 2017 considered and approved the same document for placing it before 
the Council. The Council in its 212th meeting held at Udaipur on 14th and 15th July, 2017 
considered and approved the draft IRC:44 “Guidelines for Cement Concrete Mix Design for 
Pavements” (Third Revision) for publishing.
In this third revision, the following major modifications have been made:
	
(a)	
In the present document Guidelines for Cement Concrete Mix Design for 
Pavement of standard grade of concrete, approach to mix proportioning for 
high strength concrete and pervious concrete are also introduced.
	
(b)	
The guidelines modify the procedure to fix the target mean strength for mix 
proportioning based on flexural strength or compressive strength and for each 
case two different equations are given and it is recommended to adopt the 
higher value as target mean strength. The recommended combined grading 
requirement of fine aggregate and coarse aggregate is also introduced.
	
(c)	
The maximum size of coarse aggregate for pavement construction is 
modified to 31.5 mm and the sieve sizes of aggregates are tuned to MORTH 
Specifications.
	
(d)	
The requirements for selection of standard deviation, air content, water-
cement ratio, water content and estimation of quantity of coarse and fine 
aggregate, trial mixes, illustrative examples have been reviewed and 
accordingly modified.
	
(e)	
Illustrative examples of concrete mix proportioning for standard grade 
concrete based on both i.e. flexural strength and compressive strength, 
high strength concrete and pervious concrete are given as Annexure. The 
uses of mineral and chemical admixture as one of the ingredients have been 
included.
	
(f)	
The adjustment on water content and aggregate content is also explained if 
the aggregates lying are in wet or dry condition.
In this revision, assistance has also been derived from ACI:211.1 (Re-approved 2014) 
‘Standard Practice for Selecting Proportions for Normal, Heavyweight, Mass Concrete, High 
Strength and pervious Concrete’, American Concrete Institute and also from IS:10262.

1 SCOPE
1.1	
This standard lays down the guidelines for design of concrete mixes as per the 
requirements by proportioning the concrete making materials including other supplementary 
materials. The proportioning of materials is carried out to achieve specified characteristic 
strength, workability and durability requirements. This standard does not cover mix design for 
roller compacted concrete/dry lean concrete for which seperate IRC guidelines are available.
2 DEFINITIONS
2.1	
For the purpose of these guidelines, the definitions given in IS:456-2000, IS:4845 
and IS:6461 (Part-I to IV) shall apply. The commonly used terms are given below:
2.2	
Characteristic Strength of Concrete
The characteristics strength is defined as the strength of concrete below which not more than 
5 per cent of the test results are expected to fall.
2.3	
Pozzolana
An essentially siliceous material which while in itself possessing little or no cementitious 
properties will, in finely divided from and in the presence of water, react with calcium 
hydroxide at ambient temperature to form compounds possessing cementitious properties. 
The Pozzolanic materials are Flyash (pulverized fuel ash), Silica fume and Metakaoline etc.
2.4	
Granulated Blast Furnace Slag
Blast furnace slag is non-metallic product consisting essentially of glass containing silicates 
and alumina silicates of lime and other bases, which are developed simultaneously with iron 
in blast furnace or electric pig iron furnace. Granulated slag is obtained by further processing 
the molten slag by rapidly chilling or quenching it with water or steam and air. Blast furnace 
slag in granulated form is used for the manufacture of hydraulic cement.
2.5	
Aggregate
Granular material, generally inert & such as natural and manufactured sand , natural & 
crushed gravel, crushed stone, crushed iron or steel slag, recycled concrete aggregate or 
combination thereof used for making concrete or mortar.

example: Iron slag & Steel slag, Copper slag, and Recycled Concrete Aggregates (RCA).
2.8	
Water/Cement Ratio (w/c)
The water/cement ratio (w/c) is calculated by dividing the mass of the mixing water by the 
mass of the cement.
2.9	
The Water/Cementitious Materials Ratio (w/cm)
The Water/Cementitious Materials Ratio (w/cm) is the ratio of mass of the mixing water and 
the mass of the cement, fly ash and other cementitious materials.

Where the grading falls outside the limits of any particular grading zone of sieves other

4.2	
Target Strength for Mix Proportioning
In order that not more than 5 per cent of test results are likely to fall below the characteristic 
strength, the concrete mix has to be design for higher target mean compressive strength (f’ck) 
or flexural strength (f’cr.). The margin over characteristic strength is given by the following 
relation: 
4.2.1	
Based on flexural strength
	
f’cr = fcr + 1.65 x Sf
	
OR
	
f’cr = fcr + 0.55
	
Whichever is higher.
	
Where
	
f’ cr = target mean flexural strength at 28 days, N/mm2
	
fcr = characteristic flexural strength at 28 days, N/mm2
	
Sf = standard deviation of flexural strength, N/mm2
4.2.2	
Based on compressive strength
	
f’ck = fck + 1.65 x Sc
	
OR
	
f’ck = fck + X (The value of X is given in Table 4)

Standard deviation based on test results of samples
	
a)	
Number of test results of samples – The total number of test results of 
samples required for calculation of standard deviation shall be not less than 
30. Attempts should be made to obtain the 30 samples (taken from site), 
as early as possible, when a mix is used for the first time, to validate and 
improve the mix design (if required).
	
b)	
In case of significant changes in concrete – When significant changes are 
made in the production of concrete batches (for example changes in the 
materials used, mix proportioning, equipment or technical control), the 
standard deviation value shall be separately calculated for such batches of 
concrete.
	
c)	
Standard deviation to be brought up to date – The calculation of the standard 
deviation shall be brought up to date periodically and after every change 
of mix proportioning. The standard deviation should be checked every 
month subject to minimum 30 results to ensure that it is less than the value 
considered in mix design.

Assumed standard deviation
Where sufficient test results for a particular grade of concrete are not available the value of 
standard deviation given in Table 5 for mix designs based on flexural strength and Table 6 for 
mix designs based on compressive strength may be assumed for proportioning of mix in the 
first instance. These values correspond to good degree of site control having proper storage 
of cement; weigh batching of all materials; controlled addition of water; regular checking of 
all materials, aggregate grading and moisture content; and periodical checking of workability 
and strength. As soon as the results of samples are available, actual calculated standard 
deviation shall be used and the mix re-proportioned accordingly. (However, when adequate 
past records for a similar grade exist and are justified to the designer a value of standard 
deviation different from that shown in Table 5 for mix designs based on flexural strength and 
Table 6 for mix designs based on compressive strength is permitted to be used).

Since different cements, supplementary cementitious materials and aggregates of different 
maximum size, grading, surface texture, shape and other characteristics may produce 
concretes of different compressive strength for the same free water-cement ratio, the 
relationship between strength and free water-cement ratio should preferably be established 
for the materials actually to be used. In the absence of such data, the preliminary free water-
cement ratio (by mass) corresponding to the design strength at 28 days may be selected 
from the established relationship, if available. Otherwise, the Table 8 and Table 9 given 
below may be used as a starting point for selection of water-cement ratio for the mix designs 
based on flexural strength and compressive strength respectively.

While using PPC or PSC, the water cement ratio should be taken based on the 28 day 
strength of cement. In the absence of data on 28 day strength of cement for PPC or PSC, the 
w/c ratio values given for 43 grade OPC can be utilized for trials.
The Supplementary cementitious materials that is, mineral admixtures shall also be considered 
in water-cement ratio calculations and be referred as water-cementitious materials ratio.
The maximum water cement ratio shall be restricted to 0.40 for the respective grade as per 
IRC:15.
Water-cement ratio, for strengths other than as mentioned in Tables 8 & 9, may be interpolated. 
4.4.3	
Selection of water content and chemical admixture (superplasticizer) content
The water content of concrete is influenced by a number of factors such as aggregate 
size, aggregate shape, aggregate texture, workability, water-cement ratio, cement and 
other supplementary cementitious materials type and content, chemical admixture and 
environmental conditions. An increase in aggregates size, a reduction in water-cement ratio 
and slump, and use of water reducing admixtures will reduce the water demand. On the 
other hand increased temperature, cement content, slump, water-cement ratio, aggregate 
angularity and a decrease in the proportion of the coarse aggregate to fine aggregate will 
increase water demand.
The quantity of approximate mixing water per unit volume of concrete for saturated surface 
dry aggregate may be determined from Table 10. The water content in Table 10 is for angular 
coarse aggregate and for 50 mm slump and may be adjusted after trials. The water content 
suggested in Table 10 may be reduced by approximately 10 kg for sub-angular aggregates, 
15 kg for gravel with some crushed particles and 20 kg for rounded gravel to produce same 
workability. For the desired workability (other than 50 mm slump range), the required water 



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:44-2017
16
content may be established by trial or an increase by about 3 per cent for every additional 
25 mm slumps or alternatively by use of chemical admixture conforming to IS:9103. This 
illustrates the need for trial batch testing of local materials as each aggregate source is 
different and can influence concrete properties differently. Water reducing admixture or super 
plasticizing admixtures usually decrease water content by 5 to 10 per cent and by 20 per cent 
and above respectively at appropriate dosages.

These quantities of mixing water shall be used in computing cement/cementitious material 
contents for trial mixes.
On account of long distances over which concrete needs to be carried from batching 
plant/RMC plant, the concrete mix is generally designed for a higher slump initially 
than the slump required at the time of placing. The initial slump value shall depend on 
the distance of transport and loss of slump with time.
4.4.4	
Calculation of cement/cementitious material content
The cement and supplementary cementitious material content per unit volume of concrete 
may be calculated from the free water-cement ratio (see para 4.4.2) and the quantity of water 
per unit volume of concrete.
In certain situations, while using part replacement of cement by flyash, GGBFS, silica fume 
and metakaoline increase in cementitious material content may be warranted, particularly if 
flyash is 20 per cent or more and GGBFS is 30 per cent or more. The decision on increase in 
cementitious material content and its percentage may be based on experience and trials or 
the cementitious content so calculated may be increased by 10 per cent for preliminary trial. 
The cement/cementitious material content so calculated shall be checked against the 
minimum and maximum cement/cementitious material content requirements. In case cement/
cementitious material content worked out is lower than the stipulated minimum cement/
cementitious material content, the greater of the two values shall be adopted. 
The minimum cement/cementitious material content shall be 360 kg/m3 and maximum 
cement content not including mineral admixtures shall be 450 kg/m3 except when mentioned 
otherwise in the applicable specifications. For high strength concrete higher cement content 
may be considered as per the requirement of mix design.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:44-2017
17
In case fly ash (as per IS:3812- Part 1) is blended at site, the quantity of fly ash shall be 
restricted to 25 per cent by weight of cementitious material content and the quantity of OPC 
in such a blend shall not be less than 310 kg/m3. In case of GGBFS, minimum cement 
content shall be 250 kg. If this minimum OPC content is not sufficient to produce concrete of 
the specified strength, it shall be increased as necessary.
4.4.5	
Estimation of coarse and fine aggregate contents
4.4.5.1	
Estimation of coarse aggregate proportion in total aggregate
Aggregates of essentially the same nominal maximum size, type and grading will produce 
concrete of satisfactory workability when a given volume of coarse aggregate is used per unit 
volume of concrete. Approximate values for this aggregate volume are given in Table 11 for 
a water-cement ratio of 0.50, which may be suitably adjusted for other water-cement ratios. 
The values so obtained shall be checked for combined grading to ensure that overall grading 
falls within the limits of Table 3. If not, suitable adjustment in the volumes of coarse and fine 
aggregate may be made. The proportion of volume of coarse aggregates is increased at the 
rate of 0.01 m3 for every decrease in water-cement ratio by 0.05 and decreased at the rate 
of 0.01 m3 for every increase in water-cement ratio by 0.05. It can be seen that for equal 
workability, the volume of coarse aggregate in a unit volume of concrete is dependent only on 
its nominal maximum size and grading zone of fine aggregate. Differences in the amount of 
mortar required for workability with different aggregates, due to differences in particle shape 
and grading, can be adjusted by changing coarse to fine aggregate ratios. Generally higher 
fine aggregate content is required for crushed angular coarse aggregates due to increased 
surface area.
For more workable concrete mixes which is sometimes required when placement is by pump, 
it may be desirable to reduce the estimated coarse aggregate content determined using 
Table 11 up to 10 per cent.
Volumes are based on aggregates in saturated surface dry condition for angular aggregate 
and suitable adjustments may be made for other shapes of aggregate.

4.4.5.2	
Estimation of coarse and fine aggregate contents
With the completion of procedure given in paras 4.4.3 and 4.4.4, all the ingredients have been 
estimated except the coarse and fine aggregate content. These quantities are determined 
by finding out the absolute volume of cementitious material, water and the chemical 
admixture; by dividing their mass by their respective specific gravity, multiplying by 1/1000 
and subtracting the result of their summation from unit volume. The values so obtained 
are divided into coarse and fine aggregate fractions by volume in accordance with coarse 
aggregate proportion already determined in para 4.4.5.1. The coarse and fine aggregate 
contents are then determined by multiplying absolute volume with their respective specific 
gravities and multiplying by 1000.
4.4.5.3	
Check for combined grading of fine & coarse aggregate
It is recommended to achieve the combined grading of fine and coarse aggregates as per 
Table 3. Graded coarse aggregates or single-sized coarse aggregates of nominal size shall 
be mixed in suitable proportions with fine aggregate and/or the volumes of coarse and fine 
aggregates shall be adjusted suitably to achieve the combined grading requirement of Table 3.
4.5	
Trial Mixes
4.5.1	
The calculated mix proportions shall be checked by means of trial batches
Workability of the Trial Mix No. 1 shall be measured. The mix shall be carefully observed for 
freedom from segregation and bleeding and its finishing properties. If the measured workability 
of Trial Mix No. 1 is different from the stipulated value, the water and/or admixture content 
shall be adjusted suitably. With this adjustment, the mix proportion shall be recalculated 
keeping the free water cement ratio at the pre-selected value, which will comprise Trial Mix 
No. 2. In addition two more Trial Mixes No. 3 and 4 shall be made with the water content 
same as Trial Mix No. 2 and varying the free water-cement ratio by ± 10 per cent of the 
preselected value.
Mix No. 2 to 4 normally provides sufficient information, including the relationship between 
compressive strength and water-cement ratio, from which the mix proportions for field trails 
may be arrived at. The concrete for field trials shall be produced by methods of actual concrete 
production.
For the recommended mix proportions, the yield of the mix shall be checked and the mix 
proportions shall be adjusted proportionately to meet the requirement of yield of 1 m3 of 
concrete. 
4.5.2	
Early prediction of 28 days compressive strength results as per IS:9013-1978 
may be adopted for interim recommendation of mix design for concrete upto M60 grade 
made using OPC and normal superplasticiser. However, the production of concrete before 
actual 28 days results of trial mixes shall be done on the lower w/c ratio by 0.02 in the above 
recommendation. For concrete M65 and above, the recommendation shall only be based on 
28 days compressive strength results.

5 APPROACH TO MIX PROPORTIONING FOR HIGH STRENGTH CONCRETE  
(GRADE M65 & ABOVE)
5.1	
Introduction
High Strength Concrete is defined as the concrete that has characteristic compressive 
strength of 65 N/mm2 or more. This part provides the guidance for selecting mix proportion 
for M 65 or above.
Usually, for high strength concrete mixes specially selected cementitious material and 
chemical admixtures i.e. super plasticizers are used, and achieving a low water – cementitious 
material ratio (w/cm) is considered essential. 
The procedure for proportioning high strength concrete is similar to that required for ordinary/
standard strength concrete. The procedure consists of series of steps that, when completed, 
provide a mixture meeting workability, strength and durability requirements based on the 
combined properties of the individually selected and proportioned ingredients.
5.2	
Concrete Material
Material shall be selected, proportioned & controlled carefully to achieve effective production 
of high strength concrete. The optimum proportions should be selected, considering the 
cement & other cementitious material properties, aggregate quality, aggregate gradation, 
paste volume, admixture type and dosage rate and mixing.
5.2.1	
Cementitious material
Proper selection of type of cement is very important step for the production of high strength 
concrete. Flyash, Silica fume, GGBFS or Metakaoline are widely used as a cementitious and 
pozzolanic ingredient in high Strength Concrete. 
5.2.2	
Coarse aggregate
In the proportioning of high strength concrete, the aggregates require special consideration 
and they greatly influence the strength and other properties of concrete. Therefore, the 
coarse aggregate should be strong, sufficiently sound, free of fissures or weak planes, clean 
and free of surface coating & shall meet the requirement of IS:383.
5.2.3	
Fine aggregate
The fine aggregates shall meet the requirements of IS:383. Generally, for high strength, a 
fine aggregate of coarser size is preferred i.e. Zone I or Zone II Sand because of high fines 
contents available from the cementitious materials.
5.2.4	
Chemical admixtures
High Strength Concrete mixes generally have a low-cementitious material ratio (w/cm). 
These low w/cm ratios are only attainable with High – range water-reducing admixtures 
(HRWRAS) which also help in dispersing cement particles. HRWRAS which can reduce

Estimate of mixing water
The trial batching is the most effective way to determine the best proportions for the ingredients 
to be used. The water content in the chemical admixture (high range water reducing agents, 
HRWRA) shall be calculated to be a part of the w/cm ratio. Table 14 gives estimates of 
maximum mixing water for high strength concrete. The water content is for 50 mm slump. 
For the desired workability (other than 50 mm slump), the required water content may be 
increased or decreased by about 3 per cent for each increase or decrease of 25 mm slump or 
may be established by trial. These quantities of mixing water are maximum for well shaped, 
clean, angular and well graded coarse aggregates. Since the particle shape and surface 
texture of fine aggregate can significantly influence the mixing water demand, the water 
requirement may be different from the values given in Table 14 and shall be established by 
trials.

Water content mentioned above corresponding to saturated surface dry aggregate. These 
quantities of mixing water are for use in computing cement/cementitious material content 
for trial mixes. On account of long distances over which concrete needs to be carried from 
batching plant/RMC plant, the concrete mix is generally designed for a higher slump initially 
than the slump required at the time of placing. The initial slump value shall depend on the 
distance of transport and loss of slump with time.
5.3.5	
Selection of water – cementitious material ratio (w/cm)
The w/cm ratio is calculated by dividing the mass of the mixing water by the combined mass 
of the cement and flyash (and other cementitious materials). In Table 15, recommended 
maximum w/cm ratio is given as a function of maximum – size aggregates to achieve different 
compressive strength at 28 days. The use of an HRWRA generally increases the compressive 
strength of concrete. The w/cm values given in Table 15 are for concrete made with HRWRA.

Calculate cementitious material content
The cement and supplementary cementitious material content per unit volume of concrete 
may be calculated from the quantity of water (para 5.3.4) and the free water-cementitious 
materials ratio (para 5.3.5) per unit volume of concrete. However, this must satisfy the 
specification of maximum or minimum limit on the amount of cementitious material as per 
IRC:15.
If cement content (not including fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag) more than 
the maximum cement content as given in IRC:15 is to be used, it shall be ensured that the

special consideration has been given in design to the increased risk of cracking due to drying 
shrinkage, or to early thermal cracking and to the increased risk of damage due to alkali silica 
reactions.
The recommended dosages of different pozzolanic materials for high strength mixes are 
given in Table 16.

Estimation of coarse aggregate proportion
The optimum content of the coarse aggregate depends on its strength and maximum nominal 
size of coarse aggregate. For proportioning of ordinary and standard grades of concrete, the 
optimum volume of coarse aggregate is given as a function of the maximum size of coarse 
aggregate and grading zone of fine aggregate. However, high strength grades of concrete are 
not dependent on the fine aggregate to provide fines for lubrication and consolidation of the 
fresh concrete as the mixes have high content of cementitious material. The recommended 
coarse aggregate volume per Unit Volume of total Aggregate for Different Zones of Fine 
Aggregate is given in Table 17.

Volumes are based on aggregates in saturated surface dry condition. These volumes are 
for Crushed (angular) aggregate and suitable adjustments may be made for other shape 
of aggregate. The above table is valid for w/cm material ratio of 0.30. For every decrease 
of 0.05 in w/cm ratio, the above ratio (volume of coarse aggregates) will be increased 
approximately by 0.01 & for every increase of 0.05 in w/cm ratio, the above ratio (volume of 
coarse aggregates) will be decreased approximately by 0.01. 
5.3.8	
Estimation of fine and coarse aggregate contents
With the completion of procedure given in paras 5.3.4 and 5.3.5, all the ingredients have 
been estimated except the coarse and fine aggregate content. These quantities are 
determined by finding out the absolute volume of cementitious material, water and the

chemical admixture; by dividing their mass by their respective specific gravity, multiplying 
by 1/1000 and subtracting the result of their summation from unit volume. The values so 
obtained are divided into coarse and fine aggregate fractions by volume in accordance 
with coarse aggregate proportion already determined in para 5.3.7. The coarse and fine 
aggregate contents are then determined by multiplying with their respective specific gravities 
and multiplying by 1000.
5.3.9	
Trial mixes
The calculated mix proportions shall be checked by means of trial mixes. Workability of the 
Trial Mix No. 1 shall be measured. The mix shall be carefully observed for freedom from 
segregation and bleeding and its finishing properties. If the measured workability of Trial 
Mix No. 1 is different from the stipulated value, the water and/or admixture content shall be 
adjusted suitably. With this adjustment, the mix proportion shall be recalculated keeping 
the free water-cement ratio at the pre-selected value, which will comprise Trial Mix No. 2. 
In additional two more Trial Mixes No. 3 and 4 shall be made with the water content same as 
Trial Mix No. 2 and varying the free water-cement ratio by ±10 per cent of the preselected value.
Mix No. 2 to 4 normally provides sufficient information, including the relationship between 
compressive strength and water-cementitious materials ratio, from which the mix proportions 
can be finalized. Additional field trials are recommended particularly for workability 
requirements. The concrete for field trials shall be produced by methods of actual concrete 
production.
6 PERVIOUS CONCRETE
6.1	
Introduction
The term pervious concrete typically describes a zero slump, open graded material consisting 
of Portland cement, coarse aggregate, little or no fine aggregate, admixture and water. The 
combination of these ingredients will produce a hardened material with connected pores 
that allow water to pass through easily. The void content can range from 15-35% with typical 
compressive strength of 5 MPa to 25 MPa. The drainage rate of pervious concrete pavement 
will vary with aggregate size and density of the mixture and will generally fall in the range of 
0.135 to 1.22 cm/sec. Higher the fine content lesser will be the void contents and permeability. 
The concrete with low void contents are prone to clogging by water containing soil particles.
6.2	
Materials
Pervious concrete is composed of cement or a combination of cement, coarse aggregate, 
and water. A small amount of fine aggregate may be incorporated to increase compressive 
strength. All materials should conform to the appropriate IS Specifications. A combination of 
cementitious materials that each conform to the appropriate IS Specifications can be used. 
Chemical admixtures are commonly used to improve various characteristics of pervious 
concrete. They should meet the appropriate IS Specifications or other Specifications that 
produce an acceptable mixture.

Mix Proportioning
6.3.1	
Data for mix proportioning
The following data are required for mix proportioning of a particular grade of pervious concrete:
	
a)	
Grade designation (required compressive strength)
	
b)	
Range of water permeability
	
c)	
Type of cement
	
d)	
Maximum nominal size of aggregate
	
e)	
Whether a chemical admixture shall or shall not be used and the type of 
chemical admixture and the extent of use.
	
f)	
Whether a mineral admixture shall or shall not to be used and the type of 
mineral admixture and the extent of use.
6.3.2	
Target strength for mix proportioning 
In order that not more than the specified proportions of test results are likely to fall below 
the characteristic strength, the concrete mix has to be proportioned for higher target mean 
compressive strength (f’ck). The margin over characteristic compressive strength is given by 
the following relation:
	
f’ck  = fck + 1.65 x Sc
	
where
	
f’ ck = target mean compressive strength at 28 days, N/mm2
	
fck   = characteristic compressive strength at 28 days, N/mm2
	
Sc   = standard deviation of compressive strength, N/mm2
6.3.2.1	
Assumed standard deviation
Where sufficient test results for a particular grade of concrete are not available the value of 
standard deviation given in Table 18 for mix designs based on compressive strength may be 
assumed for proportioning of mix.

6.3.3	
Selection of water- cementitious materials ratio
The water-cementitious material ratio (w/cm) is an important consideration for obtaining 
desired strength and void structure in pervious concrete. A high w/cm reduces the adhesion 
of the paste to the aggregate and causes the paste to flow and fill the voids even when lightly 
compacted. A low w/cm will prevent good mixing and tend to cause balling in the mixer, 
prevent an even distribution of cement paste, and therefore reduce the ultimate strength 
and durability of the concrete. Experience has shown that w/cm in the range of 0.26 to 0.45 
will provide the best aggregate coating and paste stability. The conventional w/cm-versus-
compressive strength relationship for normal concrete does not apply to pervious concrete. 
Careful control of aggregate moisture and w/cm is important to produce consistent pervious 
concrete.
6.3.4	
Void content
6.3.4.1	
To ensure the water will percolate through pervious concrete, the void content 
should be 15 per cent or greater, as given in Table 19. If void content is lower than that of 
15 per cent, there is no significant percolation thought the concrete and there is not sufficient 
interconnectivity between the voids to allow for rapid percolation.
Higher the void content, higher is the percolation rate and lower is the compressive strength. 
The lower the void content, lower is the percolation rate and higher the compressive strength. 
The compressive strength increases as the nominal maximum-size aggregate decreases. 
Compressive strength of pervious concrete is also a function of the aggregate strength, paste 
bonding characteristics, and strength of the cement paste itself. Some caution should be 
used when applying these quantitative numbers to practical design, as standardize methods 
do not yet exist for these properties of pervious concrete; prior discussion should be taken 
as purely qualitative. 
6.3.4.2	
The void content present in pervious concrete can be calculated by using the

Estimation of paste volume (Vp), cement (c), and water content (w)
The proportioning of pervious concrete seeks to establish the minimum volume of paste 
necessary to bind aggregate particles together, while maintaining the necessary void structure, 
strength, and Table 21 can be used to estimate the volume of the paste for a mixture using 
maximum size of aggregate 9.5 mm.

The above value of paste volume is for the mixes having no fine aggregate. When the fine 
aggregate is used, the paste volume should be reduced by 2 per cent for each 10 per cent 
fine aggregate of the total aggregate for well compacted pervious concrete and by 1 per cent 
for each 10 per cent fine aggregate of the total aggregate for lightly compacted pervious 
concrete. These reductions are necessary to maintain the same per cent voids by volume.
Once the paste volume is determined from Table 21, and the w/cm selected, the cement and 
water quantities can be determined from the following absolute volume relationships:
Paste volume	 Vp	 	
= cement volume + water volume
	
	
Vp	 	
= c/(3.15x1000 kg/m3)+w/1000 kg/m3
Substituting w= (w/cm)c,
	
	
Vp	 	
= c/(3.15x1000 kg/m3)+[(w/cm)c/1000 kg/m3]
c can be determined quickly by trial and error on spreadsheet or algebraically reduced to
	
	
c = [(Vp/(0.315+w/cm)] x1000 kg/m3
(1)
Therefore, once the paste volume is determined from Table 21, and the w/cm is selected, the 
mass of cement can be calculated from Eq. (1). From the mass of cement, the water content 
can be computed.
6.3.6	
Estimation of coarse aggregate proportion
With the completion of procedure given in para 6.3.3, all the ingredients have been 
estimated except the coarse aggregate content. The absolute volume of pervious concrete 
shall be determined by subtracting the volume of voids from the unit volume. The volume of 
cementitious material, water and the chemical admixture shall be determined by dividing their 
mass by their respective specific gravity and multiplying by 1/1000. The volume of aggregate 
shall be determined by subtracting the volume of cementitious material, water and chemical 
admixture from the absolute volume of pervious concrete. The value so obtained is then 
multiplied by specific gravity of coarse aggregate and multiplied by 1000 to obtain the mass 
of coarse aggregate.
6.3.7	
Trial mixes
Minimum three trials shall be conducted with paste content determined as above and 
± 10 per cent paste content. Cylinder specimens of size 100 mm x 200 mm or 150 mm x 
300 mm (3 for each trials) shall be cast for permeability testing (as per procedure given in 
Annexure A) and concrete cubes of size 150 mm x 150 mm x 150 mm shall be cast for 
compressive strength (to be tested as per procedure similar to IS:516). Testing to be done 
after 7-Day/28-Day water curing as per specifications.
6.3.8	
Water permeability test
The testing method for measuring water permeability of pervious concrete is given in 
Annexure A.

7 EXAMPLES
The illustrative examples of concrete mix proportioning for conventional concrete pavement 
is given in Annexure B and C for mix design based on flexural strength of concrete for 
4.5N/mm2 flexural strength with and without flyash and M40 grade of concrete respectively. 
Another illustrative example of M60 grade of concrete for special applications, using silica 
fume is given in Annexure D. The mix proportioning of pervious concrete using no fine 
aggregate and using fine aggregate is given in Annexure E and F respectively. These 
examples are merely illustrative to explain the procedure and the actual mix proportioning 
shall be based on trial batches with the given materials.
The quantities of coarse and fine aggregates are based on aggregates in saturated surface 
dry conditions. 
To determine the mix proportion based on aggregate in dry condition, the following procedure 
shall be adopted:
	
i)	
The quantities of both coarse and fine aggregates shall be divided by 1 plus 
their respective water absorptions.
	
ii)	
The values thus determined shall be the mass of aggregate content in dry 
condition.
	
iii)	
The water content shall be increased by an amount equal to the difference 
of mass of aggregate in Saturated Surface Dry (SSD) condition and dry 
condition.
To determine the mix proportion based on aggregate in wet condition, the following procedure 
shall be adopted:
	
i)	
Determine the total moisture content of fine aggregate and coarse aggregate.
	
ii)	
The quantities of both coarse and fine aggregates in Saturated Surface Dry 
(SSD) condition shall be divided by 1 plus their respective water absorptions. 
This will give the dry mass of the aggregates.
	
iii)	
Multiply the dry mass so obtained by 1 plus total moisture content. The value 
so obtained will be the mass of wet aggregate i.e. sum of mass of aggregate 
in SSD condition and surface moisture present in aggregate.
	
iv)	
The mass of surface moisture = Mass of Aggregate in wet condition – Mass 
of Aggregate in SSD condition.
	
v)	
The water content shall be reduced by an amount equal to the mass of 
surface moisture present in aggregate.

A2.1 	
Apparatus for Testing Infiltration Rate
A2.1.1	
Water Container – A cylindrical container typically made of plastic having a volume 
of at least 2000 ml, and from which water may be easily poured at a controlled rate into the 
funnel.
A2.1.2	
Funnel – Watertight and sufficiently right to frame (see Fig. 1). The funnel shall 
have a capacity of 200 ml.
A2.1.3	
Shrink Wrap – Heat shrink plastic film (polymer plastic film). Shrink wrap shall be 
made of non-absorbent material which does not react with cement paste.
A2.1.4	
Stopwatch or Clock – Accurate to 0, 1 s.
A2.1.5	
Water – Potable water.
A2.1.6	
Heat Gun – Air heating system to fully wrap the specimens by heating the shrink 
wrap.
A3	
SAMPLING
The test shall be performed with a minimum of three similar specimens. The specimens shall 
be made based on the specifications applicable to the project and area of construction.
A4	
PROCEDURE
A4.1	
Making the test specimen in the laboratory – A test specimen shall have a 
minimum diameter of 100 mm. There are two options for preparing the specimen, one with 
the specimen having a vertical porosity distribution representative of a field placement, and 
one with a more even porosity in the vertical direction.
A4.1.1 	
For the test specimen with a typical porosity distribution, the concrete shall be 
poured in one lift and consolidated with a rod by rammer. After consolidation is complete, 
the side of the mould is lightly tapped with a wooden or plastic hammer to remove foam 
generated by the compaction rod.



======================================================================
PAGE 38 of 64
======================================================================
IRC:44-2017
30
A4.1.2	
For the test specimen with a more even porosity in the vertical direction, the 
concrete shall be poured in lifts and consolidated with a rod by rammer after each lift. For 
specimens with a diameter of 100 mm and height of 200 mm, there shall be three lifts. After 
consolidation is complete, the side of the mould is lightly tapped with a wooden or plastic 
hammer to remove foam generated by the compaction rod.
A4.1.3	
The specimens shall be immediately covered after consolidation.
A4.1.4	
Curing – The specimens shall remain in the covered mould and the mould shall 
be removed after a minimum curing period of 7 days.
A4.2	
Obtaining test specimen from the field – Cut cores the full depth of the pervious 
concrete slab. Cores area a minimum 100 mm in diameter:
A4.3	
Wrapping – Wrap the specimen with three layers of shrink wrap and tape the 
vertical seam full length. Trim the wrap even with the bottom of specimen and leave at least 
a 50 mm lip on the top to hold the minimal head.
A4.4	
Heating Shrink Wrap – Heat the wrap with a heat gun to tighten the wrap on the 
vertical surface of the sample. This should prevent the flow of water between the wrap and 
the exterior of the sample. Do not heat the top 50 mm lip. The inner surface of the wrap shall 
be marked or scored with two lines at a distance of 15 mm and 25 mm from the top of the 
sample.
A4.5 	
Pre-wetting – Place the specimen upright in the funnel to allow to freely flow out 
of the bottom. Pour water into the specimen at a rate sufficient to maintain a head between 
the two marked lines. Use a total of 1000 ml of water for 100 mm diameter specimens.
A4.6	
Pour the water into the specimen at a rate sufficient to maintain a head between 
the two marked lines and until the measured amount of water has been used. Begin timing 
as soon as the water impacts the pervious concrete surface. Stop timing when free water 
is no longer present on the pervious surface. The test shall be started within 5 min after the 
completion of the pre-wetting. Record the amount of water (2000 ml for 100 mm diameter 
specimens) to the nearest 10 ml. Record the testing duration (t) to the nearest 0,1 s.

DESIGN FLEXURAL STRENGTH FOR MIX PROPORTIONING
	
f’cr = fcr+1.65 Sf
	
or
	
f’cr = fcr + 0.55
	
Whichever is higher
Where
	
f’cr = target mean flexural strength strength at 28 days,
	
fcr = characteristic flexural strength at 28 days, and
	
Sf = standard deviation of flexural strength.
	
From Table 5, standard deviation, Sf = 0.40 N/mm2.
Therefore, target strength using both equations i.e.
i)	
f’cr = fcr + 1.65 Sf
	
= 4.5 +1.65 x 0.40 = 5.16 N/mm2
ii)	
f’cr = fcr + 0.45 
	
= 4.5 + 0.55 = 5.05 N/mm2
	
The higher value is to be adopted. Therefore, target strength will be 5.16 N/mm2 
as 5.16 N/mm2 > 5.05 N/mm2.
B4	
APPROXIMATE AIR CONTENT
From Table 7, the approximate amount of entrapped air to be expected in normal (non-air-
entrained) concrete is 0.8 per cent for 31.5 mm nominal maximum size of aggregate.
B5	
SELECTION OF WATER-CEMENT RATIO
From Table 8, the free water-cement ratio required for the target strength of 5.16 N/mm2 is 
0.32 (interpolated value) for OPC-43 grade. This is lower than the maximum value of 0.40.
0.32 < 0.40, hence O.K.
B6	
SELECTION OF WATER CONTENT
From Table 10, water content for 31.5 mm aggregate = 165 kg/m3 (for 50 mm slump)

As super plasticizer is proposed to be used, a minimum of 20 per cent water content can be 
reduced (vide para 4.4.3 for details). For the purpose of present trial exercise, a reduction of 
water content of 20 per cent has been assumed by adjusting suitably the doses of the super 
plasticizer. The designer can use this reduction as per his requirement of the availability 
of the grade of cement and quality of super plasticizer. With 20 per cent reduction in water 
content, the reduced water content equals to 160 x 0.80 = 128 kg

PROPORTION OF VOLUME OF COARSE AGGREGATE AND FINE

From Table 11 Volume of coarse aggregate per unit volume of total aggregate corresponding 
to 31.5 mm size aggregate and fine aggregate grading Zone II = 0.65. This is valid for 
water-cement ratio of 0.50. As water-cement ratio is actually 0.32, the ratio is taken as

The slump shall be measured and the water content and dosage of admixture shall 
be adjusted for achieving the required slump based on trial, if required. The mix proportions 
shall be reworked for the actual water content and checked for durability requirements.
B12	
Two more trials having variation of ± 10 per cent of water-cement ratio in C-10 
shall be carried out and a graph between three water-cement ratios and their corresponding 
strengths shall be plotted to work out the mix proportions for the given target strength for field 
trials. However, minimum and maximum cement content requirements should be met.
B13	
Adjustment due to higher slump requirements for use of RMC can be made as follows:
Based on initial trials, it has been established that for expected 1 hour transit time initial 
slump requirement is 100 mm for 25 mm slump at the time of placement.
Based on trials dosage of admixture may be increased to achieve required workability 
(accordingly all other calculations can be modified).

IN CASE IT IS PROPOSED TO USE FLYASH IN THE CONCRETE
B14.1	
Calculation of Cement and Fly Ash Contents
	
Water–cement ratio	
= 0.32
	
Cement content 	
 = 128/0.32 = 400 kg/m3 
Now, to proportion a mix containing fly ash the following steps are suggested:
	
i)	
Decide percentage fly ash to be used based on project requirement and 
quality of materials
	
ii)	
*Increase the cementitious material content by 10 per cent of total cementitious 
material content of control mix calculated as above, to account for fly ash 
reactivity.
	
Cementitious material content = 400 x 1.10 = 440 kg/m3
* In certain situation increase in cementitious material content may be warranted. The decision 
on increased in cementitious material and its percentage may be based on experience and 
trial. This illustrative example is with increase of 10 per cent cementitious materials content.
	
Water Content = 128 kg/m3
	
So, water-cementitious materials ratio = 128/440 = 0.29
	
Fly ash @ 20% of total cementitious content = 440 x 20% = 88 kg/m3 
	
Cement (OPC)	 	
	
	
 	
 = 440 - 88 = 352 kg/m3
	
Check for maximum cement content 
	
Maximum cement (OPC) content as per IRC:15, 450 kg/m3 > 352 kg/m3 
	
Hence, OK
	
Check for minimum OPC content as per IRC:15, 310 kg/m3 < 352 kg/m3 
	
Hence, OK

Proportion of Volume of Coarse Aggregate and Fine Aggregate Content
From Table 11, Volume of coarse aggregate corresponding to 31.5 mm size aggregate and

cement ratio of 0.50. As water-cement ratio is actually 0.29, the ratio is taken as 0.692 to

f’ck = fck+1.65 Sc
	
or
	
f’ck = fck + X
	
Whichever is higher
	
Where
	
f’ck = target average compressive strength at 28 days,
	
fck = characteristic compressive strength at 28 days, and
	
Sc = standard deviation of compressive strength.
	
From Table 6, standard deviation, Sc = 5.0 N/mm2.
	
Therefore, target strength using both equations i.e.
	
i)	
f’ck = fck+1.65 Sc
	
	
= 40+1.65x5.0 = 48.25 N/mm2
	
ii)	
f’ck = fck + 6.5 (The value of X for M40 grade as per Table 4 is 6.5 N/mm2)
	
	
= 40+6.5 = 46.5 N/mm2
	
	
The higher value is to be adopted. Therefore, target strength will be 
48.25 N/mm2 as 48.25 N/mm2 > 46.5 N/mm2.

APPROXIMATE AIR CONTENT
From Table 7, the approximate amount of entrapped air to be expected in normal (non-air-

C5	
SELECTION OF WATER-CEMENT RATIO
From Table 9, the free water-cement ratio required for the target strength of 48.25 N/mm2 is 
0.36 for OPC-43 grade. This is lower than the maximum value of 0.50.
	
0.36 < 0.40, hence O.K.

186 
 
	
	
	
	
	
	
 = 180.4 say 180kg/m3
As super plasticizer is proposed to be used, a minimum of 20 per cent water content 
can be reduced (vide para 5.3 for details). For the purpose of present trial exercise, 
a reduction of water content of 20 per cent has been assumed by adjusting suitably 
the doses of the super plasticizer. The designer can use this reduction as per his 
requirement of the availability of the grade of cement and quality of super plasticizer. With 
20 per cent reduction in water content at water-cement ratio of 0.38, the reduced water 
content equals to 180 x 0.80 = 144 kg 
C7	
CALCULATION OF CEMENT CONTENT
	
Water–cement ratio	
 = 0.36
	
Water content	
	
 = 144 kg/m3
	
Cement content		
 = 144 / 0.36 = 400 kg/m3
Check for minimum and maximum cement content as per IRC:15
Minimum cement content as per IRC:15, 360 kg/m3 < 400 kg/m3 Hence, O.K
Maximum cement content as per IRC:15, 450 kg/m3 > 400 kg/m3 Hence, O.K 
C8	
PROPORTION OF VOLUME OF COARSE AGGREGATE AND FINE 
AGGREGATE CONTENT
From Table 11 Volume of coarse aggregate corresponding to 19 mm size aggregate and 
fine aggregate grading Zone II = 0.62. This is valid for water-cement ratio of 0.50. As water-
cement ratio is actually 0.36, the ratio is taken as 0.648 to reduce sand content. (as per 
para 4.4.5 and Table 11)
Volume of fine aggregate content = 1 – 0.648 = 0.352 per unit volume of total aggregate
C9	
CHECK FOR COMBINED GRADING OF FINE & COARSE AGGREGATE
It is recommended to achieve the combined grading of fine and coarse aggregates as 
per Table 3. Graded coarse aggregates or single-sized coarse aggregates of nominal 
size shall be mixed in suitable proportions with fine aggregate and/or the volumes of 
coarse and fine aggregates shall be adjusted suitably to achieve the combined grading

The slump shall be measured and the water content and dosage of admixture shall 
be adjusted for achieving the required slump based on trial, if required. The mix proportions 
shall be reworked for the actual water content and checked for durability requirements.
C12	
Two more trials having variation of ± 10 per cent of water-cement ratio in C 10 
shall be carried out and a graph between three water-cement ratios and their corresponding 
strengths shall be plotted to work out the mix proportions for the given target strength for field 
trials. However, minimum and maximum cement content requirements should be met.
C13	
Adjustment due to higher slump requirements for use of RMC can be made as 
follows:
Based on initial trials, it has been established that for expected 1 hour transit time initial 
slump requirement is 100 mm for 25 mm slump at the time of placement.
Based on trials dosage of admixture may be increased to achieve required workability 
(accordingly all other calculations can be modified).

ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE ON CONCRETE MIX PROPORTIONING FOR HIGH 
STRENGTH CONCRETE (BASED ON COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH)
An example illustrating the mix proportioning for a concrete of M 65 grade using silica fume 
is given below. The silica fume (very fine non-crystalline silicon dioxide) is a by-product of the 
manufacture of silicon, ferrosilicon or the like, from quartz and carbon in electric arc furnace. 
It is usually used in proportion of 5 to 15 per cent of the cementitious material content of the 
mix. Use of silica fume is generally advantageous for higher grades of concrete i.e. M50 and 
above and for high performance concrete with special requirements e.g. higher abrasion 
resistance of concrete.

DESIGN COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH FOR MIX PROPORTIONING
	
f’ck = fck+1.65 Sc
	
or
	
f’ck = fck + X
	
Whichever is higher
Where
	
f’ck = target average compressive strength at 28 days,
	
fck = characteristic compressive strength at 28 days, and
	
Sc = standard deviation of compressive strength.
	
From Table 6, standard deviation, Sc = 6.0 N/mm2.
Therefore, target strength using both equations i.e.
	
i)	
f’ck = fck+1.65 Sc 
	
	
= 65 + 1.65 x 6.0 = 74.9 N/mm2
	
ii)	
f’ck = fck + 8.0 (The value of X for M65 grade as per Table 4 is 8.0 N/mm2)
	
	
= 65 + 8.0 = 73.0 N/mm2
	
The higher value is to be adopted. Therefore, target strength will be 74.9 N/mm2 
as 74.9 N/mm2 > 73.0 N/mm2.
D4	
APPROXIMATE AIR CONTENT
From Table 13, the approximate amount of entrapped air to be expected in normal (non-air-
entrained) concrete is 0.5 per cent for 19.0 mm nominal maximum size of aggregate.
D5	
SELECTION OF WATER-CEMENTIOUS MATERIALS RATIO
From Table 15, the free water-cementitious materials ratio required for the target strength of 
74.9 N/mm2 is 0.29 for MSA 19 mm. This is lower than the maximum value of 0.40.
0.29 < 0.40, hence O.K.
D6	
SELECTION OF WATER CONTENT
From Table 14, water content for 19 mm aggregate = 180 kg/m3 (for 50 mm slump)



======================================================================
PAGE 54 of 64

3
180 
 
	
	
	
	
	
 	
 = 174.6 say 175 kg/m3
As superplasticizer (Polycarboxylate based) is used, the water content can be reduced by 
30 per cent. Hence, the reduced water content = 175 x 0.70 = 122.5 say 123 kg/m3
D7	
CALCULATION OF CEMENT CONTENT
Water–cementitious ratio
= 0.29
Water content
= 123 kg/m3
Cementitious content
= 123/0.29 = 424.1 say 424 kg/m3
Silica fume @ 5% by weight of 
Cementitious Material
= 424 x 5% = 21.2 say 21 kg/m3
Cement Content
= 424 – 21= 403 kg/m3
Check for minimum cement content, 360 kg/m3 < 403 kg/m3 Hence, OK
Check for maximum cement content, 450 kg/m3 > 403 kg/m3 Hence, OK
D8	
PROPORTION OF VOLUME OF COARSE AGGREGATE AND FINE 
AGGREGATE CONTENT
From Table 17, Volume of coarse aggregate corresponding to 19 mm size aggregate and 
fine aggregate grading Zone II = 0.70 per unit volume of total aggregate. This is valid for 
water-cement ratio of 0.30. As water-cement ratio is actually 0.29, the ratio is taken as 0.702 
to reduce sand content.
Volume of fine aggregate content = 1 – 0.702 = 0.298 per unit volume of total aggregate

Paste volume,
Vp = cement volume + water volume
Vp = (c/3.15x1000 kg/m3) + w/1000 kg/m3
Substituting 
w = (w/cm)c,

F6	
PASTE VOLUME (Vp), CEMENT CONTENT (c) AND WATER CONTENT (w)
From Table 21, paste volume = 11% for 24% void content for well compacted pervious 
concrete.
This paste volume has to be reduced by 1% for 5% fine aggregate of the total aggregate.
Therefore, paste volume = 10% for well compacted pervious concrete 
Paste volume = 18% for 24% void content for lightly compacted pervious concrete. 
This paste volume has to be reduced by 0.5% for 5% fine aggregate of the total aggregate. 
Therefore, paste volume = 17.5% for lightly compacted pervious concrete. 
Paste volume,
Vp = cement volume + water volume
Vp = (c/3.15 x 1000 kg/m3) + w/1000 kg/m3
Substituting 
w = (w/cm)c,
Vp = c/(3.15 x 1000 kg/m3) + [(w/cm)c/1000 kg/m3]
Therefore,
