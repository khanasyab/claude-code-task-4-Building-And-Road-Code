1 INTRODUCTION
Geophysical investigations are becoming increasingly acceptable and implemented in the 
field of geotechnical engineering world over, on account of its simplicity and advantages over 
traditional methods Geophysical methods can be used to provide volumetric knowledge of 
unforeseen, highly variable sub-surface ground conditions assisting bridge engineers in pin-
point borings, especially in inclined beds for foundations. The geophysical characteristics 
such as thickness of unconsolidated overburden, bed rock depth, void location, and ground 
water depth are required in the planning stage itself. Each of these characteristics will 
significantly affect the design and construction phase of any project. Additional knowledge 
about these conditions, provided by geophysical methods can reduce project risk, improve 
construction quality and safety. The document details various geophysical methods, brief 
principle, operations, capabilities, limitations and method selection criteria. The document 
also deals with investigation of existing bridges using geophysical methods.
1.1	
An Overview of Geophysics
Applied geophysics uses physical methods, such as seismic, gravitational, magnetic, 
electrical and electromagnetic at the surface of the Earth to measure the physical properties 
of the subsurface, along with the anomalies in those properties. It has been extensively used, 
historically, for oil and gas exploration, closely followed by mineral exploration. The depths 
explored are typically in hundreds and thousands of meters. Engineering geophysics is often 
used in construction sites to solve a variety of geological, geotechnical, or quality control 
problems and helps fill gaps in geotechnical data. The basic task of engineering geophysics 
is to apply physics theories and methods to determine subsurface conditions for building 
foundations and test quality of man-made structures, like bridges, roads, dams, etc.
Geophysical methods are sensitive to contrast in the physical properties in the subsurface. 
Different methods respond to different physical properties, like material strength, material 
conductivity, change in density etc. Geophysical techniques, by virtue of their non-invasive 
and non-destructive nature, offer an excellent solution for site investigations. No single 
geophysical technique can uniquely solve the problem due to a large overlapping of physical 
properties in various subsurface materials. That is the reason why it becomes important to 



======================================================================
PAGE 13 of 72
======================================================================

IRC:123-2017
use a combination of geophysical methods to uniquely resolve the problem. Choosing the 
right tool/technique to address to a specific problem is critical for success of a geophysical 
program. 
1.2	
Objectives of Geophysical Investigation
The objectives of Geophysical methods are to locate or to detect the presence of sub-surface 
structure or bodies and to determine their configuration in terms of size, shape and depth 
along with physical properties.
Physical properties of sub-surface to be investigated are:
	
i.	
Elastic parameters like Young’s modulus, bulk modulus, rigidity modulus, 
Poisson’s ratio
	
ii.	
Density 
	
iii.	
Electrical conductivity
	
iv.	
Electrical capacitance
	
v.	
Electrical inductance
	
vi.	
Magnetic susceptibility 
	
vii.	
Dielectric constant 
Application of Geophysical methods to Geotechnical engineering problems by bridge 
engineers are:
	
a)	
Sub-surface characterization for depth of bedrock, type of rock, layers and 
fractures in rock, grounder water flow, water table, weak zones, expansive 
clays.
 
b) 
Locating buried utilities for constructions of flyovers and subways in urban 
areas.
	
c)	
Locating and shifting of archaeological-interest sites when new developments 
are taking place.
	
d)	
Engineering properties of earth materials like stiffness, density, electrical 
resistivity, porosity etc.
	
e)	
Selecting borehole locations (optimising drilling) and obtain reliable 
information about the nature and variability of the subsurface between 
existing boreholes. 
	
f)	
To obtain subsurface information in environmentally sensitive areas, on 
contaminated ground, or on private property, where drilling is either not 
possible or extremely cumbersome. 
1.3	
Advantages of Geophysical Investigations
Geotechnical geophysical investigations are cost effective and reliable means of imaging 
the sub-surface between boreholes and below boreholes for determining in-situ properties 
of soil and rock. These geophysical methods when used for reconnaissance can provide a 
basis for selection of locations of boreholes. These methods provide a continuous profile of 



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:123-2017
investigated area, eliminating geological surprises otherwise unavoidable if relied only on 
discrete borehole information as depicted in Fig.1.
Fig. 1 An isolated geologic structure such as a limestone pinnacle  
might not be detected by a routine drilling program
Locations where drill rigs cannot be moved like below bridge, steep slopes, marshy lands, 
deep forests, contaminated sites, heavily congested urban areas, these geophysical methods 
will come in handy for site investigations. Unlike boring or open excavation, geophysical 
techniques are non- invasive. Environmentally sensitive locations are ideal for usage of 
geophysical methods such as contaminated grounds. Geophysical methods are normally 
considered simple in usage compared to drilling since there are fewer risks associated with 
utility encounters beneath the surface. Most interesting thing about geophysical methods 
with respect to geotechnical surveys is that the engineers can optimize or many times reduce 
the number of boreholes.
Major advantages of engineering geophysics are:
 
i) 
Geophysical methods provide continuous profile of sub-surface, as against 
discrete point information provided by drilling.
	
ii)	
It can be used to select borehole locations or can enable engineers to reduce 
the number of boreholes required.
	
iii)	
Variable sub-surface ground conditions such as sudden changes of bedrock 
profile, fault, fracture zone, boulder, sinkhole, cavity and buried obstruction 
can be identified which cannot be detected in routine drilling.
	
iv)	
It can provide reliable information about the nature and variability of the sub-
surface between and below the existing boreholes.
	
v)	
Accessibility, portability and non invasiveness.
	
vi)	
Required information through borehole survey will not be possible in urban 
area’s due to limited land accessibility.
	
vii)	
Detailed knowledge of unforeseen, variable sub-surface ground condition 
will reduce project risks and the associated cost.

IRC:123-2017
	
viii)	 Other advantages of geotechnical geophysics are related to site accessibility 
(due to easy portability of instruments), non-invasiveness, and operator 
safety. These methods can also provide temporal measurements (detecting 
changes in conditions with time). Geophysical equipments can often be 
deployed beneath bridges and power lines, in heavily forested areas, at 
contaminated sites, in urban areas, on steeply dipping slopes, in marshy 
terrain, on pavement or rock, and in other areas that might not be easily 
accessible to drill rigs or Cone Penetration Test (CPT) rigs. 
	
ix)	
Most geophysical tools are non-invasive and, unlike boring or trenching, 
leave little, if any, imprint on the environment. These considerations can be 
crucial when working in environmentally sensitive areas, on contaminated 
ground, or on private property. In addition, geophysical surveys are generally 
considered less dangerous than drilling since there are fewer risks associated 
with utility encounters and operations. 
However, engineering geophysics is not a substitute for boring and direct physical testing. 
Rather it complements a well-planned, cost-effective drilling and testing program, and provides 
a volumetric image of the subsurface rather than a point measurement. Geophysicists refer 
to borehole information and field geologic maps as ground truth, and rely on ground truth to 
constrain and verify all geophysical interpretations. 
2 SCOPE
The purpose of this document is to provide bridge engineers with a basic knowledge of 
geophysical methods for solving specific engineering problems during geotechnical site 
investigation, construction, and maintenance of bridges. The document is intended to 
provide Engineers with tools that will assist them in the use of suitable geophysical methods 
to evaluate problems for design, planning, construction, or remediation efforts.
The document provides descriptions of geophysical imaging methods for site investigation for 
new bridge sites. The document also provides the details of geophysical and non-destructive 
testing methods for evaluating sub-structure and super structure of existing bridges.

IRC:123-2017
Each geophysical method can be used for many different applications (e.g., mining exploration, 
oil and gas exploration, engineering, and environmental). The division of each method is 
based on the physics that governs it; therefore, geophysical techniques (e.g., refraction) 
within each method (i.e., seismic) are designed primarily for applications of the method to a 
given problem (e.g., rock quality & depth). 
Most of the geophysical methods listed above have corresponding IS, BS or ASTM codes, 
standardizing their application. 
3.1	
Geophysical, Non-destructive Testing and Non-contact Measuring Tools
Geotechnical geophysical, non-destructive testing and non-contact tools are very similar 
and in some instances are identical. Physical property models are generated for specific 
parameters by all these types of instruments. 
The major difference between these is that geophysical tools are used to investigate the 
earth, whereas NDT methods are used to investigate manmade structures like bridges and 
buildings wherein non-contact tools are used for measuring asphalt temperature, thermal 
imaging etc without touching the object.
3.2	
Geophysical Investigations with Respect to Geotechnical Investigations
Geophysical investigations are carried out preferably prior to geotechnical investigations and 
are of immense value in selection of borehole locations. Such investigations, in addition, will 
provide reliable information about variability of sub-surface between two boreholes.
3.3	
Selection of Surface Geophysical Methods
Selection of most appropriate geophysical method is a two stage process. In stage-1 
potentially useful geophysical methods are identified on the basis of engineering problem, 
which can be done by utilizing the information available on the methods and lateron in 
stage-II, the most suitable geophysical tools are selected based on the site specific criterion 
such as depth of target, required resolution, site accessibility and cost.
4 GEOPHYSICAL METHODS FOR BRIDGE SITE INVESTIGATION
In the process of selecting a site for a bridge, it is necessary to study the requirements of 
the bridge, volume of traffic, nature and extent of water body system, hydro meteorological 
factors, maximum flood levels, geological conditions, technical feasibility, seismicity of the 
region, economic factors etc.
For effective site investigation and characterization few of the obvious geological factors 
taken into consideration are:
	
i)	
The type of the rock and its strength and deformation behaviour i.e. igneous, 
sedimentary or metamorphic.
	
ii)	
Depth of bedrock

Seismic Refraction Method 
Seismic refraction method is one of the most developed geophysical methods, providing vital 
information on subsurface which is crucial for most of the engineering projects. The method 
is covered by IS-15681-2006 “Geological Exploration by Geophysical method- Seismic 
Refraction- Code of Practice”.
Seismic refraction method is a reliable tool for determining depth of various sub- surface 
layers, particularly in conjunction with few exploratory borings. The accuracy of depth 
determination of subsurface interfaces has been improved substantially with the availability 
of multichannel digital enhancement seismographs and new interpretation techniques, using 
advanced software & modelling techniques. The method is applicable for investigations on 
land and underwater as well. Fig. 2 shows typical layout seismic refraction testing.
Fig. 2 Typical Layout of Hydrophones for Underwater Seismic Refraction Survey
Seismic refraction surveys being rapid and economical are conducted to aid in selecting a 
site amongst a number of alternatives at the reconnaissance stage itself. It also forms a part 
of detailed site investigation at the chosen location. It plays a major role in locating fault and 
shear zones and in determining engineering parameters like Poison’s ratio, dynamic Young’s 
modulus, and shear modulus.
This method gives velocity of compressional (P) – waves in sub-surface materials. Although 
P-waves (compression) velocity can be a good indicator of the type of soil or rock, it is not 
a unique indicator. Table 2 shows that each type of sediment or rock has a wide range of 
seismic velocities and many of these ranges overlap.

The survey provides sub-surface information over large areas at relatively low cost. It 
facilitates to identify critical locations for detailed testing by drilling and can readily eliminate 
less favourable alternative sites. Seismic surveys can also reduce number of boreholes 
required to test a particular site and improve correlation between boreholes.
4.1.1	
Basic Principle
Seismic refraction consists of recording the time taken for an artificially provoked surface 
vibration to propagate through the earth (Fig.3). By processing the data recorded at various 
sensors, absolute velocities, velocity contrasts and the depths of the underlying layers are 
determined. These results provide information about the nature and thickness of overburden 
(alluvium deposits), surface of bedrock, the depth of weathering zones in the rock mass, 
location of geological boundaries and identifies faults or weak zones, scale and width, etc.

======================================================================
PAGE 20 of 72
======================================================================

IRC:123-2017
The seismic velocities are characteristics of the nature and quality of the bedrock; reduced 
seismic velocities will characterize a fissured, fractured or sheared rock. 
A multi-channel (24-48) engineering seismograph is generally used for the acquisition of 
greater amount of data per shot (Figs. 4, 5). A minimum of seven shot points are used for 
each spread. These include two far shots on either side of the spread, to provide the true 
seismic velocity of the sound rock, two end shots to obtain reciprocal times, and three mid 
shots within the profile to obtain lateral velocity variation in the top layers - overburden.
The length of geophone spread depends upon the required depth of investigation and the 
dimensions of any subsurface features that are to be mapped. A length of approx. three to 
four times the depth of investigation is recommended. A geophone spacing of 5 m with 24 
channels spread is generally adequate for detailed mapping of subsurface conditions to a 
depth of approx 30 m. The geophone spacing can be further increased for greater depth of 
investigation, if required.

trigger cable or radio link. A wide variety of seismic geophysical equipments are available 
now (Fig. 4).
For engineering geophysics application a 24-48 channel signal enhancement type 
seismograph is generally used, with 10-14 Hz geophones. Depth investigation upto 30-35 m 
is generally possible using a 10 kg sledge hammer. For deeper penetration weight drop of 
explosive source is required.
4.2	
Resistivity Imaging Method
One of the methods being increasingly used in geological exploration is the electrical resistivity 
Imaging (also termed as electrical resistivity tomography). The purpose of Electrical resistivity 
imaging survey is to determine sub-surface resistivity distribution by taking measurements 



======================================================================

IRC:123-2017
on the ground. From these measurements true resistivity of sub-surface can be estimated. 
Fig. 9 provides an example of 2D section derived from electrical resistivity imaging survey.
The resistivity is related to various geological parameters, like, mineral and fluid content, 
porosity and degree of water saturation in rock. Electrical resistivity surveys have been used 
for many decades in geotechnical, hydrological and mining investigations. Other applications 
of electrical resistivity imaging test are:
	
i.	
To correlate data from resistivity survey with those obtained from borehole 
and trial pit logs.
	
ii.	
To delineate weak formations, faults and dykes, if any and to identify locations 
of steeply dipping contacts between different rock types and earth material.
	
iii.	
To rapidly explore the sub surface conditions to locate ground water, thickness 
of over burden, depth of different rock types and stereographic features.
	
iv.	
Assessment of ground water potential, quality and determination of aquifer 
characteristics.
	
v.	
To delineate zones of seepage and identify its source around various 
structures of river valley projects.
	
vi.	
For earthing of electrical conductors.
Fig. 9 Mapping of stratigraphy in sand and gravel lenses in clay environment
The generally accepted unit of resistivity is Ohm-meter. The resistivity depends on the 
chemical content of water filling the pore spaces. Salinity of pore water is one of the most 
critical factors influencing resistivity.
The resistivity’s range among rocks and rock materials is very large, extending from 10-5 to 
1015 Ohm-m. Rocks and minerals with resistivity from 10-5 to 10-1 Ohm-m are considered 
good conductors. Those having resistivity in the range from 1 to 107 Ohm-m are intermediate 
conductors and those having resistivity in the range from 108 to 1015 Ohm-m are poor 
conductors. Igneous rocks have the highest resistivity; sedimentary rocks have lowest and 
metamorphic rocks fall in intermediate zone. The resistivity of particular rock type vary directly 
with age and lithology, since porosity of rock and salinity of porw water are affected by both of 
these factors. Table 3 presents values of resistivity for different rocks, soil and water.

4.2.1	
Basic Principle of Electrical Resistivity Imaging
Measurement of ground resistivity involves passing an electrical current into the ground using 
a pair of steel or copper electrodes and measuring the resulting potential difference within 
the subsurface using a second pair of electrodes. These are normally placed between the 
current electrodes. Fig. 10 provides a glimpse of resistivity imaging equipment and Fig. 11 
shows a typical field setup for data acquisition. Fig. 12 shows basic working principle of 
electrical resistivity imaging with data points corresponding to electrode arrangement.
Fig. 12 Arrangement of Electrodes
Unlike conventional resistivity sounding and lateral profiling surveys, 2D resistivity imaging 
is a fully automated technique that uses a linear array of number of electrodes connected by 
multicore cable. The current and potential electrode pairs are switched automatically using 
a laptop computer and control module connected to a ground resistivity meter (that provides 
the output current). 
In this way a profile of resistivity against depth (‘pseudosection’) is built up along the 
survey line. Data is collected by automatically profiling along the line at different electrode 
separations. The computer initially keeps the spacing between the electrodes fixed and moves 
the pairs along the line until the last electrode is reached. The spacing is then increased by 
the minimum electrode separation (the physical distance between electrodes which remains 
fixed throughout the survey) and the process is repeated in order to provide an increased 
depth of investigation. 
The maximum depth of investigation is determined by the spacing between the electrodes and 
the number of electrodes in the array. For a 64 electrode array with an electrode spacing of 
5 m this depth is approximately 60 m. However, as the spacing between the active electrodes 
is increased, fewer and fewer points are collected at each ‘depth level’, until on the final level 
only 1 reading is acquired (Fig. 13). In order to overcome this, the array is ‘rolled-along’ the 
line of investigation in order to build up a longer pseudo section. 
The raw data is initially converted to apparent resistivity values using a geometric factor 
that is determined by the type of electrode configuration used. Many 2D resistivity imaging 
surveys are carried out using the Wenner Array. In this configuration the spacing between 



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 72
======================================================================
16
IRC:123-2017
each electrodes is identical. Once converted the data is modelled using finite element and 
least squares inversion methods in order to calculate a true resistivity versus depth pseudo 
section.
4.2.2	
Key Applications of Electrical Resistivity Imaging
Key applications of electrical resistivity imaging are as follows:
	
i)	
To determine the underground water resources
	
ii)	
To determine bedrock quality and depth measurements
	
iii)	
Mineral prospecting
	
iv)	
Dam structure analysis
 
v) 
To determine landfill characteristics
	
vi)	
Contamination source detection
4.2.3	
Key Advantages of Electrical Resistivity Imaging
Main advantages of electrical resistivity imaging are as follows:
	
i)	
Excellent 2-dimensional display of ground resistivity.
	
ii)	
Delineation of small features like cavity, contamination plumes, weak zones 
in structures like dams etc.
	
iii)	
The technique is extremely useful for investigations of important sites to get 
information on weak zones or buried channels, under the rock interface, which 
goes undetected in seismic refraction, which terminated at rock interface. 
 
iv) 
Resistivity imaging can also be effectively used to determine rock profile 
along bridge axis across high current shallow rivers where deployment of 
hydrophones is not possible restricting use of seismic refraction (Figs. 14,15). 
	
v)	
For deep penetration seismic refraction techniques requires use of explosives, 
which are not always feasible to deploy especially in sensitive areas. In such 
cases resistivity imaging can be effectively used to get detailed information 
of deeper layers (Fig. 13).
4.2.4	
Examples of Results of Electrical Resistivity Imaging
Figs. 13, 14 and 15 show few examples of resistivity imaging survey for different applications, 
covering land as well as under water application of the technique. The example demonstrates 
that resistivity imaging can be used effectively to detect features like cavities in rocks, weak 
zones, fractures etc. The results of electrical imaging are 2D sections of resistivity along the 
survey line providing fine details of subsurface.

3-D Resistivity Imaging Surveys
All geological structures are three dimensional in nature, hence a 3-D resistivity survey 
using 3-D interpretation model gives the most accurate result. With the development of multi 
channel resistivity meters which enables recording of more than one measurement at a time 
and availability of computers the inversion of very large data sets comprising more than 8000 
data points and survey grid of greater than 30 m x 30 m can be enabled. The pole-pole, 
pole-  dipole and dipole-dipole arrays are frequently used for 3-D surveys because other

arrays have poor data coverage near the edge of survey grid. Fig. 16 is an example of a slice 
from a 3D model, from a work carried out for cavity detection in sandstone at pier location of 
a bridge.

4.3	
ReMi - Refraction Micro-Tremor Method
ReMi can be performed under the same layout as used for seismic refraction, to obtain 
excellent shear wave velocity profiles of subsurface.
Fig. 17 ReMi Seismograph
Fig. 18 Data collection in progress
ReMi is a new, proven seismic method for measuring in-situ shear-wave (S-wave) velocity 
profiles. It is economic both in terms of cost and time. Testing is performed at the surface 
using the same conventional seismograph and vertical P-wave geophones used for 
refraction studies (Figs. 17,18). The seismic source consists of ambient seismic “noise”, or 
micro-tremors, which are constantly being generated by cultural and natural noise. Because 
conventional seismic equipment is used to record data, and ambient noise is used as a 
seismic source, the ReMi method is less costly, faster and more convenient than borehole 
methods and other surface seismic methods, such as SASW and MASW used to determine 
shear-wave profiles. Depending on the material properties of the subsurface, ReMi can 
determine shear wave velocities down to a minimum of 40 m and a maximum of 100 m depth.

Fig. 19 Shear-Wave Dispersion Curve Derived from Ambient Seismic Noise
4.3.1	
Procedure for ReMi
The data acquisition procedure consists of obtaining five to ten 20-second seismic 
noise records using conventional seismograph and P-wave geophones. The wave field 
transformation of the noise record reveals the shear-wave dispersion curve (Fig. 19). The 
shear-wave dispersion curve from the wave field transformation is then manually picked and 
the picks modelled to determine the subsurface shear-wave velocity profile (Fig. 20). During 
data analysis, the wave field from the three separate noise records are manually picked and 
modelled for the purpose of quality control. The resolution of the final model is quantified 
based on the uncertainty in the picks.
The data is recorded using natural noise, by making people run along the seismic profiles, by 
making people jump at various points of the profile, by tapping of hammer at one end of the 
profile etc. The effort is to generate as much as random noise as possible in various ways.
4.3.2	
Key Applications of ReMi
ReMi can be used to obtain Shear wave velocity (Vs) profiles for:
	
i)	
Earthquake site response
	
ii)	
Liquefaction analysis
	
iii)	
Soil compaction control
	
iv)	
Mapping the subsurface and estimating the strength of subsurface materials
	
v)	
Finding buried cultural features such as dumps and piers
4.3.3	
Key Advantages of ReMi
The ReMi method has several advantages in contrast to the borehole measurements. 
ReMi tests a much larger volume of the subsurface. The results represent the average 
shear wave velocity over distances as large as 200 m. Because ReMi is non-invasive and 
non-destructive in nature, and uses only ambient noise as a seismic source, no permissions

IRC:123-2017
are required for its use. ReMi seismic lines can be deployed within the road medians, at 
active construction sites, or along highways, without affecting the ongoing work or traffic flow. 
Unlike other seismic methods for determining shear wave velocity, ReMi uses the ongoing 
activities as seismic sources. A ReMi survey usually takes less than two hours, from setup 
through breakdown. These advantages sum to substantial savings in time and cost. Moreover 
the method provides more accurate results compared to the conventional effort of picking up 
shear waves from records which more often than not lead to errors.

4.4	
Crosshole/ Downhole/ Uphole Surveys
The primary purpose of obtaining crosshole data is to obtain the most detailed in situ seismic 
wave velocity profile for site-specific investigations and material Characterization. Crosshole 
velocity data are valuable for assessing man-made materials, soil deposits, or rock formations. 
Figs. 21, 22, 23 and 24 provide instruments and arrangement for Crosshole surveys.
The seismic technique determines the compressional (P) and/or shear (S) wave velocity of 
materials at depths of engineering and environmental concern where the data can be used 
in problems related to soil mechanics, rock mechanics, foundation studies, and earthquake 
engineering. Crosshole geophysical testing is generally conducted in the near surface (upper 
hundred meters) for site-specific engineering applications. All the dynamic elastic moduli of 
a material can be determined from knowledge of the in situ density, P, and S-wave velocity. 
Since procedures to determine material densities are standardized, acquiring detailed 
seismic data yields the required information to analytically assess a site. Low-strain material 
damping and inelastic attenuation values can also be obtained from the crosshole surveys. 
However, the most robust application of crosshole testing is the ability to define in situ shear-
wave velocity profiles for engineering investigations associated with earthquake engineering.

The objective of acquiring crosshole data can be multipurpose; i.e. the seismic velocity results 
obtained may be used for evaluation of lateral and vertical material continuity, liquefaction 
analyses, deformation studies, or investigations concerning amplification or attenuation of 
strong ground motion. Typically, the crosshole surveys are geophysical tools for performing 
explorations during the phase two field investigations (wherein phase one field investigations 
include surface geophysical surveys, follow-up drilling, trenching, and sampling of the in situ 
materials). During phase two field exploration, the information gathered is more critical to the 
analytical site-specific Characterization. Although both phase one and phase two results are 
important, the two independent sets of data must be integrated in the final analysis.
Crosshole techniques are most useful when phase one site explorations indicate horizontal 
and particularly vertical variability of material properties. When layers of alternating density or 
stiffness are either known to exist or are encountered during phase one field investigations, 
crosshole seismic tests are recommended to define the in situ velocities within each layer. 
Acquiring crosshole seismic data resolves hidden layer velocity anomalies that cannot be 
detected with conventional surface methods, allows both final interpretation of other surface 
geophysical data (seismic or electrical), and permits both empirical and theoretical correlation 
with other geotechnical material parameters.
In order to have quantitative and quality assured results, crosshole tests performed for either 
engineering or environmental problems should be conducted in accordance with procedures 
established. Crosshole seismic test procedures are outlined in ASTM test designation D4428 
M-84 (1984). Crosshole geophysical surveys have become more widely used and accepted 
for engineering as well as environmental applications. Coupling detailed site information 
obtained from the crosshole tests with the overall acceptance of the validity of the velocity 
data, these standards use both empirical correlations for liquefaction and specific input 
parameters for deformation or ground motion analyses.
4.4.1	
Basic Theory of Crosshole Seismic
Crosshole testing takes advantage of generating and recording (seismic) body waves, 
both the P- and S waves, at selected depth intervals where the source and receiver(s) are 
maintained at equal elevations for each measurement. Fig. 23 illustrates a general field 
setup for the crosshole seismic test method. Using source-receiver systems with preferential

IRC:123-2017
orientations in tandem (i.e., axial orientations, which complement the generated and received 
wave type/signal) allows maximum efficiency for measurement of in situ P- or S-wave velocity 
depending on the axial orientation. Due to the different particle motions along the seismic 
ray path, it is crucial to use optimal source-receiver systems in order to have best record of 
crosshole P- or S-waves. Because only body waves are generated in the source borehole 
during crosshole tests, surface waves (ground roll) are not generated and do not interfere 
with the recorded body-wave seismic signals. 
Fig. 23 Schematic Arrangement for Crosshole Method
Particle motions generated with different seismic source types used during crosshole testing 
are three-directional. Therefore, three-component geophones with orthogonal orientations 
yield optimal results when acquiring crosshole P- and/or S-wave seismic signals. With 
three-component geophones, there is one vertically oriented geophone and two horizontal 
geophones. For crosshole tests, one horizontal geophone remains oriented parallel to the axis 
between the boreholes (radial orientation), and the other one remains oriented perpendicular 
to the borehole axis (transverse orientation). In this case, the two horizontal axis geophones 
must remain oriented, radially and transversely, throughout the survey. This is accomplished 
with loading poles or with geophones that can be electronically oriented.
P-waves are generated with a sparker or small explosive device (one that will not damage the 
PVC casing) such that along the assumed straight-ray propagation path the seismic impulse 
compresses and rarefies the materials radially toward the receiver borehole(s). Experience 
has proven that for optimal measurement of the P-wave signal, a hydrophone has the greatest 
pressure-pulse sensitivity for compressional-wave energy. Also, hydrophones do not need 
to be clamped against the borehole wall; however, water must be present in the receiver 
borehole in order to couple the hydrophone to the casing/formation.
For either surface or crosshole seismic testing in unconsolidated materials, P-wave velocity 
measurements are greatly affected by the moisture content or percent saturation. In crosshole 
testing, the seismic measurements encroach closer to the water surface with each successive 
depth interval. As the vadose zone and water surface are encountered, P-wave velocities 
become dependent upon the percent saturation, and the Poisson’s ratio is no longer a valid 
representation of the formation characteristics e.g., Poisson’s ratio increases to 0.48-0.49 



======================================================================

IRC:123-2017
in 100% saturated soils. Hence, below the water surface, the P-wave is commonly termed 
as the fluid wave, because its propagation velocity is governed by the pore fluid(s), not by 
the formation density. Fluid-wave velocities in fresh water range from 1,400 to 1,700 m/s, 
depending upon water temperature and salt content.
S-waves generated in crosshole testing may be split into two wave types, each with different 
particle motions--SV- and SH-waves, vertical or horizontal particle motions, respectively. 
Shear waves have the unique capability of polarization, which means that impacting the 
material to be tested in two directions (up or down, left or right) yields S-wave signals that 
are 180° out of phase. A seismic source with reversible impact directions is the key factor 
for quality crosshole S-wave data acquisition and interpretation. Fig. 24 shows a series of 
crosshole SV-waves with reversed polarity (note the low amplitude of the P-wave energy as 
compared to the S-wave energy) received at both the receiver boreholes.
Typically, the S-wave generated in most crosshole testing is the SV-wave, which is a vertically 
polarized horizontally propagating shear wave. That is, the ray path is horizontal but the 
(shear) particle motion along the ray path is in the vertical plane. These SV-waves are easiest 
to generate because of commercially available 
borehole impact hammers that have reversible 
impact directions (up or down), and they are 
also the easiest to record because only one 
vertically oriented geophone is required in each 
receiver borehole. Alternatively, SH-waves 
can be generated and recorded in crosshole 
testing. SH-waves also propagate horizontally, 
but their (shear) particle motion is in the 
horizontal plane (i.e., horizontally polarized 
horizontally propagating S-waves). Therefore, 
in order to generate and record SH-wave 
signals, horizontal impacts and geophones are 
required; also, the orientation of the source and 
receiver must be parallel while their respective 
orientation remains perpendicular to the axis of 
the boreholes (transverse orientation). 
Theoretically, there is no difference in the 
body wave velocity for SV- and SH-waves, 
which justifies use of the uncomplicated 
vertical source for generation of SV-waves, 
and vertically oriented geophones for signal 
detection. There are studies, however, which 
indicate significant velocity dependence of the 
SV- and SH-waves due to anisotropic states of 
stress in either the horizontal or vertical stress 
field (particularly in soil deposits or fractured 
rock formations.

IRC:123-2017
The requirement for multiple drill holes in crosshole testing means that care must be taken 
when completing each borehole with casing and grout. Normal procedures call for PVC casing 
and a grout mix that closely matches the formation density. Success of crosshole seismic 
testing depends primarily on borehole preparation and completion procedures. Poor coupling 
between the casing and the formation yields delayed arrival times and attenuated signal 
amplitudes, particularly for (higher frequency) P-waves. Matching the formation density with 
a grout mix is not very difficult, but in open coarse-grained soils, problems may arise during 
grout completion with losses into the formation. Even small grout takes may affect the velocity 
measured between two closely spaced drill holes. Several techniques to plug the porosity 
of the surrounding formation are available (e.g., cotton-seed hulls, crushed walnut shells, or 
increased bentonite concentration in the grout mix). It should be recognized that increasing 
the ratio of bentonite/cement within the grout mix does affect density, but so long as the mix 
sets and hardens between the casing and in situ formation, quality crosshole seismic signals 
can be obtained.
Another critical element of crosshole testing, which is often ignored, is the requirement for 
borehole directional surveys. There are several very good directional survey tools available 
that yield detailed deviation logs of each borehole used at a crosshole site. Borehole verticality 
and direction (azimuth) measurements should be performed at every depth interval wherein 
seismic data are acquired. With the deviation logs, corrected crosshole distances between 
each borehole may be computed and used in the velocity analysis. Since seismic wave travel 
times should be measured to the nearest tenth of a millisecond, relative borehole positions 
should be known with centimetre accuracy. Assuming that the boreholes are vertical and 
plumb based verticality checks leads to computational inaccuracies and ultimately to data 
that cannot be quality assured. 
4.4.2	
Data Acquisition of Crosshole Seismic
Recording instruments used in crosshole testing vary considerably, but there are no standard 
requirements other than exact synchronization of the source pulse and instrument trigger for 
each recording. Crosshole measurements rely considerably on the premise that the trigger 
time is precisely known as well as recorded. The recorded trigger signal from zero-time 
geophones or accelerometers mounted on the downhole impact hammer allows accurate 
timing for the first arrival at each drill hole. This becomes uniquely critical when only two 
drill holes are used (i.e., source and one receiver) because there is no capability of using 
interval travel times; in this case, the velocity is simply determined through distance traveled 
divided by direct travel time. Utilizing digital recording equipment affords the operator the 
ability to store the data on magnetic media for analysis at a later date; but more importantly, 
digital data can be filtered, smoothed, and time-shifted during analysis. Also, digital signal 
processing may be directly performed for coherence, frequency-dependent attenuation, and 
spectral analysis.
Numerous studies have shown that the effects on crosshole measurements by the choice of 
geophone are not critical to the results. There are only two requirements for the receivers: the 
receiver (velocity transducer) must have a flat or uniform output response over the frequency 
range of crosshole seismic waves (25 to 300 Hz); and, a clamping device must force the 



======================================================================

======================================================================
25
IRC:123-2017
receiver against the borehole wall such that it is not free-hanging. The clamping device should 
not affect the mechanical response of the geophone (i.e., resonance), nor should the uphole 
signal wire. If an SH-wave source is selected, then horizontal geophones must be used and 
oriented as previously described to detect the SH-wave arrivals. It is paramount that the 
polarity of each geophone be known prior to data acquisition because the direct arrivals of 
S-waves with reversed polarity can be easily misinterpreted.

Good borehole preparation is critical 
	
ii)	
Borehole verticality/ inclination to be ascertained.
Downhole and Uphole surveys also work on the similar principle as explained in this section, 
with minor differences in data acquisition methodology.
4.5 
Seismic Reflection Method
Deep seismic reflection surveying is the most advanced technique in geophysics nowadays, 
due to its application on a huge scale for oil and gas exploration. This technique does, 
however, have other applications on a smaller scale, such as for civil engineering project site 
investigation. The methodology is identical, but the equipment and parameters are adjusted to 
provide a higher resolution at shallow depths. Fig. 25 presents basic principle and geometry 
of seismic reflection survey.

======================================================================

IRC:123-2017
Seismic energy is generated at the surface using either impulsive sources (dynamite) or 
continuous sources (Vibroseis). The returned energy is recorded by a series of geophones 
installed along lines at the surface. Reflection of the energy is caused by contrasts in acoustic 
impedance between the various strata. Data processing is a complex sequence of operations 
carried out usually on powerful computers using specialized software. The final product is a 
2-D or 3-D dataset of seismic reflectors, which can then be correlated to specific geological 
interfaces through the use of borehole information.
Seismic reflection uses field equipment similar to seismic refraction, but field and data 
processing procedures are employed to maximize the energy reflected along near vertical 
ray paths by subsurface density contrasts. Reflected seismic energy is never a first arrival, 
and therefore must be identified in a generally complex set of overlapping seismic arrivals - 
generally by collecting and filtering multi-fold or highly redundant data from numerous shot 
points per geophone placement. Therefore, the field and processing time for a given lineal 
footage of seismic reflection survey are much greater than for seismic refraction. However, 
seismic reflection can be performed in the presence of low velocity zones or velocity inversions, 
generally has lateral resolution vastly superior to seismic refraction, and can delineate very 
deep density contrasts with much less shot energy and shorter line lengths than would be 
required for a comparable refraction survey depth.
The main limitations to seismic reflection are its higher cost than refraction (for sites where 
either technique could be applied), and its practical limitation to depths generally greater than 
approximately 15 m. At depths less than approximately 15 m, reflections from subsurface 
density contrasts arrive at geophones at nearly the same time as the much higher amplitude 
ground roll (surface waves) and air blast (i.e. the sound of the shot). Reflections from greater 
depths arrive at geophones after the ground roll and air blasts have passed, making these 
deeper targets easier to detect and delineate.
In hydropower projects the seismic reflection method can detect geologic structures in fault 
zones, find shallow, soft layers of underground earth materials, reduce mapping uncertainties 
and can greatly reduce the investigation costs of engineering projects.

Ground Penetrating Radar Method
Ground Penetrating Radar, also known as GPR, Georadar, Subsurface Interface Radar, 
Geoprobing Radar, is a totally non-destructive technique to produce a cross section profile 
of subsurface without any drilling, trenching or ground disturbances. Ground Penetrating 
Radar (GPR) profiles are used for evaluating the location and depth of buried objects and to 
investigate the presence and continuity of natural subsurface conditions and features. GPR 
instruments and survey details are in Figs. 29, 30 and 31.

======================================================================

IRC:123-2017
Fig. 29 GPR Investigation in Progress
Fig. 30 Ground Penetrating Radar
The GPR operates by transmitting electromagnetic impulses into the ground through transmitter 
antenna. The transmitted energy is reflected from various buried objects or distinct contacts 
between different earth materials, across which there is a contrast in dielectric constant. The 
antenna then receives the reflected waves and displays them in real time on screen. Data is 
also saved in appropriate memory for later processing and interpretation.
Ground penetrating radar waves can reach depths upto 60 m in low conductivity materials 
such as dry sand or granite. Clays, shale and other high conductivity materials may attenuate 
or absorb GPR signals, greatly decreasing the depth of penetration. 
The depth of penetrating in also determined by the GPR antenna used. Antennas with low 
frequency obtain reflections from deeper depths but have low resolution. These low frequency 
antennas are used for investigating the geology of a site, such as for locating sinkholes or 
fractures, and to locate large, deep buried objects.
Fig. 31 Radargram from GPR Survey
Antennas with higher frequencies (300 to 2000 MHz) obtain reflections from shallow depths 
(0 to 10 meters) and have a high resolution. These high frequency antennas are used to 
investigate surface soils and to locate small or large shallow buried objects, pipes, cables 
and rebar in concrete.
GPR can detect objects of any material, metallic or non-metallic.

ii)	
Depth of penetration is limited in materials with high electrical conductivities, 
clays.
 
iii) 
Energy may be reflected and recorded from above ground features, walls, 
canopies, unless antennae are well shielded.
	
iv)	
Artifacts in the near surface (reinforcing bars, boulders, components of made 
ground) may scatter the transmitted energy and complicate the received 
signal and/or reduce depth of penetration.
 
v)

information on depth and location. Classification of utility any further can 
be done only with availability of background data and is not a deliverable of 
GPR survey.

Induction Locator Method
Radio-detection uses the principles of electromagnetic to detect underground utilities. This 
principle works on the basis that a current flowing along a conductor creates a magnetic 
field, which extends around the conductor in concentric circles. A receiver coil can be used to 
detect the amplitude of this magnetic field. The amplitude varies depending on the position 
and orientation of the receiver within the field. The amplitude is maximum when the receiver 
is in line with the field and directly above the conductor. Moving the receiver from side to side 
it is possible to follow the maximum signal response and, therefore, the line of the buried 
utility. Figs. 45, 46 and 47 show instruments, field operation.

Fig. 45 Various Types of Induction Locator Equipments
Both active and passive methods are used to ensure all possible detectable utility services 
are located properly.
4.7.1	
Active Methods
An active signal is a signal that has been artificially generated by an external source. Active 
radio detection methods can allow different services such as BT and electric to be individually 
identified. Active methods involve the use of a transmitter. The transmitter can either be 
used for direct connection or for induction. Direct connection involves the application of an 
active signal to a conductor using a clamp. Induction involves a signal being radiated from 
the internal antenna of the transmitter, which is induced to any conductors in the vicinity and 
re-radiated. Generally 8, 33 or 65 KHz frequencies are used. It is often possible to determine 
the depth of the service in this mode.
4.7.2	
Passive Methods
A passive signal is a signal that occurs ‘naturally’ on a buried conductor. Passive radio 
detection methods can provide an indication only that services are present underground. 
Passive methods use the electro-magnetic fields already present around the underground 
utility to locate them.
Two modes are generally used:
 
• 
Power -detects 50-60 Hz energy present on most buried conductors
 
• 
Radio -detects re-radiated radio energy often present on conductors -it is not 
possible to determine depth in this mode.

Gravity Surveys
Gravimetry is a potential field technique which measures variations in the Earth’s gravitational 
field. These variations are caused by density contrasts in the near surface rock and sediment. 
Gravimetric surveys are carried out using extremely sensitive instruments capable of 
measuring tiny variations in the gravitational field. These surveys are always carried out in 
conjunction with a precise topographic survey, to enable terrain corrections to be carried out. 
Figs. 48, 49 and 50 show instruments for gravity surveys and contour maps obtained.

Fig. 50 Typical Gravity Contour Map (Courtesy Technos, Inc)
Gravity measurements define anomalous density within the Earth; in most cases, ground-
based gravimeters are used to precisely measure variations in the gravity field at different 
points. Gravity anomalies are computed by subtracting a regional field from the measured 
field, which result in gravitational anomalies that correlate with source body density variations. 
Positive gravity anomalies are associated with shallow high density bodies, whereas gravity 
lows are associated with shallow low density bodies. Thus, voids and cavities are easily 
detected using micro-gravity method.

Application of Geophysical Investigation for New Bridges
All major bridge projects where linear water way exceeding 100 m, longer elevated corridors, 
hilly terrains, flyovers in urban limits and all expected difficult sub soil conditions shall be 
investigated for geophysical studies prior to geotechnical investigations. The borehole 
locations for the geotechnical investigations shall be optimised for number of bores and 
depth of investigation based on geophysical studies already carried out. The geophysical 
studies can be carried out by a suitable instrument or a combination of many instruments as 
stated here.
There is no replacement of geotechnical investigation in lieu of geophysical studies. After 
experiencing the application of geophysical studies in recent times in the country delays in 
the project execution and cost overruns can be avoided in infrastructure projects.

5 GEOPHYSICAL METHODS FOR INVESTIGATING  
THE EXISTING BRIDGE CONDITIONS
The aging and deterioration of bridges mandates increasingly cost-effective strategies for 
bridge maintenance, rehabilitation, and repair. Use of non-destructive Geophysical methods 
for evaluating the integrity of structures has grown rapidly over the last decade. Not only do 
the geophysical methods help to investigate large infrastructures economically to provide 
comprehensive information about the existing bridge conditions, they help to ensure safety, 
reduced design uncertainty, mitigate bridge failures and minimize the need for destructive 
coring/testing.
5.1	
Characterizing of Existing Bridge Foundations and Assessing Scour 
Conditions
Assessing and characterizing geotechnical conditions at existing highway bridges for scour 
conditions or general foundation adequacy can become complex and costly when difficult 
access, difficult ground conditions or regulatory constraints limit traditional exploratory 
methods. Even when traditional methods can be applied, results based on penetration 
testing and / or recovered samples may be of limited usefulness. When ground surface 
is available and not completely inundated, surface geophysical methods provide means, 
for subsurface preliminary or screening characterization under these conditions. Surface 
geophysics can provide information concerning subsurface geometry and relevant material 
properties. Fig. 51 shows typical foundation condition Fig. 52 shows typical inter-relationship 
of unknown foundations, characterisation and hydraulic scour.

IRC:123-2017
There are many bridges across the world identified as having unknown foundations. The 
missing substructure information associated with unknown foundations has made the safety 
monitoring of these “off-system” bridges very difficult, especially the scour of critical bridges 
because of the foundation properties like type and dimensions, are essential for determining 
the bridge vulnerability to scour. Bridge scour is the removal of sediment such as sand and 
rocks from around bridge abutments or piers. Scour, caused by swiftly moving water, can 
scoop out scour holes, compromising the integrity of a structure. 
While very few studies have used statistical, computational, numerical solutions, soft-
computing methods such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and probabilistic methods such 
as Bayesian to infer foundation properties, there are a number of studies on applying Non 
Destructive Testing (NDT) methods to obtain information about unknown bridge foundations, 
predicting pile depth and reviewing scour depth at bridge piers.
Bridge foundations can be divided into shallow footings or deep foundations. Footings are 
mostly square or rectangular in shape. They may also be pedestal masonry stone footings 
or massive cofferdam footings in shape. Piles might be present with or without pile caps and 
may be battered or vertical. Piles can be made of concrete (round, square, or octagonal), 
steel (H-piles or round pipe sections), or timber. Deep foundations can be pre-cast concrete 
piles, or drilled shafts and auger-cast concrete piles. The top of footings or pile caps may be 
buried underneath riprap, backfill mud and/or channel soils. 
Scour of foundations is the number one cause of bridge collapse. Scour occurs in three 
main forms, namely, general scour, contraction scour and local scour. General scour occurs 
naturally in river channels and includes the aggradation and degradation of the river bed that 
may occur as a result of changes in the hydraulic parameters governing the channel form 
such as changes in the flow rate or changes in the quantity of sediment in the channel. It 
relates to the evolution of the waterway and is associated with the progression of scour and 
filling, in the absence of obstacles. Contraction scour occurs as a result of the reduction in 
the channel’s cross-sectional area that arises due to the construction of structures such as 
bridge piers and abutments. It manifests itself as an increase in flow velocity and resulting bed 
shear stresses, caused by a reduction in the channel’s cross-sectional area at the location 
of a bridge. The increasing shear stresses can overcome the channel bed’s threshold shear 
stress and mobilize the sediments. Local scour occurs around individual bridge piers and 
abutments. Downward flow is induced at the upstream end of bridge piers, leading to very 
localized erosion in the direct vicinity of the structure. Fig. 53 shows typical schematic of 
scour process.
Horseshoe vortices develop due to the separation of the flow at the edge of the scour hole 
upstream of the pier and result in pushing the down-flow inside the scour hole closer to the 
pier. Furthermore, separation of the flow at the sides of the pier results in wake vortices. 
Local scour depends on the balance between streambed erosion and sediment deposition. 
Clear-water scour is the term given to describe the situation when no sediments are delivered 
by the river whereas live-bed scour describes the situation where an interaction exists 
between sediment transport and the scour process. The presence of live-bed conditions 
leads to smaller ultimate scour depths than in clear-water conditions. The most critical factors 



======================================================================

======================================================================

IRC:123-2017
contributing to local scour are the velocity and depth of flow, both of which are significantly 
increased during heavy storms and floods. As the velocity and/or depth increase, the amount 
of scour increases. Other factors affecting bridge scour include the dimensions and orientation 
of piers, bed configuration and material size/gradation, and accumulation of ice and debris 
along the piers.
Fig. 53 Typical Schematic of the Scour Process
Scour poses obvious problems to the stability of bridge structures. There are two issues 
associated with such scour-induced damage to bridge pier footings. The first effect is the loss 
of foundation material, which exposes the footing and lowers its factor of safety with regard 
to sliding or lateral deformation. The greatest loss of sediment to scour occurs at high water 
velocities, such as during floods. Secondly, pier movement may occur because of material 
loss beside and beneath the base of the footing, which produces undesired stresses in the 
bridge structure and ultimately results in structural collapse. The scour hole generated has 
the effect of reducing the stiffness of foundation systems and can cause bridge piers to fail 
without warning. Fig. 54 provides for typical foundation with respect to scour.

IRC:123-2017
There are many critical bridges on spread footings or shallow piles. During a flood, scour is 
generally not visible and during the falling stage of a flood, scour holes generally fill in. Visual 
monitoring during a flood and inspection after a flood cannot fully determine that a bridge 
is safe. Instruments to measure or monitor maximum scour would resolve this uncertainty. 
Geophysical techniques for scour monitoring involve filling-in the vicinity of a bridge pier 
or footing at scour- critical bridge sites, monitoring of scour elevations and the hydraulic 
conditions that cause bridge scour, such as water depth, water velocity, bed-material size, 
channel slope, and channel geometry.

Time Domain Reflectrometry
Time Domain Reflectrometry (TDR) uses electromagnetic impulses that travel along a cable 
and are reflected when they encounter an impedance change. This can occur at the end of 
the cable or at a break or imperfection. The TDR instrument measures the time that the signal 
takes to travel along the cable and return to the instrument. Knowing the speed of travel of 
the wave then allows the travelled distance to be calculated. Figs. 55 and 56 shows time-
domain reflectometry.
Fig. 55 Typical Time Domain Reflectrometry signals from cable ends and  
a Thinner Section of the Cable
Measurements of scour at bridges founded on shallow footings indicate maximum scour 
occurs around the upstream side of footings during floods. As scour progresses and soil 
deposits are eroded, footings may be exposed and eventually undermined, leading to 
intolerable pier movement. Optimal placement of TDR cables would, therefore, be through 
the footing section on the upstream side. Most importantly, the cable monitoring system must 
operate at high water flows when footing and pier displacement is most likely to occur as 
a result of scour. Although bridge abutments may be less affected by scour, under certain 
circumstances they may need to be monitored for detrimental movements.
Pier footing movements can be detected from voltage reflections generated by local cable 
deformation. A minimum cable deformation of 2 mm produces a distinguishable voltage 
reflection in the TDR signal. Further footing displacement progressively shears the cable and 
produces increasingly larger voltage reflections at that point along the cable.

Ground Penetrating Radar
In bridge scour evaluations, the Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) method can provide an 
essentially continuous image of the stream channel and the sub-bottom sediment, including 
the in-filled scour features. Estimated Electromagnetic velocities can be used to transform the 
time-depth profile into a depth profile since velocities are a function of suspended sediment 
load. This method uses radar pulses to determine the water sediment interface and hence 
the depth of scour. A floating GPR transmitter is pulled along the water surface thus obtaining 
a geophysical profile of the riverbed as it passes. It operates by sending out high frequency 
electromagnetic waves which are partially reflected as they pass through different media, 
thus building up a geophysical map of the subterranean lithology. Figs. 57 and 58 shows 
typical data collected at a bridge location.

The main advantages of the GPR profiling tool are as follows:
	
i)	
The GPR antennae are non-invasive and can be moved rapidly across (or 
above) the surface of a stream at the discretion of the operator. The GPR 
tool does not need to be physically coupled to the water surface and can be 
operated remotely, ensuring that neither the operator nor equipment need be 
endangered by floodwaters. Profiles can be extended across emerged sand 
bars or onto the shore.
	
ii)	
The tool can provide an accurate depth-structure model of the water bottom 
and sub-bottom sediments (to depths on the order of 9 m). Post acquisition 
processing (migration) can be applied.
	
iii)	
Lithologic/facies units with thickness on the order of 0.1 m can be imaged 
with intermediate-frequency units (200 MHz).
The main limitations of the GPR profiling tool are as follows:
	
i)	
The equipment is relatively expensive (hardware and software).
 
ii) 
Data may be contaminated by noise (multiple reflections and echoes from 
pier footings).
	
iii)	
Post-acquisition processing (migration) may be required in areas where 
significant structural relief is present.
	
iv)	
GPR is not normally effective when water depths exceed 9 m.
	
v)	
GPR cannot be used in saline waters.
5.1.3	
Sonic Fathometers
A number of devices have been developed that use sound waves to monitor the progression 
of scour holes. They work on the same principle as devices that use electromagnetic waves, 
in that waves are reflected from materials of different densities thus establishing the location 
of the water sediment interface. 



======================================================================
PAGE 52 of 72
======================================================================
42
IRC:123-2017
Sonic fathometers can be mounted on bridge piers just below the level of the water stage. 
They build up continuous profiles of the streambed by emitting sonic pulses from a pulse 
generator, which travel through the medium to the water sediment interface. In doing so, the 
device can detect and monitor the depth of scour over time. The device can, however, only 
be operated within certain depth tolerances and is susceptible to interference from entrained 
air present in highly turbulent flow. In addition, at the place where the bed topography is 
variable, this type of sensor only measures the shallowest depth. Therefore, the beam width 
at the bed with respect to the scour hole may significantly affect the accuracy of the scour 
depth measurements. Fig. 59 shows typical data from fathometers.
Fig. 59 Typical Fathometer Data Recorded using a 3.5 kHz Transducer
5.1.4	
Reflection Seismic Profilers
Reflection seismic profilers also utilize sound waves to monitor and detect scour. This device 
typically employs a coupled acoustic source transducer and receiver transducer that are 
placed immediately below the water surface. As the system is towed manually across the 
water surface, the source transducer produces short period pulsed acoustic signals at regular 
time or distance intervals. The high frequency seismic pulse propagates through the water 
column and into the subterranean sediments below. This device can build up profiles of the 
streambed as some of the acoustic energy is reflected back to the receiver when the water 
sediment interface is encountered. By combining the signals from multiple locations and 
using estimated seismic interval velocities, the time depth profile can be converted into a 
depth profile.
The frequency of the seismic signal used by the Continuous seismic profiling technique 
determines the maximum penetration depth and resolution. A high-frequency signal has a 
short wavelength and is attenuated by sub bottom materials but provides high resolution of 
sub bottom interfaces. A low-frequency signal has a longer wavelength and is attenuated less 
by sub bottom materials but provides lower resolution. The fixed-frequency CSP technique 



======================================================================
PAGE 53 of 72
======================================================================
43
IRC:123-2017
uses a narrow bandwidth fixed-frequency signal usually centered at 3.5, 7.0, or 14 kHz. 
The CSP technique using a 14 kHz signal can be used in water as shallow as 1.2 m, can 
penetrate up to 6 m into the sub bottom in certain materials, and can detect fill material as 
thin as 30 cm in a scour hole. The CSP technique using a 3.5 kHz signal can be used in water 
as shallow as 2 m, can penetrate up to 30 m into the sub bottom in certain materials, and can 
detect fill material as thin as 75 cm in a scour hole. Swept-frequency (chirp) CSP techniques 
that sweep from 2 to 16 kHz can be used in water as shallow as 30 cm, and can penetrate 
60 m into the sub bottom in silts and clays. Such signals can sometimes detect fill material as 
thin as 8 cm in a scour hole. Figs. 60 and 61 shows typical data obtained.

Transducer of a Single Frequency System

5.1.5.	
Echo Sounders
Echo sounders work in a very similar manner to reflection seismic profilers and can be used 
to determine scour hole depths. The only major difference is that they emit higher frequency 
acoustic source pulses and due to the rapid attenuation of the high frequency pulsed acoustic 
energy, relatively little signal is transmitted or reflected within the sub-bottom sediment. A 
time-depth profile is generated by plotting traces from adjacent source and receiver locations. 
Using estimated seismic interval velocities, these plots may be converted to depth plots. 
The only disadvantage of this system over reflection seismic profilers is that no information 
about previously filled-in scour holes can be obtained since the high frequency waves cannot 
penetrate into the sub-bottom strata.
Devices of this type use the differences in the electrical conductivity of various media 
to determine the location of the water sediment interface. They work on the principle of 
measuring an electrical current between two probes. If the material between the probes 
changes, the ability for a current to be drawn will also change. This phenomenon can be used 
to indicate the presence and depth of scour. An example of a device that uses this technology 
is electrical conductivity probe. Fig. 62 shows typical scour monitory instrumentation.

Depth and Integrity Investigations of Existing Bridge Foundations
5.2.1	
Sonic Echo/Impulse Response Test
The sonic echo/impulse response test can be used to evaluate the integrity and length of 
newly constructed piles. It can be used to detect defects, soil inclusions and pile necking, 
diameter increases (bulging) as well as approximate pile lengths. The Sonic Echo method 
requires a measurement of the travel time of seismic waves (time domain), and the Impulse 
Response method uses spectral analysis (frequency domain) for interpretation. These two 
methods are sometimes called Pile Integrity Testing methods (PIT).



======================================================================
PAGE 55 of 72
======================================================================
45
IRC:123-2017
In both (SE/IR) tests, the reflection of compressional waves, also called P waves by 
geophysicists, from the bottom of the tested structural element or from a discontinuity such 
as a crack or a soil intrusion is measured. The generated wave from an impulse hammer 
travels down a shaft or a pile until a change in acoustic impedance which depends on 
velocity, density, and changes in diameter is encountered, where the wave reflects back and 
is recorded by a receiver placed next to the impact point.
In an SE/IR test, a hammer strikes the foundation top, and a receiver monitors the response 
of the foundation. A digital signal analyzer records the hammer input and the receiver output. 
Sonic Echo (SE) tests are typically performed with different frequency filtering to optimize 
reflections coming from the bottom of the foundation and to reduce the effect of surface 
waves or reflections from a discontinuity at a shallow depth where the frequencies associated 
with these two conditions are high. In an Impulse Response (IR) test, a digital analyzer 
automatically calculates the transfer and coherence functions after transforming the time 
records of the hammer and the receiver to the frequency domain. Fig. 63 shows typical sonic 
echo test details.
Fig. 63 Typical Configurations Source and Receiver Locations for a Sonic Echo/Impulse 
Response Test for Three Shaft Geometric Configurations
Sonic Echo data are used to determine the depth of the foundation based on the time 
separation between the first arrival and the first reflection events or between any two 
consecutive reflection events (∆t) according to the following equation:
where D is the reflector depth, and V is the velocity of compressional waves. 
A reflector can be the bottom of the foundation or any discontinuity along the embedded part 
of the foundation. The Sonic Echo data can also be used to determine the existence of a 
bulfing or a necking in a shaft or the end conditions of the shaft based on the polarity of the 
reflection events.

IRC:123-2017
Fig. 64 Typical Data from the Sonic Echo Method and Depth Calculations
Fig. 64 illustrates the data from a Sonic Echo survey along with the depth calculation 
computed between the second and third echoes. The multiple echoes are all interpreted as 
coming from the same reflector since the time separations of the echoes are all equal. Any 
pair can be used to calculate the two-way travel time between the source and the reflector. In 
this case the clearest pair of echoes were the second and third, which were used to calculate 
the depth using the formula above, giving a depth of 2.01 m. 
The Impulse Response data are also used to determine the depth of reflectors according to 
the following equation:
Where, ∆f = distance between two peaks in the transfer function plot or between zero 
frequency and the first peak for soft bottom conditions.
The multiple echoes from a discontinuity or bottom, as seen in the Sonic Echo method, 
result in increased energy at the frequency of the echo. This causes a peak in the frequency 
spectrum. Under conditions where there is a hard material beneath the structure, the 
second harmonic of the echo is also evident. Using the frequency difference between zero 
and the main echo 10 frequency or between the first and second harmonic frequencies 
in the formula above gives the depth of the structure. In addition, the Impulse Response 
data provides information about the dynamic stiffness of the foundation. This value can 
be used to predict foundation behaviour under working loads or correlated with the results 
of load tests to more accurately predict foundation settlement. Fig. 65 illustrates about 
impulse response method.

Fig. 65 Typical Depth calculations using Frequency Domain Data for  
the Impulse Response method
The Bending Waves method uses flexural or bending waves, rather than the compressional 
waves used in the Sonic Echo/Impulse Response method to determine integrity and unknown 
depth of deep foundations. It is limited to applications on rod-like deep foundations such as 
timber piles, concrete piles, and drilled shafts that extend above the ground or water surface. 
This method uses the propagation of flexural or bending waves in piles that are highly 
dispersive in nature. The bending wave velocity decreases with increasing wavelength, with 
most of the velocity decrease occurring at wavelengths that are longer than the pile diameter. 
These longer waves propagate as flexural or bending wave energy. 
The Ultraseismic (US) method is also performed to evaluate the integrity and determine 
the length of shallow and deep foundations. This method is particularly useful in testing 
abutments and wall piers of bridges because of the relatively large exposed areas available 
for testing.

IRC:123-2017
It uses multi-channel, three-component (vertical and two perpendicular horizontal receivers, 
i.e., triaxial receiver) recording acoustic data followed by computer processing techniques 
adapted from seismic exploration methods. Seismograph records are typically collected by 
using impulse hammers as the source, and accelerometers as receivers that are mounted 
on the surface or side of the accessible bridge substructure at intervals of 30 cm or less. The 
bridge substructure element is used as the medium for transmission of the seismic energy. 
Four wave modes of longitudinal (compressional) and torsional (shear) body waves as well 
as flexural (bending) and Rayleigh surface waves can be recorded by this method. Seismic 
processing can greatly enhance data quality by identifying and clarifying reflection events 
that are from the foundation bottom and minimizing the effects of undesired wave reflections 
from the foundation top and attached beams. For concrete bridge elements, useful wave 
frequencies up to 4 to 5 kHz are commonly recorded. Figs. 66, 67 and 68 shows about 
typical impedance of wave propagation.
This method can be used in two modes: Ultraseismic Vertical Profiling (VP) and Horizontal 
Profiling (HP).

Seismic Wave Reflection Survey
In the Seismic Wave Reflection Survey Method, it involves setting up shot points on one side 
of the pier and two horizontal component geophones on the other side of the pier. The toe of 
the pier will diffract seismic waves passing under it. The depth of the pier can be found from 
the position of the diffractions on the seismic records. Figs. 69, 70, 71, 72 and 73 shows 
seismic reflector survey.

Parallel Seismic Method
The Parallel Seismic (PS) method is a borehole test method for determining depths of 
foundations. It can also be used to measure the thickness of the scour zone when it has been 
filled with mud or soft sand after the flood surge has passed. The method can also detect 
major anomalies within a foundation as well as provide the surrounding soil velocity profile. 
The method requires the installation of cased borehole close to the foundation being tested. 
The method can be used when the foundation tops are not accessible or when the piles are 
too long and slender (such as H piles or driven piles) to be testable by sonic echo techniques.

IRC:123-2017
Plotting the first arrival times as a function of depth and observing the depth where a change 
of slope occurs shows the depth to the bottom of the shaft and the scour depth. In addition, 
the foundation depth can be obtained by observing the depth where the signal amplitude of 
the first arrival energy is significantly reduced. 
For hydrophone data, the time arrival of compressional waves is picked from the data for all 
receiver locations. A plot of the time arrival-versus-depth is prepared. In Fig. 71, the velocity 
of the concrete in the shaft is 5,155 m/s. A break in the graph occurs at a depth of 8.5 m 
indicating the depth of the shaft. 
For uniform soil conditions, two lines are identified in the plot as shown in Fig. 72. The slope 
of the upper line is indicative of the velocity of the tested foundation, and the second line is 
indicative of the velocity of the soil below the bottom of the foundation. The intersection of the 
two lines gives the depth of the foundation. For nonuniform soil conditions, the interpretation 
of data from hydrophone use can be difficult due to the nonlinearity of the first time arrival. For 
geophone data in uniform soil conditions, the data can be interpreted in a way similar to the 
hydrophone data. When variable soil velocity conditions exist, an alternative to the first arrival 
time in data interpretation is used. All the traces are stacked, and a V-shape is searched for 
in the data because the bottom of the foundation acts as a strong source of energy (a point 
diffractor and a reflector), which produces upward and downward traveling waves. When a 
geophone is used, the borehole is generally not filled with water. As a result, tube waves are 
minimized so that later arrival of reflected and diffracted shear and compressional waves can 
be identified.

filtered. Note the uniform data amplitudes 
across the water-sediment interface. The 
linear refraction first-arrival pattern A-B 
changes to the hyperbolic first-break pattern

5.2.4	
Induction Field Method
Induction Field (IF) method is used for the determination of the unknown depth of steel or 
continuously reinforced concrete piles. This is an electrical method that relies on detecting 
the magnetic field in in response to an oscillating current impressed into a steel pile. In order 
for this method to work, the pile must, therefore, contain electrically conductive materials. 
For reinforced concrete piles, this usually implies that reinforcing rebar extends along its full 
length.
A sensor is placed down a drill hole located close to the pile and detects the changing magnetic 
field strength. This sensor could be a magnetic field sensor or a coil. Along the length of the 
pile, the magnetic field strength will be relatively strong. However, the magnetic field strength 
will be significantly diminished at levels in the drill hole beneath the bottom of the pile to a 
residual conductivity value of the soil or bedrock. This change in the magnetic field strength 
is used to determine the depth of the pile. Fig. 74 shows typical induction field method setup.
Fig. 74 Typical Induction Field method setup
5.2.5	
Dynamic Foundation Response Method
The Dynamic Foundation Response uses the resonant frequencies of structures to differentiate 
foundation types. The vibration response of a bridge substructure will exhibit lower resonant 
frequency responses when excited for a shallow foundation versus the comparatively higher 
resonant frequency response of a deep foundation system. The method is unproven for this 
use in bridges, but is based on the dynamic analysis theory for vibration design of foundations 
(soil dynamics) and geotechnical analyses of foundations subjected to earthquake loading.
A hammer with a built-in dynamic force transducer is used as the vibration source. A triaxial 
block of seismic accelerometers records the resulting signals. Typically, a bridge is excited 
at five to six locations, and the triaxial response is measured at five to six locations giving 
rise to 25 to 36 source-receiver combinations. The bridges are impacted in the vertical and 
horizontal directions to excite these modes as well as rocking modes along the frame of the 
substructures. Once the impulse force and the resultant vibration response are measured, 
the transfer function can be calculated.

5.2.6	
Vibroseis Trucks Method
Use of vibroseis trucks for inducing vibrations to excite a bridge is also a widely used 
practice for unknown foundation depth testing. The Piezoelectric Charge Accelerometers 
are attached to a bridge pier nondestructively. These sensors measure acceleration in three 
directions and send it directly to a data logger. By impacting the pier with a hammer, readings 
from the sensors are used to calculate the natural frequency of the pier from which the depth 
of the foundation can be inferred. A numerical simulation employing the finite element method 
is also created. In this model, shallow foundations are compared to deep foundations, each 
with different embedment depths. An eigenvalue analysis with frequencies and mode shapes 
for each system is created to compare the different responses of frequency relative to the 
foundation depth and type.
5.2.7	
Crosshole Seismic Tomography
Two- and three-dimensional tomography is used for the high resolution imaging of the 
subsurface between boreholes.
Basic Concept: Tomography is an inversion procedure that provides for two- or three-
dimensional (2-D and 3-D) velocity (and/or attenuation) images between boreholes from the 
observation of transmitted first arrival energy.
Data Acquisition: Tomography data collection involves scanning the region of interest with 
many combinations of source and receiver depth locations, similar to medical CAT-SCAN 
(fig. below). Typical field operation consists of holding a string of receivers (geophones or 
hydrophones) at the bottom of one borehole and moving the source systematically in the 
opposite borehole from bottom to top. The receiver string is then moved to the next depth 
location and the test procedure is repeated until all possible source-receiver combinations 
are incorporated. Fig. 75 illustrates Tomographic survey design.

IRC:123-2017
Data Processing: In the tomographic inversion technique, the acoustic wavefield is initially 
propagated through a presumed theoretical model and a set of travel times are obtained by 
ray-tracing (forward modeling). The travel time equations are then inverted iteratively in order 
to reduce the Root Mean Square (RMS) error between the observed and computed travel 
times. The inversion results can be used for imaging the velocity (travel time tomography) 
and attenuation (amplitude tomography) distribution between boreholes.
Data Interpretation: Described below in figure is a tomographic survey designed to investigate 
the foundation of an existing bridge. In this example, cross- hole velocity tomography surveys 
were conducted by pairing a seismic source in one borehole and a string of receivers in an 
adjacent borehole to propagate and capture seismic signals transmitted between source 
and receiver boreholes. Steel or concrete piles that existed within the surveyed area were 
indicated in the tomograms as relatively higher seismic velocity zones than the surrounding 
ground. The pile group, as depicted in Figure, appeared as relatively higher seismic velocity 
anomalies within the fill and soil material above the bedrock. There was also a clear indication 
of low-velocity anomaly pockets in the top of the bedrock where the piles were driven into the 
bedrock. The seismic tomography survey indicated that the piles were point-bearing on rock, 
and, in fact, the piles were driven into the bedrock surface when installed.
The example shown in Fig. 76 is a tomographic survey designed to investigate the depth of 
four drilled shafts supported by a pile cap under a bridge column. The shafts were originally 
thought to be 2 m socketed in the bedrock. The tomogram sections, however, show that 
the shafts rested on top of bedrock. The results were also confirmed using the parallel 
seismic method. In figure, the top of bedrock was well defined with no low-velocity anomalies 
apparent. In this Fig. 76, the water-saturated alluvial sediments, shown in blue, lies above 
bedrock, shown in green.

Advantages: Tomography provides high-resolution two-dimensional area or three-
dimensional volumetric imaging of target zones for immediate engineering remediation. 
Tomography can then be used in before and after surveys for monitoring effectiveness 
of remediation. Tomography can also be used in before and after surveys for monitoring 
fluid injections between test holes or for assessing the effectiveness of soil improvement 
techniques.

Attenuation tomography can be used for the delineating fracture zones. Wave equation 
processing can be used for a high-resolution imaging of the reflection events in the data 
including those outside and below the area between the boreholes.
Limitations: Tomography is data-intensive and specialized 3-D analyses software is required 
for true three-dimensional imaging. Artifacts can be present due to limited ray coverage near 
the image boundaries.

Monitoring Bridge Deck Conditions
Bridge deck monitoring is an essential component of early stage deterioration detection, 
whether the deterioration manifests itself through material degradation or defect generation. 
One of the most common problems in concrete bridge decks is corrosion-induced deck 
delamination, where expansive corrosion products at the reinforcement level create internal 
stresses that result in cracking and delamination of the concrete from the reinforcement it is 
intended to protect. Routine employment of geophysical surveys can yield good results when 
assessing deck conditions if the proper method(s) are selected.
Bridge deck evaluations can be categorized as initial (QA verification) and baseline condition 
verification, as well as condition assessment of older, existing structures. Geophysical 
instruments, including accelerometers and tilt meters, as well as strain gages, are increasingly 
used for short- and long term monitoring of bridge decks. The basic problems encountered 
include the aerodynamic stability of bridge decks when subject to high winds, the long-
term stability of bridge decks due to fatigue caused by a variety of cyclic stresses including 
temperature, increased loading from traffic, and heavily loaded trucks and the stability of 
bridge decks during earthquakes. The primary method used to evaluate stability is to measure 
the baseline performance characteristics of a structure and then monitor the change in these 
characteristics with time. This can be done periodically, such as during an inspection cycle, or 
continuously using a permanent monitoring system. The geophysical techniques applied to 
this problem are principally vibration monitoring, including strains, displacements, rotations, 
and accelerations, but also some environmental monitoring including wind and temperature, 
since these affect the response.

Ground Penetrating Radar
Quality Control (QC) is the implementation, measurement, and enforcement of sound 
construction practices and jobsite inspections to ensure construction quality. Quality Assurance 
(QA) is the inspection and testing of the completed product, in accordance with specifications 
intended to verify the quality of the completed structure. In the transportation sector, GPR 
surveys are routinely and successfully used for quality assurance (QA) verification of new 
construction. The electromagnetic energy used by the GPR system depends primarily on 
two physical properties of the ground; the electrical conductivity and the dielectric constant. 
The dielectric constant determines the speed with which the wave travels and the electrical 
conductivity determines the attenuation of the electromagnetic signals. Through air, GPR 
travels at light speed; through another material, its speed is inversely proportional to the 
square root of its dielectric constant. 
Most concrete in-service, has a dielectric of roughly 9 (GPR moves through the medium 
three times slower than the speed of light), and water slows GPR to only 1/9 its speed in air,

IRC:123-2017
because water has the highest dielectric constant (80) of any (dielectric) medium. Asphalt 
overlays typically have a dielectric constant of about 6 to 6.5. GPR moves faster in asphalt 
than in most concrete, except when concrete is extremely well cured and dry. 
The dielectric contrast—absolute difference in magnitude between two adjacent materials 
through which a GPR signal will propagate—controls whether there will be a measurable 
reflection of energy transmitted from the antenna back to the receiver at the surface. The 
greater the dielectric contrast, the higher the amplitude of this reflection will be. Also, the 
polarity of the signal will depend on whether the GPR is propagating through a higher, then 
lower dielectric material or the reverse scenario exists. These and many other subtle GPR 
signal characteristics help determine accurate depth to rebar, concrete deterioration, overlay 
thickness, deck thickness, and other structural properties of interest. 
Electrical conductivity, the inverse of resistivity, is a property that measures how well a material 
transports or disperses an electrical current through that given medium. Highly conductive 
materials, such as metal or seawater, effectively impede all or most of a GPR signal from 
penetrating them. Similarly, conductive materials that do not fully impede signal penetration, 
but significantly impair the ability to penetrate them, typically attenuate or disperse the GPR 
signal so that very little of it can return to the receiver to be measured. Chloride-contaminated 
concrete is a relatively conductive medium, causing some relative increase in GPR signal 
amplitude to be measured at a wet surface where chlorides have intruded, and, more 
importantly, causing a marked decrease in amplitude at the top mat reinforcing level. Much of 
this amplitude decrease is attributed to greater signal attenuation of the GPR signal through 
the contaminated concrete, allowing less energy to return and be measured at the surface. 
These combined conditions are what allow GPR to be effective in identifying conditions that 
are dominant when rebar is corroding, corrosion products are causing cracking, delamination 
and spalling, and concrete is otherwise deteriorating.
5.3.2	
Impact Echo
Impact Echo (IE) test is used to determine deck thickness as well as to evaluate deck de-
bonding, corrosion induced delamination and integrity. Impact Echo on bridge decks is done 
with small metal spheres or electronic solenoid sources. The impact, however it is made, 
sends acoustic energy into the deck which resonates at a frequency whose wavelength is 
the thickness of the deck. The frequency spectrum of the receiver is used to determine the 
depth of reflectors according to: 
D = Vp/(2 x fr)
where D is the reflector depth, fr is the large dominant frequency peak identified in the 
response, and Vp is the compressional wave velocity. 
If the velocity of the concrete is known or can be measured, then the depth of a reflector can 
be calculated from the reflection echo peak frequency. The wave speed Vp can be measured 
by observing the travel time of a compressional wave between two transducers held a fixed 
distance apart on the concrete surface or by performing a calibration test on a slab of known 
thickness and observing the dominant frequency. The highest amplitude frequency peak is 
the main indicator of a reflector depth (thickness echo). The presence of additional echo 
peaks can also be significant, indicating the presence of possible defects or other interfaces

in the concrete. The IE technique is thus, used to identify a position of wave reflectors in a 
bridge deck, detect defects and can be considered as a defect diagnostics tool.
The best use of impact echo on a bridge deck is for overlay thickness. It is necessary to look 
for sites in between rebar to get the best depth measurement of the deck. Sites affected by 
the rebar will be readily in the data as a very shallow measurement (at the depth of the rebar). 
The biggest advantage of the IE method over the current practice of chain dragging is that 
it allows detection of zones of delamination at various stages: from initial to progressed and 
developed, thus enabling better prediction of deterioration process in the deck. To improve 
automation, accuracy and interpretation of results of the IE technique, the testing is simulated 
by the finite element method in two probable scenarios of delamination progression: expansion/
growth of single small delamination and progressive linking of several smaller delaminations. 
5.3.3	
Ultrasonic Seismic Methods and Ultrasonic Surface Waves Methods
Ultrasonic seismic methods (SASW and MASW) and Ultrasonic Surface Waves Methods 
are methods for evaluation of material properties and defects in structures based on the 
generation of elastic waves and measurement of their velocity of propagation and other 
wave propagation phenomena like reflections, refractions and dispersions. Compression and 
surface wave velocities are measured and correlated to the elastic moduli and thus, can 
be described as material quality control techniques. Ultrasonic Seismic and Impact-Echo, 
particularly when applied together in an integrated instrument such as a Seismic Pavement 
Analyzer (SPA) or Portable Seismic Pavement Analyzer (PSPA), are high-frequency, acoustic 
(seismic), geophysical methods for concrete condition assessment. In the transportation 
sector, these integrated surveys can be used for quality assurance (QA) verification of new 
construction (thickness determination and homogeneity of concrete pour, even segregation 
of aggregates or suspected voids) and calculation of mechanical properties, both on bridge 
decks and pavements. Fig. 77 shows typical ultrasonic seismic and impact echo test methods.
Fig. 77 Typical Ultrasonic Seismic and Impact Echo Test Methods
In the first part of the evaluation, the UBW test is conducted using an impact source and two 
receivers. From the travel time of the P-waves between the two receivers, the P-wave velocity 
is calculated. Because it is often difficult to identify arrivals of P-waves in an automated way, 
a more reliable way to estimate P-wave velocity is through the measurement of the R-wave 
velocity from the USW test. The R-wave velocity, for an assumed Poisson’s ratio, can be 
correlated to both compression and shear wave velocities and thus to the Young’s and 
shear Moduli. In the second part of the evaluation, the IE test is conducted using an impact 
source and a single nearby receiver. Because of a significant contrast in rigidity of concrete

and air the elastic wave is practically entirely being reflected between the bottom and the 
surface of the deck. The frequency of reflections, called return frequency, is clearly visible 
in the response spectrum. The depth of the reflector, in this case the deck thickness, can be 
obtained from the return frequency and previously determined P-wave velocity. In the case 
of a delaminated deck, reflections of the P-wave occur at shallower depths, causing a shift in 
the response spectrum towards higher frequencies. Fig. 78 shows typical portable pavement 
seismic analyser correlated to initial, moderate and severe delamination development.

and severe delamination development (fair, poor, serious), respectively
5.3.4	
Pachometer Test
For baseline condition assessment, the Pachometer, an electromagnetic (EM) instrument 
sensitive to ferrous content in steel is used to determine cover (depth to reinforcing steel 
from concrete surface), reinforcement quantity, and layout (spacing of bars and their lateral 
positions within the deck). It is best used to locate reinforcement in (a) rehabilitation situations 
where cutting or coring into concrete does not involve the risk of damaging post-tensioned 
cables and ducts, electrical conduits, fiber-optic conduits, or other embedded utilities; and 
(b) structural analysis calculations where reinforcing is known to be spaced at fairly large and 
consistent intervals within the depth range that these instruments are suitably sensitive.

5.3.5	
Infrared Thermography
Imaging using infrared thermography is a nondestructive geophysical approach used with 
some degree of accuracy when evaluating the condition of existing bridge decks, specifically 
for detection of shallow delaminations in bare concrete decks or identification of de-bonded 
zones at an overlay/deck interface. IR thermography identifies delaminations and de-bonded 
areas because it is sensitive to heat differences at the deck surface caused by the uneven 
rates of warming and cooling (accumulation and dissipation of thermal energy) between 
mass concrete, air-filled cavities (delaminations or de-bonded areas), and water-filled 
delaminations or de-bonded areas. Temperature differences on the surface can indicate the 
location of usually shallow delamination. Its primary limitations are:
	
i)	
Unreliability of solar heating to provide even thermal energy input into all 
areas of the deck.
	
ii)	
Speed of survey is limited to about 3 to 5 km/h, meaning that deck condition 
(thermal gradient) can change considerably from start to end of the survey, 
and a very slow-moving “mobile lane closure” is required.
	
iii)	
Effect of shadows from trusses, cables, walls, jersey barriers, and/or overhead 
decks generally ensure that uneven thermal loading and dissipation are 
taking place, removing much of the objectivity of the analysis.
	
iv)	
Dissipation of heat at a rapid rate by a mild breeze, particularly if the wind is 
sporadic with large variations in intensity; heat is removed temporarily at the 
surface on actual “hot-spots” that are missed as the survey progresses.
 
v) 
Problems with variations in reflectance from surface materials or surface 
conditions that can confuse or otherwise complicate the interpretation, such 
as pavement patches, surface staining from oil or burned pavement, surface 
‘polishing’ of a concrete deck or asphalt overlay, light and dark areas on a 
deck caused by sunlight and shadow, pavement markings (paint), etc.
	
vi)	
Time limitations brought about because surveys typically must be performed 
at limited times of the day when conditions are favorable, i.e., a few hours 
after initial warming of the deck when heat-retention differences at the surface 
reveal defects (morning hours) or immediately at or after sundown, when 
deck surfaces rapidly cool in some areas and more slowly cool in others.
5.3.6	
Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV) Test
UPV method is used for computing the ultrasonic pulse velocity of structural concrete. UPV 
can be used for assessing integrity of structural concrete elements of up to 7.5 m thick 
with two-sided access. This technique involves measuring the travel time of acoustic pulses 
through material with a known thickness. The frequencies of the transmitted signals vary 
from 50 to 300 kHz. Under certain conditions, it is possible to estimate the compressive 
strength using the ultrasonic pulse velocity method. The method requires that objects to be 
tested have two sides available for access. Voids, honeycomb, cracks, delaminations, and 
other damage to concrete can be located. This method is used to predict the strength of early 
stage concrete and as a relative indication of concrete quality. Fig. 79 shows typical relation 
between pulse velocity and compressive strength.

6 INTEGRATING GEOPHYSICAL METHODS
Planning for geophysical survey should be considered from the inception of a project, and 
the potential information that geophysical data may offer should be anticipated. Planning of 
a hypothetical project might anticipate the following stages:
 
i) 
Define research goals 
	
ii)	
Site reconnaissance
	
iii)	
Assess feasibility 
	
iv)	
Develop appropriate survey design 
	
v)	
Conduct survey 
	
vi)	
Develop preliminary interpretations 
	
vii)	
Ground truthing (on-the-ground testing) 
 
viii) Refine interpretations
As explained in the earlier sections, different methods have their individual limitations. As an 
example, seismic refraction is an excellent tool for obtaining information on rock depth, but 
suffers from the limitation that velocity must increase with depth. In few typical geological 
conditions, the assumptions does not hold good, and in such cases electrical tomography 
provides an excellent complimentary tool. 
Another good example is importance of shear wave velocities. The P-wave velocity in a 
material is mostly dependent on compressive strength. Experience (with a little common 
sense and some helpful tables) allows us to guess something about the material once the 
velocity is known. For example, if the P-wave velocity is 600 m/s, then we know that the 
material is probably a compacted soil. A sudden increase to 1500 m/s suggests that we have 
hit the water table. A velocity above 3000 m/s is almost certainly a fairly competent bed rock. 
A refraction analysis will tell us the depth from the surface to each of these materials and 
this result is adequate for many applications such as finding the depth to ground water or the 
excavation costs. However for major applications, like nuclear power plants, the complexity 
is much more. For a payer with velocity of 1500 m/s, no longer can we assume that this is 
just a saturated alluvial material. Consider some of the materials that might exhibit this same 
compressional wave velocity: saturated gravels, clay deposits, weathered rock, coal, or even 
quick sand. The shear wave velocities of these material show wide variations and help us 
uniquely resolve the problem.
