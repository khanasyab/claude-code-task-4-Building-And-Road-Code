Definitions
Bunching: Unintended arrival of two or more public transport vehicles in close succession, often 
occurring when vehicles operate at high frequencies and/or in mixed-traffic. 
Bus Rapid Transit (BRT): A high-quality bus-based transit system that delivers fast, comfortable, 
and cost-effective urban mobility through the provision of segregated right- of-way infrastructure, 
rapid and frequent operations, and excellence in marketing and customer service. 
Busways: A dedicated lane for existing bus services without any level boarding on low floor buses, 
SMART fare collection, information display etc. (See also closed and hybrid BRT system.)
Closed BRT system: Service by buses that operate only in exclusive busways, complemented by 
feeder service to trunk stations or terminals. (See also hybrid BRT system)	
Dedicated lane: A lane in which entry is permitted for specific types of vehicles.
Depot: A facility with provision for bus cleaning, maintenance, and parking. Depots also offer office 
space for bus operators and facilities for drivers including washrooms, canteens, and rest areas.
Docking bays: A location in a BRT station where a bus stops and aligns to the boarding platform.
Dwell time: The amount of time that a vehicle occupies a given stopping bay. 
Expressway: A divided highway for through traffic with access control and grade separations at most 
intersections.
Frequency: Number of vehicles per hour that stop at a station. 
Headway: Length of time that elapses between vehicle arrivals at a stop or station.
Hybrid system: Service that directly links origins and destinations with buses that operates both on 
and off an exclusive busway. (See also closed BRT system)
Light Rail Transit (LRT): Electric rail-based technology operated at surface level in exclusive lanes, 
typically composed of a single rail car or as a short train of cars. 
Load factor: The ratio of the number of passengers on a vehicle to the vehicle’s capacity. For example, 
if a bus has a capacity of 70 and an average load of 60 passengers, then the load factor is 0.85. The 
load factor for a BRT system is determined by the frequency of vehicles and the passenger volume. 
Higher load factors are more profitable for the system but may result in overcrowding. 
Median bus lanes: Lanes reserved for buses that are aligned in the middle of a roadway. 
Mixed traffic lane: A lane designated for use by various types of vehicles and users. 
Passengers per hour per direction (pphpd): The number of passengers passing by a particular 
point in a single direction every hour.
Passing lanes: Additional bus lane at the station for a given direction of travel that allows buses to 
pass (overtake) stopped buses.
Platform: An area in a BRT station where passengers board and alight from buses. Platforms also 
accommodate passenger waiting and circulation. 
Ramp: An inclined walkway or roadway connecting elements at different levels.
Saturation: Percentage of time that a station bay is occupied.
Sub-stop: Distinct stops within a single station,placed adequately apart to allow simultaneous, 
independent access to BRT buses via passing lanes.

BUS RAPID TRANSIT (BRT) DESIGN GUIDELINES FOR INDIAN CITIES
Introduction
At the first meeting of the H-8 Committee on Urban Roads and Streets held on 20th May 2015, 
members expressed the view that several cities in the country would require strengthening 
of road-based public transport and high capacity bus transport in corridors exhibiting heavy 
demand for public transport. In that context, the Committee decided that design guidelines 
may be prepared in respect of Bus Rapid Transit. This would help the city authorities in 
planning, provision and operations of this mode of travel, where warranted based on existing 
and projected demand.
Accordingly, the Committee constituted a Sub-Group headed by Ms. Shreya Gadepalli, 
Member of the Committee and South Asia Programme Lead, Institute for Transportation 
and Development Policy, to undertake the task of preparing the document on BRT Design 
Guidelines. Other members of the Sub-Group were Dr. Manoranjan Parida, Professor 
Transportation Division, IIT Roorkee; Dr. Devesh Tiwari, Principal Scientist, CRRI; Dr. Ch. 
Ravi Sekhar, Principal Scientist, CRRI; Mr. Amit Bhatt of World Resources Institute (WRI) and 
Ms. Anjlee Agarwal, Samarthyam, India. In addition, Mr. Christopher Kost and Ms. Pranjali 
Deshpande-Agashe from Urban Works Institute provided support to the Sub-Group.
The Sub-Group prepared the draft document, which was circulated among members of the 
Committee for comments and feedback. The document was further revised in the light of 
guidance and comments provided by the Committee.
The H-8 Committee in its meeting held on 28.10.2015 approved the BRT Design Guidelines 
and recommended its submission to the Highway Specifications and Standards Committee 
for their consideration and approval.
The composition of the H-8 Committee is given below:

The Highways Specifications & Standards Committee (HSS) considered and approved the 
draft document in its meeting held on 23rd June, 2017. The Executive Committee in its meeting 
held on 13th July, 2017 considered and approved the same document for placing it before 
the Council. The Council in its 212th meeting held at Udaipur on 14th July, 2017 considered 
and approved the draft IRC:124-2017 “Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Design Guidelines for Indian 
Cities” for printing.
1. Bus Rapid Transit System (BRT)
Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is a high quality bus-based transit system that delivers fast, 
comfortable, and cost-effective urban mobility through the provision of segregated right-of-
way infrastructure, rapid and frequent operations, and excellence in marketing and customer 
service. The United States Federal Transit Administration (FTA) defines BRT as a “rapid 
mode of transportation that combines the quality of rail transit and the flexibility of buses.” 
(Thomas 2001)
A more detailed definition, which was developed as part of the Transit Cooperative Research 
Program (TCRP)1 A-23 project, is:
1	
TCRP is a cooperative effort of three organizations: the Federal Transit Administration (FTA); 
the National Academies, acting through the Transportation Research Board (TRB); and the 
Transit Development Corporation, Inc. (TDC), a nonprofit educational and research organization 
established by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). For more information, visit

BRT is a flexible, rubber-tired rapid transit mode that combines stations, vehicles, services, 
running way, and Intelligent Transport System (ITS) elements into an integrated system with 
a strong positive image and identity. BRT applications are designed to be appropriate to the 
market they serve and their physical surroundings and can be incrementally implemented in 
a variety of environments. 
In brief, BRT is a permanently integrated system of facilities, services, and amenities that 
collectively improve the speed, reliability, and identity of bus transit. In many respects, BRT is 
rubber-tired Light Rail Transit (LRT), but with greater operating flexibility and potentially lower 
capital and operating costs. (Levinson et al, 2002)
The success of BRT depends on sound corridor selection and a set of physical and operational 
elements that improve the speed of operations, increase capacity, and enhance safety. These 
elements include the following:
	
l 
Dedicated median bus lanes that are physically separated from mixed traffic 
lanes. Dedicated lanes are crucial for ensuring that buses can move quickly 
and avoid congestion.
	
l 
A dedicated fleet of high quality buses and high quality stations with platforms 
that match the level of the bus so that passengers can enter and exit quickly 
and easily without climbing steps.
	
l 
Smart fare collection to enhance passenger convenience and improve 
efficiency.
	
l 
Well-designed intersections that restrict mixed traffic from taking turns across 
the bus way.
Dedicated Right-of-
Way
Bus-only lanes fully 
segregated from mixed 
traffic
Busway Alignment

Fig. 1: Basic elements of BRT
Much like a modern metro rail system, high quality BRT systems adopt an ecosystem 
approach where all elements including rolling stock (buses), stations, terminals, passenger 
information, and fare collection are designed to function seamlessly with each other. The 
coordinated provision of these elements is critical to maintaining superior performance and 
excellent customer service. Integration of these features accounts for proven track record

of BRT systems in not only serving existing public transport users better but also attracting 
users from personal motor vehicles.
An efficient street-level BRT can:
	
l	
Result in a multi-fold increase in the people-carrying capacity of urban roads.
	
l	
Serve a wide range of demand from 2000 to 45,000 persons per hour per 
direction (pphpd) at a capital cost that is typically one-tenth of elevated rail 
system to one-twentieth of an underground rail system.
	
l	
Be implemented quickly, in a span of three to five years.
	
l	
Cause a mode shift from personal motor vehicles to public transport.2
	
l	
Reduce emissions of harmful local pollution and greenhouse gases by 
attracting passengers from more polluting modes.
2. Role of BRT
2.1	
Forms of Road-Based Public Transport with Priority
Road-based public transport priority in urban areas can take a variety of forms, ranging from 
simple kerbside bus lanes to high capacity BRT and Light Rail Transit (LRT) corridors. Each 
of these approaches and technologies can have a role to play, depending on travel patterns, 
expected level of demand, and available capital budget. However, cities should exercise 
caution when planning for high-demand corridors, as basic solutions such as kerbside bus 
lanes or busways will provide a below average level of service. 
Within these categories, BRT can be further classified into two typologies: “closed” or “hybrid” 
systems. BRT systems, whether closed or hybrid, share key features, such as dedicated 
median lanes, level boarding, and off-board ticketing. However, BRT systems differ in how 
they provide service beyond dedicated trunk corridors. While closed systems operate feeder 
services with separate vehicles, hybrid systems extend trunk services beyond dedicated 
corridors, providing direct service with the same vehicle.
2.1.1	
Bus lanes
Bus lanes typically consist of painted demarcations on the kerbside of a carriageway. Buses 
stop at normal bus shelters along the side of the road. Personal motor vehicles are generally 
restricted from using the bus lanes, but may enter the lanes to access properties and to make 
left turns. 
Well-enforced kerbside bus lanes may offer a modest speed improvement over mixed traffic 
bus operations. However, kerbside lanes experience several drawbacks:
2	
Indian BRT systems like Janmarg (Ahmedabad) and Rainbow (Pune) have experienced mode 
shift around 8-12% during the initial period.



======================================================================

IRC:124-2017

l	
Lack of physical delineation makes it difficult to prevent unauthorised entry 
into the bus lane.
	
l	
Frequent entry of vehicles making left turns into properties or side streets 
can slow down buses.
 
l	
Personal and delivery vehicles may use the bus lanes for parking and drop-
off.
	
l	
Stepped entry increases boarding and alighting times and makes the system 
less accessible.
 
l	
High bus speeds adjacent to the footpath pose a safety hazard for pedestrians.
	
l	
At intersections, mixed traffic turning left comes into conflict with buses 
moving straight.
	
l	
Kerbside bus lanes require a more generous kerb radius at intersections, 
in case buses have to make left turns. This increases accident risk at 
intersections, especially for pedestrians.
	
l	
Unless physically separated cycle tracks are provided, cyclists are forced to 
travel in the bus lane next to fast-moving vehicles. Besides compromising 
cyclist safety, this arrangement also slows down buses.
Cities such as London, Sao Paulo, and Singapore have created networks of kerbside bus-
only lanes. These lanes are somewhat useful at raising bus speeds when effectively enforced 
and paired with congestion pricing, parking control, or other measures to reduce personal 
motor vehicle traffic. However, in cities where enforcement and travel demand management 
measures are weak, the benefit of painted bus lanes is marginal. Buses tend to leave the bus 
lanes for mixed traffic lanes in order to avoid parked vehicles and slow moving traffic. The 
capacity as well as speed of buses on such lanes tends to be low.
Photo 1: Parked vehicles and standing delivery trucks can compromise the utility of  
kerbside bus lanes (left): New York City, USA. Mixed traffic turning movements can also 
block kerbside lanes, leading to slower bus speeds (right): Los Angeles, USA.
2.1.2	
Busways
Busways give existing city buses priority with dedicated lanes, often in the median. The 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:124-2017
6
dedicated lanes may contribute to modest savings in travel time. However, busways miss 
many of the benefits of a mass rapid transit system. 
Elements that typically signify a busway are:
	
l	
Focus is on physical infrastructure (e.g., dedicated bus lanes), with less attention 
given to the overall ecosystem (e.g., seamless interface between stations and 
buses, route rationalisation, passenger information, electronic fare collection, 
intersection priority, and Information Technology Systems [ITS]). 
	
l	
Buses of varying configurations (i.e., in length, position of doors, size of 
doors, floor height, and presence of steps) operate on the dedicated bus 
lanes. Poor docking at stations, narrow doors, and steps make boarding or 
alighting inconvenient and slow, lead to higher dwell times at stations and 
longer journey times for passengers.
	
l	
When bus lanes are located on the kerbside of a road, they face constant 
interruption from vehicles making left turns into adjacent properties and side 
streets.
	
l	
Kerbside lanes tend to be encroached by parked vehicles. They also introduce 
the risk of conflicts between pedestrians and buses if pedestrian traffic spills 
over into the busway. All of these conflicts reduce safety and inhibit system 
speed, making the system less attractive for customers. They also limit the 
overall capacity of the corridor. 
	
l	
Little effort is made to train bus drivers on correct docking and safe driving.
	
l	
Retention of existing operator(s) running the same routes that they did 
previously and lack of route rationalisation can result in higher than necessary 
bus frequencies and long dwell times that potentially choke the busway.
	
l	
Operational interruptions are caused by frequent breakdowns of old buses in 
the busway.
	
l	
Old, cash-based ticketing inside buses (rather than cashless ticketing, 
primarily at the station), potentially lead to inconvenience to passengers and 
operational delays.
	
l	
Lack of comprehensive branding and customer information, along with the 
poor image of existing buses that operate in the lanes, make the system 
unattractive to potential customers.
While many cities in the world have attempted to create basic busways, the experience of 
passengers has not been significantly different from that in regular bus services in the city. 
Some cities, like Bogotá (Colombia) and Lima (Peru), started with busways but rebuilt those 
corridors as part of a BRT system to overcome the low quality of service, long travel times, 
and poor image of the busways. While the original busways had high throughput (exceeding 
20,000 pphpd in some cases), commercial speeds were often below 10 km/h.

Fig. 2: Busways provide dedicated lanes for buses but are often  
characterised by the lack of a dedicated bus fleet, poor quality stops,  
on-board ticketing, complicated route structures, and limited branding.
2.1.3	
Closed BRT systems
Closed BRT systems tend to mimic rail-based mass rapid transit systems. Key elements of 
a closed system are:
	
l	
Specially designed trunk buses that operate only on dedicated BRT lanes. 
	
l	
Separate trunk and feeder routes that connect at terminal stations. This 
typically reduces the fleet required. While it increases the number of 
passenger transfers, the financial performance of the system improves due 
to better operational efficiency.



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:124-2017

l	
Fare collection at the stations to reduce boarding and alighting delays, 
improve system efficiency, and enhance passenger convenience.
Compared to kerbside bus lanes and busways, BRT corridors add design elements that lead 
to a significant increase in capacity. In particular, passengers can board and alight through 
multiple wide doors without internal steps. Level boarding reduces the time that buses need 
to stop at each station, allowing a corridor to handle a larger number of buses each hour. 
In addition, off-board fare collection reduces delays caused by fare collection and payment 
verification inside the bus. Together, these design features enable BRT systems to handle 
high passenger throughput—ranging from 12,000 pphpd with a single lane per direction to 
45,000 pphpd with passing lanes—often with commercial speeds of 20 km/h and above. 
(See Section 4.3).
Bus operation reforms typically accompany the implementation of closed BRT systems. 
Often, the private sector is contracted to provide day-to-day services for various elements 
including bus operations, fare collection, system maintenance, and security. 
While closed BRT systems are similar to metro systems in many respects, a key difference is 
that BRT systems allow flexible routing—services can combine two or more trunk corridors, 
thereby reducing the number of transfers compared to a metro system in which passengers 
must interchange between lines. However, closed BRT systems tend to have more transfers 
than busways and regular city bus services due to the trunk-feeder configuration.
TRUNK LINES
FEEDER SERVICES
Fig. 3: Routes in a closed system are rationalised to operate as trunk and feeder 
services, where only BRT vehicles operate on the trunk corridor.

Photo 3: Many Latin American BRT systems, including Quito, Ecuador (left) and  
Bogotá, Colombia (right), operate as closed systems.
Closed systems can be employed when the demand is very high on trunk corridors but 
declines significantly on the feeder branches. Services within the trunk corridor are highly 
efficient and punctual since they are almost unaffected by the remaining traffic. Passenger 
transfers between trunk and feeder services should be facilitated with efficient interchange 
terminals to mitigate the inconvenience to the transferring passengers. Such transfer terminals 
may require differential platform heights in order to provide level boarding to feeder as well 
as trunk buses.
2.1.4	
Hybrid BRT systems
Hybrid BRT systems combine the benefits of closed BRT system with the flexibility of 
busways. The routes operated by the BRT fleet extend beyond the network of dedicated 
corridors, thereby providing passengers with direct connections and reducing the need for 
transfers. Otherwise known as “direct services,” these extended routes are most effective if 
the extended portion of the route is relatively short and uncongested. Otherwise, delays on 
the service extensions can result in irregular bus arrivals once buses enter the BRT trunk 
corridor. 
Recognising the potential for improved customer service from hybrid configurations, many 
BRT systems even those that began as closed trunk-and-feeder systems have begun 
introducing direct services. BRT systems with hybrid services include the Guangzhou BRT 
(Guangzhou, China), Rainbow BRT (Pune-Pimpri Chinchwad, India), and Rea Vaya BRT 
(Johannesburg, South Africa). Hybrid systems can have a wide range of capacities from 
2,000 pphpd to 30,000 pphpd at commercial speeds of around 20 km/h.
While some hybrid systems retain the existing bus route network and simply operate those 
routes in the new physical infrastructure of the BRT network, the introduction of BRT presents 
an opportunity to improve customer experiences by rationalising the routes. Rationalisation 
can simplify complicated route networks, reduce wait times, and minimise the number of

passengers who need to transfer one or more times in order to reach their destinations. The 
rationalisation process should be informed by the data obtained from travel demand surveys 
(see Section 3.1, Corridor Selection).

2.2	
Light Rail Transit (LRT)
LRT is an electric rail-based technology operating either as a single rail car or as a short train 
of cars, typically on an exclusive right-of-way at street level. Modern LRT systems feature 
many of the same features as BRT, including platform level boarding, off-board fare collection, 
and real-time passenger information.
Surface LRT systems usually carry volumes below 15,000 pphpd. As volumes increase, the 
only option is to increase the service frequency or increase the number of cars in the train. 
LRT systems generally cannot accommodate passing tracks, so system capacity is limited to 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:124-2017
11
the number of people that single track can serve. Operations are restricted to the network of 
LRT tracks, akin to a closed BRT system. Surface LRT systems cost 8 to 10 times as much 
as BRT systems. Therefore, for most urban corridors, either a closed or hybrid BRT system is 
more cost-effective than LRT. Table-1 summarises the typical features of road-based public 
transport priority systems.

BRT vs. Road Expansion
Cities often try to address congestion by building wider roads, flyovers, and elevated roads. 
Such investments in car-centric infrastructure bring at best short-lived mobility benefits, as 
private cars are inefficient users of precious road space.
A single lane filled with cars typically carries only 1,000 to 1,200 pphpd, compared to 
2,000-12,000 pphpd in a single BRT lane.3 In the long run, studies have found that there 
is a near one-to-one relationship between expansion in road space and the ensuing road 
congestion4, i.e., more and more people shift to a new road until they have used up all of the 
additional road space. As a result, speeds plummet to the same level experienced prior to the 
road expansion project but with a larger number of vehicles stuck in traffic.
The only way to achieve a lasting increase in the capacity of the transport system of a city 
is to invest in modes that use road space efficiently namely public transport, walking, and 
cycling. Cities should devote a major share of transport funding to cost-effective sustainable 
transport infrastructure and services, including BRT.
3	
With the addition of a passing lane at BRT stations and express services, the capacity can go up 
to 45,000 pphpd.

Fig. 5: Expanding road space for personal vehicles results in modest  
capacity improvements. Allocating dedicated road space for BRT is a  
more effective way to increase passenger throughput.
On streets with moderate to high demand for public transport (i.e., over 2,000 pphpd), 
cities should start to plan for BRT integrated with other mass rapid transit services 
across the city. Further, allocation for BRT corridors must be made on any new arterial 
streets being planned and implemented. Ideally, dedicated lanes for BRT should be created 
before traffic congestion sets in. However, even in situations where a public transport corridor 
is congested with traffic, it is equitable to dedicate lanes for BRT to cater to existing as well 
as future demand for mass rapid transit. 
2.4	
BRT and Grade-Separated Rail
A key element of transport planning is the calibration of transport services to the travel 
patterns and demand level along the corridor in question. A service that is undersized relative 
to expected demand may result in overcrowding and delays. On the other hand, a system 
with too much capacity represents an inefficient allocation of resources that could have been 
used to improve other transport services or meet other basic needs in the city. Therefore, 
sound transport planning must seek to provide the required capacity on each of a city’s 
transport corridors in a cost-effective way. 
High-capacity rail-based modes, such as metro rail systems, can provide high quality service 
on high demand corridors. However, demand on major corridors in many Indian cities falls 
in the range of 2,000 to 10,000 pphpd well below the level needed to justify the large capital 
investment required for a metro rail system (i.e., at least 20,000 pphpd), and well within the 



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:124-2017
13
range that can be handled by a BRT system with a single lane per direction. The existing 
arterial streets in many Tier 1 Indian cities, already have more than 100 buses per hour or 
6,000 pphpd that make them a strong case for BRT5.
Large cities (Population > 5 million), a balanced public transport network might include metro 
rail services on some of the city’s highest demand corridors, while the remaining corridors 
in the city can be served by BRT6. In medium-sized cities (population of 1-5 million), BRT 
typically can provide sufficient capacity to serve the city’s entire mass rapid transit network. 
Cities smaller than 1 million typically do not need a rapid transit system and bus and Para 
transit services are sufficient to serve the demand. However, cities whose population is 
expected to touch 1 million within the next 5 years should start planning for a BRT system. 
BRT is also a very cost effective option for the cities having existing population upto 2 million 
and it should be one of the first considerations in MRT system development in any city.7 It is 
suitable for cities where an MRT system needs to be developed quickly and incrementally as 
conditions and funding.8
Fig. 6: The choice of rapid transit technologies should correspond to the expected  
level of demand (left). The city of Chennai is implementing metro rail on three of its  
highest demand corridors (indicated in blue in the diagram at right). On other corridors,  
BRT can meet expected passenger demand.

Street level LRT can provide high quality service on corridors with moderate demand, 
provided that it incorporates the same key features that characterise BRT systems (i.e., 
dedicated lanes, level boarding, off-board fare collection). LRT lacks the flexibility of BRT 
and its capacity is limited to around 15,000 pphpd. However, the capacity of an LRT system 
(with a single track per direction) is higher than that of a single lane per direction BRT system 
(which peaks at around 12000 pphpd). BRT systems with express services can serve higher 
demand but require an additional passing lane at the stations to enable overtaking.
Higher capacities can be achieved if LRTs are grade separated, but the cost of LRTs with 
frequent grade separated elements begins to approach that of metro systems. In sum, high 
cost of implementing LRT paired with capacities that are equivalent to those of BRT systems 
typically mitigates against their implementation in cities with limited capital budgets.
3. Planning for BRT
3.1	
Network Selection
An initial step in the BRT planning process is to identify the network of corridors where BRT 
can and should be implemented. Network selection is a function of multiple considerations, 
including:
	
1.	
Existing and future passenger demand patterns.
	
2.	
Presence of severe congestion.
	
3.	
The need to offer equitable access to the system to people across all socio-
economic groups.
	
4.	
Potential to minimise passenger transfers.
	
5.	
Potential to minimise land acquisition.
	
6.	
Right of Way (ROW) availability.
Passenger demand is a key factor for corridor selection. A BRT system should be located 
where it will benefit a large number of people relative to the expected investment. While cities 
are often averse to develop BRT corridors in congested parts of the city where traffic volumes 
near the capacity of the carriageway, it is precisely these locations that have significant 
number of passengers on public transport (a combination of buses and informal public 
transport vehicles such as shared autos and mini buses), and could benefit most by the 
creation of a BRT. 
As has been observed in many cities across the world, creation of a BRT has benefited 
not just public transport passengers but also people travelling by other modes due to the 
streamlining of vehicular traffic. However, the primary goal of creating a BRT is to maximise 
the ability of a corridor to transport people rather than vehicles. This goal has also been noted 
in the National Urban Transport Policy of the Government of India.



======================================================================

======================================================================

BRT should not be seen as a solution for solving traffic congestion. Even in cases where 
a BRT is created on less congested corridors, personal motor vehicle traffic growth results 
in congestion on the mixed-traffic lanes, abutting BRT lanes, within a few years. Instead, 
it should be viewed as an effective option for those who wish to travel rapidly, safely, and 
comfortably, even when there is congestion on mixed-traffic lanes of the carriageway. 
The only known solutions for controlling traffic congestion are measures that control the 
demand for the use of personal motor vehicles through physical restrictions or appropriate user 
charges, such as market-based parking fee and congestion pricing, along with appropriate 
enforcement measures.
Demand is generally assessed through three basic types of surveys:
	
l	
Frequency-Occupancy (FO) survey: An FO survey records how frequently 
each bus or taxi route runs and the approximate occupancy of each vehicle.
	
l	
Boarding-Alighting (BA) survey: The BA survey is an on-board count of 
how many passengers get on and off of the vehicle at each stop along the 
route.
	
l	
Transfer surveys: A transfer survey is helpful in order to get a better sense 
of full passenger trips, including trips that involve more than one segment 
linked by a transfer from one route to another.
A city may opt to gather more data using other types of surveys, depending on system 
complexity, the project timeline, and availability of funds. Data from travel demand surveys 
can be processed using a basic spreadsheet model or travel demand modelling tools such as 
CUBE, Transcad or Emme. Key model outputs include the passenger load on different parts 
of the corridor and the expected boardings and alightings at each station. These demand 
data are used to determine the alignment and frequency of BRT services. Eventually, they 
also inform the sizing of stations, terminals, and other physical infrastructure elements. A 
four-step model is useful to estimate mode shift. However it is equally valid to use rule of 
thumb to make decisions on network selection.
A BRT corridor should be long enough to provide a meaningful impact on travel times and 
passenger convenience. If warranted by passenger demand, BRT corridors must continue all 
the way into congested parts of the city. There is limited utility in building BRT infrastructure 
in uncongested outer roads while sending buses into mixed traffic as soon as they reach 
congested areas.

walled city (left), helps provide fast, reliable service where passenger demand is highest. 
Road width need not pose a constraint to the implementation of BRT, as demonstrated  
by Mexico City (right) and other cities around the world that have built BRT-only corridors  
in dense city centre environments.

New streets that are developed in the periphery of the city may be designed to be BRT-ready, 
with space reserved in the centre for a future BRT, especially in the case of streets with a 
right of way of more than 36 m. This is most effective when such reservations are made in 
the statutory development plan of the city/region. BRT infrastructure can be created once the 
demand is high enough to justify dedicated infrastructure.
3.2	
BRT Configuration and System Capacity
System capacity refers to the maximum number of people or vehicles that can be moved in a 
single direction on a BRT corridor. It is important to match the system design to the required 
capacity, as a design with inadequate capacity can lead to delays, overcrowding, and a poor 
image for the system. 
Among the factors that determine the capacity of a BRT system, the configuration of the lanes 
and stations is the key. A BRT system with one lane per direction in station areas can handle 
about 70 regular buses an hour, or around 5,000 pphpd. This configuration is appropriate 
for the corridor demand in many Tier 2 Indian cities. Above these volumes, bus congestion 
caused by bus docking at stations results in delays and slower commercial speeds. The 
capacity of a system with one lane per direction can be increased to around 9,000 pphpd 
by adding articulated buses or 12,000 pphpd by using bi-articulated buses (see section 4.3, 
Calculating corridor capacity: basic approach).   
In situations with higher passenger demand, passing lanes at stations can increase the 
capacity of a BRT system. The Transmilenio BRT system in Bogotá (Colombia) can carry 
up to 45,000 pphpd through the use of articulated and bi-articulated buses, passing lanes 
at stations, and up to 60 per cent of services operating as express routes that stop only at 
limited locations. Another system with passing lanes, the Guangzhou BRT system in China, 
carries 27,000 pphpd.
For passing lanes to function effectively, stations must be long enough to accommodate 
separate stopping bays, also called sub-stops, that can function independent of one another 
(see section 4.4). Multiple sub-stops increase the number of buses that can dock at a station 
without causing congestion and permit different types of services to operate from the same 
station. 
In cases where adequate space for long stations is not available, another possibility is to 
create stations with docking positions on both sides of the station for a single direction. 
The additional docking bays allow the system to handle higher bus frequencies without 
experiencing slow-downs due to congestion at stations. (BRT systems in Lanzhou and 
Yichang with dual-side docking are able to handle frequencies of 80-100 buses per hour with 
competitive commercial speeds of 20 km/h or more.)
Some systems with a single lane per direction increase capacity by operating buses in 
convoys of two or more vehicles operating in a closely bunched pack. In some cases, convoys 
are able to transport up to 20,000 pphpd in a single lane. However, at volumes above 13,000 
pphpd, convoys experience a major deterioration in commercial speeds. If space is available, 



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:124-2017
18
it is preferable to increase capacity through the use of passing lanes and stations with multiple 
sub-stops.
With a variety of configurations to handle varying levels of passenger demand, BRT 
capacities are competitive with rail-based modes. For example, LRT systems typically can 
accommodate up to 15,000 pphpd with a single track per direction, a level easily achievable 
with BRT. Monorails are lower capacity systems, handling around 8,000 pphpd on the busiest 
known systems. BRT with passing lanes, which can carry up to 45,000 pphpd, is comparable 
with all but the world’s highest capacity metro systems.
Photo 6: A single-lane BRT system like that in Mexico city (left) can handle volumes from 
5,000 to 12,000 pphpd, depending on the type of vehicle used. With passing lanes at 
stations, a BRT system can carry up to 45,000 pphpd, the capacity of Bogotá’s Transmilenio. 
iBus, Indore (right) has passing lanes at stations to help cater to future demand. (Photos

Fig. 8: Capacity of mass rapid transit systems. A simple BRT system with one BRT lane per 
direction and regular 12 m buses can carry up to 5,000 passengers per hour per direction 
(pphpd). The capacity increases to 9,000 pphpd with articulated buses and to 12,000 pphpd 
with bi-articulated buses. The addition of a passing lane brings a dramatic increase in 
capacity of up to 45,000 pphpd far above the capacity of LRT and monorails and competitive 
with high capacity metro systems.

4. System design
4.1	
Dedicated Bus Lane Alignment
A common misconception is that kerbside alignment of bus lanes reduces the crossing distance 
for bus passengers. In fact, the overall crossing distance for a round trip is the same whether 
bus stops are located on the outer edges or the centre of a road. If bus stops are located on the 
kerb, a passenger can board from the same side for travel in one direction but has to cross the 
entire road to travel in the other direction. If stops are located in the median, the passenger has 
to cross half of the street each time. The total crossing distance remains the same.
Photo 7: Median busway alignment avoids conflicts with other traffic, especially from turning 
movements from mix-traffic lanes: Ecovia, Quito, Ecuador (left) and Rainbow, Pune (right).
4.2	
Station Alignment
Common BRT station typologies include the following:
	
l	
A single centrally located station serving both directions of service.
	
l	
Side stations on the outer edges of a median busway, each serving a single 
direction of service.
	
l	
A pair of two-sided stations, each serving the same direction of travel.
A single central station serving both directions is the configuration employed in most high 
performance BRTs. This alignment has several advantages:
	
l	
Optimal use of street space: Central stations require a single entry area 
and single set of turnstiles; whereas two bilateral stations each require their 
own entries, thereby increasing the total length of the stations.
	
l	
Easier customer transfers between routes: Central stations make it easier 
for customers to transfer from one bus route to another without having to exit 
the station and cross a street, irrespective of the direction of the two routes.
	
l	
Easier docking: Bus drivers have an easier time docking stations that are 
located on the driver’s side of the bus.



======================================================================
PAGE 29 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:124-2017
20
	
l	
Lower construction and maintenance costs: Central stations are smaller 
and are up to 40 per cent less expensive to build and operate than two bus 
stations on either side of the central bus lanes.
Photo 8: Median stations, such as in Pimpri Chinchwad are  
less expensive and have a more compact footprint than side stations.
Side stations on the outer edge of the busway are sometimes employed to permit the use 
of an existing fleet of buses with kerbside doors. However, in such cases, system designers 
and operators should ensure that only high-quality, low-entry buses are permitted in the 
BRT corridor. A common pitfall is to open the corridor to multiple types of vehicles with 
different internal floor heights and mismatched door locations. Doing so renders the system 
inaccessible to many users, makes boarding slower and less convenient, and generally 
detracts from system image. Moreover, the cost savings from the use of an existing bus fleet 
are relatively small in comparison to the overall capital cost of a BRT system. Therefore, it 
is advisable that a new fleet of compatible, high-quality buses are procured along with the 
creation of suitable BRT infrastructure. Further, these buses must be maintained well and 
replaced at the end of their rated life (typically 7-10 years). Well-maintained buses break 
down less and tend to last longer, resulting in lower cost of operations. 
A recent innovation in BRT design is to develop two station buildings, each with boarding 
areas on both sides serving a single direction. Found in systems in Lanzhou and Yichang 
(China), such an arrangement increases the number of vehicles that can dock at the station 
while maintaining a reasonable level of saturation. Both of these systems utilise buses with 
low-entry doors on both sides. 
Potentially, dual-side stations could also introduce multiple dock heights. High-entry buses 
with median side doors would dock on the left side of the station, while low-entry buses with 
kerb side doors would dock on the right. An internal ramp would connect the two boarding

areas. The high-entry vehicles could be articulated or bi-articulated buses that provide trunk 
only services while the low-entry vehicles could provide direct services outside the corridor. 
High level of detailing and utmost design and safety precautions are essential while adopting 
such a composition.

Calculating Corridor Capacity: Basic Approach
The capacity of a BRT corridor depends on the load factor, vehicle size, the service frequency, 
and the number of stopping bays at each station. The equation below shows the basic 
relationship between these factors and the capacity of a BRT system:
Ccorridor = Cvehicle* L * F* B
Where:
	
l	
CCorridor is the number of people the corridor can transport, expressed in 
passengers per hour per direction (pphpd).
	
l	
Cvehicle is the passenger capacity of the vehicle.
	
l	
L, load factor, is the average occupancy of the vehicles, expressed as a 
per cent.
	
l	
F, service frequency, is the number of vehicles per hour per stopping bay.
	
l	
B is the number of independent stopping bays in each station.
Table-2 gives the corridor capacities estimated by the basic capacity formula for a range of 
frequencies and station sizes. The capacity of a single sub-stop is typically limited to 50-60 
buses per hour. This capacity can dramatically reduce when dwell times are longer due to a 
large number of passengers boarding and/or alighting at certain stops, but, more frequently, 
due to poor bus docking and restrictions in access to the bus, in the form of narrow doors 
and/or steps inside the bus, resulting in slower boarding and alighting time per passenger. 
As can be seen, the provision of passing lanes and multiple stopping bays leads to a dramatic 
increase in system capacity. It should be noted that the number of stopping bays also affects 
the type of busway infrastructure. If the number of stopping bays increases to four or more, 
then it is likely that two lanes per direction will be required along the entire length of the 
busway not just at stations.

Station Saturation
The “saturation” of a station refers to the degree to which passenger and bus volumes have 
reached the station’s design capacity. Station saturation is a significant parameter in BRT 
planning as it indicates the maximum number of commuters that a particular BRT configuration 
can handle while providing an acceptable level of service. 
In literal terms, saturation refers to the percentage of time that a vehicle-stopping bay at a 
BRT station is occupied. Based on empirical evidence, BRT systems perform best when the 
saturation level is below 40 per cent at each station. Above this level, BRT systems run the 
risk of congestion and system breakdown. Therefore, it is desirable to keep saturation levels 
as low as possible. It should be noted that overcrowding in a station does not necessarily 
indicate a high level of saturation. Crowding in a station can result from inadequate bus 
frequency, even if the saturation level is low.
Photo 10: In Sao Paulo, high saturation levels at BRT stations can lead to bus queuing (left). In 
Jakarta, passengers experience delays due to high saturation levels at major terminals (right).
In systems with moderate demand, stations should be constructed with at least two docking 
bays per direction. The additional docking bay allows two buses to dock at the station 
simultaneously. Constructing multiple sub-stops with passing lanes can reduce station 
saturation further. Sub-stops are independent docking units that allow buses to pass one 
sub-stop and dock at another. Passing lanes are required at stations to allow buses to pass 
other vehicles that are stopped for boarding and alighting, but the corridor can return to a 
single lane per direction between stations.
Each sub-stop is separated from others by minimum of 32 m to allow buses to manoeuvre 
into and out of each stop regardless of whether the other sub-stops are occupied. Each 
sub-stop can handle around 50 buses per hour, leading to a dramatic increase in system 
capacity. Further, express services that stop only at a limited number of stops increase 
capacity further. Systems have two to three sub-stops per station but some systems have as 
many as four sub-stops per station. Beyond this, it is better to create a new station with its 
own sub-stops.

Transmilenio, Bogotá (left) and Guangzhou BRT (right).
The number of sub-stops required at a station is determined using data on the number of 
passengers boarding and alighting at the station and the frequency of buses. The following 
formula indicates the saturation level at a station:

Calculating Corridor Capacity
4.5.1	
First advanced approach
While the basic capacity formula described in the section above provides a broad idea of the 
capacity that is achievable on a BRT corridor, a more detailed analysis of theoretical system 
capacity should take into account the quantity of passenger movements at each station:

4.5.2	
Second advanced approach
The second advanced approach is based on the Levinson’s approach as mentioned in 
the latest transit capacity and quality service manual. TCQSM (2013) reported a model to 
estimate the bus stop capacity as shown below:
Where Bs is the bus stop capacity, Nel is the number of the effective loading area; td is the 
average dwell time(s). This model with some improvements in the estimation of its components 
for Indian condition can be used to estimate the capacity of the BRT corridor. For using this 
model, first the dwell time is estimated as presented in the equation below:
Dwell Time = Pata + Pbtb + BLT
Where ‘Pb’ and ‘Pa’ are the number of passengers boarding and alighting, ‘ta’­ and ‘tb’ are per 
person alighting and boarding time, ‘toc’ is the bus door opening and closing time and BLT is 
the bus lost time or boarding lost time. Bus Lost Time (BLT) which is a recently introduced 
component of dwell time is defined as the waiting time for a bus, between when the bus 
comes to stop in its loading area and when the first passenger boards the bus (Jaiswal et 
al. 2010). BLT, in other words, is the additional time apart from the passenger service times 
and bus door opening time, which should be added in the dwell time estimation model. Since 
BRTS in India majorly has two loading area stops hence, a BLT of 2.3 sec for loading area 
1, and 3 sec for loading area 2 can be used (Kathuria et al. 2016). Once the dwell time is 
estimated then, the mean dwell time (td) and the Cv i.e. the coefficient of variation can be 
estimated from the same. 
The second step is to estimate the failure rate. The failure rate is defined as the percentage 
of buses that arrive at the bus stop to find all available loading areas already occupied. 
Failure rate data can either be collected manually or by videography survey. The value of Z 
in the capacity model can be estimated only when the failure rate is known. TCQSM (2013) 
provides values of Z corresponding to the operational failure rate (see Table-3).

To get the maximum capacity of the system, a failure rate of 25% is recommended. This value 
is suggested so that a trade-off between failure rate and operational reliability of the system 
is maintained. A failure rate value higher than this will result in flow exceeding capacity.
Bus clearance time (tc) is estimated as presented in the equation below.
tc= tsu+ tre
Where tsu is the minimum time for the bus to start and cover its own length and the next bus 
to come and pull in, tre is the re-entry delay. The re-entry delay in the case of BRT system is 
zero because BRTS has dedicated lane and the bus stops are located online but not offline. 
Nel in capacity model i.e. the number of effective loading area is considered because in 
constrained situations buses in the rear loading area have to wait for exit till the front loading 
is empty. To counter this effect, effective loading area is considered. TCQSM(2013) suggest 
1.75 as Nel value for two loading area online stop. The Nel value for different number of 
loading areas is given in Table-4.

After putting all the parameters in the above model, the stop capacity is calculated. The 
minimum stop capacity is the corridor capacity.

5. Station design
Stations play a major role in shaping a passenger’s overall experience of using a BRT system. 
Stations need to have sufficient capacity to handle anticipated ridership, and should offer a 
safe, comfortable space that eases the wait. Beyond functionality, stations are important 
in defining the image of a BRT system. A prominent, attractive station has the potential to 
inspire the communities around it and demonstrate that BRT is a lasting investment in the 
urban environment.

5.1	
Bus-Station Interface
Buses and stations must be designed together to ensure that a BRT system is accessible to 
all. To reduce boarding and alighting time, the station platform level should be at the same 
level as the bus floor. Internal steps render a system completely unusable by persons in 
wheelchairs, and even small steps can cause significant delays for the elderly, disabled, 
or people with suitcases or strollers. To accommodate such users, BRT systems require, 
modern buses with floor height that matches the height of the station floor.  
The reduction or elimination of the vehicle-to-platform gap is also key to customer safety and 
comfort. The gap between the station and the bus should not be more than 5 cm. Physical 
measures such as kassel kerbs or alignment markings can help guide bus drivers closer to 
the station. In addition, alignment markings can be placed on the bus dashboard and in the 
bus lane. Ultimately, good bus docking is a function of the level of driver training and system 
monitoring (Photo-14 and Photo-15).
To further improve safety, many BRT systems make use of sliding doors at stations. Doors 
give a degree of security to commuters and they protect against weather, reduce accident 
risks, and prevent fare evaders from entering the BRT system.

BRT vehicles should be designed with sufficient number of wide doors to facilitate rapid 
boarding and alighting at stations. Regular 12 m buses should have at least two doors on the 
station side, while articulated buses should have four doors. Each door should be at least 
1.2 m wide. Where doors are situated together, they should be separated by at least 400 mm. 
However, it is recommended that there be a greater gap between the two doors of the bus for 
better internal circulation and lower ingress/egress times. 
In case of buses with median doors for trunk corridor operations, doors also should be 
provided on the left side of the bus to enable the system to operate direct services that 
extend beyond the dedicated corridor. BRT vehicles need to comply with the urban bus 
design standards, as developed by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Government 
of India. (see Section 8,Vehicle Specifications).

types of vehicles that are expected to ply on the corridor in current and future phases.

5.2	
Station Layout and Size
A BRT station contains three primary areas:
	
l	
Ramp(s): Provided on one or both ends of the station, ramps make the 
station accessible to all users. The ramp should have a slope not exceeding 
1:15, making it convenient for the disabled. The ramp should have railing 
on both sides and should have tactile paver blocks for people with visual 
impairments.
	
l	
Fare collection area: The fare collection area contains system information 
displays and a place for customers to buy tickets. The ticketing booth should 
be at least 1.1 m by 1.5 m. Turnstiles or flap-gates should be provided for off-
board fare collection.
	
l	
Boarding area: The boarding area should provide space for people waiting 
for buses as well as circulation space for people entering or leaving the 
station. For small to medium stations, bus-docking positions on either 
direction should be staggered for easy circulation of people inside the 
station.
Together, these elements typically add up to a length of 70 m for a moderate-demand BRT 
system with 12 m buses.
Fig. 12: Typical BRT station configuration incorporating ramp,  
fare collection area, and circulation space.
The width of station platform depends on width of the structural elements, the waiting 
area for both directions, and circulating width. Staggering the docking bays for opposite 
directions reduces the total width required. Length required for waiting passengers at 
each docking bay should be equal to the length of the bus. Width required for waiting 
passengers depends on the peak demand at a given station and the frequency of the 
buses. Circulation width depends on the total number of boarding and alighting passengers 
during peak hours. 
Poor bus operations result in long waiting times and crowded stations. Further, if the space 
within a station is inadequate for the volume of passengers it is expected to handle, bus 
boarding and alighting times increase due to crowding, and the efficiency of the system 
deteriorates.



======================================================================
PAGE 41 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:124-2017
32
It is recommended that stations have a width of at least 4 m to provide room for waiting 
and circulation. The internal clear width should be minimum 3 m in case of a one-way BRT 
station.
Fig. 13: Station configurations for systems with various levels of demand.
When the demand is high, systems should be designed with passing lanes and independent 
sub-stops. The distance between the independent sub-stops should be approximately 1.8 
times for buses to manoeuvre easily. BRT stations should be designed to allow for the addition 
of new modules based on future increase in passenger demand. Space in the median may 
be reserved for future extension of the station. 
Fig. 14: At stations with passing lanes, the distance between two docking bays on stations 
should be 1.8 times the length of the bus for easy manoeuvring. For 12 m BRT buses,  
the distance between two docking bays should be at least 22 m, while for 18 m buses;  
the distance between two docking bays should be at least 32 m.



======================================================================

======================================================================
IRC:124-2017
33
5.3	
Distance between Stations
Stations should be placed at an average spacing of 500 m in order to ensure that bus stops 
are accessible to adjoining neighbourhoods. With greater station spacing, the increased time 
spent walking to the stations more than offsets any gains due to higher bus speeds. Stations 
that are too close result in lower bus speeds. Accepting that spacing may vary from station to 
station depending on local conditions, systems should aim for spacing in the range of 300 m 
to 800 m.
Photo 18: An average spacing of 300 to 800 m between stations is optimal for passengers.
5.4	
Architectural Features
The waiting area of a BRT station must provide seating, lighting, and real-time passenger 
information. The use of open station architecture allows for natural ventilation and lighting 
(see Photo-19). However, the station roof should provide protection from rain and sun. An 
overhang is preferred to shelter passengers when boarding or alighting. Stations should be 
built with durable, low-maintenance materials to minimise maintenance costs.
Photo 19: The BRT stations should offer seating, leaning bars, and adequate circulation 
space to meet expected passenger demand: Rainbow, Pimpri-Chinchwad, India (left)  
and GZ BRT, Guangzhou, China (right).

For night-time operations, adequate lighting (e.g., an illumination level of 150 lux) should 
be provided to ensure the safety of BRT passengers. Reduced intensity lighting should be 
provided at station ends to mitigate changes in brightness experienced by the driver while 
pulling into the station.
Photo 21: Adequate lighting at BRT stations is important to ensure passenger safety and 
comfort: Mio BRT, Cali (left) and Transmilenio, Bogotá (right).
5.5	
Terminal Design
A terminal is a large station that functions as a major interchange between trunk and feeder 
routes or between the BRT system and para transit or intercity services. Individual bus routes 
often start or end at terminals. The location of terminals is a function of passenger demand 
requirements, travel patterns, and the size of the BRT network. Terminal and interchange 
facilities require space for the buses to turn around and multiple bays for the various routes 
that pass through the terminal. 
Larger terminals should also provide passenger amenities, administrative offices, and space 
for midday bus parking. Depending upon availability of land, the terminals may either be sited 
within the corridor ROW or slightly off the corridor. However, the position of a terminal should 



======================================================================
PAGE 44 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:124-2017
35
be close enough to major destinations to facilitate passenger access by foot and on other 
modes.
Good terminal design should minimise bus circulation and passenger movements. A single 
platform serving BRT buses on one side and feeder buses on the other is the most convenient 
design for passengers. It also permits fare free transfers or integrated fare collection, 
depending on the fare structure of the system. BRT and non-BRT platforms need physical 
separation in between the two areas if transfers are not free.

the trunk and feeder platforms can be split entirely (bottom).

terminals can include multiple platforms under a single roof.
6. Corridor design
6.1	
Street Elements and Design Configurations
BRT corridor design requires careful planning covering cross section designs, busway 
placement, intersection treatments, and station positions. BRT corridors function best if they 
are designed to meet the needs of all users, including public transport users, pedestrians, 
cyclists, and personal motor vehicle users.
Various elements of a BRT corridor and their suggested dimensions are given below:
	
l	
BRT lane for one-way movement should have a width of 3.5 m. The width of 
a passing lane, where required, should be 4 m. 
	
l	
A divider, minimum 0.5 m wide, should separate BRT lanes from mixed 
traffic. These should be expanded to at least 1 m at street crossing points by 
marginally reducing carriageway and BRT lane width.



======================================================================
PAGE 46 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:124-2017
37
	
l	
Median stations that serve both directions of BRT services should have a 
minimum inner clear width of 3.5 m. The outer width would be minimum 4 
m. Station width may have to be expanded based on passenger demand. If 
adequate width is not available, then the boarding areas for the two directions 
may be staggered to reduce the conflict between passengers waiting to 
board and those alighting and wanting to exit. 
	
l	
The width of all BRT elements, at station locations without passing lanes, 
should be 12 m. In case of systems that require a passing lane, the total 
width of BRT elements at station expands to 16 m. Since passing lanes are 
not required at non-station locations, the width of BRT elements drops to 8 
m in both cases.
	
l	
Footpaths are essential for safe pedestrian access to BRT stations. Footpaths 
with a minimum clear width of 1.8 m should be provided on either side of the 
carriageway. A tree line next to the footpath with a minimum width of 1 m 
should be included at all locations.
	
l	
Cycle tracks may be provided along the corridor for the safety and convenience 
of cyclists where adequate right of way is available. 
	
l	
In case of BRT, since a majority of large vehicles (buses) do not use the 
carriageway, the carriageway width may be reduced from 7 m to 6.0-6.5 m. 
	
l	
At non-station locations along the BRT corridor, parallel parking may be 
provided at the edge of a carriageway or a service lane, depending on the 
chosen street cross-section.

BRT requires wider cross sections at stations. Elsewhere, a multi-utility zone that provides 
space for on-street parking and bus stops can occupy the extra 4 m of ROW that is available 
between stations. Walking and cycling provide last-mile connectivity to BRT stations, and 
space for these modes should not be compromised in station areas. BRT lanes require 
physical separation to prevent entry by mixed traffic. Physical delineators should be paired 
with adequate signage and road markings to alert personal motor vehicle users that they may 
not enter the lanes.

A BRT corridor with all elements BRT stations and lanes for both directions; 2-lane 
carriageways, one for each direction; footpaths with tree cover and cycle tracks at both edges 
can be accommodated on streets with an ROW of 36 m and above. Parking may be provided 
on such a street at non-station locations. A typical BRT corridor configuration for a 36 m ROW 
is illustrated in Fig. 20.

A minimum of 30 m ROW is required to develop a BRT corridor that serves both directions of 
travel on BRT as well as motor vehicles (carriageways of 2 lanes per direction). This section 
has safe walking space an essential element but not cycle tracks or service lanes (Fig. 18). 
Introducing passing lanes at stations allows the system to accommodate a larger number of 
passengers. A 36 m wide street can accommodate passing lanes but with the omission of 
cycle tracks or service lanes. Fig. 19 shows a configuration on a 42 m ROW that has BRT 
passing lane. This configuration shows a shared space at the street edge that is primarily 
meant for pedestrians but can be accessed by motor vehicles at very slow speeds to access 
properties and parking. An additional dedicated footpath is also present at non-station 
locations in this cross-section.
Successful design interventions, in Latin American cities such as Quito, Medellin, and Mexico 
City, have demonstrated that BRT can be implemented even on narrow streets, especially 
in old city areas and heritage districts. Fig. 21 gives suggested cross-sections for streets 
with ROW of 16-24 m. While one or more elements are omitted in these configurations,safe 
walking space an essential element is ensured in all these sections. For example, on an 18 m 
ROW, only one-way movement is possible for BRT as well as other vehicular traffic. In case 
of a 16 m ROW, two-way movement of BRT is accommodated but there is no space for other 
vehicular traffic in either direction.

Table-6A & Table-6B provide a matrix of various elements and street widths, along with 
suggested dimensions for each element. On corridors marked for future development of BRT, 
a median of 12 m should be reserved for BRT infrastructure. This median reserve provides 
space for two-way BRT lanes and stations. The exact position of stations can be determined 
at a later point based on passenger demand and operational requirements and intersection 
locations.

Intersection Design
Special intersection treatments are required along BRT corridors in order to reduce delays 
and maintain system capacity. The aim of junction design for a BRT system is to:
 
l	
Minimise delays for the BRT system.
 
l	
Provide safe and convenient pedestrian access to stations.
 
l	
Minimise delays for mixed traffic.
Junction design will vary according to the volume of turning vehicles, bus operations and 
volume of pedestrians crossing the junction. In general, BRT junction operation should focus 
on reducing turning movements across the busway to improve safety and reduce signal 
delays. As a general rule, signal cycles for BRT intersections should not have more than two 
phases. Phases that combine BRT and mixed traffic movements can reduce the amount 
of delay experienced by BRT passengers. Bus priority signals that extend a green phase if 
the system detects an approaching bus can improve bus speeds on corridors with low bus 
volumes. However, such systems are not needed on corridors with high bus frequencies.
One way of reducing the number of phases at BRT intersections is to substitute right turns 
for movements at the network level. For example, right turn can be substituted by three left 
turns (see Fig. 22).
Fig. 22: To reduce intersection delays along BRT corridors, intersections should  
prohibit right turns for mix traffic. Instead, vehicles can make a series of turns and  
then cross perpendicular to the corridor.

Photo 23: Forbidding turns across the bus lanes increases bus speeds at intersection:  
Las Vegas BRT (left) and DART BRT, Dar es Salaam (right).
Signalised roundabouts (also called square-abouts) are a means of managing right-turning 
traffic at large intersections while minimising signal cycle time. Square-abouts make the 
right-turn phase obsolete by creating right-turn queuing space within the intersection itself. 
Vehicles queue in this space during one phase and exit during the next phase. By combining 
BRT and mixed traffic movements, the square-about accommodates all turning movements 
in only two phases.

BRT stations should be setback from the intersection stop lines to allow sufficient space for bus 
and mixed traffic queues. When stations are located immediately adjacent to intersections, 
significant delays can be caused when a queued bus blocks the docking bay and prevents 
other buses from accessing the station. The setback distance depends on the frequency of 
buses on the corridor and the signal cycle duration. Lower frequency and short signal cycles 
require lower setback. Higher frequency and longer signal cycles require greater queue 
length, and hence, a larger setback from the intersection. At a minimum, the setback should 
be equal to the length of two queued articulated buses (~40m).
Fig. 27: BRT stations should be offset at least 40 m from intersection stop lines.

6.3	
Corridor Management
Traffic along BRT corridors must be monitored and controlled in such a way that BRT 
operations are not impacted by non-BRT traffic. Effective corridor management depends on 



======================================================================
PAGE 59 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:124-2017
50
close coordination between the traffic police and the BRT agency, as well as dedicated traffic 
management personnel employed by the BRT operating body. Such BRT-focused traffic 
police must ensure that junctions are not blocked by traffic regardless of signal activation 
or intersection design. BRT junction guards are key gatekeepers to the system, and must 
be vigilant to prevent private vehicles, pedestrians, animals, and others from accidentally 
entering the busway. 
In order to sensitise vehicle users during the initial phase of BRT operations and prevent 
BRT corridors from encroachment by personal motor vehicles, it is recommended that each 
corridor has specialised BRT traffic management personnel. The primary duty of these staff 
is to prevent motorised vehicles from entering BRT lanes and ensure that other vehicles give 
priority to BRT buses at intersections. In addition, BRT management personnel must work 
with the traffic police to ensure that footpaths, cycle tracks, and other BRT corridor facilities 
remain free of encroachments by parked vehicles.
6.4	
BRT Corridor Designs for Special Cases
Cities may have to address existing natural or constructed elements while designing BRT 
corridors. Existing grade separators, canals, and expressways are examples of such elements. 
BRT corridor designs should be adjusted to address these features through modifications in 
station locations and BRT lane entry points without hampering basics of BRT.
For example, in Ahmedabad and Pimpri Chinchwad, grade separators have been constructed 
as split flyovers to accommodate BRT stations without obstructing bus movements. On the 
Old Mumbai-Pune corridor in Pimpri Chinchwad, BRT designs take into consideration existing 
grade separated express lanes. BRT stations and lanes have been constructed in the service 
lanes to facilitate passenger access and to accommodate turning movements of buses at 
intersections.
Photo 26: In Ahmedabad, a split flyover allows for continuous BRT movement in the  
median (left). In Pimpri Chinchwad, BRT lanes were constructed in the service lane in  
order to accommodate existing express lanes (right)

Pavement Design
Good pavement quality ensures better service and operations for a longer period by minimising 
the need for service interruptions due to busway maintenance. Concrete pavement should be 
provided for BRT lanes in station areas and at intersections. In these locations, the constant 
starting and stopping of buses leads to severe rutting if flexible pavement is used. If funding 
permits, the entire busway may be constructed in concrete. Beyond these provisions, the 
detailed design of the pavements depends on the axle weight of the BRT vehicles and the 
projected number of BRT vehicles that are more likely to use the infrastructure over its service 
life. (Refer to IRC:15 for more information on concrete pavement design.)

7. Universal accessibility
Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) not only provides a dedicated corridor for quicker bus and 
priority vehicle movement, but also provides a segregated and safe corridor for pedestrians 
and NMVs. The system facilitates access to public transport and also encourages pedestrian 
trips for short distances. Towards the prioritization of public transport particularly BRTS; 
stakeholders are investing in renewal of transit and road infrastructure. This creates ample 
opportunities to make the system inclusive by incorporating universal design features (Rickert, 
Bus Rapid Transit Accessibility Guidelines, 2007).
Universal design ensures accessibility for BRT passengers and other road users and should 
be accessible to all irrespective of age, gender and disability. The entire BRT corridor must 
be designed to provide seamless pedestrian connectivity without abrupt level difference 
or changes in clear width, which benefits persons with reduced mobility such as people 
with medical conditions, families with young children, those using mobility aids and persons 
carrying luggage, pregnant women, etc.
7.1	
Footpaths
Footpaths must meet the following standards11:
 
l	
Footpaths should include a margin next to shop fronts (the “frontage 
zone”), at least 1.8 m minimum of clear space on footpaths for walking (the 
“pedestrian zone”), and space for landscaping, lights, bus shelters, signs, 
property ramps, and other street furniture (the “furniture zone”) (Photo 28).
 
l	
The minimum clear width of 1.8 m is sufficient for around 1,400 pedestrians 
per hour in both directions. The width should be increased by an additional 
half metre for every additional 700 pedestrians per hour.
 
l	
Footpaths should be maximum 150 mm above carriageway level. 
 
l	
Footpaths should have a smooth surface asphalt or concrete.
 
l	
Footpaths should be continuous and should not have any level difference at 
property entrances and intersections. Abrupt and frequent kerb cuts require 
pedestrians to constantly step up and down and therefore discourage them 
from using footpaths. Any unavoidable level difference must be bridged 
with ramps that offer full access to persons with disabilities and those with 
reduced mobility.
 
l	
Tactile pavers should be installed to indicate any change of level, directions 
and locations where vehicles and pedestrians interact (Photo 30).

7.3	
Passenger Access
Well-designed crossings allow pedestrians to go across busy streets safely and conveniently. 
For BRT to function well, people must have safe access to stations. At-grade crossings are 
the preferred mode of access for BRT stations. Pedestrian foot over bridges are acceptable 
only in the case of BRT corridors located on limited access highways. Such bridges may 
have working elevators and escalators. Pedestrian crossings at BRT stations must meet the 
following standards:



======================================================================

l	
A raised crosswalk that is at least 2.4 m wide should be provided, elevated 
to the level of the adjacent footpath (150 mm above carriageway) with 
a speed table for motor vehicles. The slope for vehicles should be in a 
range from 1:8 to 1:15 (Fig. 29).12 Grade separated pedestrian access (foot 
over bridge/ subways) should only be provided in case of expressways. 
Pedestrians should not have to cross more than two lanes of traffic before 
reaching a pedestrian refuge. Otherwise, a signalised crosswalk should be 
provided.
	
l	
Speed bumps in mixed traffic lanes in advance of pedestrian crossings can 
help reduce motor vehicle speeds further.

than that employed in mixed traffic lanes. The BRT lane can remain at 150 mm for the entire 
length of the BRT station, with a final down ramp provided after the pedestrian crossing at the 
other end of the station.

Station Ramps
Station ramps must meet the following standards:
	
l	
Ramp gradients should not exceed 1:15.
	
l	
The materials selected for the surface finish of a ramp should be firm, levelled 
and easy to maintain. These must also be slip resistant, especially if surfaces 
are likely to become wet.

Bus Interior
The interior of BRT vehicles must also be designed so that all persons can use them. The 
following access features must be included on all BRT vehicles (over and above the standard 
urban bus specifications) :
	
l	
Stanchions, grab bars and hand-holds must be provided in contrast colour 
for balance and support for passengers to hold during bumps or sudden 
stops that the vehicle may encounter.
	
l	
Priority seating must be provided that is clearly identified as being reserved 
for people with disabilities, seniors, and mothers with small children, or 
pregnant women.
	
l	
Approximately 800 mm x 1200 mm of space on BRT vehicles must be 
dedicated for persons using mobility devices. This area must be located 
adjacent to vehicle entry doors to facilitate access from BRT stations.
	
l	
Stop request buttons must be installed at locations of priority seating and 
wheelchair positions.
	
l	
Auditory announcements of stop names and key destinations ensure that 
people who are visually impaired are facilitated to reach their destinations.
	
l	
For BRT and feeder buses operating on service extensions beyond the 
dedicated BRT corridors, a manual ramp or lift must be provided so that

conductors can provide assisted boarding from bus stops and from the 
ground level for seniors, wheelchair users, and other people with physical 
disabilities.
7.6	
Bus Stops on Service Extensions
BRT trunk buses in a hybrid system as well as feeder buses in a closed system travel beyond 
dedicated BRT corridors. Along these extensions, stops will be provided on the kerb at the 
left side. Bus stops should be placed adjacent to the linear line of travel so that the bus does 
not need to pull over to the left (IRC:103, 6.10). Bus bays should be avoided because they 
increase travel time for bus users and the likelihood that bus passengers will stand in the 
street while waiting for the bus. The position of the bus stop should always leave accessible 
clear space for pedestrians behind the shelter. 
If BRT services utilise high-level boarding platforms (e.g., 650 mm or 900 mm), a lift must 
be provided on the left side of the bus. In the case of low-floor buses, an automated or 
manual hinged ramp can bridge the level difference between the bus floor and the bus stop. 
Bus stops should be built at a height of 150 mm (i.e., the same height as the surrounding 
footpath) to improve accessibility and safety if buses do not pull directly up to the kerb.
8. Vehicle specifications
In general, standard 12 m BRT buses should have doors on the right side of the bus to 
allow for level boarding and alighting from median stations. Each door should have a width 
of at least 1.2 m minimum, and the doors should be separated by at least 400 mm. On 
higher demand corridors, 18 m articulated vehicles enable an increase in capacity without 
increasing station saturation. These buses should have four wide doors on the right side at 
the same level as the station floor. 
In closed systems, trunk services can be operated with high floor buses because passengers 
only board from BRT stations. For systems with direct services, buses need to have doors 
on the left side that allow for kerbside boarding and alighting when the vehicle leaves the 
dedicated lanes. Low-floor buses with hinged manual wheelchair ramps are generally 
preferred for systems operating direct services because they are accessible to persons with 
disabilities on service extensions. In case of systems with dual-side stations in each direction, 
trunk services can use high-floor buses while direct service routes can use low-floor buses.
In case of corridors with very high demand, articulated and bi-articulated buses are preferred. 
It should be noted that the cost of such buses in low-floor configuration tends to be 5 to 
6 times that of a high-floor configuration of a bus with same length. Therefore, systems 
designers are encouraged to create a closed system where high-floor articulated and 
bi-articulated buses provide trunk line services while low-floor buses of smaller size (8 to 12 
m) are used for feeder services.

Buses should meet modern emissions norms (i.e., at least Bharat Stage IV). However, the 
primary emission savings from BRT systems typically come from the reduction in kilometres 
travelled by personal motor vehicles rather than the marginal reduction in the emissions from 
each bus. BRT buses should be compliant with the urban bus design standards as developed 
by Automotive Industry Research Committee of Ministry of Road Transport & Highways and 
Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. Buses may also be designed with attractive external 
styling and high-quality interiors to project a smart image for the system.

9. Safety
Well-designed BRT systems hold the potential to improve safety for all road users. Since 
dedicated BRT corridors segregate buses from smaller vehicles, they can result in a good 
reduction in minor as well as major crashes. With appropriately designed pedestrian facilities, 
conflicts between motor vehicles and pedestrians can fall as well. Safe design of BRT requires 
attention to the following safety elements:
	
l	
Physical segregation of BRT lanes: Physical barriers between the 
carriageway and BRT lanes help prevent conflicts between mixed traffic and 
BRT buses. Railings are advisable to prevent random pedestrian crossing 
movements along the corridor. However, breaks in the railings should be 
provided at regular intervals to facilitate safe crossing behaviour.
	
l	
Intersection design: The layout of intersections should facilitate safe user 
behaviour. Channelisation using medians and pedestrian refuge islands can 



======================================================================
PAGE 71 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:124-2017
62
help reduce crossing distances, streamline traffic flow, and reduce avoidable 
conflicts. 
	
l	
Pedestrian crossings: BRT corridors require safe pedestrian crossings at 
regular intervals. Pedestrian crossings should be built at grade to ensure 
that they are accessible to all users. Crossings require adequate markings 
and signage. Motor vehicle movements must be managed, either through 
signalisation in the case of crossings located at junctions, or through physical 
traffic calming elements at mid-blocks. Mid-block crossings should be 
constructed as table-top crossings that are raised to the level of the adjacent 
footpath. Bollards, if provided should have minimum spacing of 1 m to allow 
mobility aid users such as wheelchairs to pass through unhindered.
Photo 36: Inadequate spacing of bollards and level 
difference at crossings (Photo courtesy SAMARTHYAM)
	
l	
Footpaths and cycle tracks: The corridor design must provide for safe 
movements for pedestrians and cyclists through the length of the corridor. 
Wide, continuous footpath and cycle tracks are important to provide access 
to BRT stations and to offer access to other road users.
	
l	
Driver training: Adequate training is required to orient and sensitise drivers 
to BRT corridor safety issues.
	
l	
Level boarding: Precision docking of buses and level boarding is essential 
for the buses so that there is minimum horizontal and vertical gap between 
bus platform and bus chassis (Photo 37), which can be bridged through 
manual hinged ramp.

l	
Traffic management: During the initial phase of BRT operations, in order 
to sensitise vehicle users and promote safe road user behaviour along a 
corridor, traffic wardens should be stationed at major junctions and pedestrian 
crossing points along the entire corridor. The primary duty of these guards 
will be to prevent motorised vehicles from entering the corridor, ensuring that 
vehicles give priority to BRT buses at intersections, and providing safety to 
pedestrians who wish to cross the road or access a BRT station. 
Once the system is operational, the BRT control centre should monitor all traffic incidents 
along the corridor to document safety issues and identify solutions.
10. BRT Operations
Following implementation, BRT operations should be monitored closely to ensure good 
performance. BRT is more than the physical infrastructure of bus lanes and stations reliable 
service and customer friendly operations are equally essential to the success of a system. 
Long-term system management is more likely to succeed if a BRT system is operated by an 
empowered agency with qualified professionals and trained staff. 
10.1	
System Monitoring
To facilitate effective ongoing management of a BRT system, it is advisable to create a 
professional, robust management body to oversee the system. Known as a “Special Purpose 
Vehicle” (SPV), this body is responsible for planning, managing, and monitoring BRT 
operations. The SPV need not operate services directly, but can engage a number of private 
contractors to operate various elements of the BRT system. For instance, the SPV can hire a 



======================================================================
PAGE 73 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:124-2017
64
bus operator to procure the BRT buses; hire drivers and maintenance staff, and operate BRT 
services according to a schedule provided by the SPV. The involvement of private operators 
helps leverage the government’s investment in the system by bringing in private capital to 
finance elements such as buses and fare collection equipment.
The SPV needs qualified, professional staff and the independence to make swift decisions 
during the implementation process. The staff is responsible for carrying out a range of 
activities, including project implementation; procurement of services; operations management; 
financial management; communications and marketing; and planning of future phases. 
Active monitoring of system performance, passenger demand, and safety incidents by the 
SPV helps ensure that system operators meet stipulated service level standards and provide 
excellent customer service.
For cities with SPVs for public transport operations, a separate BRT cell with qualified and full 
time staff should be created. The SPV or cell should receive urban transport fund collected 
from various sources of revenue such as fare, non-fare-box, parking management etc. At least 
10% of the received fund shall be utilised for the maintenance of existing BRT infrastructure.
10.2	
Fare Collection
Efficient fare collection is an essential component of a modern public transport service. Most 
BRT systems make use of off-board fare collection with electronic smart cards to improve 
customer experience and reduce revenue leakage. Off-board fare collection eliminates delays 
such as those caused when buses halt between bus stops to allow a conductor to sell tickets 
to all of the passengers on the vehicle. They also eliminate the need for passengers to fish 
for change on a moving vehicle. Off-board fare collection with smart cards is the dominant 
form of fare collection in BRT systems worldwide for the reasons described in the following 
sections and summarised in Table-10.

10.2.1	
Fare types
The fare type for a BRT system should take into account land use patterns, passenger trip 
lengths, and capital cost factors. There are following five types of fares:
	
l	
Flat fare: In this type, a passenger is charged with the flat rate for his journey 
irrespective of the distance travelled or origin and destination. Flat fares are 
advantageous from a social equity perspective. Flat fare scan permit multiple 
transfers within a prescribed time limit.
	
l	
Distance-based fare: Distance-based fares vary based on the number of km 
travelled by the passenger. In a distance-based fare system, the fares paid by 
customers closely match the actual operating costs incurred to the system.
	
l	
Zone-based fare: A zone-based fare is a simplified version of a distance-
based fare. Zone-based fares incorporate some variations according to 
distance but can be easier for passengers to understand.
	
l	
Time-based fare: Time-based fares are typically employed in the form of 
passes that allow unlimited daily, weekly, monthly or quarterly trips for a 
fixed fare. Sometimes, passes allow unlimited trips but only between known 
origin-destination stops or within fixed set of zones. Time-based fare may 
also be employed for shorter duration, i.e., up to 1 or 2 hours. 
BRT systems may have combination of fare systems. For example, trunk routes may have a 
distance-based fare, while feeders have a flat fare. However,effective passenger information 
is essential to explain the fare rules if more than two systems are employed.
10.2.2	
Fare media 
While off-board fare collection can be accomplished with paper tickets, electronic fare 
collection using RFID smart cards has many advantages for BRT systems, including reduced 
need for ticketing staff, higher revenue retention, and time saved because passengers do 
not need to queue at ticket counters each time they ride the system. RFID cards contain 
an electronic chip that can read and process information regarding cash inputs and can 
permit the collection of a wide range of information on commuter movements. A smart card 
system should also be designed so that it can serve multiple transport modes and essentially 
function as a common mobility card across the whole region.

IRC:124-2017

10.2.3	
Access control
Automatic barrier control at BRT stations reduces the amount of time needed to verify fare 
payments. Most contemporary rapid transit systems in India including metro systems in Delhi, 
Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, and Jaipur as well as the BRT system in Ahmedabad use flap 
gates. These gates fold back automatically once the fare reader completes a successful 
reading of an electronic smart card. 
Flap gates can provide advanced detection systems that prevent the gates from closing 
when a stroller or suitcase is still passing through the gate. The flap gate can still stay open if 
another legal passage is detected. Further, the design of wing gates can allow for wider gates 
that permit the passage of wheelchairs. 
The tripod-shaped turnstiles used in many older rapid transit systems have lower operating 
and maintenance costs compared to flap gates. However, tripod gates are not universally 
accessible to persons with disabilities and users with strollers and heavy luggage. Furthermore, 
flap gates offer faster throughput because the users can simply walk through the gate without 
applying physical force to turn the tripod unit.

10.3	
Passenger Information
One of the barriers to using public transport is customer uncertainty about when the next bus 
will arrive. Providing real time information in the form of voice communications and variable 
message signs at stations can eliminate this uncertainty for BRT users. Real-time information 
services should include:
Entry Flapgate 2

At stations: visual and audio announcements of when the next bus will 
arrive and the destination or route number of the bus.
	
l	
On buses: real-time audio and visual announcements of the next stop and 
the final destination of the route.
In addition to the real-time information, the following static information must be provided:
	
l	
At stations and terminals: route map, fare chart, directions, system map, 
station locations, and an area map with surrounding landmarks;
	
l	
On buses: route diagrams;
Multi-lingual real-time and static information is preferred to allow for easy comprehension by 
all users.
Photo 39: Real-time information at stations in Rainbow, Pimpri Chinchwad (left), and inside 
buses such as in Jinan (right) is critical to a positive overall experience of passengers.
10.4	
Fleet Management and Scheduling
The aim of fleet management is to ensure that the services are run according to schedule and 
to address problems such as delays due to traffic congestion. Some of the key requirements 
of a fleet management system are the ability to locate a vehicle and to transmit this information 
to the control centre. Most fleet management systems use vehicle location information to 
inform various functions such as real time monitoring, real time passenger information, and 
service planning.
Operational data can be stored as part of a record of operations and may also be analysed 
to review operational performance. The comparison of the planned and actual services 
provides important information not only for the service operator but also for the government 
agency letting the service contract. Further, inclusion of parameters such as fuel consumption 
and engine performance makes it possible to calculate both the financial and environmental 
impact of running the BRT services. Logging of parameters such as acceleration, speeds, 
and braking provides a basis for generating feedback on driving behaviour. For maintenance 
tracking, the system can keep a record of all vehicle failures, defects, inspections, 



======================================================================
PAGE 77 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:124-2017
68
modifications, and repairs. The data in the maintenance control report should also provide a 
basis for analysing failure trends and informing maintenance schedules. 
11. Inter-modal integration
For BRT to function as part of a coherent public transport network, passengers need to be 
able to transfer easily from one mode to another. Integration does not merely mean placing 
stations for multiple public transport modes close together. Rather, it involves the detailed 
design of inter-modal stations incorporating the following features:
	
l	
Short, direct walking paths with minimal level difference for transferring 
passengers.
	
l	
Adequate clear space for passenger movement to prevent bottlenecks.
	
l	
Protection from sun and rain.
	
l	
Public information.
Some inter-modal facilities, such as auto-rickshaw and cycle rickshaw stands and cycle 
parking, can be developed at several major stations along a BRT corridor. Convenient inter-
modal facilities should be developed wherever the BRT corridor passes near a metro station, 
intercity rail station, city bus hub, or intercity bus terminal.
Photo 40: Passengers on Medellín’s Metroplus BRT corridor can easily access the city’s 
elevated metro line via a staircase without leaving the station.
12. Depot layout design
BRT depots should include areas for refuelling, cleaning, repairs, administration, and parking. 
Depots are generally located at or adjacent to terminal facilities so that depot parking can be 
used for BRT vehicles coming out of service during off-peak periods. 
The location of a depot is often dependent upon the economical acquisition of sufficient 
property, but depots generally should be sited immediately adjacent to a BRT corridor to 



======================================================================
PAGE 78 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:124-2017
69
reduce the number of “dead kilometres” that buses operate to reach a corridor end point. The 
geometric design of the depot entry should be designed in conjunction with that of the BRT 
corridor. The interior layout should allow for convenient manoeuvring of buses.
The size of the depots and terminals depends on the number of vehicles that will be based 
at the depot. As a thumb rule, a depot for 100 standard buses requires approximately 2 
hectares. Depot surfaces should be constructed in concrete rather than asphalt for better 
durability.

13. Parking Management
Unmanaged corridors with chaotic illegal parking, unrestricted street vending as well as 
encroachments by various activities are the norm on most streets in Indian cities. While 
many cities have taken steps to regulate and manage street vending through clearly defined 
policies, on-street parking remains haphazard and unmanaged. Following are the broad 
principles of parking management for cities :
	
l	
Prioritise sustainable modes of transport. Cities must make transport 
planning decisions that give priority to facilities for sustainable modes of 
transport over parking, both on the street as well as off the street (such as 
intermodal facilities). Provide feeder connections and improve intermodal 
integration between various public transport modes. Cities must prioritize 
sustainable modes of transport (walking, cycling, public transport) in their 
financial plans.
	
l	
Price parking to manage demand. Instead of trying to increase parking 
supply, cities must treat parking as a commodity that should be priced 
proportional to demand. While determining parking rates, cities must ensure 
that streets with higher parking demand must have higher parking fee. 
Parking rates must be based on location, time of day, duration of parking and 
category of vehicle (defined by size and type). Prices for on-street parking 
must be higher than off-street parking to encourage people to use off-street 
facilities and free up road space for other uses.
	
l	
Manage and enforce on-street parking first. Even when off-street parking 
is available to users of personal motor vehicles, it is often under utilised due 



======================================================================
PAGE 80 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:124-2017
71
to the low or no cost of on-street parking and poor enforcement. Thus, cities 
must manage and enforce on-street parking effectively before building any 
off-street parking facilities, public or private. 
	
l	
No subsidy to parking. Cities must not subsidize on-street or off-street 
parking for personal motor vehicles (including multi-level parking), implicitly 
or explicitly. Where private sector develops off-street parking for personal 
motor vehicles, the private sector must bear the full cost of land, construction, 
maintenance, and operations, and recoup its investment directly from 
parking users without any form of cross subsidy using public funds. Cities 
must ensure that users pay full cost of parking facility based on opportunity 
cost of land, capital cost, O&M cost and temporal demand.
 
l	
Parking revenue for sustainable modes of transport. Cities must earmark 
the revenue from parking management for investments in sustainable modes 
of transport. Specifically, cities must develop mechanisms whereby a good 
portion of the parking revenue from an area of the city is spent on improving 
walking, cycling and public transport facilities within that area. Estimates 
show that revenue generated by 1 km of paid parking can pay for not just the 
creation and maintenance of high quality footpaths along the stretch but also 
the addition of up to ten new buses to serve the area. 
 
l	
Limit parking supply. Cities must limit total parking supply, including public 
and private off street and on-street parking based on the capacity of the road 
network in the zone. Cities must set caps on the total quantum of parking 
available in each zone. Construction of additional off-street parking spaces 
(public as well as private, including multi-level car parking) facilities must be 
balanced with a reduction in on-street parking. For example, in 1996, the city 
of Zurich in Switzerland capped parking supply at 1990 levels, to prevent 
addition of extra parking in the city centre that might result in increased 
congestion. 
 
l	
Create active street frontage. Parking in the front setback creates an 
undesirable separation between footpaths and activity within buildings. 
Further, stilt parking on the street facing edge of buildings create an inactive 
and potentially unsafe spaces. Cities must modify building regulations to 
ensure active edges and prohibit parking in the front setback.

16. Care to be taken while implementing BRT
It is desirable to take care of following factors while planning, constructing and operating BRT 
system:
16.1	
Network Length
Some cities construct small segment(s) of dedicated BRT corridor(s) that may not give 
desirable results. Short (and sometimes disconnected) corridors benefit limited number of 
commuters and create a negative image of the system and about the concept of BRT itself, 
and run the risk of being considered a failure. When planning a BRT system, a reasonable 
network should be identified. While implementation can be phases, systems should be 
expanded in a time bound manner to benefit a substantial number of people. 
16.2	
Dedicated High Quality Fleet
For a BRT to be high quality system that serves the public well and wins their confidence, it 
should have an attractive fleet of buses. The BRT system should be projected as a “Metro on 
the Road”, with buses that have quality similar to metro rail coaches.
16.3	
BRT Lane and not a Bus Lane
BRT is the coming together of multiple design and operational elements to create a seamless 
user experience and enhance efficiency. For example, bus floor height should match the 
station floor height to facilitate step-less boarding and alighting. Some cities allow buses of 
all types into the BRT corridor—including various types of city buses, intercity buses, school 
buses, and company buses. Such decisions have the effect of converting the BRT corridor to 
a mere bus lane. This significantly reduces the efficiency of the system. 
To maintain efficiency, provide seamless customer experience, and create and maintain a 
strong brand amongst public, BRT must not be diluted. Only specially designed buses that 
belong to the system must be allowed on the corridor. Attempt must be made to rationalise 
city bus routes to reduce or eliminate overlap with BRT services.
16.4	
BRT Station Location
BRT station locations on the corridor are very critical. While proximity to passenger demand 
location is important, it should be noted that the stations should not be placed right at 
the intersection. It has been observed that the systems with stations located right at the 
intersection, don’t provide sufficient queueing space for buses. Moreover, they occupy lanes 
which could be added for queuing of mixed traffic, thereby maximising the throughput of the 
intersection. Poor intersection throughput may result in annoyance about BRT in the minds 
of motor vehicle users.
16.5	
Median Alignment of BRT Lanes
Medians are the most appropriate location for BRT lanes since they provide rapid and 
uninterrupted movement for buses. Kerb side bus lanes are frequently obstructed by parked 



======================================================================
PAGE 86 of 90
======================================================================
IRC:124-2017
77
or stopped vehicles, vehicles turning left into side streets or properties, as well as other 
slower moving traffic and are therefore inappropriate for BRT. Bus passengers routinely cross 
streets to access bus stops that happen to be on the other side of the street. Rather than 
crossing the entire street width around half the time, a BRT passenger has to cross only half 
the street width at all times. Hence, a BRT passenger has to cross no more than a passenger 
of a regular city bus service. Further, frequent and safe street crossing opportunities are a 
defining feature of a good urban road. BRT stations- integrated with signals provide a safe 
opportunity to cross the street to reach the stations in the median.
16.6	
Intersection Design
Intersections are complex and can easily become bottlenecks in many Indian cities. 
Very long traffic queues, running into hundreds of meters, becomes a routine affair. In 
fact, some poor BRT systems have signal cycles which areas long as 8 to 12 minutes. 
Motor vehicles often have to wait for even up to three such long cycles before they are 
able to clear the intersection, resulting in undue delay to both personalised vehicles and 
buses.
16.7	
Overlap with Rail-Based Mass Transit Systems
It is essential to analyse the desire lines of the commuters in situations where a BRT line might 
overlap an existing or proposed Metro or other forms of urban rail lines. While rationalising 
services is a laudable effort to improve utilisation of resources, one must not forget the 
primary goal of maximising public transport passenger convenience. In cases where the 
overlap between the rail line and specific BRT routes are small, and removing the BRT route 
would cause one or more needless transfer that might potentially push the passengers away 
from public transport altogether. It is advisable to allow an overlap of systems. However, 
all attempts must be made to integrate such systems to create seamless connectivity and 
maximise customer options.
16.8	
Bus Operations Monitoring
Due to lack of monitoring the operations, there may be bus bunching at stations and at 
intersections, resulting in a reduction of speed, crowding at stations, and overall degradation 
of efficiency. Poor bus maintenance results in breakdowns during operations. GPS-enabled 
BRT buses should be monitored and controlled using two-way communication system to 
reduce bunching and for maintaining desired headways. 
16.9	
BRT Fleet Expansion
Some systems fail to augment the fleet size to cope with the increase in demand and if the 
demand stagnates, it may lead to promoting greater use of personal motor vehicles that 
eventually demand the removal of BRT to get them more road space. Therefore, cities must 
ensure that the BRT bus fleet is continuously augmented to not only match the existing 
demand but also have additional capacity to attract new users.

IRC:124-2017

16.10	
Interdepartmental Coordination
Any mass transit system needs close involvement of various government organisations in the 
city/region. Typically, the BRT systems in India need involvement of municipal corporations, 
traffic police, regional transport office, sometimes state or National highways departments 
and the existing bus operating company or the department. Cities that lack interdepartmental 
coordination end up with poor system performance because of issues like two city bus 
systems (regular and BRT) on the same corridor that confuse the passengers and results in 
unnecessary competition, or traffic police allowing private vehicles to use the bus lane during 
peak hours, or lane segregation is missing on part of the corridor due to land encroachment 
issues etc. Cities must bring together all stakeholders, especially different public offices, to 
ensure their support and ownership of the system.
16.11	
Supporting Infrastructure
A good BRT system needs supporting infrastructure like passenger terminals, depot and 
maintenance areas. Lack of passenger transfer stations and waiting areas result in discomfort 
to passengers, increases operations and maintenance cost. A BRT system must have 
supporting infrastructure that is typically provided to rail based MRT systems.
16.12	
Fund Allocation
Public transport systems, whether BRT or otherwise, often need subsidy from the government 
to provide affordable mobility options to citizens. However, many Indian BRT systems find 
it very difficult to get necessary funding to meet the operational losses or augment fleet, 
whether it be from urban local bodies or their state government. At the same time, these cities 
manage to spend large sums of money on short term options like vehicular grade separators 
and construction of off street parking blocks that only facilitate the use of personal motor 
vehicles that cause many negative externalities such as traffic congestion, pollution, and 
unsafe road conditions. Cities must financially support public transport systems, especially 
bus-based systems such as BRT that can service the needs of the majority.
16.13	
Skilled Manpower
BRT systems need regular planning and monitoring. They need competent professionals 
from the fields of transport planning, finance, law, and human resource management. They 
also need trained drivers and other staff for functions such as ticketing and security to 
providing quality service to passengers. The establishment of a special purpose vehicle or 
a special department to plan, manage, and monitor the operations of BRT, with sufficient 
skilled manpower, is essential. To maintain high standards of quality of service, drivers and 
other operations staff must be trained and skilled in their respective trade and function.
