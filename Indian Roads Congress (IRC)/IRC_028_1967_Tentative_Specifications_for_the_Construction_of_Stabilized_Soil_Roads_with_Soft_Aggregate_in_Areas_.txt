INTRODUCTION
The two specifications recommended
in
this
publication
were
framed by the Soil Research Committee (personnel
given
below),
and approved by the Executive
Committee
at
their
meeting held
on the 21st &
22nd
August,
1967
and
by
the
Council
at
their
meeting held at Nainital on the 30th September, 1967.

These specifications are intended to indicate what
is considered
to be a good practice for construction of stabilized soil roads
with
soft aggregates in areas of moderate
and
high
rainfall
laid
over-
compacted embankment of non-expansive soil.
Provisions of these specifications shall apply unless modified by
special provision to take into account unusual conditions.
.
*This technique of soil stabilization was evolved and
successfully
tried on
a large scale
by
Prof.
S.
R.

SOIL
ROADS WITH
SOFT
AGGREGATE IN AREAS OF HIGH RAINFALL (EXCEE-
DING
150 CM PER ANNUM) OR AREAS OF HIGH
WATER-TABLE

SCOPE
The specification is recommended for the climatic
and
traffic
conditions given below
:
(i)
Rainfall
:
(ii) Depth of sub-soil
water level
:
(iii)
Traffic intensity

2.
INTRODUCTION
The
water-table
is generally high in areas of high rainfall or
areas having poor drainage
conditions.
The
proximity
of
water-
table leads to the absorption of moisture by the subgrade and
road
bases
as
a
result
of
rise
of
moisture
through
capillarity.
The
specification for a road pavement, with stone grafted base coat and
surface treatment are given below.
3.
THICKNESS OF PAVEMENT
The
exact
thickness
of road
pavement shall be worked out
from the soaked CBR of the subgrade and that of the various layers
of the road pavement, from the soaked CBR of soil
stabilized
with
binders such as cement or lime.
The
thickness of
the
bjase
coat
shall
be
kept
about
10 cm
and
the
remaining
thickness
shall
consist of base course and sub-base.
No soil
layer
shall
be com-
pacted in loose thickness exceeding 22 cm.

CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURE*
1.
PRELIMINARY SOIL SURVEY
A visual identification of soils along the
entire
length
of
the
existing earth road or proposed alignment shall be done
keeping in
view
the
behaviour
of
dififerent
lengths
under traffic in different
weather conditions.
Topographical
data
and
figures
of
rainfall,
etc., shall also be collected.
2.
SOIL SAMPLING
As a certain amount of banking is necessary to keep the road
immune from flooding, the soil for stabilizing
has
normally
to
be
borrowed from areas outside the formation width of the road.
In the alluvial plains of India^ the
characteristics
of
the
soil
deposits
change
at
short
intervals.
Therefore,
soil samples shall
be taken from fixed points which
can
be
located
at
the
time
of
borrowing soil for road construction.
Soil samples shall be taken 30 cm
or
more
deep
depending
upon
the
practice
of
borrowing
soil
and
20 m
away from Ihc
centre line of the
road
and
at points
approximately
50 m
apart
or
longer
distance
depending
upon the variation in the texture of
soil keeping m view
the
borrow
area
available.
After
removing
the
top
3
to 5 cm of foreign matter, which may be m the form of
grass or any
other
loose
matter, a
representative
sample
about
2.5 kg in weight shall
be
obtained
by
the method
of quartermg,
after
mixing
the entire quantity of soil dug out from 30 cm cubical
pit.
For locating the
spot
for
subsequent
borrowing
of
soil,
a
numbered peg shall be driven.
In
addition
to
sampling
at
regular
intervals,
a
few
more
samples of admixtures like fat clay and sand, available at economic
distance from the road shall be taken to facilitate blending.
Samples of local aggregate such
as
brickbats,
or
any
other
local
deposits
of kankar,
laterite, or coarse moorum shall be also
*The procedure sptcitied relates
to work
carried
out
by manual
labour.
The
use
of machinery
for
pulverising,
mixing and watering has been success-
fully adopted recently in a few cases.
The procedure
for
the use
of machinery
will be evolved in due course as a result of actual experience.

Samples of water to be
used for
construction shall be
collected in glass bottle.
3.
DESPATCH Oh SAMPLES
Each sample
shall be put in
paper bag to avoid loss
of
fine
material.
This, in
turn,
shall be enclosed in a cloth bag to which
a tag shall be tied describing the exact location.
Similar
informa-
tion written on paper shall also be
enclosed in the bag itself.
The
samples shall be despatched to the laboratory
for testing.
4.
TESTING OF SAMPLES
The following routine tests shall be carried out
:

SUBGRADE FORMATION
If the formation
is
already
existing, then top
15 cm
of
the
subgrade
shall
be
raked,
pulverised and
rolled back with 6 to 8
ton power roller at near optimum moisture.
In case of a new
for-
mation of minor
and
major
roads,
the
top
30 cm
and
45 cm
respectively
of the embankment shall be compacted in loose layers
of not more than 22 cm in the same manner
as
mentioned
above.
The desired moisture may be attained by flooding the borrow area.
6.
COLLECTION OF SOILS
Soils, as specified in the designed mixtures, shall
be
dug
out
and collected in stacks in required quantities every 50 m.

7.
PULVERISING OF SOILS
The soil shall then be pulverised separately with the backs
of
spades to such a state of fineness that about 80 per
cent of
the soil
is under 8 mm size.
In the case of fat hard clays (P.I.
c
^r
20),
the
pulverisation
can be carried out more conveniently if the clods are wetted
a
day
or two in advance.
8.
DRY MIXING AND STACKING
The different soils for base course and soils with aggregate for
base coat shall then be mixed in the dry state by turning them over
with spades and shovels. After thorough mixing, stacks about 38 cm
in height shall be prepared and the top of stacks levelled carefully.
9.
CHECKING OF MIXED STACKS
A representative sample shall be taken from the mixed
stack
and checked in the field laboratory, for correctness of the required
P.I. and sand content.
Any serious departure shall be set
right
by
adjusting proportions of its constituents to make sure that
requisite
quantity of admixture
is added.
10.
ADDITION OF MOISTURE
Quantity of water required
for optimum
moisture
is
deter-
mined on weight basis.
It will,- therefore, be necessary to determine
the average weight of soil per cubic metre.
This
generally
varies
from
1100
to
1300
kg
per
m^.
Quantity of water for optimum
moisture, determined by the field laboratory shall be
poured
care-
fully
towards
evening
over
the
stacks,
small
earth
sides having
been
provided
to
retain
the
water,
earmarked
for
laying
next
morning
and
allowed to soak down overnight.
To ensure uniform
distribution of water, the top of the
stacks
shall
be
divided
with
raised
earth
sides
into a number of sub-stacks.
Necessary allow-
ance shall be made for evaporation losses and absorption
by
brick
aggregate as determined by actual experiments from time to time.
Jl.
LAYING AND ROLLING
After remaining in contact with moisture for several hours, the
wet mixture of the base course shall be sliced off from the stacks in
11

small lots, mixed as required and laid on the prepared
subgrade
to
template
with
cross slope of
1 in 48 for the roads with bituminous
treated surface and
1 in 24 for other roads,
(The mixing
can
also
be
done
mechanically
with
equipment
such
as rotavator).
The
rolling shall then be done with
6-8
ton
power
roller,
to
attain
a
minimum of 95 per cent of the laboratory Proctor density.
The wearing coat shall also be
laid
arid
rolled
as
described
above.
Rolling shall be continued
till the wheels of the roller make
no appreciable impression on the
surface.
A
heavy
sprinkling
of
water shall then be given
to
the
road
and
left
overnight.
Next
morning, the surface shall again be rolled to finish.
When stone grafting is specified, the following procedure
shall
be adopted.
On the
first day, the uncompacted base coat together with the
layer of stone, 2.5 cm gauge, spread on the surface
at
the
rate
of
0.20
to
0.23 m^ per 10 m^ shall be rolled with two to three passes
of the roller over the whole length, and then
the
surface
shall
be
sprinkled thoroughly with water and left over for the night.
On the following day, without
adding
any
more
water,
the
surface
of the road shall be rolled thoroughly with at least 6 passes
of the roller.
The surface shall again be thoroughly sprinkled with
water and left for the rest of the day.
On the third day again, the surface of the road shall be rolled
(after
spreading
wet
soil
to
blind
the
surface
and without any
addition
of
water) and rolling continued
till the road is thoroughly
compacted.
Of these 3 days, the rolling on
the
second
day
shall
be the heaviest.
12.
CURING
The ungrafted road surface shall be kept closed
to
traffic
for
4 to 5 days and all the time kept damp by heavy sprinkling of water.
After this, light sprinkling of water shall be
continued
for
another
1 to 14 days and controlled traffic allowed
to
run
over
the
road,
beginning
with
motor
trafldc
only
and gradually extending to all
kinds of traffic.
In case
it is not possible
to
subject
the
road
to
controlled
traflSc,
the
crust
shall only
be
allowed to dry before
surfacing.
However, in the case of the
grafted
surface,
the
crust
shall be allowed to dry without subjecting it to any traffic.

13.
SURFACE TREATMENT
The
crust
shall be allowed to dry to a moisture of about 4 to
6 per cent.
For a traffic intensity of 200 tons
a
day,
the
surface
shall be
painted with primer (30 parts bitumen 80/100 and 70 parts
furnace oil) or cutback SC-0 at the rate of 10 kg per
10
sq.
metre
before bituminous surfacing is given.
14.
MAINTENANCE OF UNSURFACED STABILIZED SOIL ROAD
The maintenance of this type of stabilized soil road is different
from
t|^. of^the conventional gravel road in that,
it does not need
periodical grading with mechanical graders.
All that is required,
is
to remove the wearing course wherever a patch occurs, mix
a little
water or preferably water and molasses
(in
the jatio
of 3:1)
to
bring
it
to
near
about optimum moisture and ram
it back with a
hand rammer.
Molasses is used to give a little extra strength to the
Soil
to make up for the variation in the moisture contents from th6
optimum and curing of the area of each small patch before opening
to traffic.
Some slight rutting that takes place
during
the
dry
weather
gets more
or
less
smoothed
out
automatically under
the traffic
during the wet weather.
The road
thus
remains
almost
free
of
ruts and pot-holes arid the whole section wears evenly.
