BRIDGE INSPECTOR'S REFERENCE MANUAL
BACKGROUND
Quite often persons other than bridge engineers have to be asked to inspect the bridges in their jurisdiction
to assist the bridge engineers in their inspections. These "other persons" who are called "bridge inspectors"
though experienced are not fully qualified engineers. The Bridge Maintenance and Rehabilitation Committee
(B-10) of Indian Roads Congress felt that there is a need to prepare reference manual for such bridge inspectors
which will in simple terms provide them with information on various components of bridges, the distresses the
bridges undergo during the service life time and guidance on what to look for during their inspections and how
to record observations made during inspections. The composition of the Committee

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1
Periodical and a meaningful inspection of highway bridges
is an important essential input for any
useful and effective bridge management system for ensuring safe and uninterrupted flow of traffic on our
highways. Tremendous economic loss and the likely public criticism resulting from
any disruption due to the
failure of a bridge or
its acquiring 'Highly Distressed'
status requiring partial closure or load restrictions do
not warrant any neglect or laxity in adequate maintenance of bridges and for that purpose regular inspection
through well qualified and adequately experienced bridge engineers
is essential.
It is well understood that all
civil
engineering
structures
require
regular maintenance
and
periodical
repairs
or replacement
of some
components during their design serviceable life. Considering the astronomical increase in the number of bridges
as a result of the rapid development of highways catering to the continuously increasing preference for road
transport, the bridge engineer has now far more bridges to inspect than ever before. It has thus become necessary
that the bridge inspecting engineer
is assisted by a group of sufficiently qualified, properly trained and well
experienced bridge inspectors
to carry out more frequent inspection though preliminary yet comprehensive
enough to include all listed components and sufficiently informative in respect of important details Report from
such reliable inspectors can go a long way in helping the bridge inspecting engineers to plan their priorities
and correctly orient their inspections and the means of field inspections. Such purposefully directed timely
inspection from the bridge inspecting engineers would ultimately expedite timely and effective removal of
defects or rehabilitation measures which
is the main aim of the inspection of our bridges.
1.2. While SP:35 of the IRC, published in 1990, contains guidelines on inspection and maintenance of
bridges by the bridge inspecting engineers, this manual aims at providing guidance to bridge inspectors so that
their resulting inspection reports provide the bridge inspecting engineers directly responsible for the bridge-
management in the specified zone of the highway system under their control, a general picture of the present
'Health-Status' of the concerned bridges with broad indicators towards distress-prone areas or already distressed
components needing immediate attention.
1.3. Bridge Inspectors are not fully qualified engineers. However, it is essential that they should be selected
from the personnel who have certified engineering skills from any approved institution. The selection will depend
on the consideration of the position of responsibility or familiarity with the bridges with experience of minimum
of 5
years
in bridges. This Manual (Bridge
Inspector's Reference Manual)
is
a guideline for such Bridge
Inspectors and it provides information needed to be known by them in inspecting the bridges. Using this Manual
such persons with experience should be able to carry out routine bridge inspection of a majority of the bridges.
The Manual does not cover large and special types of bridges such as suspension bridges, cable stayed bridges,
etc., which are considered beyond the scope of the Manual. As far as possible the technical contents and language
have been simplified to make the Manual useful for the people whose knowledge of bridge engineering
is not
highly developed. The State Government will be advised to translate this Manual into local State language.
It
must be stressed that this Manual is supposed to only support
and guide the bridge inspector in how to inspect
the bridges on behalf of the Bridge Engineer. The
final responsibility, however, must
lie with
the Bridge
Engineer.
1.4. The manual has been organised into the following further Chapters:

2. SALIENT COMPONENTS OF A ROAD BRIDGE
For understanding the methodology of inspection and systematic recording of observations, it is necessary
to briefly define major components of a road bridge as per normally accepted common terminology. Format for
a bridge inspector's report has been designed accordingly.
2.1. Superstructure (Sketches
1
to 7)
The structural system which supports the carriageway for movement of all vehicular traffic and footpaths
where required, for use of pedestrians for crossing over the river or other impediments to the free flow of highway
traffic
is called the superstructure. This structural arrangement sustains
all loads and forces coming from the
traffic using the bridge and from other causes such as wind, earthquake, temperature changes, (water currents
in case of submersible bridges) and transmits the same to the ground (foundation) through the substructure.
Important parts of the superstructure are:
a)
Roadway decking slab, curbs, footpaths, railing or crash barriers, approach slab.
b)
Longitudinal members-beams, girders, arch/arches, cross-girders, box-girders, etc.
2.2. Substructure (Sketches 8 to 16)
2.2.1. Superstructure transmits all its loads and forces to a vertical supporting system which is called sub-
structure.
2.2.2. Sub-structure
is composed of Piers and Abutments.
2.2.3. The vertical support at each end of the bridge is called an Abutment, while other such intermediate
supports are called Piers.
2.2.4. This supporting system of Piers and Abutments in addition to carrying loads and forces trasmitted
to them from the superstructure,
is in itself subjected to forces from wind, earthquakes, water currents, impact
from floating
trees and barges,
(earth pressure
in case of abutments,
since they
retain
the approach road
embankment), etc.
2.2.5. Piers and Abutments can be solid or hollow and in different shapes. For the case of spill through
abutments the approach embankment is allowed to slope in front of the abutment and
is protected by proper
pitching with an adequate apron.
2.2.6. Abutments normally have return walls at either end constructed at some angle parallel to the approach
road to embankment. These are called Wing Walls. These normally have separate foundations when constructed
to the full height of the embankment.
2.2.7. In some cases the wing walls are not for the full height and cantilever out from the abutment ends.



======================================================================
PAGE 14 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:SP:52-1999
These are called flyback returns and allow the earth to spill through on the sides as well. In some bridges R.C.C.
box returns are also provided behind the abutments.
2.3. Foundation (Sketches 17 to 20)
2.3.1. All loads and forces coming from the superstructure and the sub-structure are ultimately to be safely
transmitted to the earth stratum below the river bed or below other natural soil formation in such a manner that
tiiere
is no unexpected settlement of the piers and abutments or damage due to scour during the design life of
the bridge structure. The structural system which enables such a safe load-forces-transference to the soil strata
from the
substructure components
is
called foundations. Foundations may be deep foundations or shallow
foundations depending upon their depth below the bed being safely below the maximum expected scour or
otherwise.
2.3.2. For deep foundations, normally well foundations are adopted while shallow foundations are mostly
open foundations duly protected against scour by a suitably designed pucca flooring, cut off walls, upstream
and downstream flexible stone aprons. Pile foundations (Bored, precast and driven, and cast in situ) are normally
used in situations away from the river flow spread such as for flyovers or viaducts. However use of large-diameter
bored piles is quite common for minor and medium bridges (and sometimes for long bridges also,) where scour
is not appreciable.
2.3.3. When span openings
are small and individual open foundations
are
likely
to
either overlap or
come too near each other, a combined raft foundation is used e.g. in the case of a box culvert or a multibox
type bridge. Such a foundation too
is normally protected on u/s and d/s by a pucca flooring, cut off walls and
aprons, (Sketch 46).
2.4. Bearings (Sketches 21
to 26)
2.4.1. Temperature changes, both day and night variations and seasonal variations, which can be quite large
in many parts of India, bring about elongation or contraction of the superstructure as a whole causing longitudinal
movements. Due to flexural effects there are rotations at the ends of spans (for superstructure). These movements
and rotations if restricted, can produce undesirable large forces on bridge components. To minimise these forces
and
to judiciously distribute them for an economical solution with better design
life
serviceability, ends of
superstructure of each span are supported on a bearing fixed on the top of the piers and abutments. Bearings
can be sliding bearings, reinforced elastomeric pads, roller and rocker bearings in steel and pot bearings. For
submersible bridges and for bridges in earthquake prone zones stoppers are provided against any transverse
dislodging movement of the superstructure. These are blocks monolithic with the pier or pier cap, steel bars or
girders embedded in pier and projecting above.
2.4.2. For a single span or simply supported multi-span system one bearing is a fixed bearing and the other
permits movement. For continuous spans system expansion or contraction
is allowed with one end fixed in
position and movements being allowed at
all others.
2.5. Expansion Joints (Sketches 43
to 45)
2.5.1. Between simply supported spans or units of a continuous span system and
at the ends of the
superstructure adjacent to the dirt wall of the abutments, the gaps are bridged by properly designed bridging
arrangements which besides protecting the exposed edges of the deck slab and ensuring smoother rideability
allow expansion/contraction of the superstructure. These components of the deck-furniture of a bridge are called
expansion joints.
4



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:SP:52-1999
2.5.2. Design of the expansion joints varies with the extent of movements. Proper design, adequately strong
and leak-proof construction, correct installation and regular maintenance of the expansion gap are essential
requirements for ensuring performance of expansion joints. Badly leaking, loose and knocking, dirt clogged or
broken or dislodged expansion joints are not desirable for a bridge. Even the best of such joints installed under
strict supervision of the suppliers require periodical replacement and hence the need for proper inspection at
regular intervals. Leaking expansion joints have been the cause of serious distress due to corrosion of prestressing
tendors and mal-functioning of the bearings. Hence, during inspection of bridges, expansion joints and bearings
need special attention.
2.6. Deck Drainage System
2.6.1. Nothing can be more annoying
to
the
travelling public, whether in vehicles or on foot than
a
waterlogged carriageway. Worse
still
is the resulting likely structural distress due to the presence of moisture
for long durations.
2.6.2. Riding surface can have in-adequate cross slope or non-functioning drainage outflow system. These
problems also need proper identification during inspection.
2.6.3. Again, water flowing out of the drainage spouts (Sketch 27) should not be allowed to fall on the
supporting main girders or cross girders but should be led or deflected away from these.
2.6.4. A properly designed drainage system ensures that water from various well-spaced drainage outlets
is collected into a longitudinal pipe along the span and then brought down at pier locations so as to discharge
into the stream or into the surface drainage system in case of flyovers.
2.7. Wearing Course
2.7.1. Deck-slab forming the main structural component of the carriageway is provided with suitable overlay
of adequate thickness either in good quality high strength concrete or in layers of graded bituminous construction.
This additional covering layer laid in proper longitudinal and transverse profile is called the wearing course and
takes on
all the frontal attack of the moving heavy vehicles and that of the natural elements. Deteriorating
condition of the wearing course affects rideability and can lead to distress in the structural deck slab and main
supporting members from water leaking into the deck through cracks and pot holes, especially when there
is
no waterproof layer interposed.
2.7.2. Therefore proper attention to assess the serviceability of the wearing course during inspection assumes
importance. Any water layer locked in between the wearing course and the structural deck-slab is not desirable.
Water
is
constantly pumped
in through pressure of heavy moving
vehicles and being often contaminated
especially in marine environments can be a dangerous source of distress in concrete and reinforcement.
2.8.
Railings/Parapets/Crash Barriers and Footpath (Precast) Slabs and Kerb
All these items form a part of the carriageway and are normally constructed after the main load bearing
structural system of the span has been completed. Since these
are
essential for the
safety of vehicles and
pedestrians, their condition requires to be as meticulously inspected as of the main structural components. Railings
may have an open design consisting of vertical posts and horizontal members, parapets and crash barriers and
solid kerbs which
act as an extreme edge guide for the
vehicular
traffic and
is
also continuous and made
monolithic with the deck slab (except in the case of submersible bridges, where kerbs are discontinuous with
gaps in between and railings which are collapsible or removable.)

======================================================================
IRC:SP:52-1999
2.9. River Protection Works
Some bridges have to be provided with river protection works like guide bunds which are to be protected
with stones of suitable size, protection to banks and protection to bed. These works need to be regularly inspected
and damages should be rectified in time.
3. TYPES OF BRIDGES (Sketches 27 to 32)
Bridges can be classified in accordance to their form of structural lay out as well as on the basis of their
construction technology or even materials.
3.1. Structural forms normally used and as have been adopted for our bridges, are:
a)
Arches
b)
Simply-supported spans
c)
Continuous spans
d)
Rigid frame type "with decking integral with substructure
e)
Cantilevers or balanced cantilever spans
3.2. Considering construction materials and construction technology, bridges may be in
a)
Masonry: Brick/Stone/Plain Concrete blocks/plain concrete normally for small and medium span arch
bridges.
b)
R.C.C.: For long span arches and medium span simply supported T-beams and slabs, box-girders,
balanced cantilevers and continuous span systems, (Generally not encouraged in severe marine or
chemically charged environment) rigid frames.
c)
Prestressed Concrete: For comparatively longer spans in simply supported, continuous or cantilever
construction both in T-beam and box girder cross-sections. Also used in long span arch bridges and
segmental
construction
with
precast
or
cast-in-situ
segments.
Sometime
a
bridge may have
a
combination of RCC and PSC component members.
d)
Steel girders bridges with plate girders or triangulated trusses with built-up members, supporting an
RCC deck slab.
e)
Composite construction for medium spans using plate girders and RCC deck slab.
(f)
Timber bridges for temporary crossings and bridges for lighter loads either as cantilevers or in timber
truss and timber deck arrangement.
4. USUAL PROBLEMS WITH DIFFERENT BRIDGE MATERIALS LIKE MASONRY, BRICKS,
CONCRETE, STEEL AND TIMBER
Problems with
different bridge
materials:
In bridges,
timber, masonry,
steel and concrete
are
the
materials which are mostly encountered. This chapter enumerates the deficiencies to be watched in each material.
4.1. Timber
4.1.1. The main problems with timber are 'decay' and 'Insect Attack'. There are some problems also with
joints. Sketch 33 shows a cross-section of a tree trunk.
It has three layers. Bark is the outermost and has practically
no strength. The central layer is called 'heart-wood' and the Intermediate layer is called 'sapwood'. The sapwood
is usually softer and lighter in colour than the heartwood. Sapwood
is, prone to decay and insect attack.

4.1 .2. The bark usually stays damp and insects live in it. This leads to decay and insect attack. It is, therefore,
necessary to remove the bark from the timber in the bridge.
4.1.3. Decay is caused by a fungus which attacks damp wood. It makes the timber go soft and lose strength.
Decay
is possible
at locations where there
is ingress for both
air and water. Such locations may be:
a.
parts in contact with ground (piles, ends of beams, etc.)
b.
where dirt, debris and water collect and where, vegetation grows (joints in a truss, bridge deck, etc.)
c.
where fixtures are attached with deep bolts, water can get to the centre of the member through bolt-
holes. This type of decay
is difficult to see.
d.
at the location of splits in the timber. Splits are found in all woods. These lead to decay if water gets
in and
is retained.
4.1.4. To prevent decay and insect attack, timber
is treated with chemicals. Chemicals usually cannot
penetrate into the middle portion and, therefore, decay may
still occur in the middle portion. While inspecting
for decay,
it
is necessary to look for:
a.
Stains on the timber caused by water
b.
Soft areas on the surface
c.
Soft areas
split into small blocks separated by cracks
- a sign of advanced decay.
d.
Fungus growing on surface of timber
- a sign of advanced decay deep inside the timber.
4.1.5. A variety of insects can attack timber. The most damaging are termites and borers. Borers may be
marine or land-based. Beetles are land-based borers. Marine borers usually cause severe damage and all piers
and piles in salt water must be inspected regularly for these.
4.1.6. There are three simple tests for decay and attack by insects:
1. Spike Test: A square spike is pushed into wood to find soft spots. Square spike ensures that the resultant
hole
is not confused with insect bore-holes
at a later date.
2. Hammer Test: Decayed timber sounds different from solid timber when hit with a hammer. The member
is hit at different locations to find weak spots.
3. Drill Test: A 5 mm drill is used for this test. If any decay is suspected in the timber, a hole is drilled
at such locations. The different feel of drill will then reveal decay. Too many holes near the joints are ill-advised.
After using Spike or Drill test, holes should be plugged with wood-plugs after putting in some preservative like
creosote.
4.1.7. There are three points to be attended to concerning joints in timber:
1.
Vibration caused by
traffic
or shrinkage can make
bolts
in the joints
loose.
Bolts
should,
therefore, be checked for tightness.
2.
Timber trusses are usually joined by nails.
It is important to see that no gap
is developed at
any joint location.
3.
Joints in timber are also made with steel-plates and bolts or pins. Corrosion or damage to steel
parts and looseness of bolts pins or plates should be checked.
4.
Loss of painting or surface protection should be noted.

4.2. Masonry
4.2.1. The four main problems associated with masonry are:
1
Cracking
Bulging
Loss of pointing
Deterioration of brick, stone or concrete blocks
2
3
4
4.2.2. Masonry is bricks, stone or concrete blocks put together with lime or sand-cement mortar in the joints
between them.
It is strong in compression but weak in tension.
It is used for constructing substructure elements
like abutments, piers and retaining or parapet walls. Arches may also be
built in masonry. As there
is no
reinforcing steel, there is no
corrosion. Well maintained masonry bridges have lasted for more than a hundred
years. Vibrations caused or impact given by very heavy vehicles can cause damage to masonry.
4.2.3. Cracking (Sketches 34 to 36)
4.2.3.1. Cracking
is an indication of distress in masonry.
It can be caused by over-loading, vibration or
impact from traffic. Failure or settlement of foundation or change in temperature or alternate wetting and drying
can cause cracking.
4.2.3.2. Cracking weakens the masonry and allows ingress of water and soil. Plants and small trees could
also grow in cracks. These cause the cracks to further widen.
It is not always easy to determine the cause of
cracking. Masonry expands and contracts with changes in temperature and moisture content. The resulting cracks
normally pass only through mortar joints. Cracks which cross bricks, stones or concrete blocks, are usually
serious. These cracks could be caused by either over-loading or by failure in foundation. All large cracks should
be meticulously mapped.
4.2.3.3.
Cracking
is to be considered 'serious' when:
4.2.4. Bulging
Bulging is a change in shape or curving of the face of a masonry wall. It is usually caused due to excessive
back-pressure. Bulging of masonry parapets can be caused by vehicular impact. The force exerted by the soil
behind a wall can increase due to saturation of fill if drainage is inadequate. For draining a fill, weep-holes are
provided in the abutments and returns. These sometimes get choked and cause saturation of the
fill. Saturation
may also be caused by vibration or compaction caused by heavy vehicles, or by shaking caused by earthquakes.
The height of fill may also be increased over the years and the mortar usually goes weaker with age, causing
bulging. Bulging should be mapped and measured with the help of a plumb-line, where possible.
4.2.5. Loss of pointing: Pointing is the mortar seen exposed between bricks or stones or concrete blocks.
The mortar gets worn out by river or rain water. Pointing is usually weaker than stones or bricks and deteriorates
with age. Loss or weakening of pointing can cause stones or bricks to move or even fall off. Repointing is required
to be done periodically.
1.
Cracking occurs near bearings
2.
A step occurs in the face of masonry
3.
Cracks are about 5 mm and wider
8



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:SP:52-1999
4.2.6. Deterioration of bricks or stones
4.2.6.1. Many weaker types of brick or stone cannot last for a long time. They can be worn away by rain-
water or river flow.
'Peeling Off or 'De-lamination' could be caused by alternate heating and cooling and
changes in moisture content.
4.2.6.2. Tapping the stone or brick face lightly with a hammer can cause pieces to break off. This indicates
that there
is deterioration or weathering.
It may then be necessary to protect the surface with a hard mortar,
gunite or shotcrete.
4.3. Steel
4.3.1. There are six main problems associated with steel bridges, which need detailed inspection:
1. Deterioration of paint or galvanizing/metallizing
2. Corrosion (Sketch 40)
3. Damage (bends or bulges) to steel parts (Sketch 42)
4. Loose bolts or pins or loss of weld
5. Cracking in plates
6. Loss of grease/oil from contact surfaces.
4.3.2.1. Deterioration of paint or galvanizing/metallizing: Steel corrodes when not protected from air
or water. Protection is provided by paint, galvanizing or metallizing. Sometimes painting is done after galvanizing
or metallizing
if risk of corrosion
is high. Galvanizing
is deposition of zinc on
steel by a special process.
Metallizing is spraying of zinc on steel by a special gun. In air, galvanizing provides more protection than paint.
But in saline water, galvanizing or metallizing can peel off and rusting can occur. Paint or galvanizing does not
last for many years and renewal
is necessary, after thorough cleaning. When steel starts rusting, spots of rust
are seen in the paint surface. Water enters through these spots and moves under the paint, causing peeling. Air
pollution and 'holidays' in paint or thin layers of paint can lead to quick deterioration of paint. Galvanizing or
metallizing deteriorates due to corrosion of zinc. This is apparent when white spots appear on the surface. Proper
record of spots at which paint or galvanizing has deteriorated should be maintained and timely repairs should
be carried out.
4.3.2.2. Corrosion: In contact with air and moisture, a chemical change occurs in steel and
it is called
rusting or corrosion. If corrosion progresses and becomes severe, the edge of plates appear to be split into thin
layers. This is 'lamination'. This is very serious and steel then looses almost all its strength. Rust has a volume
larger than the steel
it comes from. Where two or more steel plates are bolted or rivetted or welded together,
rust can push them apart due to increased volume and can bend the plates or shear-off bolts, rivets or welds.
Worst corrosion usually occurs under the deck where dirt, dust and water tend to accumulate. Bird droppings
also cause corrosion. Trough decks and jack arch decks are more prone to corrosion as water can accumulate
under the concrete filling above the troughs or over members of jack arch.
4.3.2.3. Vehicle or ship/vessel impact can bend a member of a steel bridge. This may weaken the structure
seriously. The location of the bend has to be mapped and the bend measured. Stiffened deck-plates may bend
under overload.
4.3.2.4. Loose or broken fixings: Steel parts are joined by fixings like rivets, bolts or welds. All rivets
and bolts must be tight and not broken. Corrosion can lead to breaking of rivets or bolts. By keeping a finger
on one side of a rivet and lightly hammering on the other
side, any looseness can be detected by the feel
(Sketch
41). There are two basic types of bolts, namely, 'bearing bolts' and 'friction-grip bolts'. Friction-grip
9



======================================================================
PAGE 20 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:SP:52-1999
bolts can be distinguished by markings on the head. Friction-grip bolts are not likely to work loose and need
not be checked. Bolts can be checked for tightness by means of a spanner. Each bolt or rivet on a bridge needs
to be checked at every inspection.
4.3.2.5. Cracking of steel: It is not a usual occurrence, but, sometimes, steel members crack. Heavy loads
frequently crossing the bridge, problems with welds or misfits, and faults in steel can cause cracks. A careful
look at
all welds and holes
is required as cracks can often start there (Sketch 37). A crack only in the paint
is not serious, but if there is a thin line of rust along it, the crack is usually serious. Every crack should be mapped
and
its thickness measured with a crack gauge film.
4.3.2.6. Loss of grease/oil from contact surfaces can sometimes occur, leading to greater frictional forces,
loss of metal and protection, and corrosion.
4.4. Concrete
4.4.1. Concrete
is made from coarse aggregates, sand, cement and water.
It is strong in compression but
weak in tension, just like masonry. To carry tension, steel bars are provided as reinforcing material. The steel
so provided may be tensioned (as in pre-stressed concrete) or un-tensioned (as in reinforced cement concrete).
As concrete dries,
it always shrinks. There are three ways in which concrete
is used in bridges:
1.
Mass Concrete or Plain Cement Concrete:
It
is usually without reinforcement (except may be
surface reinforcement to cater to temperature and shrinkage effects). Abutments, piers, retaining walls,
footways, parapets, arches, filling, wearing course, etc., may be in mass concrete.
2.
Reinforced Concrete: It has steel bars as reinforcement, and is used for abutments, piers, deck-slabs,
beams, box-girders, arches, caps over piers and abutments, dirt-walls, box-returns, etc.
3.
Prestressed Concrete:
It has tensioned steel bars, wires or strands (prestressing steel) and
is used
for long spans of slabs, beams and boxes.
4.4.2. Some of the main problems associated with concrete in bridges are:
1
.
Cracking
2.
Spalling
3.
Corrosion of tensioned or untensioned steel.
4.
Erosion and attrition
5.
Chemical attack
4.4.2.1. Cracking of concrete: Most concrete usually develops cracks. Fine and short cracks may not pose
problems but wide and long cracks can always be dangerous. Shrinkage cracks are usually fine. These need not
be mapped.
For mapping cracks, the following guidance should be adequate:
1.
Measure the length and the maximum width of important cracks and draw them on a sketch.
2.
Cracks
1 mm or wider are usually important. Smaller cracks may be important if they occur
in vital parts. A simple metal gauge or crack-gauge film is all that is needed to measure crack
widths.
3.
Crazing or a large number of cracks in a small area should be mapped even if cracks are less
than
1 mm in width.
10



======================================================================
PAGE 21 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:SP:52-1999
4.
Rust staining or white deposits or discolouration along the line of cracks should be noted.
5.
An oil-based coloured pencil should be used to mark the ends of important cracks and the date
of inspection should also be marked. Glass tell-tales should preferably be attached across such
cracks.
6.
During subsequent inspection, it should be ascertained if the cracks have lengthened or the tell-
tales
cracked. The new ends of the cracks
should then be marked alongwith
the
date of
inspection.
4.4.2.2. Spalling:
If some of the conrete in the structure falls away,
it is termed spalling of concrete.
It
is usually caused by corrosion of reinforcement. When steel corrodes,
its volume increases and the resulting
pressure breaks away or spalls pieces of concrete. Spalling causes a
loss in cross-section of a member and a
consequent reduction in strength
at the location.
4.4.2.3. Corrosion of untensioned or tensioned reinforcement
:
It
is a serious problem and can cause
a bridge
to
fail
if neglected. Corrosion
is caused by water and
air getting
into concrete and reaching
the
reinforcement.
It is accelerated by the presence of chemicals like salts carried in with water. Ingress of water
and air
is facilitated by a break in concrete due to cracking, spalling or honey-combing or due to permeable,
poor quality concrete, and/or because of inadequate cover
to reinforcement.
Tell-tale
signs which
indicate
corrosion of reinforcement are:
a.
Exposed reinforcement,
b.
Occurrence of spalling, and
c.
Cracks or rust-stains (discolouration) or leach-marks along lines of reinforcement.
4.4.2.4. Poor concrete quality: Concrete of poor quality could be honey-combed, could be permeable,
may be starved of cement, may not have specified construction tolerances, may have reacting aggregates and
could, therefore, be susceptible to chemical attack. Usually, tests or cores establish permeability, cement content,
reactive aggregates or proneness to chemical attack. But a honey-combed concrete can be detected easily by
naked eye and indicates concrete of a poor quality. Water marks, discolouration, leach-marks usually indicate
that the concrete is of a poor quality. To prevent further damage, ingress of water should be stopped by improving
drainage and providing a less permeable protective coat, as otherwise, there will be profuse corrosion.
4.4.2.5. Chemical attack: Even without the presence of moss, if the surface of the concrete feels soft and
slippery, and if there are a number of small hollows in the surface of the concrete, it can be inferred that chemicals
are damaging the concrete. Tests are required to be conducted to determine the depth of carbonation and the
extent of attack by chemicals.
5. TYPES OF DAMAGES TO VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF BRIDGES DUE TO NATURAL CAUSES AND
PROTECTION MEASURES AGAINST THEM
5.1. Damage Caused by River
5.1.1. The water flowing in a river can pick up material from the river bed or banks and can carry it away.
This is called 'scour'. Scour can form large holes in river beds or can wash away large sections of banks. Scour
has destroyed many bridges.
5.1.2. Bridges are damaged either when a river changes
its course (Sketch 39) or when
it is not able to
go through the water-way provided. This occurs when:
a)
The water-way provided
is inadequate for the discharge in the river,
11



======================================================================
PAGE 22 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:SP:52-1999
b)
The waterway gets blocked by deposition in bed, parts of old bridges, trees, bunds and other debris,
or
c)
The river discharge has grown over the years due to some reasons.
5.1.3.
If a flood
is too big for the waterway provided under a bridge, the following can occur:
i.
The river washes away the bridge.
ii.
It washes away the road-embankment and may go round the bridge. (This is termed "out flanking").
iii.
It washes away fill in front of abutments and may scour larger and deep holes in the river bed (scour
is large around piers and abutments). If the provided waterway is not sufficient, additional spans or
culverts may be provided to carry the extra flood water.
5.1.4. Protection against scour: If a river is causing scour, the road embankment, the abutments and the
piers need to be protected.
It could be 'bed protection' or 'slope protection'.
5.1.4.1. Bed protection: To protect the bed from scour, a part or
all of the bed at the bridge site needs
to be covered at times. The cover is usually provided with stone or concrete block pitching, concrete flooring
or paving with stone filled boxes or crates.
It is sometimes necessary to carry this protection beyond the width
of the bridge. For example, for fast flowing rivers, a long downstream protection may be needed or for bridges
on raft foundation, shorter protection may be needed both on the upstream and downstream. Bed protection
carried beyond a bridge
is usually termed 'apron'. When the volume of apron provided is sufficient to replace
the bed-volume likely to be scoured,
it
is termed a "launching apron".
5.1.4.2. Slope protection: Often, the embankment runs across the water-mass flowing along the river-banks,
especially in rivers with flat gorges and large flood-spreads. Such embankments can breach unless protected
adequately by stone pitching. Some embankments in backwater zone may have to be designed for sudden draw-
down condition, and may need extra slope protection. Slope protection is usually in the form of stone pitching
or boulder pitching. Armour of stone may have to be provided for embankments in creeks or sea, where the
effect of waves
is predominant. Settlement or scour can damage slope protection.
5.1.5. River training
5.1.5.1. Rivers can change their course, this change can take place either slowly or suddenly. Change of
course, after a time, can damage a bridge. Debris or large logs can cause deposition of the bed material carried
in suspension by the river. This leads to formation of new islands. Such an island formed upstream of a bridge
can cause scour around piers and or abutments. To prevent a river from changing its course river training works
are provided. These works generally keep a river on its course. Four ways commonly used for training rivers
are:
1.
Walls made of steel or timber, sheet piles or stone filled crates.
2.
Embankment protected by boulder pitching (also undressed heavy rock-pieces).
3.
Groynes made from crates or boxes filled with stone or from timber or steel piles.
4.
Trees protected by stone-filled crates or boxes.
5.1.5.2. Groynes are lines of piles or stone-filled crates placed at an angle and projecting partway across
the river from the banks. Trees grown along banks keep the banks in place with the help of their roots. Young
trees are usually protected by placing stone-filled crates around them,
if the banks are vulnerable. Apart from
these, river training works can be made of many different types of materials and with different methods of
construction. These need to be identified when encountered.
12



======================================================================
PAGE 23 of 76
======================================================================
IRC: SP: 52- 1999
5.2.1. Water: Apart from damage caused by water in the river following are some ways in which water
can affect a bridge:
1.
Corrosion of steel bridges.
2.
Corrosion of reinforcement or prestressing steel in concrete bridges.
3.
Decay in timber bridges.
4.
Damage caused to masonry or stone pitching by water running down
its surface.
5.
Bulging of walls caused by excessive pressure exerted by water retained due to blocked weep-holes.
6.
Washed embankments due to water running down.
Most of these damages can be prevented by providing good drainage on the approaches and good drainage
and water-proofing to the deck of bridges. Badly placed water spouts can cause corrosion and other damages.
A good filter medium behind abutments and returns and adequate provision of weep-holes
is a must.
5.2.2. Debris, dirt and vegetation
5.2.2.1. Dirt or debris hold water if they get collected on a bridge structure. The resultant dampness causes
decay or deterioration. Vegetation can grow in these pockets and can damage a bridge.
5.2.2.2. Debris carried by the river sometimes collects against piers or abutments. This can cause blocking
of waterway, leading ultimately, to out-flanking.
5.2.2.3. Large amount of debris can sometimes get collected against a pier or a superstructure. Force of
water on this debris can badly damage a bridge.
5.2.2.4. Normally vegetation is found growing in areas of the bed not used by river. For many bridges,
river is found to flow, most of the time, through only a part of the waterway. Grasses or light vegetation is not
bad, as
it holds the bed-soil in place. Trees large bushes and large plants are bad, as they block the waterway.
5.2.2.5. Culverts and bridge waterways could be choked in arid areas or where rivers have a tendency to
deposit sand. When the river flows in floods, the sand may get washed away but when this happens the structure
can get damaged.
5.2.3. Earthquakes: Sometimes, bridges can be damaged by earthquakes. Earthquakes can cause two
common types of damage:
1.
Foundation failure causing abutments or piers to move.
2.
Dislodging of superstructures, from their bearings. In earthquake prone areas, measures to hold the
superstructure in place are usually provided.
5.2.4. Landslides: A landslide occurring directly on a bridge can cause a bridge to collapse. If a Landslide
takes place upstream of a bridge, water can build up behind
it. After sometime the river can break-through and
wash away the bridge along with the debris. This does not occur often but, to be safe, changes in the river on
the upstream of a bridge should be watched with the aid of local enquiry during inspection.
6. IMPORTANT POINTS FOR BRIDGE INSPECTION AND FORMAT OF BRIDGE INSPECTOR'S REPORT
6.1. A form of inspection report has been given in Appendix-3. The procedure of filling the form has been
explained below. It must be remembered that the report form must be filled into "show what you have seen".
13



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:SP:52-1999
6.2. On page
1 of the report form, the number, name of river and location and the bridge to be inspected
should be given. The following checklist should be of help:
(1)
Check that "it
is really the bridge to be inspected."
(2)
Check the bridge number.
(3)
Check the name of river/nallah.
(4)
Check the kilometerage on the road.
(5)
Carefully read any instructions that may have been given by the engineer.
(6)
Draw a small sketch. On it, mark the end villages, the flow direction, number of spans, piers abutments.
6.3. It is necessary to give a careful second look to the filled-in report, before leaving the site. The following
checklist should be of help:
(1)
Have
all the sections been filled?
(2)
Have
all the necessary notes and sketches been completed and properly numbered?
(3)
Have any points been noticed which are not listed in the form, but which you feel are important?
(4)
Has the form been signed with date?
(5)
Has the form been tied together with the total number of pages mentioned?
6.4. On page 2 of the report form, construction details and details of services and signs are to be filled
in and the following checklist should be of help:
6.4. 1
. Construction details: Each construction detail should be checked correctly and ticked YES or NO
carefully.
6.4.2. Services: Services may be electricity or telephone cables or gas, oil, water or sewage pipes. It should
be verified if the service mentioned on record drawing
is
still in place or it has been taken away. If any new
services, not mentioned in the form, are noticed, a note should be taken and problems, if any, should be written
down. If any damage to services is noticed, a note should be taken, in particular, if it could lead to damage to
the bridge, like say a leaking water pipe can cause deterioration. A note should also be taken of any damage
caused by the staff or authorities manning the services during installation, removal, maintenance or repairs.
6.4.3. Signs: Signs are important indicators giving limits on height, width, speed, weight, number of axles,
flow direction, etc. The bridge can fail or get badly damaged if vehicles not permitted on the bridge ply over
it. Signs should be easy to read, especially for the drivers.
It should be verified that each of the required signs
is in place. If any damage to the signs
is noticed,
it must be reported.
6.5. The main part of the report form covers the list of problems which should be looked for. These problems
have been
listed under different headings,
e.g., under the heading "River", report on scour, blockages
in
waterway, change in course of river, etc. are covered.
6.6. The report form should be filled-in as the bridge is being inspected and on site itself.
It should never
be filled from memory subsequently or at a place other than the site. Some additional notes and sketches should
also be drawn for clarity, if necessary. Sketches should be drawn on the back pages (If any short note is to be
written,
it should be done in the same line as the problem as far as possible). The answers to questions "How
bad" and "How much" depend on the experience of the Inspector and his judgement.
It
is always advisable
to inspect the first few bridges along with an experienced engineer.
It
is important to be deliberately careful
14



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 76
======================================================================
IRC: SP:52- 1999
while filling in each line of the report form. Sometimes,
it
is difficult to assess the extent of a problem or a
problem may be difficult to recognise. In these cases,
it is necessary to make a note in the report form. When
in doubt, it is better to state that doubt instead of writing something incorrect. When all the questions under each
heading have been ticked, the "all checked" box can be ticked as YES.
If, due to any reason,
it has not been
possible to answer any of the questions,
it is necessary to tick the "NO" box to show that that a particular part
has not been inspected or checked fully.
6.7. Observations During Inspection
6.7.1. During Inspection a number of points have to be remembered. The inspection report form covers
most of these points. The points to be checked while inspecting and the nature and significance of the problems,
in brief, have been indicated in this chapter.
6.7.2. Road approaches and protection
6.7.2.1. Slopes of approach embankments become unstable if the base of the embankments is being attacked
and washed away by the river flow.
It
is, therefore, necessary to check for scour at the base of embankment
slopes. Where scour takes place, the embankment fill slips down. It is necessary to check for slip of embankment
fill.
6.7.2.2. If rain water or in case of submersible bridges, river water, on the approaches to bridges
is not
drained properly water runs down the face of the embankment. This after some time, may wash the
fill away.
It can also cause damage to parts of abutments and wing walls. Hence,
it is necessary to check for erosion of
the
fill near the abutments.
6.7.2.3. Cracking of the road or the edge of embankments behind abutments indicates that the wall has
moved. Any cracking of the road or edge of embankment has, therefore, to be checked. Failure of embankments
may be by formation of slip circles or by
'piping'. In both modes, there
is loss of materials from around the
abutment.
6.7.2.4. Toe
walls
are usually provided
at
the end of embankment slopes
to prevent scouring away.
Sometimes concrete, steel or timber piles may be provided below toe walls. It is necessary to look for any 'away'
movement of the toe wall or piles. Though small movements are common these are not serious. Movement of
large sections of the wall are serious.
6.7.2.5. Stone pitching for slope protection: One of the ways of protecting the slope surface from being
washed away by rain or by water running off the road,
is by providing stone pitching.
It is necessary to look
for cracks in the stone pitching. Cracks wider than 5 mm are serious. The stone pitching breaks up if the mortar
pointing is poor. Pitching may crack due to settlements in embankment. It is necessary to observe for any scour
or erosion at the edges of stone-pitching. Pieces broken off from stone pitching indicate bad undermining.
6.7.2.6. Stone filled crates/boxes for slope protection: Wire or wooden crates or boxes filled with stones
are sometimes used to protect slopes from getting washed off in floods or due to water run-off from road. These
crates can move considerably, and movement has to be checked. The wires and ties should also be checked to
verify that these are in place. When the boxes move excessively the top of the slope gets exposed and the road
cracks. There may be scour at the bottom of the slope, resulting in settlement of the boxes.
6.7.2.7. Boulder pitching for slope protection: For boulder
pitching to be effective, the size and weight
of the boulders should be such as to prevent the river or tide from moving these. As the embankment gets scoured
at base, the boulder pitching sinks into the river bed. Any sinking or washing away should be carefully noted.

6.7.3. River bed protection
6.7.3.1. Rivers can damage the river bed under bridges.
It is important to prevent this as
it usually leads
to major damage to bridges.
It is necessary to make a note of large holes in the river bed near or directly under
a bridge.
If the river flow
is fast and if the river bed
is
soft, protection may have to be provided by:
1.
Stone pitching
2.
Concrete cover slab or concrete block pitching
3.
Stone-filled crates or boxes
4.
Boulder pitching.
(All these come under bed protection or aprons).
6.7.3.2. Scour in the river bed usually occurs at the edge of the bed protection or apron. Small scour holes
are usually not important. If any scour holes go below the bed protection the same must be noted and reported.
It
is preferable to illustrate the note by means of a sketch. Cracks in the surface of the bed protection occur
usually due to settlement. It is necessary to report all cracks in reinforced concrete aprons but for mass concrete
or stone aprons, only large cracks usually need be reported. To find cracks, a spade should be used to scrape
off any
soil, sand and debris. If cracks are noticed, a sketch should be prepared.
It is necessary to check for
any sign of spalling of concrete or missing stones from pitching. It is important to remember that stones carried
by the river usually cause erosion of the surface of the concrete aprons. For reinforced concrete aprons, corrosion
of reinforcement should be looked for.
6.7.3.3. Stone filled crates or. boxes can be advantageously used for river bed protection. These are flexible
and when scour takes place, they function as a "launching apron". The protection, therefore, is more effective.
It
is important to look for signs that the stone filled boxes garlanded around piers or abutments, have broken
away. If this occurs, the river can very quickly destroy the bed protection. Damage or corrosion of wires and
ties could also result in the destruction of protection work.
6.7.3.4. Boulder aprons: Boulder pitching or garlanding is used to prevent scour around piers. It is usually
necessary to replenish the boulders lost during floods in filling up the scour holes.
It is necessary to look for
loss of stones of apron or garlanding during inspection.
6.7.4. River behaviour and training works
6.7.4.1. During inspection any changes in the river characteristics should be looked for carefully. Most of
the changes and problems can be seen when looking from the bridge deck or when looking from the abutments
while standing under the bridge.
It may sometimes be necessary to walk along the banks for some distance on
both sides to check what
is happening to the river.
6.7.4.2. Obstructions in the waterway: The waterway under a bridge should be clear. Any obstruction
can:
a.
Cause scour in the bed or banks.
b.
Cause successively larger obstruction due to further deposition and entanglement of debris.
It is, therefore, necessary to look for any debris piled up against piers and abutments or in the bed on the
u/s of the bridge. Sometimes, the old bridge
is not fully dismantled after a new bridge is built nearby. Parts of
the old bridge can arrest debris and lead to scour. Under many bridges, some of the waterway
is usually dry,
except in floods. Farmers tend to put fences or bunds and may be huts on the dry areas and start cultivation.
Large plants or trees and shrubs grown in bed can block waterway. Obstructions like these must be removed,
especially when on the u/s of a bridge.

IRC:SP:52-1999
6.7.4.3. Change of river course:
If a river changes
its course,
it can destroy a bridge, especially when
the change takes place on its upstream. To judge whether a river is changing its course, bends in the river upstream
of a bridge and condition of banks on bends should be examined, duly considering information obtained from
local people. If the bank is steep with trees at the edge, but with nothing else growing on the bank, then it can
be inferred that the river is shifting towards that bank. When a lot of water is seen flowing but the bank is not
steep and small plants are seen growing with some mud or pebbles on the bank, then
it can be inferred that
the river is shifting away from that bank. If new islands are forming on the u/s,
it means that the river is likely
to change
its course.
6.7.5. Training works:
6.7.5.1. The river affects the training works in four ways:
a.
The river can attack the end of the training work by moving beyond the u/s end of the works.
b.
The river can wash off or disturb/damage the materials of the river training works.
c.
Piles or walls may be moved forward due to scour.
d.
The river training works may be damaged by floating logs or trees.
6.7.5.2. Sometimes, trees grown on terraces are used to train rivers. The trees are protected by stone filled
crates or boxes till they grow. Damage to trees used in river training works should be noted and dead and damaged
trees should be replaced.
6.7.6. Sub-structure and retaining walls
6.7.6.1. It is usually found that for a bridge, the sub-structure and retaining wings or returns are made from
the same material. However, to enable the inspector to fill in the report form properly,
all types of materials
are covered in each category. Substructure comprises abutments, returns, wing walls and piers.
6.7.6.2. Concrete abutments, wing walls and return walls
6.7.6.2.1. In concrete structures, the inspector should look for any cracking of concrete and indicate the
important cracks on a sketch. In concrete, cracks are termed important if 1 mm or
wider and/or if water seeps
through them. Near the bearings, even fine cracks are important and these should be shown on the sketch.
6.7.6.2.2. Spalling of concrete should be noted and the area indicated on the sketch.
6.7.6.2.3. The inspector should indicate areas where the quality of concrete is poor, as apparent from honey
combing and/or chemical attack.
6.7.6.2.4.
It is necessary to observe leach marks, rust marks discolouration, leakage, cracks and spalling
to infer corrosion of reinforcement. At the location of spalling, the cover to reinforcement and the reduction
in diameter of the exposed bar or
its stage/state of corrosion should be noted carefully.
6.7.6.3. Masonry abutments and returns
6.7.6.3.1. In masonry,
it is necessary to map
all cracks wider than 3 mm at the widest location and also
when there
is a step across a crack.
6.7.6.3.2. Any cracks near bearings especially if these go
all around the bearings, and cracks which run
underneath the bearings are important and should be noted very carefully.
17



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:SP:52-1999
6.7.6.3.3.
It must be remembered that bulges noticed in abutments are more serious than those noticed in
returns. Specially, when a bulge has horizonal cracks in it, careful noting is needed as this is a serious problem.
A sketch showing the location and the extent of bulges should be prepared.
6.7.6.3.4.
It
is important to observe and note poor quality or loss of pointing.
6.7.6.3.5. Any deterioration of the bricks, stones or concrete blocks should be observed and noted.
6.7.6.4. Stacked abutments and returns
Stone filled crates or boxes or wire baskets are at times stacked together to form abutments and returns
of simple and often temporary bridges. They could be used as abutments for timber bridges, Bailey bridges and
steel beam bridges with timber decks. When these abutments settle or bulge, the deck may be damaged and the
road may also be damaged. Any change in shape, cracks or hollows or settlement should be noted. The wires
and ties can be cut by debris in the river or corrosion or excessive deformation of the crates or baskets.
It is,
therefore, necessary to inspect and note the condition of the wires and ties.
6.7.6.5. Timber abutments and returns
Abutments and returns are sometimes made of logs tied or spiked together. Usually, these are provided
for log bridges. Timber piles topped with timber cross-beam are used as abutments for timber bridges. Timber
in contact with ground and water is prone to decay and insect attack. The ties and spikes can corrode and decay.
It
is necessary to check for the following during an inspection
1. Decay-near beams of spans, near ground and at water level.
2. Insect attack-at the seat of beams on abutments.
6.7.7. Piers
6.7.7.1. The different types of piers are shown in Sketches 8 to 12. Boat inspection may be needed to inspect
bridges on perennial rivers or on creeks. Ladders or some other arrangement may have to be provided for
inspecting piers. In general, piers need to be inspected for the following:
i.
Scour near the base of the piers.
ii.
Damage near the base or damage to wells or piles including corrosion,
hi.
Movement of the piers.
iv.
Damage due to impact from boats, vessels, floating logs or trees or vehicles passing under the bridge.
v.
Debris resting against piers.
vi.
Vegetation growth on the piers.
vii.
Leakage of water from expansion joints damaging the piers.
6.7.7.2. Concrete Piers: For piers built in concrete,
it
is necessary to inspect for the following:
i.
Cracking of concrete, especially around bearings, in pile caps, wells and pier caps. Important cracks
should be shown on a sketch.
ii.
Spalling of concrete: Spalled areas should be shown on a sketch.
iii.
Corrosion of reinforcement with special attention given to rust-stains from cracks and areas of spalled
concrete.
If exposed, the loss in bar diameters should be measured.
iv.
Areas of poor concrete especially showing honey combing and chemical attack.
18



======================================================================
PAGE 29 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:SP:52-1999
6.7.7.3. Masonry piers: For piers built in masonry,
it is necessary to remember that cracks can be caused
by failure of foundations. These cracks are usually long and go deep into the body of the piers. Overloading
may cause cracks around bearings. These may also be caused by free bearings prevented from moving. For piers
in masonry, the following points need to be inspected:
i.
Cracking of Masonry, especially long and wide cracks and any cracks near bearings.
ii.
Poor pointing can lead to problems. Brick or stone masonry piers can be seriously weakened by loss
of mortar pointing by erosion due to river flow. The flow of water past a pier and alternate wetting
and drying can damage the pier material.
iii.
Deterioration of bricks or stones should be tested by hitting the surface with a hammer. If pieces fall
off, the indication
is that the bricks or stones are in poor condition.
6.7.7.4. Steel piers: Steel piers are usually trestle piers and each trestle consists of a number of members
jointed together. For steel piers,
it
is necessary to inspect for:
i.
Debris in the joints of the steelwork, leading to corrosion.
ii.
Deterioration of paint or galvanizing/metallizing.
iii.
Corrosion, especially near water level and in creeks, in the portion between HTL and LTL.
iv.
Bends in steel members and joints, usually caused by barges or logs/trees impacting.
v.
Loose bolts or rivets and lost welds or cracks near welds and bolt holes.
vi.
Cracking especially near bearings.
6.7.7.5. Timber piers: Wet timber decays. For timber piers,
it is necessary to inspect for:
i.
Debris in the joints.
ii.
Decay at joints and near water levels.
iii.
Insect attack especially below water level in salt water. Attack by marine borers is very common here.
iv.
Splits in timber, especially near bolt holes and at or below water-level.
v.
Loose bolts or pins
at joints.
vi.
Bends in timber, which may be caused by impact or overloads.
vii.
Corrosion of steel parts especially at water level.
6.7.8. Superstructure
6.7.8.1. General: Each span of a bridge will have to be inspected and each superstructure will have to
be recorded in a separate part of the form. The general inspection should be carried out both from the top of
the deck and from under the deck. The points to be checked during general inspection include:
i.
Impact damage to beams trusses or bracings caused by vehicles, boats or logs.
ii.
Debris and vegetation on beams, trusses, bracings or in joints.
iii.
Water coming through the bridge deck, signs of wetness on steel work, on timber and on concrete,
respectively in the form of rust marks, water run marks and dark areas with build up of white material
on surface, should be noted.
iv.
Water from the deck-drainage flowing on the girders, trusses, beams or bracings.
v.
Adequate headroom for overbridges exists and is not encroached upon. The actual head room should
be noted.
19



======================================================================
PAGE 30 of 76
======================================================================
IRC: SP:52- 1999
vi.
Excessive deflections in superstructure.
vii.
Cracking and spalling in superstructure.
6.7.8.2. Concrete girders: If cracks are noticed, these should be measured for length and maximum width.
A sketch should be included in the report. Date and ends of cracks should be marked and preferably glass tell-
tales should be attached. The progress of the cracks already identified in the previous inspections should be
observed and noted. For concrete girders,
it
is important to look for the following:
i.
Cracks at ends of beams which spread up from the bearing seat (Sketch 38).
It is a serious problem.
ii.
Cracks parallel to the beams on the faces of bottom bulbs of beams. These cracks are normally due
to corrosion and occur when the concrete in bulb-corners is about to spall. It is necessary, therefore,
to tap the concrete here firmly with a hammer.
iii.
Spalling of concrete which may be due to external impact or corrosion of reinforcement.
iv.
Signs of corrosion of reinforcement. If any reinforcement is visible, a note of the concrete cover and
loss in diameter of the bar should be taken in the report.
v.
Signs of poor quality of concrete, especially at the corners of bottom bulbs.
6.7.8.3. Steel girders and bracings: The parts of a steel girder are shown in Sketch 32.
For steel girders,
it
is necessary to inspect the following:
i.
Deterioration of paint or galvanizing or metallizing on
all main and cross girders.
ii.
Corrosion
of
steel:
Special
attention
should be
given
to
wet
areas
and
areas
where
debris
accummulates. Ends of beams and girders also get badly corroded. Corrosion causes two very serious
problems. These are:
(a)
Lamination &
(b)
Steel sections forced apart by increase in volume due to rusting. This causes rivets, bolts or welds
to snap.
iii.
Bends in webs and flanges of girders and bends in stiffeners and bracings: Serious overloading could
cause bends along the length of girders. These are serious. The size of the bends should be measured
by using a string-line and mapped as far as possible.
iv.
Loose bolts, rivets and lost welds: All these should be marked clearly on the structure with paint
and on a sketch. Joints with loose bolts/rivets or lost welds should be shown (Sketch 41)
v.
Cracking: Cracks at the locations of welds and holes should be sketched and marked on the girder
with paint. Cracking can be very dangerous.
6.7.8.4. Steel trusses: During inspection of steel trusses, attention has to be given to the following points:
i.
Deterioration of paint, galvanizing or metallizing. This should be looked for especially
at joints.
ii.
Corrosion: Corrosion normally starts at joints. The joints of the bottom chord are affected first. Where
corrosion is apparent, lamination should be looked for. Signs of forcing apart of plates should also
be searched.
iii.
Bends in truss members: Any bend member should be marked with paint and a sketch drawn. As
far as possible, the size of the bend should be measured.
iv.
Bent or damaged joints: Damaged or bent joints should be marked with paint and a sketch drawn.
v.
Bent or damaged bracings: The pattern of the bracing system should be sketched and damged
members should be clearly shown on the sketch and marking done in paint on the members. The bends
should be measured,
if possible.
20



======================================================================
PAGE 31 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:SP:52-1999
vi.
Loose bolts/rivets and lost welds: All these should be marked on site with paint also indicating the
affected
joints. A
sketch showing
the
locations
of damage
should be drawn. Any bending
or
displacement of truss as a whole out of plane should be measured and marked and also shown on
sketch. Any distress or any displacement in pins of pin-joints should be noted.
vii.
Cracking: This
is serious in trusses as
it can lead to sudden collapse as the members are usually
small. The cracks should be marked with paint and sketched. Cracks in trusses should be reported
to the higher authorities as soon as possible.
6.7.8.5. Timber decks: These include log bridges, timber beam bridges and bridge decks made from
laminated timber. Log bridges normally have a short life, being used for temporary bridges. However, these can
last for a long time
if properly constructed and maintained. For timber bridge decks,
it
is necessary during
inspection, to give attention to the following points:
(i)
Decay any where in the timber: Areas of dampness and locations around nails and spikes should
be closely inspected for decay. If beam ends rest on ground or are likely to come in contact with
soil, the ends decay faster. The ends of beams should be carefully inspected for decay. Logs having
bark in place should be inspected very carefully and the bark should be removed wherever possible
without endangering safety. The extent of decay should be assessed and noted.
(ii)
Insect attack: The extent of insect attack should be assessed and noted. The spike test, hammer test
and/or drill tests should be used. The size and depth of bad area should be ascertained upto a point
where good timber
is encountered. These should be sketched and recorded.
(iii)
Splitting of timber: In timber, two types of splits are important and need be noted:
(a)
Very large
splits, tending to get larger, and
(b)
Splits which may allow entry of water into the member but will not allow
it to drain. In this
context, splits in the top are dangerous as they do not drain. Cracks near the soffit can drain
water off. Splits in glue laminated bridges can be serious, but these beams are not used in India.
(iv)
Loose or corroded nails, spikes or fixing wires.
6.7.8.6. Masonry jack-arches: For masonry jack arches, the following points should be properly inspected:
(i)
Change in shape of arch: This
is usually a result of overloading or failure of arch material. If the
change of shape
is significant, the arch may have to be rebuilt.
(ii)
Cracking or spalling of the bricks or stones,
(iii)
Pointing of arches: Poor quality pointing or lost pointing can cause serious damage.
6.7.8.7. Masonry arches
6.7.8.7.1. For masonry arches, the most important observation is the change in shape of the arch. This could
be observed in the following manner:
(i)
Standing a long distance away, compare the shape on the left of the arch centre with that on the right.
Sometimes, observing the shadow lines reveals a lot of information.
(ii)
Look for any shift in the key stone
at centre of face walls.
(iii)
From underneath the arch look for any change in shape of barrel, even locally.
6.7.8.7.2. The arch barrel should be checked for any cracking. The cracks should be mapped. Cracks across
the roadway are usually dangerous signs. Other important crack is due to separation of the face walls from the
21



======================================================================
PAGE 32 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:SP:52-1999
arch barrel. These cracks run in traffic direction. Alternatively, there may be bulging of the face walls. Any
bulge in the face walls should be sketched.
6.7.8.7.3. Spandrel or face wall should not separate from the arch as shown in sketch.
6.7.8.7.4. Any spalling of stones or bricks from the arch or from spandrel walls should be noted.
6.7.8.7.5. Quality and loss of pointing should be noted.
6.7.8.7.6. Leakage through arch: With the effects of weather and water, the materials of the arch generally
deteriorate. Some water leaks through most arches. Small leakage does not cause problems.
If the leakage
is
large, white stains can be observed near joints and even clear wet areas can be seen. If leakage
is excessive,
the arch gets damaged.
6.7.8.7.7 Scour under arch foundation: This can be observed by pushing a long pole into the ground under
the foundation of an arch bridge. If the pole can be pushed in, there
is a problem of scour.
6.7.9. Bearings
6.7.9.1. General: Bearings of some kind or the other are provided under the deck. But
it is not possible
to inspect all parts of a bearing. The parts not inspected should be recorded as "not inspected". While inspecting
bearings
it is firstly important to identify which bearings are fixed and which are free. Pedestals and areas under
bearings are normally wet places where debris and vegetation collect. During inspection, attention should be
given to the following:
(i)
Debris and Vegetation around bearings and pedestals, these can damage a bearing and can also lead
to malfunction due to obstruction to movement or jamming.
(ii)
Poor drainage on top of cap under pedestals and of pedestals themselves: Any signs suggesting
continued accumulation of water during rainy season and after floods recede, should be recorded.
(iii)
Prevented/Restricted Movements: This point is difficult to determine. Small debris accumulation
cannot usually lead to this as the weight of the deck
is large.
(iv)
Bearings not properly seated.
(v)
Span or deck not properly seated on bearings.
(vi)
Damages to pedestals.
(vii) Damaged or missing grease boxes and missing parts.
(viii) Other extraneous supports inadvertently left in place during construction or inserted later on.
(ix)
Cleanliness of the area around bearings.
6.7.9.2. In addition to the above, there are some important points specific to the type of bearings and these
are given below:
6.7.9.2.1.
Elastomeric bearings:
(i)
Splitting, tearing or cracking of elastomer
6.7.9.2.2. Metal bearings
(i)
Fallen cut segmental rollers
(ii)
Corrosion.
22



======================================================================
PAGE 33 of 76

IRC:SP:52-1999
(iii)
Problems in lubrication system.
(iv)
Damages to pins, knuckles and sliding or rolling surfaces.
(v)
Cracks and bends in metal parts.
6.7.9.2.3. Other types of bearings may include concrete roller bearings, PTFE bearings, pot bearings, dish
and knuckle bearings. Any damage to these or any malfunction should be recorded.
6.7.9.2.4. Restraints: On bridges in severe earthquake zones or on submersible bridges, deck restraints
are usually provided, to prevent the span from falling off. The restraints may be of the following types and any
damage or looseness should be recorded:
(i)
Large bolt or bolts.
(ii)
Concrete or R.C.C. Stoppers.
(iii)
Special restraining bearings.
6.7.10. Expansion joints
6.7.10.1. Various types of expansion joints may be provided on bridges. The type provided and locations
for a particular bridge should be ascertained from records. Physical verification should be done to ensure that
the record is correct. Expansion joints can mostly be inspected from above. But sometimes, sound of loose plates
or damage or leakage can be noticed from under the deck.
6.7.10.2. For expansion joints, the following points should be inspected:
(i)
Damage to the concrete of the superstructure or of the dirt wall.
(ii)
Debris or vegetation in the joints-stones or other debris can stop some of the parts from moving.
(iii)
Loose or damaged fixtures and fastenings. This
is a common problem with bolts and steel parts.
(iv)
Damage or corrosion to metal parts of the joints.
(v)
Damages to rubber water seals-some joints have a water-seal to prevent water and debris from the
deck getting into the joint. Stones rubbing on water-seals can puncture the same.
(vi)
Fingers of the finger type expansion joints may deform or snap or debris can arrest their movement.
6.7.11. Parapets and railings
6.7. 11.1. Railings may be removable or fixed and are usually made of angle iron posts and G.I. Pipe railings.
For submersible bridges, collapsible railings are sometimes used. Parapets are usually solid or with patterns and
may be made of masonry, concrete, R.C.C. or steel. For some bridges insurmountable or deflecting crash-barriers
may also be provided. Log bridges or culverts may have only guardstones. Parapets and barriers can get damaged
by impact from vehicles. Sometimes,
this causes damage to the superstructure near parapets.
6.7.11.2. The following points need to be inspected:
(i)
Impact damage to parapets: A note should be made of any damage to parapets and also to the bridge
at that location.
(ii)
Loose or damaged fixtures and fastenings.
(iii)
Posts loose at base: This is relevant when precast R.C.C. or P.C.C. or steel or timber posts are fitted
into holes in the concrete runner members.
23

In addition, some points specific to the material of the parapet also need be considered.
6.7.11.3. Steel parapets
(i)
Damaged galvanizing or paint
(ii)
Corrosion
6.7.11.4. Concrete parapets
(i)
Cracking
(ii)
Spalling of concrete-at corner posts and rails
(iii)
Corrosion of reinforcement-especially at corner posts and rails and at locations of spalled concrete
(iv)
Poor Concrete and
(v)
Vegetation and debris
6.7.11.5. Timber parapets
(i)
Decay-especially at bases of posts and at joints
(ii)
Insect attack
(iii)
Splits in timber
(iv)
Vegetation and debris
6.7.11.6. Masonry parapets
(i)
Serious Cracks-Masonry cracks under vehicular impact and gets pushed outwards. Small cracks are
usually not important.
(ii)
Outward movement or bending of parapets
(iii)
Poor Pointing
(iv)
Deterioration of brick or stone in parapets
6.7.12. Wearing course and footpaths
6.7.12.1. The road surface on a bridge
i.e. the wearing course, can be of bituminous materials, concrete,
steel or timber. If footpaths are of the same materials, the report can be made for both together. Otherwise, report
on road and footpaths should be separate.
6.7.12.2. Bituminous wearing course-where small movements are expected at expansion joints, bituminous
wearing course can cover the gap
at the joint. The surface often cracks or breaks up over these joints. The
following points need attention.
(i)
Wearing course breaking up or lifting off the deck concrete-especially at expansion joints and water-
spouts.
(ii)
Cracked wearing course above buried joints-any damage to or exposure of the water proofing layer,
if any, between the deck and wearing coat should be noted.
6.7.12.3. Concrete wearing course: The following points need attention:
(i)
Cracking of concrete: Any cracks which begin in spalled areas of the superstructure could be serious.
24

Long span bridges especially cantilevers can deflect considerably and induce cracks.
(ii)
Spalling of concrete (Sketch 47)
(iii)
Exposed and corroded reinforcement

Poor concrete
(v)
Wear of the surface due to small stones on the wearing course and those lodged in tyre surface.
(vi)
Loss of filling in bituminous joints
(vii)
Potholes in the wearing course
6.7.12.4. Steel and Timber Wearing Course are usually not encountered. However, the basic points as for
other wearing course remain the same. Points related to materials themselves should also be given attention.
6.7.13. Utilities:
Utilities like water pipe lines, electric cables, telephone cables, gas lines, etc., may be
provided on the deck or under
it. The following points need to be checked:
(i)
Whether or not the utility
is authorised
(ii)
Whether any leakage
is seen
(iii)
Damage caused by leaking
utilities
(iv)
Damage caused to utilities themselves
6.7.14.
Electric
poles: On some
bridges
near
cities,
electric
street
lights
are
provided. The
fixing
arrangement may be in concrete pedestals, but holding down is usually by bolts. The pedestals also get damaged
by vehicular impact. The poles, at times may get bent. The lights may not be functioning. The holding down
bolts may corrode and snap. The condition of all these components should be noted and recorded.
6.7.15. Culverts
6.7.15.1. As the openings in the culverts are small, blockage by debris and vegetation is often found. At
places, people may try to impound water by providing stone slabs or such other obstructions in front of the
openings on the upstream of the culverts. Unless these obstructions are removed before monsoons, the culverts
are likely to be damaged, and outflanking
is also possible.
6.7.15.2. For culverts, the following points need to be inspected:
(i)
Debris, vegetation, etc. inside or near the culvert
(ii)
Settlement of parts of the culverts.
(iii)
Scour at ends of culverts and at edges of aprons. Usually there is silting on the u/s and scour on the
d/s.
6.7.15.3. Concrete culverts: For these, the following points should be inspected:
(i)
Cracking
(ii)
Spalling
(iii)
Corrosion of reinforcement
(iv)
Poor concrete.
6.7.15.4. Culvert aprons: Like some bridges, some culverts may be provided with aprons, usually on the
25



======================================================================
PAGE 36 of 76
======================================================================
IRC:SP:52-1999
d/s. Scour may cause the aprons to settle at the edges. Concrete or stone pitching may crack and break up. Any
damage to or loss of material from the aprons should be recorded.
6.7.15.5. Headwalls: Embankment at the ends of the culverts
is retained by headwalls. These walls may
be in masonry or in concrete. If the headwalls settle or get pushed outward, the flow can damage the wall as
well as the embankment.
It is, therefore, necessary to check for movement of headwalls, especially at the joint
between the barrel around waterway opening and the headwall. In addition, depending on the material, the
following points need to be inspected:
(i)
For concrete headwalls, cracking, spalling, corrosion of reinforcement and poor concrete.
(ii)
For masonry headwalls, cracking poor pointing, and deterioration of bricks or stone.
6.7.16.
Miscellaneous
6.7.16.1. Access: For any inspection or monitoring, easy and preferably comfortable access to all parts of
a bridge or culvert is necessary. The bridges should be inspectable and maintainable and access plays a major
role in these operations.
It
is for this reason that mobile inspection units specially developed for the purpose
of detailed inspection are used these days. Older bridges may not have been provided with access arrangements.
Newer bridges may have some arrangement for access. Where provided, the condition of the access arrangement
should be recorded. The problems encountered due to non-provision of access arrangement or inadequate access
arrangement should be recorded. If any hollow component, like a box super-structure or hammer head is found
to be without access for going inside the box, the same needs to be recorded and brought to the notice of higher
authorities.
6.7.16.2.
Instrumentation: Some
bridges under
distress
or some
important long
span
bridges
with
innovative design may be provided with instrumentation for monitoring
stresses,
etc. The condition of the
instrumentation provided and whether the same
is functioning, may be noted,
if possible.

"SAFETY ASPECTS FOR INSPECTORS"
The bridge inspector has to be careful during inspections to prevent accidents to himself. He has to keep
in mind,
all along the following, to plan his work:
1.
Traffic:
a.
While walking on the bridge and
its approaches,
it
is necessary to keep an eye on the
traffic.
b.
It
is better to carry warning signs like DANGER, WORK IN PROGRESS, SLOW, etc., and place them
so as to warn drivers.
c.
It
is better to wear bright coloured uniform and helmet, preferably yellow.
d.
It is better to protect work area with cones and ask the assistant to control traffic. Traffic may be stopped
for a short while,
if required.
2.
Dangerous Spots:
a.
Small bridges over shallow water could be inspected alone. Otherwise always take someone with you to
make sure that you are safe.
b.
Always a rope and a safety harness should be carried with you.
c.
Never go into dangerous places without assistance.
d.
Keep a watch on insects, reptiles or animals or birds which can cause harm. This
is especially so after
floods.
e.
Before going into closed spaces like inside of a box-girder, keep the manhole covers off for a long time
before you enter. Poisonous gases can cause death. Always keep somebody standing outside, ready to help.
3.
Chemicals:
Most chemicals are toxic and proper care must be taken while using those.
