CODE OF PRACTICE FOR MAINTENANCE OF
BITUMINOUS SURFACES OF HIGHWAYS
1.1. Highway
maintenance
is
an important
activity of every
Highway Department.
The safety and
convenience of traffic using
the road are governed
to
a
large extent
by the quality of mainte-
nance.
The
operation-economics
of
road transport
is influenced
by the degree of maintenance
imparted
to
the
road.
The
life of
an asset can be preserved and
prolonged
if adequate maintenance
measures are undertaken in
proper time.
In
developing countries,
stage
construction
of
pavements
is
often
resorted to, with lesser
pavement thickness and lower
specifications
than needed for a
full
design.
The
proper
maintenance
of
roads,
therefore, assumes
greater
significance
in
such situations.
The financial resources at
the command
of
a
maintenance
engineer
are
always
short of
demands, and
it becomes
necessary
to utilise the same in the most
judicious
manner,
applying
the
best
engineering
practices
and
managerial
skill.
1.2.
This
Code
of
Practice
deals
with the maintenance of
bituminous surfaces of
highways.
This
Code was prepared by the
Bituminous Pavements Committee
(composition
given
below) and
finalised in
its meeting held on the 20th August,
1980.

to the Govt,
of India- Ex-officio.
It was approved by the Specifications and Standards Commit-
tee
at its
meeting
held on the 28th May,
1981.
It was then approved
by
the
Executive
Committee
through
circulation and by the Council
in
its
meeting
held at Amritsar on
the 28th December, 1981.
2.1. Maintenance
operations
can
be
classified
in
three
groups:
(/)
Routine fnaintenance,
embracing work
items
such as filling of pot-
holes, and repairing of cracks which are required to be carried out by
the maintenance staff almost round the year;
(/7) Periodic maintenance,
covering more extensive maintenance opera-
tions such as
applying
a
seal
or
renewal coat which
are required
to be done periodically every few years; and
{Hi) Rehabilitation and strengthening,
which
refers
to major restoration
or upgrading of the pavement through reconstruction or applicatioa
of overlays to rectify structural deficiencies.
2.2. This Code of Practice deals
only with
the "routine" and
''periodic" maintenance
activities.
By
early
detection and repair
of defects at initial stages the
rapid
deterioration of
the pavement
can be prevented.
Such surveys and
evaluations should
be carried
out periodically
so
as
to
plan
necessary
preventive maintenance
measures.
Operations
falling
in the category of rehabilitation and
strengthening arc beyond the scope of this Code; for such operations,
reference may
be made either to IRC:37-1970
''Guidelines
for the
Design
of
Flexible
Pavements"
or
to
IRC:8I-1981
"Tentative
Guidelines
for Strengthening
of
Flexible
Road
Pavements
using
Benkelman Beam Deflection Technique."
2.3. Since
several
phases
are
involved
in
the maintenance
operations for bituminous
surfaces,
these
are
discussed separately
2. SCOPE

in subsequent sections.
In
brief,
Section
3
deals
vvitii the overall
approach to the
maintenance
planning
process and Section
4 with
the symptoms, causes and treatment of the
various types
of defects
commonly met with the
bituminous
surfaces.
Methods for repair-
ing the defects have been discussed in
Section
5.
Requirements of
periodic
renewals
are
covered
in
detail
in Section 6 and some
special problems of maintenance,
in
Section
7.
Last
four Sections
namely
8,
9,
10
and
11,
discuss the materials,
tools and plants,
arrangements for traffic and overall
organisation and management,
respectively.
3.
PLANNING OF MAINTENANCE OPEUATIONS
3.1. The first step to planning
of maintenance operation
is the
evaluation of the existing
pavement
in terms
of its physical condi-
tion, structural capacity, roughness etc.
For this purpose, condition
surveys may be undertaken for
the
visual assessment
of
the pave-
ment, which would cover not only the
type
but also the magnitude
of the distress and
its
location.
Apart from visual surveys, pavement
surface evaluation based
on riding quality (i.e. road roughness)
and
skid
resistance
should
also form the basis for taking maintenance decisions.
3.2. Necessary
information
about
the
routine
maintenance
needs
will
be
readily
available
as
the
maintenance
staflf
are
expected
to
be
continuously
in touch
with the physical condition
of the road.
However, for
periodic renewal requirements
or long-
term maintenance strategy, condition surveys carried
out at a fixed
frequency are a must.
Keeping
this
in view,
it
is desirable
that at
least two condition surveys are
conducted
on each
stretch of road
every year, one before and the other after the monsoon.
Generally
the condition
surveys
are
carried
out
from a vehicle
travelling at
a slow speed, supplemented
by mspection of the more critical
spots
on foot.
The data collected should be recorded
methodically
kilo-
meterwise.
It
is
desirable that these visual surveys are
carried
out
by an experienced engineer at a responsible
level.
3.3. Based
on
the
condition
evaluation,
the
causes for the
various defects observed should be examined in detail
as
discussed
in Section 4 and a decision taken whether to initiate a particular main-
tenance
activity,
defer
the
same,
or
to
go in for more detailed
investigations
to
determine
the
rehabilitation
needs
precisely.
Where
distress
on
the
pavement
has
reached
the stage of the
pot-hole which
affects
the smooth operation of trafiic,
it should be
rectified straightaway. For other defects like cracking, ravelling etc.
3



======================================================================
PAGE 8 of 60
======================================================================
IRC
: 82-1982
the optimal strategy
should
be
determined
having
regard
to
the
various factors involved
including
the
finances
available,
and
a
decision taken
whetlier to go
in
for temporary measures like seal/
renewal
coat
or
to
strengthen/reconstruct
the
pavement.
If the
latter
appears
necessary,
further
investigations
about
structural
deficiencies must be taken up as mentioned
in Clause 2.2.
In other
words the planning
of
the various maintenance
operations should
be
correlated and
looked
upon as a
total system rather than each
activity being considered
in isolation.
3.4.
Once the overall maintenance
plan has been drawn up,
attention
should be given
to the
proper organisalion and manage-
ment of the
whole
programme
including
deployment of
various
resources,
i.e.
men,
materials
and
equipment,
in an
efliicient
manner.
For each maintenance
activity the work at site should be
carefully
controlled
so that the optimum
output
and quality are
achieved.
4.
SYMPTOMS, CAUSES, AND TREATMENT OF DEFECTS
4.1.
General
4.1.1.
The types of defects in bituminous surfacing are group-
ed under four categories
:
(i) Surface
defects—^^Wxch
include
fatty
surfaces,
smooth
surfaces,
streaking, and hungry surfaces
;
(ii) CracA:^— under which hair-line cracks, alligator cracks, longitudinal
cracks, edge craclt^ shriiikage cracks, and reflection cracks are dealt
with
;
(iii) Deformation— undQT this are grouped slippage, rutting, corrugations,
shoving, shallow depressions, and settlements and upheavels
; and
(iv) Disintegration— cowering
stripping,
loss of
aggregates,
ravelling,
pot-holes, and edge breaking.
4.1.2.
This Section
describes
the
symptoms
and
causes of
these defects
and
indicates
the
possible
types of treatment. The
next
Section
gives
the
details of
specifications and construction
methods for each type of treatment.
4.1.3.
In each case of pavement
distress, the cause or causes
of
the
distress should
first be
determined.
It will be possible to
provide suitable maintenance measures
which
will not only correct
the damage
but also
prevent
or
delay
its
recurrence.
In many
situations,
lack of proper drainage
is the principal cause for stripp-
ing
loss of material from the pavement and shoulder, weakening of
the pavement
layers
and subgradc,
resulting
in the failure of the
4



======================================================================
PAGE 9 of 60
======================================================================
IRC
: 82-1982
pavement.
In
such situations,
the
cause
should
be completely
eliminated before taking any maintenance measure.
4.2.
Surface Defects
4.2. 1
.
General
: These are associated with the surfacing layers
and may be
due to
excessive
or
deficient quantities of bitumen in
these layers.
4.2.2.
Fatty surface
Symptoms
Fatty surface, Photo
1
results
when
the
bituminous
binder
moves upward in the surfacing and collects as a film on the surface.
The binder so collected becomes generally soft
in hot weather and
may be picked up and spread by the traffic. In cold or wet weather,
the surface is likely to be slippery and this can cause accidents.
Causes
The causes for a fatty surface are
:
(i) Excessive binder in a premix surfacing over-filling the voids.
(ii) Loss of cover aggregates in surface dressing.
(iii) Non-uniform
spreading of cover
aggregates in surface dressing.
(iv) Excessive application of binder in surface dressing.
(v) Poor
quality
oT
aggregates
leading
to their fracture, breakdown
and eventual
loss,
(vi) Graded
cover
aggregates
with
particles
so
small that they are
covered by the binder.
(vii) Too heavy a prime or a tack coat.
(viii) Excessively
heavy
axle loads
causing compression of a surfacing,
forcing the bitumen to the top.
Treatment
(i)
If the bleeding is fairly uniform and the
surface is free from irregu-
larities,
application of cover aggregates or
sand
(sand-blotting
or
sand-blinding)
would be successful.
The
aggregate or sand used
shall be of
small
size,
clean
and angular,
and may be heated,
if
necessary.
(ii) An open-graded
premix surfacing with a low bitumen
content can
absorb the excess binder.
(iii) A
liquid
seal coat,
with
special
care taken to select the rate of
application of
the binder and the quantity and size of cover aggre-
gates, can also
be effective.

======================================================================
IRC
: 82-1982
(iv) Special methods such as the burning of the excess binder.
(v)
In case of large areas of fatty surface having irregularities,
removal
of the affected layer in the area and replacing
it with a layer having
a properly designed mix, may be necessary.
4.2.3.
Smooth surface
Symptoms
A
smooth surface, Photo 2
has
a
very low
skid
resistance
value and becomes
very
slippery
when
wet.
Such
a
condition
invites hazards, especially on gradients, bends, and intersections.
Causes
A
primary
cause
for
a
smooth
surface
is the polishing of
aggregates
under
traffic.
Also
excessive
binder can result in a
smooth surface.
Treatment
The rectification consists of resurfacing with a
surface
dress-
ing course or a premix carpet.
Care should be taken to select hard
and angular aggregates which have proven non-polishing
character-
istics.
The carpet can be an open-graded mix.
A slurry seal can
also be used to impart anti-skidding texture.
4.2.4.
Streaking
Symptoms
Streaking
is characterised by the appearance of alternate lean
and heavy
lines
of
bitumen either in longitudinal. Photo 3
or in
transverse direction.
Causes
Longitudinal
streaking
results
when
alternate
longitudinal
strips of surface contain different quantities of bitumen due to
non-
uniform application of bitumen
across
the surface.
Some of the
more common
causes
of
this
type of
streaking
are
mechanical
faults, improper
or
poor
adjustment
and
careless
operation of
bitumen
distributors.
These
streaks
can
also
be
formed as a
result of applying the bituminous binder at too low a
temperature
;
a temperature
at
which
bitumen
is
not
fluid enough to fan out
properly from the nozzles on the spray bars.
All these causes
can
result
in
transverse
streaking
also.
Transverse streaking may also be caused by
spurts in
the bitumen

spray from the distribution spray bar.
These could be
a
result of
mechanical faults in the
distributor.
Transverse
streaking
may
result in corrugation in the pavement surface.
Treatment
The satisfactory repair for longitudinal and transverse
strcaK-
ing
is to remove the streaked surface
and
apply
a
new
surface
treatment.
It
is
always
desirable
to
prevent
longitudinal
and
transverse streaking
than
to
coirect
it.
Whenever mechanical
equipment
is used
for spraying of
bitumen,
manufacturer's
reco-
mmendations
of
the
bitumen
distributor
should
be
carefully
adhered
to.
4.2.5-
Hungry Surface
Symptoms
Hungry surface
is characterised
by
the
loss
of
aggregates
from the surface or the appearance of fine cracks, Photo 4.
Causes
One of the reasons for
hungry
surface
is
the
use
of lest
bitumen
in
the
surfacing.
Sometimes
this
condition may also
appear due to use of absorptive aggregates in the surfacing.
Treatment
A slurry seal may be used as a repair measure.
It
is applieo
in an average thickness of 2 — 5 mm.
As an emergency repair, a fog seal may be used.
4.3.
Cracks
4.3.1.
General
:
A common defect in bituminous surfaces
is
the formation of cracks.
The crack
pattern
can, in many cases,
indicate the cause of the defect.
As soon as cracks
are
observed,
it
is necessary to study the pattern
in detail
so as to
arrive at the
cause;
Immediate
remedial
action
should
be
taken thereafter
because of the danger of ingress of water through the cracks and of
the formation
of pot-holes
and
ravelling.
Cracks
can hardly be
observed from moving vehicles
and
inspection
on
foot is always
desirable.
The common types of cracks
are
discussed
briefly
in
the following clauses.
11



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 60
======================================================================
IRC
: 82-1982
4.3.2.
Hair-line crack
Symptoms
These appear as short and fine
cracks
at
close intervals on
the surface. Photo
5.
Causes
These cracks are caused by
:
(i)
Insufficient bitumen content.
(ii) Excessive filler at the surface.
(iii) Improper compaction— over-compaction,
compaction
when
the
supporting layer was unstable, or compaction of too hot a mixture.
4.3.3.
Alligator crack
Symptoms
These appear as interconnected cracks
forming
a
series
of
small blocks which resemble the skin of an
alligator. Photo 6.
Causes
Alligator cracks are due to
one
or
more
of
the
following
factors
:
(i) Excessive deflection of the surface
over
unstable
subgrade,
sub-
base or base of the pavement, particularly in the wheel tracks.
The
unstable conditions in the subgrade or lower
layers
of
the
pave-
ment might have arisen from saturation.
(ii) Excessive overloads by
heavy
vehicles
or
inadequate
pavement
thickness, or both.
(iii)
Brittleness of the binder either due to ageing
of binder
or
initial
over-heating might cause fine cracks of the
alligator
pattern,
but
there will be no deflection of the surface.
These cracks
are
some-
times called 'crazing'.
4.3.4.
Longitudinal crack
Symptoms
These cracks appear, more or less, on
a
straight line,
along
the road.
These cracks may appear either
at
the
joint
between
the pavement and the shoulder, or at the joint
between two paving
lanes. Photo 7.
Causes
(i) The cracking at the pavement-shoulder joint may be
due
to
alter-
nate wetting and drying beneath the shoulder surface owing to poor
12



======================================================================
PAGE 17 of 60
======================================================================
IRC: 82-1982
drainage
or due to depressions in the pavement edge
which
allow
water to stand and seep through the joint.
Shoulder settlement or
trucks passing over the joint, may also cause these cracks.
(ii) The lane joint crack is caused by a weak
joint
between
adjoining
spreads in the layers of the
pavement
Differential
frost
heave
along the centre line may also be one of the causes.
4.3.5.
Edge crack
Symptoms
Edge cracks are formed parallel to
the
outer
edge
of
the
pavement usually 0.3 — 0.5 m inside from the
edge, Photo
8.
At
times some transverse cracks are seen to branch out
from the edge
cracks towards the shoulder.
Causes
These cracks are caused by
:
(i) Lack of literal support from the shoulder.
(ii) Settlement or yielding of the underlying material.
(iii) Inadequate surface drainage, especially during flooding conditions.
(iv) Shrinkage due to drying out
of
the surrounding
earth,
generally
caused by roots of trees or bushes
close
to
the
pavement
edge.
Highly expansive soils are particularly
prone
to
shrinkage
when
moisture dries out.
(v) Frost lieavc.
(vi) Inadequate pavement width forcing traftic too close
to
inc edge of
the pavement.
(vii) Non-provision of extra width of pavement on curves.
4.3.6.
Shrinkage crack
Symptoms
These are cracks appearing in the transverse
direction,
or as
interconnected cracks forming a
series
of
large
blocks,
Photo
9.
The
pavement itself appears to have
suffered
no
deterioration
or
deformation, but
it is the top surfacing that seems
to
liave
become
old and cracked.
Cause
The primary cause for such
cracks
is
the
shrinkage
of
the
bituminous layer itself with age.
The bituminous
binder loses
its
ductility as
it ages and becomes brittle.

4.3.7.
Reflection crack
Symptoms
Reflection cracks are the sympathetic cracks
that
appear
in
the bituminous surfacing over
joints
and
cracks in the pavement
underneath. Photo
10.
The pattern may be longitudinal, transverse,
diagonal or block. They occur most frequently in overlays on cement
concrete pavements or on cement-soil bases.
They may also occur
in overlays or surfacings on flexible pavements where cracks in
the
old pavement have not been properly repaired.
Another condition
under which reflection
cracks
can
occur
is when
a pavement
is
widened and the entire pavement
is surfaced.
The location of the
crack will then be exactly on the junction between the old pavement
and the widened strip.
In some cases reflection
cracks
are
merely
unsightly,
but
frequently
they
deteriorate
and
the
riding
quality
of
road
is
affected.
These cracks can
allow
water to
enter the underlying
pavement and the subgrade and cause further damage.
Cause
Reflection cracks are due to joints and cracks in the pavement
layer underneath.
4.3.8.
Treatment
The treatment,
for
all
types
of
cracks
discussed
above,
would
depend
on
whether
the
pavement
remains
structurally
sound, or has become distorted or unsound.
In case the pavement remains
structurally
sound,
then
the
cracks
should
be
filled
with
a
bituminous binder having a
low
viscosity so that
it can be poured and worked into the cracks.
Cut-
back bitumen
and
emulsions
are generally
suitable.
All loose
materials are
removed
from
the
cracks
with
brooms
and,
if
necessary, with compressed air jetting.
The binder is poured with
a pouring can and a hand squeegee
is used to assist the penetration
of the binder into the cracks.
Light sanding of
the
cracks
is then
done to prevent traffic picking up the binder.
If the cracks are wide enough a slurry seal or sand bituminous
premix patching can be used to
fill the cracks.
If the cracks are fine (crazing) and
extend
over
large
areas,
a
ligiit cut-back or an emulsified bitumen (fog seal) can be broomed

binder by the traffic.
4.4.
Deformation
4.4.1.
General
:
Any change in the shape of the
pavement
from
its original shape
is a deformation.
It may be associated with
slippage, rutting,
etc., discussed below.
The
treatment
measures
aim at the removal of the cause, and bringing
it to the original level
by
fill material or by removing
the
entire
aflfected part and repla-
cing
it with new material.
4.4.2.
Slippage
Symptoms
Slippage
IS the relative
movement
between
the surface layer
and the layer beneath.
It
is characterised
by
the
formation of
crescent-shaped cracks that point in
the
direction
of the thrust of
the
wheels
on
the
pavement
surface, Photo
11.
This does
not
mean that
tlie cracks invariably point
in the direction
the
trafiic
is
going.
For example,
if brakes are applied on a vehicle going down
a
hill the thrust of the wheels will be
pointing
uphill.
The
craCks
in this case will, therefore, point uphill.
Causes
Slippage is caused by
:
(i) Unusual thrust of wheels in a particular direction.
(ii) Omission or inadequacy of tack coat or prime coat.
(iii) Lack of bond between the surface and the lower
course caused by a
layer of finx dust, moisture or both.
(iv) Failure of bond between two layers due to
excessive
deflection
oi
the pavement.
Treatment
Rectification consists
oi removing the
surface
layer
around
the area affected upto the
point
where
good
bond between
the
surfacing and the layer underneath exists and
patching
the
area
with prcmix material aficr a
tack
coat.
4.4.3.
Rutting
Symptoms
Rutting
is a longitudinal depression
or
groove m
the wheel
tracks, Photo
12. The ruts are usually of the width of a wheel
path.
19



======================================================================
PAGE 24 of 60
======================================================================
IRC
: 82-1982
Swerving from a rutted wheel path at high speed can be
dangerous.
Accumulation
of
water
in the depressions can cause skidding.
If
rutting
is accompained by adjacent bulging,
it may be a sign of sub-
grade movement or weak pavement.
Causes
The causes of rutting are
the
following
:
(i) Heavy channelised traffic
.
(ii) Inadequate compaction of the mix at the surface or
in
the
under-
lying courses during construction,
(iii) Improper mix design, lacking in stability of
the mix to support the
traffic and leading to plastic movement laterally under
traffic.
(iv) Weak pavement.
(v) Incidence of high stress caused by heavy bullock-cart traffic.
(vi)
Intrusion of subgrade clay into base course.
(vii) Aggregates of surface dressing being pressed into the lower support-
ing bituminous layer.
Treatment
The rectification consists of filling with premix open-graded or
dense-graded patching materials and
compacting
to
the
desired
levels.
The limits of the depression are
first
determined
with a
string line and marked on the surface.
After applying
a
suitable
tack coat, the premix
is spread and compacted.
Detailed procedure
for premix patching
is given in Section
5.
Situations indicative of shear failure
or
subgrade
movement
generally require excavation.
The job should be carefully assessed.
The area to be opened up should as far as possible
be
limited
to
that which can be completed and made safe in a day's working.
4.4.4.
Corrugation
Symptoms
Corrugation
is the formation
of
fairly
regular
undulations
(ripples) across the bituminous surface, Photo
13.
They are usually
shallow (about 25 mm) and are different from the larger depressions
caused by weakness in the lower layers of the pavement or the sub-
grade.
The spacing of the waves
is around 3 m.
The corrugations
can be a source of discomfort to the motorists and
can
become
a
hazard
if allowed to become severe.
20



======================================================================
PAGE 25 of 60
======================================================================
IRC
: 82-1982
Causes
Corrugations are due to the following causes
:
(i) Lack of stability in the mix (excessive binder,
high
proportion
of
fines, too round or too smooth textured coarse
or.
fine
aggregate,
too soft a binder).
(ii) Oscillations set up by the
vehicle
springs
can
cause
alternative
valleys and ridges.
(iii) Faulty laying of surface course.
Treatment
If the
surface
is thin, the same
is
scarified,
including
some
portions of the
underlying
water-bound
macadam base, and
the
scarified material
is recompacted.
A new
surfacing layer
is then
laid.
Cutting of high spots with a blade with or without heating and
addition of levelling course materials can also be resorted to.
Spreading of sand bituminous premix
with
a
drag
spreader
with
its blade
adjusted
to just clear the high spots can also be an
effective way
to make
up
the
corrugations.
The
area
is
then
thoroughly rolled.
4.4.5.
Shoving
Symptoms
Shoving is a
form
of
plastic
movement
within
the
layer
resulting in localised bulging
of the
pavement
surface,
Photo
14.
Shoving occurs characteristically
at points where traffic
starts
and
stops
(intersections,
busy
bus-stops), on hills where vehicles acce-
lerate or brake on grades and on sharp curves.
The first indication
of
shoving
is
the
formation
of slippage cracks which are crescent
shaped cracks with the apex of the crack pointing
in
the
direction
of the shove.
Causes
Shoving can be caused by
:
(i) Lack of stability in the mix (excessive binder,
high
proportion
of
fines, too soft a binder) in the surface or base course.
(ii) Lack of bond between bituminous surface and underlying layer.
(iii) Heavy traffic movement of a
start
and
stop
type
or
involving
negotiation of curves and gradients.
(iv) Use of non-v olatile oil on roller wheels.
21



======================================================================
PAGE 26 of 60
======================================================================
IRC
: 82-1982
Treatment
The rectification consists of
removing
the
material
in
the
affected area down
to
a
firm
base
and
laying a stable premix
patch.
4.4.6.
Shallow depression
Symptoms
Shallow depressions arc localised
low
areas of
limited size,
dipping about 25 mm
or
more
below
the
desired profile, where
water will normally
collect, Photo
15.
The
depressions may
or
may not be accompanied by cracking.
If not rectified in time, they
may lead to further deterioration of the surface and cause
discom-
fort to traffic.
Cause
Shallow
depressions
are
caused
by
the
settlement of lower
pavement
layers
due
to
a
pocket
of
inadequately
compacted
subgradc or pavement layers.
Treatment
Shallow
depressions
are
made
up
by
filling
with premix
materials, open-graded
or
dense-graded,
and
compacting
to
the
desired profile as the surrounding pavement.
4.4.7. Settlement and upheaval
Symptoms
Setlemenis and
upheavals
arc
characterised by
large defor-
mations of the pavement, Photos
16 and
17.
They
are
extremely
uncomfortable to traffic and cause serious reduction
in speed. They
arc generally followed by extensive cracks in the pavement
surface
in the affected region.
Causes
The follovviDg are the causes for settlements and upheavals:
(i) Inadequate compaction
ol
the
fill at locations behind bridge abut-
ment*!, over utility cuts, etc.
(ii) Excessive
moisture
in
subgradc
and
permeable
layer of sub-base
and base caused by capillary action or poor drainage.
(iii) Inadequate pavement thickness.
(iv) Frost heave conditions.
22



======================================================================
PAGE 27 of 60
======================================================================
IRC
: 82-1982
Treatment
If settlements
and
upheavals
indicate
an inherent weakness
in the
fill,
it may be necessary to excavate
the defective
fill and do
the
embankment
afresh
under
properly
controlled
conditions.
Material
having
good
drainage
qualities
should
be
preferred.
Under-drains may
become
necessary
in
locations
where lack of
drainage has been
identified
as
the
cause of failure.
Where the
cause
of
deformation
is
inadequate
pavement
thickness,
then
properly
designed
pavement
shall
be
provided.
Frost-affected
regions may need
thorough
investigations
and
a complete recons-
truction of the pavement.
4.5. Disintegration
4.5.1. General
:
There are some defects which
if not
rectified
immediately,
result in the disintegration of the pavement into small,
loose
fragments.
Disintegration,
if
not, arrested
in
the
early
stages, may necessitate complete rebuilding of the pavement.
4.5.2.
Stripping
Symptoms
This
defect
is
characterised
by
the
separation of bitumen
adhering to the surfaces of the
aggregate particles,
in the presence
of moisture, Photo
18.
This may lead to
loss of bond and
subse-
quently to loss of strength and materials from the surface.
Causes
Stripping may be caused by the following
:
(i) Use of hydrophilic aggregates.
(ii) Inadequate mix composition.
(iii) Continuous contact of water with the coated aggregate.
(iv)
Initial over-heating of the binder or the aggregate or both.
(v) Presence of dust or moisture on aggregate when
it
comes in contact
with the bitumen.
(vi)
In the case of surface
dressing,
poor
bond with the surface existing
below,
delay
in
spreading
the
cover
aggregate
over
the sprayed
bitumen, or insufficient compaction.
(vii) Occurrence of rain or dust storm immediately after the construction
(viii) Opening
tlie road to fast
traffic before the binder has set.
(ix) Concentration of
soil
salt in
rain water coming in contact with the
coated aggregate.
23



======================================================================
PAGE 28 of 60
======================================================================
IRC
: 82-1982
(x) Use of improper grade of bitumen.
(xi) Ageing
of
the
bitumen
leading
to the cmbrittlemcnt of the binder
film.
Treatment
In the case of surface
dressing,
hot coarse sand
heated to at
least 150°C and spread
over
the
affected
areas, may
be
used to
replace the lost
aggregates.
After
spreading,
it
should
be rolled
immediately so that
it will be seated into the bitumen.
If
aggregates
are only partially whipped off, a liquid seal may be the
solution.
In other cases the existing bituminous mix should be removed
and a
fresh
one
laid.
As
a
precautionary
measure,
a suitable
anti-stripping agent should
be
added
to
the
bitumen, at the time
of construction.
^
4.5.3. Loss of aggregate
Symptoms
Loss of aggregate occurs in surfaces which have been provided
with surface dressing.
The
surface
presents
a rough appearance,
with
some
portions
having
aggregates
intact
and
others
| where
aggregates have been lost, Photo
19-
Causes
The
loss
of
aggregates
can
occur
due
to
the
folljowing
causes
:
I
(i) Ageing and hardening (oxidation) of the binder whereby itsaflhesive
property
is lost.
\
(ii) Stripping
of
binder
from
aggregates
due
to
cold or wet weather
before, during or soon after surface dressing.
(iii) Wet or dusty aggregate to which binder has not adhered.
(iv)
Insufficient
binder
for
the
size
of the
aggregate
used or
for^ the
existing absorptive surface.
(V) Aggregate having no affinity to the binder.
(vi)
Insufficient rolling before opening to
traffic.
(vii) Fast traffic over new work whipping off the aggregates.
(viii) Cold-spraying of bitumen
or
delaying
the spreading of aggregate
over sprayed bitumen.
Treatment
If the loss
of
aggregates
is
due
to ageing and hardening ol
the binder, the condition may
be
rectified by applying
liquid seal,
fog seal or slurry seal.

If the loSs of aggregates has occurred over large isolated areas,
the best thing to do would
be to
provide
another surface dressing
layer, after carefully cleaning the surface.
If the
loss
of
aggregates
has taken
place
in
small isolated
patches a liquid seal would be sufficient.
4.5.4.
Ravelling
Symptoms
Ravelling
is generally associated
with
premixed
bituminous
layers.
It
is characterised by the
progressive disintegration of the
surface
due
to
the
failure
of
the
binder
to
hold
the materials
together.
The ravelling
process generally
starts from the
surface
downwards or from edge inward.
It
usually
begins with the blow-
ing off
of
the fine aggregates leaving
behind
pock
marks
on the
surface. When larger particles
are broken
free, the surface appears
eroded, Photo 20.
Causes
Ravelling
is due to one or more of the following reasons
:
(i) Inadequate compact'on during construction.
(ii) Construction
during
wet
weather
leading
to stripping of binder
from aggregates.
(iii) Construction
during
cold weather resulting in non-uniform binder
film.
(iv) Use of inferior quality
aggregate resulting in
fracture, crushing and
opening of new faces.
(v)
Insufficient binder in
the mix.
(vi) Ageing of
binder
leading to
brittle
fracture and disintegration of
pavement.
(vii) Excessively open graded mix.
(viii) Poor compatibility of binder and aggregate.
(ix) Over-heating of mix or the binder.
(x) Improper coating of aggregates by
binder.
Treatment
Ravelled
surface
is corrected
by
adding
more quantity of
binder,
the
rate
of
application
depending
upon the condition of
existing
surface
and
degree of hardening
occurred to the binder.
If the ravelling
has
not developed
too
far,
the condition may be
corrected
by a simple
application
of a
cut-back bitumen covered
with
coarse sand, or
a slurry seal
can be
applied.
Where
the
29



======================================================================
PAGE 34 of 60
======================================================================
IRC
: 82-1982
ravelling has progressed
far, a renewal
coat with
premix material
would be necessary.
4.5.5.
Pot-hole
Symptoms
Pot-holes
are bowl-shaped
holes of
varying sizes in a surface
layer or extending into the
base course caused by localised disinte-
gration of material, Photo 21.
They usually appear after rain.
Causes
(i) The
most
common
cause of
pot-hole
formation is the ingress of
water
into the
pavement through the
surfacing
course.
This can
happen if the
surfacing is open-textured
and lacks proper camber.
Water can enter the
pavement also through
the
cracks in the bitu-
minous surface.
The pavement gets softened
as a result, and under
the action of traffic a depression
soon
gets
formed.
This is aggra-
vated by use of plastic filler in WBM.
If not attended to properly,
the aggregates
in
the
surface
get
progressively
loosened
and a
regular pot-hole forms.
(ii) Lack
of
proper
bond
between
the bituminous surfacing and the
underlying water bound
macadam
base
can
also cause pot-holes.
The
bond
is
usually
supplied
by a tack
coat, and any localised
inadequacies in these applications can cause pot-holes.
(iii)
Insufficient
bitumen
content
in
localised
areas
of
the
surfacing
layer can cause pot-holes.
(iv) Too thin a bituminous
surface
which
is
unable to
withstand the
heavy traffic can also cause
pot-holes, when associated with impro-
per or inadequate camber.
(v)
In dense-graded
mixtures,
pot-holes
can
be
caused by
too much
fines or too few fines.
Treatment
The rectification consists of filling pot-holes with premix open-
graded or dense-graded patching, or penetration patching.
4.5.6.
Edge-breaking
(Frayed^edges)
Symptoms
A common
defect
in
bituminous
surfaced
roads
is
edge
breaking. The edge
of
the
bituminous surface gets
broken
in an
irregular way. Photo 22, and
if not remedied in time,
the
surfacing
may peel
off in large chunks at the edges.
30



======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 60
======================================================================
IRC
: 82-1982
Causes
The following are the causes for edge breaking
:
(i)
Infiltration
of
water
which
softens the foundation layers causing
the pavement edges to break.
(ii) Worn out shoulders
resulting
in
insufficient
side
support to the
pavement.
(iii) Inadequate strength at the edge of the
pavement due to inadequate
compaction.
(iv) Lower layer of pavement not being wider than upper layer.
Treatment
The shoulder and the pavement material
in the
affected area
should be entirely removed
to a regular section
with vertical sides.
The pavement and the shoulders should
be built up simultaneously
with thorough compaction. A bituminous surface
similar
to that
in
the adjacent reach should be
laid.
The shoulder should have ade-
quate slope to
drain away the
water. A slope one per cent
steeper
than the camber of the bituminous surface should be
found
gene-
rally necessary for earthen shoulders.
In order to prevent the edges
from
getting
broken
again,
the
maintenance
operations
should
include periodic inspection
of
the shoulder
condition and replace-
ment of worn out shoulder
material with adequate compaction.
In
sandy areas where the soil
is
likely to
be eroded by wind and rain,
it may be advantageous to have brick paving at least for some width
to protect the
edges.
Surface
and
subsurface
drainage,
wherever
deficient, should be improved.
5.
METHODS FOR REPAIRING THE DEFECTS
5.1.
General
5.1.1.
The previous Sections have dealt with the identification
of the affected area, type of defect and
its cause, and the maintena-
nce measure to be taken in each case.
This Section describes each
of the various maintenance operations which remain grouped under
'Routine
Maintenance',
in
Section
2
of
this
Code
of^
practice.
Maintenance
operations
of
a
periodic
nature
are
discussed
in
Section
6.
5.1.2.
The repair methods discussed in this section
generally
fall under two
categories:
(i)
Seal
Coat,
and
(ij)
Patching.
The
seal coat,
is a single, thin application of bitumen which may or may
not be
covered
with
aggregate.
Patching
is
the
application
of
bituminous materials either premixed or penetration macadam type,
31



======================================================================
PAGE 36 of 60
======================================================================
IRC
: 82-1982
and
is resorted to for filling
pot-holes, shallow
depressions,
rutting

irregularities.
Patchi ig when
used
for
filling
the
ruts
and depressions, can also be termed as
"levelling'*.
5.2.
Liquid Seal
5.2.1
Description
:
Liquid
seal
consists
of an
application
of liquid bitumen (penetration grade, cut-back
or an emulsion) and
covering
the
same
with agggregate.
This
is
applicable
for
the
rectification of fatty
surfaces,
stripping,
loss
of
aggregates,
and
ravelling.
5.2.2.
Materials
:
Penetration grade bitumen should
be
of
suitable grade.
A cold application cut-back such as RC-3 or MC-3
is also suitable.
If emulsion
is to be used,
it should be of the rapid
setting type.
The quantity of binder shall be as follows
:
Binder
Quantity for 10 sq. m
(kg.)
1.
Penetration grade bitumen
9.8
2.
Cold application cut-back, RC-3 or MC-3
9.8
(Quantity in terms of penetration grade
bitumen)
3.
Emulsion, RS
10—12
The cover aggregates should be of a nominal
size of 6.3 mm,
viz.
passing
through
10 mm
IS Sieve and retained
on
2.36 mm
IS Sieve.
The quantity of cover
aggregate
should
be
0.09 cu. m.
per 10 sq. m.
5.2.3.
Construction method
:
The area to be treated shall be
thoroughly cleaned.
If penetration grade or cut-back bitumen
is
to
be used, the
wet
areas should
be
allowed
to
dry.
However,
if
emulsified
bitumen
is
to
be
used,
the
surface
requires
to
be
dampened. But such patching with emulsified bitumen should not be
done when
it
is raining.
The binder
is applied either Dy a spray nozzle or,
only
where
permitted, by pouring pots at the appropriate temperature and rate.
Cover aggregates are then spread at the
specified
rate
and
rolled
in position with a 6-8 tonne steel wheel
roller.
When
penetration
grade bitumen
is used, the road can be
opened
to
traffic
on
the
following day
or if required to
be
opened
immediately,
a
speed
restriction of
16
km/h
shall be
enforced
till
the
following
day.
When cut-back bitumen
is used, the finished surface shall
be closed

to traffic until
it has sufficiently cured to hold
the
cover
aggregate
in position.
If emulsion
is used, the road can be opened
to
traffic
after 4-6 hours.
5.3.
Fog Seal
5.3.1.
Description
: Fog seal is a light application of emulsi-
fied bitumen, usually without a cover aggregate.
It
is used
to
in-
crease the binder content of bituminous surfaces, rejuvenate
oxidi-
sed and old surfaces,
fill in cracks and
prevent
ravelling.
It
can
also
be
used
as
an
emergency
treatment
measure
for
hungry
surfaces.
5.3.2.
Construction method
: The bituminous binder
is a slow
setting emulsion.
The emulsion
is diluted with an equal amount of
water and sprayed at the rate of
0.5— 1.0
litre/sq. m
(of
diluted
material) depending upon the texture and dryness of the old
pave-
ment. The seal sets in about 30 minutes. The traffic can be allowed
on the area after the seal has set to a firm condition so that
it
is not
pickcd-up by the traffic.
5.4.
Slurry Seal
5.4.1.
Description:
Slurry seal
is a mixture of fine aggregates,
mineral
filler and emulsified bitumen with water added
to
achieve
slurry consistency.
The ingredients are mixed and
spread
evenly
on to bituminous surfaces to
fill cracks,
repair
ravelled pavements,
smooth or hungry surfaces,
rectify
loss
of
aggregates,
rejuvenate
oxidised and open-textured old bituminous surfaces, and to
provide
a skid resistant surface.
5.4.2.
Materials
: The aggregate gradation
is very important.
The following grading is found suitable
:
Gradation of aggregates for slurry seal
Sieve designation
Per cent by weight passing the sieve
4.75 mm
100
2.36 mm
80-100
1.18 mm
50-90
300 micron
15-50
150 micron
10-25
75 micron
3-10
In order to obtain the above
gradation,
fine
grit,
sand
and
filler can be mixed in suitable proportions.
33



======================================================================
PAGE 38 of 60
======================================================================
IRC
: 82-1982
The binder
is
a
slow-setting
emulsified
bitumen.
The mix
has to be designed to have a consistency such that the slurry
when
spread, would flow in a wave approximately half a metre
ahead
of
the
strike-off squeegee.
This would ensure that the
slurry
would
not bridge over the cracks without
filling
them.
About
18-20
per
cent emulsion and 10-12 per cent of water by weight of
the
aggre-
gates would approximately make a satisfactory mix.
5.4.3.
Construction method
:
The area
is thoroughly cleaned
after carrying out patching where necessary, and
a tack
coat
con-
sisting of a light application of bitumen emulsion
diluted with three
parts of water is applied at the rate of
2.5—3.5
kg/10
sq.m.
The
slurry seal can be mixed by a continuous machine or a
batch
type
unit.
For smaller works batch type unit
is
preferable.
Measured
quantity of aggregate
is taken
in
the
slurry
mixer.
Water
for
pore-wetting
is mixed with the aggregates.
Bitumen emulsion
is
added to the mixer and
the slurry
is then spread on the road.
The
slurry may be spread and forced into voids
by hand squeegees
or
spreader boxes.
Spreader boxes are suitable
for controlled laying.
The slurry
is laid at an approximate coverage
rate of
200
sq. m.
per tonne giving a thickness
of
about
2 to 5 mm.
No rolling is
required.
The traffic can be
allowed
on the area
after the slurry
seal has set to a firm condition so that the mixture
is not picked-up
by the traffic.
5.5.
Sand Bituminous Premix Patching
5.5.1.
Description
:
Sand
bituminous
premix
patching
consists of laying a mixture of fine aggregate and bituminous binder
to rectify cracks, slippage, corrugations,
shoving,
shallow
depre-
ssions and ravelling.
The fine aggregate shall be a medium coarse
sand (fineness modulus of more
than
2.5)
or
fine
grit
passing
1.70 mm IS Sieve and retained on 180-micron IS Sieve. The binder
can be a paving bitumen of suitable penetration grade, rapid curing
cut-back
such
as
RC-3,
or
a
medium curing cut-back
such
as
MC-3.
5.5.2.
Construction
method
:
The
area
is
thoroughly
cleaned and a tack coat with penetration grade
bitumen,

The mix
is prepared in
suitable mechanical or hand-operated mixers by mixing binder and
sand.
The quantity of sand
and
binder shall
be 0.06 cu. m. and

Description
:
Premix open-graded patching consists of
making up the area to be patched by a premix open-graded material
consisting of a binder and
aggregates,
compacting
and

area
is
first defined by a string line
and
marked;
the area
upto
at least 0.3 m beyond the marked area on
all
sides
is
thoroughly
cleared.
A tack coat
is applied on the uneven
area and
then the
patching material
is applied.
For rectifying pot-hole, the edges of
the hole are squared and
the
hole
cut
to
solid
material
with
vertical edges, before applying the tack coat and patching material.
The surface
is allowed to
dry
if it
is wet
and
the work
is
to
be
done by penetration grade bitumen
or
cut-back.
If a bituminous
emulsion
is used, slight dampness
is required.
Patching of perma-
nent nature should be allowed only when
it
is
not
raining.
How-
ever,
if it
is raining continuously, as
an
emergency
measure, pot-
holes can be temporarily filled with stone or
brick
ballast laid and
compacted to WBM specifications using non-plastic filler,
till
such
time when regular maintenance measures
can
be
taken.
If
an
emulsion
is used the tack
coat
is
not
applied
earlier
than
ten
minutes before laying the premix.
A mechanical mixer
should be
preferred.
A drier unit for the aggregates will be an added advant-
age.
For use with cold application cut-back and emulsion, a power
mixer should be
preferred.
If no
power
mixers
are
available,
mixing for
small
size
jobs
can
be
done in hand operated drum
mixers.
For
still smaller jobs, hand mixing
by
shovels on a plat-
form can be resorted to.
When using
a
cold application cut-back,
the premix should be prepared at
least
3
days in advance of use.
If necessary such a mixture can be
stock-piled
and covered with a
tarpaulin
and stored for 2-3
weeks.
The patch
is
filled with the
prepared premix, care
being
taken
to
see that
filling
is done in
layers not exceeding 40 mm
thickness.
Each layer
is compacted
thoroughly either by rolling using a roller
or
a
truck wheel or by
means of vibratory tampers.
The final surface
should be
sealed
with
a
liquid
seal
coat
as
per
Clause
5,2.
in
areas
having
rainfall of over 150 cm per year or with a
premix
seal coat as per
Clause 5.5. in areas having rainfall of under
150 cm per year.
The
resultant surface shall conform to
the adjacent
levels.
Humping
for compaction by traffic should not be allowed.

Premix Dense-graded Patching
5.7.1.
Description
: Premix dense-graded patching consists of
making up the area
to
be
patched
by
a
dense-graded
premix
material consisting of a binder, aggregates and filler, compacting and
finishing.
This
is a high quality, thoroughly controlled hot mixture
for which the mix design
is to
be
invariably got
done
before the
start of the work in a suitably equipped
laboratory.
For existing
superior types of surfaces, the use of this type of
patching may be
considered.
This type of
patching
can
be
used
for
repairing
slippage, rutting, shoving, shallow depressions, or pot-holes.

the same as for the earlier mix.
5.7.4. Construction method
: The area
to be patched should
be
thoroughly cleaned.
For rectifying unevenness,
the uneven area
is
first defined
by
a
string
line and marked;
the area upto at
least
0.3 m beyond the marked area on all sides
is tliorougiiiy cleared. A
tack coat
is
applied
at
the
rate
of
7.5
kg
per
10 sq.
m. on the
uneven area and then the patching material
is
applied.
For
recti-
fying pot-hole, the edges of the hole
are
squared
and the hole cut
lo solid material with vertical edges, before
applying
the
tack coat
and patching material.
The
surface
is allowed
to dry,
if it is wet.
Patching work of permanent nature
shall be
allowed
only when
it
is not raining.

can
be
temporarily filled with
stone or
brick ballast laid and compacted to WBM
specifications using non

till such time when regular
maintenance measures can
be taken.
The mixing shall be done in a
hot
mix plant.
A small
capacity
portable
hot
mix
plant will be very convenient
for small
patching jobs.
The
patch
is
filled
with
the
prepared mix,
care
being taken to see that filling is done in layers not exceeding 40 mm
thickness.
Each
layer is compacted thoroughly either by
rollers or
by means of vibratory tampers
before
the
mix cools below 100°C.
The
resultant
surface
shall
conform
to
the
adjacent
levels.
Humping for compaction by traffic should not be allowed.
Adequ-
ate quality control shall be exercised
at
every stage of the work as
per IRC:29-1968 and IRC Special Publication:
11-1977.
5.8. Penetration Patching
5.8.1. Description: Penetration patching
consists of making up
the area to be patched by
a
course
of
aggregates, compacting the
same, applying bitumen and key
aggregates
and
finishing
off with
a
seal
coat.
The
patch
is
used
for
surface
disintegration over
12 mm deep.
The patching may
be
done in layers, but the depth
of the individual layers should not exceed 50 mm.
Although
it is known from experience that penetration patching
does not produce as good a patch as premix material due
to lack of
accurate control of the
amount
of bitumen to be used, emergency
patches of this type may be necessary as a last resort in the absence
of premix
material.
Hence use
of
penetration
patch
should
be
very
limited.
5.8.2. Materials
:
The course aggregates
should
conform
to
the following grading requirements:

it
shall be as per Clause 5.2.2.
and for a premix seal coat,
it shall be as per Clause 5.5,
The gradation
and
quantities of the
materials shall be modi-
fied depending on the thickness of the layers to be achieved.
5.8.3.
Construction method
: The area to be patched should be
thoroughly cleaned. If it
is a pot-hole, the
edges of the
hole should
be squared and the hole cut to solid
material
with
vertical
edges.
All loose materials are removed.
The surface
should
be
allowed
to dry
if it
is wet.
Patching of permanent
nature
shall
be
done
only if the weather
is dry and free from
dust
storm.
Ho wever
if
it is raining continuously, as an emergency measure,
pot-holes
can
be temporarily filled with stone or brick ballast laid and compacted
to WBM specifications using non-plastic filler,
till such
time
when
regular maintenance measures can
be
taken.

bitumen
is applied over the sides and bottom of
the
hole and
mc
entire area to be patched
at
the
rate
specified
in
Clause
5.8.2.
Coarse aggregates conforming to gradation and quantities
specified
in Clause 5.8.2. are spread.
The aggregates are
dry
rolled
either
by a
steel
wheel
roller
or
a
vibratory
compactor.
Bituminous
binder
is then applied at the appropriate
temperature
either
by
a
nozzle or, only where permitted, by pouring pots, at the
rate
speci-
fied in Clause 5.8.2.
Immediately, thereafter key
aggregates
con-
forming to gradation and quantities
specified
in
Clause
5.8.2.
are
spread uniformly and rolled into position.
The final surface should
be sealed with a liquid seal coat as per Clause
5.2. in
areas
having
rainfall of over 150 cm per year or with a prcmix
seal
coat
as
per
Clause 5.5. in areas having rainfall of under 150 cm per year.
The
resultant surface shall conform
to
the
adjacent
levels.
Humping
for compaction by traffic should not be allowed.
Care should be taken to see that excessive amount of bitumen
is not used as this causes the patch to shove and become
rough,
to
bleed or to be slippery when wet. Also too small amount of bitumen
will cause the patch to ravel.
Penetration patches should be check-
ed frequently.
If found to be ravelling,
they
should
be
resealed;
if they
are
bleeding
additional
seal
coat
aggregate
should
be
applied.
If they show signs of
shoving
they
should
be
removed
and replaced with prcmix material.

For penetration patching above 50 mm
thickness
and
upto 75 mm thickness, built-up spray grout
specifications

PERIODIC RENEWALS
6.1.
Need and Importauce of Periodic Renewals
Periodic renewals consist of the provision of a surfacini:
layer
over the pavement at regular intervals of
time,
so
as
to
preserve
the required characteristics of the
pavement
and
offset
tlie
wear
and
tear
caused
by
traffic,
weathering,
etc.
In
effect,
periodic
renewals
represent
preventive
maintenance
which
is
needed
to
prevent deterioration of the pavement characteristic:, and
io
ensure
that initial qualities are kept up for the future requirements of traffic
during the design
life of the pavement.
Early detection and
repair
of noticeable defects can prevent a major break-down
of
the
sur-
face.
For example,
if symptoms like hungry surface, ravelling
etc.
are noticed at an early stage and suitable preventive action by
way
of renewal of surface
is taken to arrest further deterioration, the
life
of the pavement can be prolonged.

6.2.
Planning and Programming of Renewals
The general practice in
tlie country
is to finalise
renewal
pro-
gramme on an annual basis.
In order that necessary steps
leading
to the
laying of renewal layer on the road could be taken in proper
time, the renewal programme for each section of a road
should
be
decided well in advance.
Once
the programme
is finalised,
steps
could be taken to secure
tiie
required
allocations
and
start
the
prelinunary field
action such as collection of materials etc.
While
the
nomenclatui-e
"Periodic
Renewal"
would
imply
that the renewal treatment be carried out at a fixed and
pre-deter-
mined frequency,
it would neither be
practicable
nor
desirable
to
follow impliciily any specified frequency irrespective
of
the
condi-
tion of the road surface proposed to be renewed.
The most
effec-
tive way to plan a renewal programme
is
to
carry
out
inspections
of the road surface at suitable
intervals.
Visual
inspection
of
the
road as detailed in Section
3 of this
Code
should
be
carried
out.
In addition, special inspections also are necessary before and
after
the rains so as to assess the need for patching and
other
remedial
measures required to be carried out either
in
advance
or
together
with the renewal treatment.
6.3.
Identification of Length to be Renewed
The lengths of
the
road
showing
signs
of
distress
such
as
hungry surface/hair-line cracking, ravelling
etc.,
should
invariably
be included in the renewal
programme.
This
would
ensure
that
the surface of the road and the pavement structure
do not
deterio-
rate further.
The lengths
of
the
road
which
would
bo
due
for
renewal
treatment on the basis of the prescribed periodicity should
be inspected closely and decision whether
to
include
these
in
the
renewal programme or
to
postpone
the
renewal
for
a
specified
period should be taken depending upon the conditiorf'.of
the
road
surface.
In cases where the nature of distress/failure
seen
on
the
road
is
severe
and
of
considerable
extent and the cause may be
deep-seated and where
it
is
considered
the
pavement
cannot
be
improved with renewal treatment, detailed investigations should
be
carried out and special measures would have to be taken for correc-
ting the same,
^.4.
Types of Renewal
The types of bituminous surfaces prevalentin India are surface
dressing (one or two coats), thin premix
chipping
carpet,
thin mix
seal carpet, hot mix semi-dense and dense carpets. These surfaces have
different
life spans depending upon
trafllc and environmental
con-
ditions.
Periodic renewals in these cases would
generally
provide
41



======================================================================
PAGE 46 of 60
======================================================================
IRC
: 82-1982
for the application of a surfacing layer upto 20 mm thickness so that
the superficial wear and weathering of the surface
is covered up and
the pavement lasts for the full intended
life
span.
The
specifica-
tions adopted for the
renewal
layer
on
a
particular
road
would
depend upon the type of the original
surface and
its
condition
at
the time of renewal.
The
specifications
generally
adopted
for
periodic renewals in this country are
:
(i)
Single coat of surface dressing as per IRC
: 17-1965 (SD).
(ii)
20 mm thick prcmix chipping carpet as per IRC
: 14-1977 (PC).
(tii)
Mix seal
surfacing
as
per
Ministry
of
Shipping
and
Transport
(Roads Wing)
Specification
for Road
and
Bridge Works
Clause
508 (MS).
The specification and the thickness of
the
renewal
course
should
be such that as far as possible the road surface
is restored
close
to
its original
condition.
For
example,
renewal
over
an
original
hot mix
dense carpet (asphaltic
concrete) surface
would
have
to
be hot mix paver-laid mix seal surfacing while on an original surface
of premix
chipping carpet, the renewal layer could either
be
single
coat surface dressing
or 20 mm
thick
prcmix
carpet
depending
upon
the condition of the worn-out surface.

Notes:
(1) The treatment symbols SD, PC

have been explained
in Clause 6.4 above.
(2) The denominator refers to the periodicity of renewal
in
years.
(3) For
areas
subject
to
snowfall
and
hilly areas
with steep
side slopes and heavy rainfall the periodicity of renewal may be
at closer interval.
(4) The periodicity
of
the renewal
indicated
in the table above
should only be taken as a general
guideline
for the purpose of
budgetting and determining
the extent of renewal prograimme.
It
does
not
indicate either the expected
life of the partcular
type of treatment or the imperative need for renewals after the
period indicated.
6.6.
Rectification of Profile
at the Time of Renewal
The
camber
and
superelevation
provided initially on a road
tend to get flattened out
due to traflSc.
Before the renewal of sur-
face is done, the cross profile should be corrected by means of a suit-
able levelling course.

SPECIAL PROBLEMS
7.1.
Construction
and
Maintenance
during
Wet
Weather
Conditions
7.1.1.
Nature of problem
:
It
is well known that the chippings
which are damp or wet due to storage in
the
open
stacks,
do
not
adhere to bituminous binder so long as the film of water
persists on
the stone.
Also majority of wet weather failure of surface dressings
are caused by rain
during or within a few days
after
construction.
Even after the
chippings have
adhered
to
the
binder
there
is
a
period varying from an hour or two to seven days or more when the
adhesive bond between the stone and the
binder
is
susceptible to
displacing action of water.
This phenomenon
is relevant not only to
surface dressing but also to open-graded surfacings as well, although
the aggregates in this case are heated
and
then
coated
with
the
bituminous
binder.
The effect of water manifests in the form of all
round ravelling of the affected area, loss
of
cover
aggregate
and
development of pot-holes.
7.1.2.
Preventive Measures
: The damage by wet weather can
be prevented by the use of surface active agents
(adhesion
agents).
The adhesion
agent
promotes
the
adhesion
of
binder
to
wet
aggregates or prevents the loss of adhesion under
the
influence of
subsequent rains. Creoste
oil,
hydrated
lime,
turkey red oil,
or
amines (mono, di or polyamine of
fatty
acids)
can
be us .d as an
adhesion agent.
Under wet conditions, adhesion
agents
may
be
added at the rate of
1 to
1.5 per cent by weight of binder.
7.1.3.
Maintenance measures
(A) Use of bitumen emulsions
The
bitumen
emulsions
not
only
flow
well at atmospheric
temperature
but
can
also
be
applied to damp road surfaces and
used for coating damp aggregates. The presence of emulsifying agent
helps in improving the adhesion characteristics of the binder.
Two types of bitumen emulsion
namely
the
anionic type and
the cationic type are generally used.
The
basic difference between
the two lies
in their method of
breaking.
Anionic
bitumen emul-
sions
break
only when
sufficient
water
has evaporated from the
system to leave the emulsion unstable. With cationic bitumen emul-
sion
the break
is chemical,
i.e., the positively charged emulsifier
is
chemically
attracted
to
negative
surface on
the aggregate.
This
44



======================================================================
PAGE 49 of 60
======================================================================
IRC
: 82-1982
causes
the
emulsion
to
break
and
the emulsifier then acts as an
adhesion agent.
The cationic emulsifiers
are
especially useful with
siliceous aggregate and may be effectively used in slurry sealing and
preparation of patching mixtures.
(B) Storable
bituminous
mixes for maiotenance during
rainy season
In bituminous pavements the maximum
damage
is caused by
water and
that
too during the
rainy
season.
Stagnation of water
and movement of
traffic
induces stripping and ruptures the binder
film on aggregate
and eventually
leads to
ravelling
and potholing
on
the
road
pavement.
For
meeting such
a
situation
storable
bituminous
mixtures
stockpiled
in advance offer a ready solution.
Such mixes may be stored for a week or ten days. The manufactur-
ing details of such mixes are as follows
:
(i) BINDER
: The
cut-back
bitumen
of
the
consistency
of MC—
3
(Bitumen
80/100+16
per
cent flux) or a slow setting emulsion may
be used.
In case the maintenance is to be undertaken during
rainy
season the cut-back bitumen
should
be treated
with
one per cent
antistripping
agent.
No
treatment
is
warranted
in
the case
of
cationic bitumen emulsion.
(ii) AGGREGATE : The
mineral aggregates shall be crushed rock, sand,
or mineral dust conforming to the required gradings.
(iii) PREPARATION OF THE MIXTURES
:
Coarse and
fine aggregate
shall be fed into the
plant
in
a
proportion
conforming
to
the
grading requirements.
The cut-back bitumen
or emulsion shall be
applied at appropriate temperature at 4-6 per cent by weight of total
mix.
The mineral aggregates and the binder
shall
be
mixed
until
all aggregates are thoroughly coated.
(iv) STOCK PILING
:
The mixture shall be stored in a cool
dry
place
and shall be used as and when required.
7.2.
Road Cuts Resorted to for
Installation
or
Maintenance
of Utilities
7.2.1.
Nature of the problem
:
It often becomes
necessary
to cut the road pavement
to
install
an
utility
(sewer, waterline,
electric cable etc.) or repair
it.
This requirement
is
very frequeiit
in urban streets, though
rural
roads
also
need such
cuts
The
number and frequency of these cuts should be
kept
to a minimum
by proper
coordination
with
the
utilities services
organisations.
In some Highway Departments,
the
method
of
driving or jacking
the pipeline
under
the
pavement is
adopted
wherever feasible.
Wherever these cuts are
made, the
important
thing is
to ensure
that they
are
restored
properly.
Otherwise,
they tend to be a
45



======================================================================
PAGE 50 of 60
======================================================================
IRC
: 82-1982
constant source of annoyance and danger to traffic, apart
from the
recurring trouble to maintenance personnel.
7.2.2.
Hints
for
better
maintenaoce
practices
:
The
cut
should
be
of
rectangular
shape
with
vertical sides.
As far as
possible, the accumulation
of
water
in
the
trenches should
be
avoided.
Collection of water renders
it difficult to dry the trenches
and
is also detrimental to the stability of the trench
fill.
The trench
fill material must be
carefully
selected
and
it
should be thoroughly compacted.
The use of mechanical rammers
and the control of
moisture
and
layer
thickness
should receive
attention.
The different layers of the pavement should similarly be
built-up under controlled conditions.
It
is suggested that bituminous
macadam may be adopted in lieu of
water-bound-macadam where
it
is not possible to
consolidate
water-bound
macadam in narrow
trenches.
The top 150 mm of the pavement
should
preferably be
of bituminous construction, irrespective of the existing crust.
The final surface should be of material similar to that
in
the
existing pavement.
The final surface should be
laid in a
manner
similar to the restoration
of a
pot-hole.
The resultant
surface
should be flush with the adjacent surface. Humping, for compaction
by traffic, should not be allowed.
Since many repaired
road-cuts
continue to give trouble for quite some
time, sustained attention
is
necessary.
8.
MATERIALS
8.1.
Binder
The bituminous binder should be one of the following
:
(1)
Paving
bitumen,
penetration
grade
30/40,
60/70
or
80/100
conforming to IS;73-1961.
(2)
Cut-back bitumen of the Rapid curing (RC-3) and
Medium
curing
(MC-3) Type conforming to IS.-217-196I and 454-J961.
(3)
Bitumen emulsions of the Rapid setting
(RS)
or
Medium

depend
upon
the maintenance specifications for which
the binder is required, the
climatic conditions, traffic and
durability.

TOOLS AND PLANT
9.1.
A
list of equipment that will be needed for various types
of bituminous
work
is
given
in
IRC
: 72-1978
^'Recommended
Practice for use and upkeep of equipment, tools and appliances
for
bituminous pavement construction"
9.2.
In addition,
it may be necessary
to
have
mobile
units
located
at
key
places
so
that the repair work may be centralised
and handled
expeditiously.
For
this purpose,
a
truck
wherein a
small hand operated drum mixer, vibratory tamping equipment, and
some small essential tools are provided, can be very useful.
10.
ARRANGEMENTS FOR TRAFFIC
10.1.
Since
maintenance
operations
involve
considerable
hardship,
inconvenience
and
hazard
to traffic and also hazards to
maintenance workmen,
all possible precautions should
be
taken to
make
safe arrangements for traffic.
These include erection of bar-
riers, 5igns, red flags and lights.
Efforts should be made to
confine
work
in
half
the
pavement width at a time, leaving the other half
49



======================================================================
PAGE 54 of 60
======================================================================
IRC
: 82-1982
for use by the traffic.
Where this
is
not
possible,
diversion
roads
may
have
to
be
constructed
or the traffic diverted to some other
alternative routes.
The maintenance operation
itself can be conve-
niently confined to a small length at a time, say 30 m.
10.2.
The appropriate warning sign to be used
is
the "Man
at
work"
sign,
vide
Code
of
Practice
for Road Signs (IRC: 67-
1977).
If half the road
width
alone
is
available
for
traffic,
the
''Narrow Road
Ahead"
sign
should
also
be displayed.
During
night, there should
be
adequate
lighting
with
a
red
lantern/red
reflectors.

ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT
11.1
Maintenance of a road
requires
proper
supervision
of
skilled workmen who
are
adequately trained in various aspects of
maintenance.
The
supervisory
staff,
generally
known
as
Road
Inspectors
in
this
country
are,
therefore,
to be given training in
various aspects of bituminous
work.
They
should
be
conversant
with
the
specifications for various types of repair works, the choice
of binder for different types
of
repair
work,
the
quality
control
measures
needed
to achieve good workmanship, use and upkeep of
equipment and tools and safety measures to be adopted
during
the
maintenance operations.
11.2.
Routine maintenance work in this country
is generally
carried out through
gang
labour.
For
National Highways
and
State Highways,
it
is customary to base the
optimum
requirement
of labour
at a rate of 0.3 gangman
per
km
in
the case of
single-
lane road and 0.45 gangman per km
in case of two lane road.
A
group of 5-6 gangmcn
is
supervised
by
a
mate.
In
order
to
optimise the output of the labour employed and
to
ensure that the
job carried out are at locations fixed
by
the
supervisory
officer,
partial
mechanisation
of
the
maintenance
operations
is
quite
necessary.
The system of making an
individual
gang
responsible
for a particular section of the road should
be
adopted and
these
gangs should be made mobile with the provision
of
a
mechanical
transport (truck/pick-up vans
for
longer
beats, and
tricycles for
shorter beats) provided with necessary
tools
and
equipment
(see
clause 9.2. of the Code).
11.3.
Maintenance of
bituminous
pavement
is
a
skilled
operation.
The labour engaged for
this
job
should
be properly
trained.
Such
trained
labourers
should
move
about
in
the
mechanical transport
carrying
essential
tools,
implements
and
materials while the premix material could be prepared
and
stored

at a central location.
This
would
ensure required
mobility of
the
labour force and
result in timely and
proper
completion of repair
works.
11.4.
The headquarters of one or more
mobile gangs should
be fixed at a convenient location on the road
where the necessary
store-sheds for tools, plants and implements
and
for
premix and
other materials should
be
available
together
with
a
rest-shed.
Preferably, these locations
should
be
connected
with the
head-
quarters of the
Assistant
Engineer/Executive
Engineer
either by
means of a public telephone or
a departmental
telephone line so
that jn case of emergency, serious accidents on the road, dislocation
of traflSe due to flooding,
damage
to
structures
etc.,
immediate
contact could be established with the concerned officer for initiating
the remedial measures and
giving
necessary
publicity to the road
user.
11.5.
Planning and scheduling of the maintenance operations
should be given due importance.
The annual renewal
programme
should be drawn up well
in advance keeping
in view the condition
of the surface, prescribed
renewal
cycle
and
any
improvement
work carried out recently or scheduled to be taken up
in
the
nea^-
future.
It
is useful for easy comprehension to depict
the
renewal
programme on a bar chart indicating the renewals
carried
out
in
the last eight years.
The budgetting for maintenance
expenditure
should also be
done
well
in
advance
and
the
allocation
of
resources to the
different
operations
of
maintenance
should be
finalised simultaneously.
This would facilitate the
field
engineer
to plan and implement his programme effectively.
