RECOMMENDED  PRACTICE  FOR  ACCELERATED  STRENGTH  
TESTING  AND  EVALUATION  OF  CONCRETE
FOREWORD
The document was ﬁ rst published in May, 1983 under the recommendation about 
accelerated strength testing and evaluation of concrete for road and airﬁ eld constructions. 
The Rigid Pavement Committee (H-3) decided to revise IRC:85-1983 mainly because 
of cement used in 1983 was of 33 grades OPC, the correlation of 28 day compressive 
strength of accelerated curing and normal cured was not given. The correlation of 28 day 
compressive and ﬂ exural strength of concrete with PPC and PSC was also not available 
in the IRC:85-1983. A research project was undertaken at Central Road Research Institute 
(CRRI), New Delhi to develop the correlation between the accelerated cured and normal 
cured concrete using Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), Portland Pozzolana Cement 
(PPC) and Portland Slag Cement (PSC). The team members of the R&D project were 
Shri J.B. Sengupta, Member advisory group Senior Principal Scientist, Shri Binod Kumar, 
Principal Scientist, and Shri Manoj Kumar Singh, Technical Ofﬁ cer, Rigid Pavement Division, 
CRRI, New Delhi.
The draft IRC:85 “Recommended Practice for Accelerated Strength Testing and Evaluation 
of Concrete” (First Revision) was prepared by the Sub-group comprising Dr. S.C. Maiti, 
Shri J.B. Sengupta, Shri R.K. Jain, Shri Satander Kumar and Shri Binod Kumar. 
The Committee deliberated on the draft document in a series of meetings. The H-3 
Committee ﬁ nally approved the draft document in its meeting held on 19th June, 2014 and 
authorized the Convenor, H-3 Committee to send the ﬁ nal draft for placing before the HSS 
Committee.

The Highways Speciﬁ cations & Standards Committee (HSS) approved the draft document 
in its meeting held on 9th August, 2014. The Executive Committee in its meeting held on 
18th August, 2014 approved the same document for placing it before the Council. The IRC 
Council in its 203rd meeting held at New Delhi on 19th and 20th August, 2014 approved the draft 
IRC:85 “Recommended Practice for Accelerated Strength Testing and Evaluation of Concrete” 
(First Revision) for publishing.
1  INTRODUCTION 
1.1 
The quality acceptance criteria of most cement concrete works including paving 
concrete works for roads and airﬁ elds are based on the strength of specimens tested at the 
age of 28 days after curing under standard curing conditions. An estimate of 28-day strength 
of concrete is sometimes done from the corresponding 7-day strength results for purpose of 
early quality control. In case of many constructions, the time lapse of even 7 days is too long 
for the strength results to serve any useful purpose from the point of either quality control or 
predicting the 28-day strength. 
1.2 
With a view to overcoming this problem, accelerated strength testing of concrete 
has been recommended in this document that would provide early information, say in about a 
day, on the concrete strength likely to be developed at 28 days. Such information may enable 
taking decision on removal of any defective concrete very early while it has still not hardened 
much, or before it is covered by subsequent layer. With the estimate of 28 days strength, 
the accelerated test also helps in taking early corrective steps for concrete mixes as being

produced and which may not perform satisfactorily. It will thus help achieve better control of 
concrete quality economically with greatly reduced chances of rejection, and take corrective 
actions early.
1.3 
For predicting the compressive and ﬂ exural strengths of concrete at 28 days, it will 
be desirable to obtain in advance, in the laboratory, along with the mix design of concrete, the 
correlations between the accelerated strength results and standard cured strength results at 
28 days, using the material to be actually used in construction. The present Recommended 
Practice relates particularly to 28-day compressive and ﬂ exural strength estimation of concrete 
through accelerated curing. Since compressive and ﬂ exural strength of concrete is of great 
importance to the paving engineers, this document will have particular signiﬁ cance in road 
and airﬁ eld constructions.
2  SCOPE 
This Recommended Practice covers procedure for accelerated curing, details of 
accelerated strength test under compression/ﬂ exure and estimation there of from strength 
under standard curing for 28 days, and is recommended to be used when estimation of 
28-day compressive strength or ﬂ exural strength is required from the accelerated one day 
strength tests.
3  WORKING  PRINCIPLE  OF  ACCELERATED  CURING
The concrete specimens (cubes or beams), after 23 hours ± 15 minutes of their preparation, 
are cured in boiling water for 3.5 hours ± 5 min. The specimens are then taken out of boiling 
water and allow cooling in air under wet gunny bags for 2 hours and then tested. The total 
period elapsed between castings and testing is 28.5 hours.
4  APPARATUS  FOR  ACCELERATED  CURING  
4.1 
Water Bath  
4.1.1 
When it is desired to conduct accelerated strength test for both compressive and 
ﬂ exural strength, the water bath which is to provide the accelerated curing conditions shall 
consist of a galvanized steel tank of appropriate capacity and dimensions and shall have 
a detachable top cover. The tank should accommodate at a time minimum 3 cubes and 
3 beams encased in moulds. The plan of placement of moulds in the tank is shown in 
Fig. 1. The dimensions of the tank may be varied depending on the number, size and type of 
specimens to be accommodated in the tank.

Fig. 1  Layout Plan for 3 Beams and 3 Cubes Inside the Water Tank
For 900 mm x 750 mm x 400 mm deep tank shown in Fig. 1, six immersion type heating 
elements (220V, 1500W each) having a combined load of 9 kilo-watts are ﬁ tted horizontally 
at the side of the tank. These elements are distributed on the sides of the tank and located 
about 70 mm above the bottom of the tank. The tank is provided with a mild steel grid platform 
resting on 4 angles iron supports welded to the sides of the tank. The grid is placed about 
100 mm above the bottom of the tank, Fig. 2. The cube and beam or only beam specimens 
together with their moulds are placed on the grid. The tank shall have an outlet at the bottom 
for emptying it, when required.

4.1.2 
The tank is to be ﬁ lled with water to a depth of 250 mm for 900 mm x 750 mm 
x 400 mm deep tank so that when the specimens are placed in it, the water level rises to 
about 70 mm above the top of the moulds. This level of water is to be maintained during the 
heating period by adding small amount of water (as required) into the tank from time to time 
in order to maintain constant heat capacity of the curing medium. Depending on the ambient 
temperatures prevalent at the time of experimentation, about 60-75 minutes are required to 
raise the temperature of water in the tank to its boiling point near 100ºC. The steam formed 
during heating is allowed to escape through an outlet provided in the tank cover, Fig. 2.
4.2 
Water Bath in the Field 
At construction sites in the ﬁ eld, where electrical power may not be available, water may be 
brought to boiling temperature by means of heating through coal or ﬁ rewood. The dimensions 
and other arrangements of the water bath should remain the same as described in Para 
4.1.  
 
 
 
4.3 
Mould for Concrete Specimens 
The moulds for concrete specimens (cube or beams) shall be as per IS:516-1959. In 
addition, 6 mm thick mild steel plate (with machined surface in contact with concrete) of size 
corresponding to that of the moulds is required to cover the specimens during the period of 
curing in boiling water. The moulds shall have suitable handles for easy removal.
 5  PROCEDURE 
5.1 
Concrete cube and beam shall be prepared in accordance with IS:516-1959. The 
mould ﬂ anges are wiped clean after the concrete is trowelled level with the top of the mould. 
The specimens are cured for 23 ± ½ hours under wet gunny bags at standard temperature of 
27 ± 2ºC. After such curing, the specimens still in moulds shall be covered with cover plates 
(with machined surface in contact with concrete) and placed in boiling water in the tank. The 
temperature of water will drop slightly due to immersion of moulds but will regain the boiling 
temperature within 15 minutes.
5.2 
The specimens shall be kept in the boiling water for 3.5 hours ± 5 min. After 
this period, these should be removed from the tank with hooks having wooden handles, 
demoulded and left to cool in air for two hours under wet gunny bags. Immediately after 
2 hours of cooling of the specimens, these shall be tested for compressive/ﬂ exural strength 
as per IS: 516-1959. 
6  ESTIMATION  OF  28-DAY  STRENGTH
6.1 
Ordinarily, the correlation between the accelerated strength results as per procedure 
described in Para 5 and standard cured strength results at 28 days shall be obtained in the 
laboratory along with the mix design of concrete, using the materials to be actually used in

the construction. These correlations should be supplied to the site engineer along with the 
mix design.
6.2 
Where such correlations are not made available from the laboratory, general 
guidance may be had from the correlations given in Figs. 3, 4 and 5 which have been drawn 
on the basis of laboratory test results given in Annexure I. While Fig. 3 gives the statistical 
correlations between accelerated and 28-day standard cured compressive and ﬂ exural 
strength using OPC, Fig. 4 shows the same between accelerated and 28-day standard 
cured compressive and ﬂ exural strength using PPC and Fig. 5 shows the same between 
accelerated and 28-day standard cured compressive and ﬂ exural strength using PSC. The 
correlations shown in Fig. 3 relate to concrete mixes using ordinary Portland cements having 
widely different physical and chemical properties i.e., 3 day compressive strength varying 
between 23 to 26 N/mm2, 7-day compressive strength varying between 33 to 38 N/mm2 and 
28-day compressive strength varying between 43 to 49 N/mm2, minimum speciﬁ c surface 
area 2250 cm2 per gm (Blaine’s), C3S content varying between 45 percent and 55 percent 
and C2S content varying between 30 percent and 20 percent. In Fig. 4 the pozzolana content 
in PPC varying from 25 percent to 35 percent. Whereas in Fig. 5 slag content in PSC varying 
from 30 percent to 50 percent. The statistical relationship between one day accelerated and 
28 day normal cured specimen’s compressive and ﬂ exural strength using OPC, PPC and 
PSC are given in Table 1.
