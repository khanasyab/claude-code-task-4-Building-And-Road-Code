STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS AND CODE OF PRACTICE FOR
WATER BOUND MACADAM
1. INTRODUCTION
1 . 1 This standard was originally published in
1 966.
The first revision of the standard was approved
by the Specifications and Standards Committee in
their meeting held on the 29
th & 30
th September,
1972, by the Executive Committee in their meeting
held at Gandhinagar on the 25
th November,
1 972
and by the Council in their 79
th meeting held at
Gandhinagar on the 25
th November, 1972 for
publication. Following the decision of the IRC
Council at its meeting held on the 28
th August,
1 976,
the tolerance of surface evenness were revised on
the basis of IRC Special Publication 16 "Surface
Evenness of Highway Pavements" and the second
revision of standard was published in May,
1 977
which was further amended in March, 1987.
The decision to review and revise the code of
practice was taken during meeting of Flexible
Pavement Committee on 10
th February, 2001
. The
task was assigned
to Dr.
P.K. Jain and K.
Sitaramanjaneyulu, Scientists of Central Road
Research Institute. The draft of the revised code
was presented and discussed in the meeting of
Flexible Pavement Committee held on
1
th May,
2002 and
it was decided that the draft document
may be modified in the light of the comments of
the members and sent to Convenor, Flexible
Pavement Committee for forwarding to Highways
Specifications & Standards (HSS) Committee. Dr.
P.K. Jain, and Shri K. Sitaramanjaneyulu modified
the document and forwarded to Convenor, Flexible
Pavement Committee. The draft standard was
reviewed by the Flexible Pavement Committee
(constituted in January, 2003) in its meeting held
on
1
st August, 2003 and authorized a Group
consisting of Shri S.C. Sharma, Shri K.K. Singal
and Dr.
P.K. Jain
to finalise the document
incorporating the suggestions of the members and
forward the same to HSS Committee. The draft
standard was finalised by the Group in its meeting
held on
7
th May, 2004 and then
sent
for
consideration of HSS Committee.

pavement.
2.1.
Description
2.1.1
Water Bound Macadam (WBM) shall
consist of clean, crushed coarse aggregates
mechanically interlocked by rolling, and voids
thereof filled with screening and binding material
with the assistance of water, laid on a prepared
subgrade, sub-base, base or existing pavement as
the case may be. WBM may be used as a sub-
base, base course or surfacing course depending
upon category of road. In each case,
it shall be
constructed in accordance with the specifications
given in this Code and in conformity with the lines,
grades and cross-sections shown on the drawings
or as directed.
2.1.2
The WBM shall not be laid on an existing
bituminous top surface without scarifying or
providing adequate measures for proper bond and
drainage at the interface of existing bituminous
surface and WBM layer.

IRC: 19-2005
3.1.4
Overburnt (Jhama) brick metal
: B rick
metal shall be made out of overburnt bricks or
brick bats and be free from dust and other
deleterious materials.
3.1.5 Kankar
: Kankar shall be tough having a
blue almost opalescent fracture.
It shall not contain
any clay in the cavities between nodules.
3.1.6 Laterite
: Laterite shall be hard, compact,
heavy and of dark colour. Light coloured sandy
laterities, as also those containing ochreous clay
shall not be used.
3.2 Coarse Aggregates-Size and Grading
Requirement
3.2.1
The coarse aggregates shall conform to
one of the grading given in Table 2. Grading
1
shall be used only for sub-base courses, with a
compacted layer thickness of 100 mm.
3.2.2
The size of aggregates to be used would
depend on the type of aggregates available and
compacted thickness of the layer.
3.2.3
The crushable type aggregates like brick
metal, kankar and laterite shall also generally
satisfy the grading requirements of Table
2.
Relaxation in grading may be permitted for such
materials with the permission of the Engineer.
3.3 Screenings
3.3.1
Screenings to
fill voids
in the coarse
aggregates shall generally be of the same material
as
the coarse aggregates. However, from
economic considerations, predominantly non-plastic
material such as kankar, moorum or gravel (other
than river-borne rounded aggregate) may also be
used for this purpose provided that the liquid limit
and plasticity index of such material are below 20
and 6 respectively and the fraction passing 75 micron
sieve does not exceed 10 per cent.
3.3.2
As Tar as possible, screenings
shall
conform
to the grading shown in Table
3.
Screenings of type A shall be used in conjunction
with coarse aggregates of grading
1, and of type
B with coarse aggregates of grading 3. With coarse

aggregates of grading 2, either type A or type B
screenings may be used. For crushable screenings
like moorum and gravel, the grading given in Table
3 shall not be binding.
3.3.3
The use of screenings may be dispensed
with when crushable type soft aggregates such
as brick metal, kankar, laterite, etc., are used as
coarse aggregates, as these are likely
to get
crushed to a certain extent during rolling.
3.4 Binding Material
3.4.1
Binding material to be used for WBM as
filler shall consist of a fine grained material passing
100 per cent through 425 micron sieve and
possessing PI value of 4-8 when the WBM is used
as a surfacing course, and less than 6 when the
WBM is adopted as a sub-base/base course with
bituminous surfacing. If limestone formations are
available nearby, limestone dust or kankar nodules
may be used as binding material.
3.4.2
Application of binding material may not
be necessary, where the screenings consist of
crushable type material like moorum or gravel.
However, for WBM used as a surfacing course,
where the PI of crushable type screenings is less
than 4, application of a small quantity of binding
material having PI of 4-6 would be required at the
top. The quantity of screenings could be reduced
correspondingly.

grade and camber and cleaned of all dust, dirt and
other extraneous matter. Any ruts or soft yielding
places that have appeared due to improper
drainage, service under traffic or other reasons
shall be corrected and rolled until firm.
4.1.2
Where the WBM
is to be laid on an
existing un-surfaced road, the surface shall be
scarified and re-shaped to the required grade and
camber as necessary. Weak places shall be
strengthened,
corrugations
removed
and
depressions and potholes made good with suitable
material before spreading the coarse aggregates
for WBM.
4.1.3
As far as possible, laying ofWBM course
over an existing bituminous surface should be
avoided since it will cause problems ofproper bond
and internal drainage of the pavement at the
interface of two courses.
It
is desirable to
completely remove the existing thin surfacing of
bituminous layer, where WBM is proposed to be
laid over it. Where the intensity of rain is low and
interface drainage facility is efficient, WBM can
be laid over existing thin bituminous surfacing by
course for a compacted thickness of 75 mm are
given in Table 5.
3.5.2
The quantity of binding material where it
is to be used (see Clause 3.4.), will depend on the
type of screenings and function ofWBM. Generally,
the quantity required for 75 mm compacted
thickness will be 0.06-0.09 m3/10 m2 in the case of
WBM sub-base/base course and 0.10-0.15 m
3/10
m
2 when the WBM is to function as a surfacing
course. For 100 mm thickness, the quantity needed
will be 0.08-0.10 m3/10 m2 for sub-base course.
3.5.3
The above mentioned quantities should be
taken as a guide only, for estimation of quantities
for construction, etc.

CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURE
4.1 Preparation of Foundation for Receiving
WBM Layer
4.1.1
The subgrade, sub-base or base to receive
theWBM course shall be prepared to the required
7



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 24
======================================================================
IRC: 19-2005
cutting 50 mm x 50 mm (minimum) furrows at
1
metre intervals at 45 degrees to the centre line of
the carriageway before proceeding with the laying
ofWBM.
The direction and depth of furrows shall be
such that they provide adequate bondage and also
serve to drain water to the existing granular base
course beneath the existing bituminous surface.
4.1.4
In all cases, the foundation shall be kept
well drained during the construction operations.
4.2
Provision of Lateral Confinement of
Aggregates
For construction ofWBM, arrangement should
be made for the lateral confinement of aggregates.
This shall be done by building adjoining shoulders
alongwith WBM
layers.
The
practice
of
constructing WBM in a trench section excavated
in the finished formation must be completely
avoided.
4.3 Spreading of Coarse Aggregates
4.3.1
The coarse aggregates shall be spread
uniformly and evenly upon the prepared base in
required quantities from stockpiles along the side
of the road or directly from vehicles. In no case
shall these be dumped in heaps directly on the area
where these are to be laid nor shall their hauling
over a partly completed base be permitted. The
aggregates shall be spread to proper profile by using
templates placed across the road about 6 m apart.
Where possible, approved mechanical devices shall
be used to spread the aggregates uniformly so as
to minimize the need for their manipulation by hand.
4.3.2
The WBM Course shall be constructed in
layers such that thickness of each compacted layer
is not more than 100 mm for grading
1 (Table 2).
The compacted thickness of layer shall be 75 mm
for grading 2 and grading 3. Each layer shall be
tested by depth blocks. No segregation of large or
fine particles
shall be allowed. The coarse
aggregates as spread shall be of uniform gradation
with no pockets of fine material.
4.3.3
The coarse aggregates shall normally not
be spread in lengths exceeding three days average
work ahead of the rolling and bonding of the
preceding section.
4.4 Rolling
4.4.1
After the laying of coarse aggregates,
these shall be compacted to full width by rolling
with either three wheel-power roller of 80 to 100
kN capacity or an equivalent vibratory roller.
4.4.2
The rolling shall begin from edges with
roller running forward and backward until the edges
have been firmly compacted. The roller shall then
progress gradually from edges to the centre, parallel
to the centre line of the road and overlapping
uniformly each preceding rear wheel track by one
half width and shall continue until the entire area
of the course has been rolled by the rear wheel.
Rolling
shall continue
until the road metal
is
thoroughly keyed and the creeping of stone ahead
of the roller is no longer visible. Slight sprinkling of
water may be done, if required.
4.4.3
On super elevated portions of the road,
rolling shall commence from the lower edge and
progress gradually towards the upper edge of the
pavement.
4.4.4
Rolling
shall not be done when the
subgrade
is soft or yielding or when
it causes a
wave-like motion in the base course or subgrade.
If irregularities develop during rolling, which
exceed 12 mm when tested with a 3 m straight
edge, the surface shall be loosened and aggregates
added or removed as required before rolling
again so as
to achieve
all uniform surface
conforming to the desired cross section and grade.
The surface shall also be checked transversely by
template for camber, and any irregularities corrected
in the manner described above. In no case shall
the use of screenings to make up depressions be
permitted.
4.4.5
Material, which gets crushed excessively
during compaction or become segregated shall be
removed and replaced with suitable aggregates.

IRC: 19-2005
4.5 Application of Screenings
4.5.1
After coarse aggregates have been rolled
as per Clause 4.4, screenings to
fill interstices
shall be applied gradually over the surface. Dry
rolling shall be done when the screenings are being
spread so that the jarring effect of roller causes
them to settle into the voids of the coarse aggregate.
The screenings shall not be dumped in piles but
applied uniformly in successive thin layers either
by
the spreading motion of hand shovels,
mechanical spreaders, or directly from trucks.
Trucks plying over the base course to spread
screenings shall be equipped with pneumatic tyres
and operated such as not to disturb the coarse
aggregates.
4.5.2
The screenings shall be applied at a slow
rate
in three or more applications as necessary.
This shall be accompanied by rolling and brooming.
Either mechanical brooms/hand brooms or both
may be used. In no case shall the screenings be
applied so fast and thick as to form cakes or ridges
on the surface making the filling of voids difficult
or preventing the direct bearing of roller on the
coarse aggregates. The spreading, rolling and
brooming of screenings shall be taken up on
sections, which can be completed within one day's
operation. Damp and wet screenings shall not be
used in any circumstances.
4.6 Sprinkling of Water and Grouting
4.6.1
After application of screenings, the
surface shall be copiously sprinkled with water,
swept and rolled. Hand brooms shall be used to
sweep the wet screenings into the voids, and to
distribute them evenly. The sprinkling, sweeping
and rolling operations shall be continued and
additional screenings applied, where necessary until
the coarse aggregates are bonded and firmly set
and a grout of screenings and water forms ahead
of the wheels of the roller. Care shall be taken that
the base or subgrade does not get damaged due to
addition of excessive quantities of water during the
construction.
4.6.2
In case of lime treated
soil sub-base,
construction of WBM on top of
it can cause
excessive water to flow down to the lime treated
sub-base before
it has picked up enough strength
(is still "green") and thus cause damage to the sub-
base layer. The laying ofWBM layer in such cases
shall be done after the sub-base attains adequate
strength, as directed by the Engineer.
4.7 Application of Binding Material
4.7.1
After the application of screenings as per
Clauses 4.5 and 4.6, binding material where
it is
required to be used (see Clause 3.4), shall be applied
at an uniform and slow
rate
in two or more
successive thin layers. After each application of
binding material, the surface shall be copiously
sprinkled with water and the resulting slurry swept
in with hand brooms/mechanical brooms or both
so as to fill the voids properly. This shall be followed
by rolling with 80- 100 kN roller during which water
shall be applied to the wheels to wash down the
binding material that may get stuck to them. The
spreading of binding material, sprinkling of water,
sweeping with brooms and rolling shall continue
until the slurry of binding material and water forms
a wave ahead of the wheels of moving roller.
4.8 Setting and Drying
4.8.1
After final compaction of the course, the
layer shall be allowed to dry overnight. Next
morning, hungry spots shall be filled with screenings
or binding material, lightly sprinkled with water if
necessary, and rolled. No traffic shall be allowed
till the macadam sets.
4.8.2
In the case of WBM base course to be
provided with bituminous surfacing, the latter shall
be laid only after the WBM course
is completely
dry and before allowing any traffic on it.
5. SURFACE
EVENNESS
OF WBM
COURSE
5.1
The surface unevenness of completed
WBM course in longitudinal and transverse directions
shall be within the limits specified in Table 6.
5.2
The longitudinal profile shall be checked
with a 3-metre long straight edge at the middle of

checked with a series of three camber templates
at intervals of 10 m. For detailed guidance in this
respect, reference may be made to IRC:SP:16-
2004 "Guidelines for Surface Evenness of
Highway Pavements (First Revision)".
6.
RECTIFICATION OF DEFECTIVE
CONSTRUCTION
Where the surface irregularity of the WBM
courses exceeds the tolerances given in Table 6
or where the course is otherwise defective due to
sub-grade soil mixing with the aggregates, the layer
to
its
full thickness shall be scarified over the
affected area, reshaped with added material, or
removed and replaced with fresh material as
applicable, and recompacted in accordance with
Clause 4. The area treated in the aforesaid manner
shall not be less than
10 nr.
In no case
shall
depressions be filled up with screenings or binding
material.
7. CONSTRUCTION OF WBM OVER
NARROW WIDTHS
Where the WBM course is to be constructed
in narrow widths for widening of an existing
pavement, the existing shoulders should be
excavated to their full depth and width up to the
subgrade
level except where the widening
specifications envisage laying of a stabilised-soil sub-
base using in-situ operations in which case the same
should be removed only up to the sub-base level.
The construction of WBM shall be carried out as
per the procedure prescribed in Clause 4.
8. MAINTENANCE OF WBM WEARING
COURSES
8. 1
The successful performance of WBM as
a surfacing course depends to a large extent on
timely maintenance. Maintenance measures for
this can be considered under three heads: periodic
patching of potholes along with removal of ruts
and depressions, blinding of the surface, and
surface renewals.
8.1.1
Patching of pot-holes along with
removal of ruts and depressions
: Potholes,
ruts and other depressions should be drained of
water and cut to regular shape with vertical sides.
All the loose and disintegrated material shall be
removed and the exposed surfaces swept clean.
The holes/depressions shall then be filled with
salvaged coarse aggregates mixed with sufficient
quantity of fresh aggregates and recompacted as
normal WBM to operations described in Clause 4
so that the patched area merges with the adjoining
surface. Where the area so treated is small, hand
rammers may be used for compaction instead of
rollers.
8.1.2
Blinding of surface
: Blinding of the
surface shall be resorted to periodically as soon
as the blinding material applied earlier has been
eroded away due to a traffic or weather action
10



======================================================================
PAGE 19 of 24
======================================================================
IRC: 19-2005
and the surface has started showing signs of
ravelling. Blinding operations shall consist of
application of binding material in thin layers and
grouting in accordance with the procedure given
in Clause 4.7.
8.1.3
Surface Renewal
: WBM wearing
course shall be renewed when the surface is worn
out,
is corrugated and badly ravelled or has a
profusion of potholes and depressions which can
not be treated economically with patching or
blinding operations.
For renewal, the existing surface shall
be scarified to a depth of 50-75 mm and the
resulting material removed to berms for screening
to salvage the usable coarse aggregates. The
exposed pavement shall be scarified again at high
spots so as to ensure proper grade and camber.
The salvaged coarse aggregates mixed with
sufficient quantity of fresh aggregates (usually
between one half to one third of the quantity of
salvaged aggregates) shall then be used to
construct a new WBM course in accordance with
Clause 4.
