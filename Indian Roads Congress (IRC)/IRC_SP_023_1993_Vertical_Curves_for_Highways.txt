PREFACE
Vertical curves constitute
an
important
component
in
the
design of the longitudinal profile of a road. For providing guidance
to the designers in this regard,
the
Specifications
and
Standards
Committee of the Indian Roads Congress had published a
detailed
Paper
on
the
subject
in the year 1952 (Vertical Curves for High-
ways, Paper
No.
156,
Journal
of
.the
Indian
Roads
Congress,
Vol. XVI- 1).
For many years, this Paper served as a
useful guide
in the design of highways in the country.
In the meantime, a lot of changes have
taken
place
in
the
geometric
design
standards
as
also
in
the design concepts.
The
revised geometric
design standards have been published
separately
by the Indian Roads Congress, vvie IRC: 73-1980 for
Rural
(Non-
Urban) Highways and IRC: 86-1983 for Urban Roads.
For provid-
ing guidance on the design of vertical curves
in
the
light
of
the
current
geometric * design
standards and
concepts,
the
original
Paper No. 156 was modified and rewritten by Shri K. Arunachalam,
Deputy Secretary (Research), Indian Roads Congress.
It is hoped that this Publication will be useful in the design of
proper vertical curves for roads in the country besides being a guide
to engineering students.

VERTICAL CURVES FOR HIGHWAYS

.
INTRODUCTION
1.1.
In the alignment of a highway,
it
is a generally accepted
practice
to
follow,
as
closely
as
possible,
the natural
lie of the
land.
This practice,
while
satisfying
the
aesthetic
principles
of
road
location,
tends
itself
to economical road construction.
As
the natural ground
is rarely level, the road located therein accord-
ing
to
these
principles
will
also
have
a series of grades, often
chancing to suit the ground level.
For
the
economical
and
safe
operation
of vehicular
traffic,
however,
certain
other important
considerations set definite limits to the grades and
also
.define
the
way
the changes in grades are to be effected by the introduction of
vertical curves in the longitudinal profile of the road.
1.2.
Not so long ago, the average speed of motor vehicles on
the
main
roads
in
this
country
was
about 35 km/h.
In recent
years there has been a rapid advance
in
design.
Motor
vehicles,
with
low
centres
of
gravity
and equipped with powerful brakes,
are now built to travel at high speeds. To provide full advantage to
these
improved
vehicles and thereby to increase the speed of road
transport,
it
is necessary to improve the
design
of
the
road
itself
by applying proper geometric standards and by other means.
1.3.
To attain the primary objectives of safety
and
comfort
in
travelling
over
different
grades,
the
design of vertical curves
has
to
be
given
due
attention.
This publication gives a rational
conception of the principles governing the de ign of vertical
curves
on roads.
1.4.
The design of vertical curves on highways is not entirely
a matter of mathematical analysis.
Factors such as
the
"personal
equation"
of
the
driver
of
the
vehicle
have
to be taken into
account
and
subjected
to
extensive
research.
On
many
such
factors, research work and field observations carried
out
in
other
countries,
particularly
the
United
States of America, the United
Kingdom, and
Australia
have
supplied
valuable
material.
Not
all the data used in this publication have been supported by adequ-
ate experimental observations.
As further investigations are
made

some
of the
conclusions may need revision in the course of time.
2.
GRADIENTS
2.U- The
rate
of
rise
or
fall with respect to the horizontal
along the length of a road, expressed as a
ratio
or
a
percentage,
is
termed
the
"Gradient".
It
is customary to express a gradient
in terms of the natural tangent of the angle of its inclination to
the
horizontal.
This
may
also
be stated as a ratio, e.g,,
1 in 20,
1 in
25, etc.
In the U.S.A. and some other countries the grade
is
more
often expressed as a percentage as 5 per cent or 4 per cent, etc.
v
2.2.
When
an
angle
is
small,
its tangent is approximately
equal to its circular measure.
For this purpose
all
angles
within
the practical range of gradients on roads may be treated as small.
2.3.
In
this
publication
«i
and
«2
are used to denote the
natural tangents as well
as
circular
measures
of
the
angles
of
inclination
to
the
horizontal
of
the
two
intersecting grade lines.
Thus
in
Fig.
1,
nx
is
the
tangent
(or circular measure) of the
angle BAE and n2 that of the angle BCF.
Signs 4- and — are used
to
denote
ascending and
descending gradients respectively, in the
line of travel, which, by convention,
is
generally
left
to
right in
figures.

The angle which measures the change of direction in the
path of motion at the intersection of two grade
lines
is
called
the
deviation
angle.
Thus

Fig.

between the two grade angles.
Thus N — n } —no

Gradients must be fixed before a vertical curve
can
be
designed. The
designer
has
always
to
keep an eye on economy
in selecting the alignment and
suggesting
the
longitudinal
profile
of
a
road.
The
choice
of
the
alignment of a projected road
is
influenced
by
many
considerations,
gradients
being
one
of
the
most
important.
The
necessity
of
securing
easy grades some-
times compels a
long
and
expensive
alignment.
On
many
an
existing
road,
grcdes
can
be
improved
only by abandoning the
present alignment and re-locating
it.
T-nus,
for
road
projects
it
is
necessary
for
the
designer
to know what gradients are to be
aimed at.
With
this
knowledge
the
designer
is
in
a position to
achieve a balance between the economy of design and
its utility
to
the road user.
On motor roads in hilly coxintry the gradients should be
such
that
they
can
be
negotiated
with
the least changing of gears by
the heavier vehicles (there
is
not
much
animal-drawn
traffic
on
such
roads).
This
saves
time and operation costs.
The problem
is somewhat
complicated
in
the
plains
where roads are used by
the
slow
moving
bullock
cart
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
fast
modern motor vehicle on the other.
For many years to come
the
bullock cart will remain a dominating element
in
the
agricultural
economy
of
this
country.
Gradients
adopted
on
roads
in the
plains should, therefore not be such
as
to
have
an adverse
effect



======================================================================

on bullock cart traffic.
There are many varieties of bullock
carts,
differing
in
design
and
capacity, and in the strength, and number
of bullocks used to pull.
Taking ail
these
factors
into
account,
the
Indian
Roads
Congress has laid down standards for gradients
to be adopted in different terrains, vide Table
1.
Terrain
is
classi-
fied
by
the
general slope of the country across the highway align-
ment, fo»- which the following criteria should be followed
:

While classifying a
terrain,
short
isolated
stretches
of
varying
terrain should not be taken into consideration.

(1 in 12.5)
Gradients upto the 'ruling gradient* may be used as
a
matter
of course in design.
However in special situations such as
isolated
ever-bridges
in
flat
country
or roads carrying a large volume of
slow moving traffic,
it will be desirable to adopt a
flatter
gradient
of
2 per cent
from
the
angle
of aesthetics, traffic operation, and
safety.
The 'limiting gradients' may be used where the topography of
a
place
compels
this
course
or
where
the
adoption of gentler



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 62

gradients would add enormously to the cost.
In
such
cases,
the
length
of
continuous grade steeper than the ruling gradient should
be as short as possible.
'Exceptional gradients' are meant to be adopted only
in
very
difficult
situations and
for short lengths not exceeding 100 m at a
stretch.
In mountainous and steep terrain,
successive
stretches
of
exceptional
gradients
must
be*
separated by a minimum length of
100 m having gentler gradient (i.e. limiting gradient or flatter).
The rise in elevation over a length of
2 km
shall
not
exceed
100 m in mountainous terrain and 120 m
in steep terrain.
2.6.
Compensation in Grade for Horizontal Curves
2.6.1.
When a vehicle driven by the rear
wheels
travels
on
a curve there
is some loss in
the
tractive
force
as
is
explained
below.
big. 2.
Lei A and B be the rear driving wheels and C and D the front
wheels of a motor vehicle in plan travelling on a curve
(Fig.
2).
It
is
seen
that
the
tractive
force acts in the direction EF while the
front wheels should move in the direction GH so
as
to
follow
the
curve.
As GH
is
inclined
to EF there will be a tendency for the
vehicle to slide in the direction EF.
This tendency
is
resisted
by
the
friction
between the wheels and the road surface, but in effect
there will be a sliding movement when
the
curve
is
sharp.
This
action
takes
up some of the tractive force driving the vehicle for-



======================================================================
PAGE 16 of 62
======================================================================

ward.
In the case of a vehicle
with
driving
wheels
in
the
front
this action would be absent.
To maintain the same speed on curve
as on a straight, more of the tractive effort of the vehicle has there-
fore to be mobilised in case of vehicles driven by rear wheels.
The
effect
of
the
curve on the tractive effort
is, therefore, the same as
that of a grade.
If, in addition to the
curve,
there
occurs
also
a
sharp
grade
the
total
effect
of the curve and grade should not
exceed that of the limiting gradient specified.
2.6.2.
The amount by which the gradients should be eased to
offset
the
extra
tractive
effort
involved
at horizontal curves is
known as 'grade compensation'.
This should be calculated by
the
following formula
:
Grade compensation (per cent) = —jjjr—
Subject to a maximum of 75//? where R
is
the
radius
of
the
curve in metres.
Since grade compensation is not necessary for gradients flatter than
4 per cent,
when
applying
grade
compensation
correction,
the
gradients need not be eased beyond 4 per cent.
3.
DESIGN SPEEDS
3.1.
As stated earlier in
para
1, the
purpose
of
designing
proper
vertical
curves
is
to achieve a safe and sustained speed of
travel on a road.
The designer must therefore know
what
maxi-
mum
speed
is
to
be
sustained on each class of the roads.
The
analytical treatment of vertical curves centres round the one domi-
nating factor "speed".
3.2.
The
design
speeds
laid down
by
the
Indian
Roads
Congress
for
the
various
classes
of
roads are given in Tables 2
and 3.
While
Table 2 pertains
to
rural
(non-urban)
highways,
Table 3
is for urban roads in plains.
4.
THE PURPOSE OF VERTICAL CURVES
4.1.
It
is a well known
fact
that
considerable
forces
are
involved, when
a
change
takes place m the direction of motion of
a body.

move
on
to
another grade, a change of direction of motion in the
vertical plane
is involved.
If this change is not
effected
gradually
the
vehicle
will
be
subjected
to shock and the occupants of the
vehicle will experience discomfort.
Therefore
vertica
curves
are
required to ease off the changes in gradients.
4.2.
Vertical
curves
can
be
classed
into
two
types
viz.,
(1) Summit curves to ease off
intersections
convex
upwards,
and
(2) Valley curves to ease off intersections concave upwards.
4.3.
When a vehicle approaches a summit curve, the view of
the
road
is
cut
off beyond the summit.
Therefore to secure the
required sight distance, the intersection of
the
two
grades
should
be
eased
off by
interposing
a
properly
designed
vertical curve.
For valley curves,
visibility
is
not
a
problem
during
day
time.
However,
for night travel, the design must ensure that the roadway
ahead
is illuminated
by
vehicle
headlights
to
a
sufficient
length
enabling the vehicle to brake to a stop if necessary.
4.4.
Sight Distance Considerations
4.4.1.

: 66-1976

to interfere with visibility.
The dynamics
of movement
over
an
ordinary
summit
curve
is
of
little
consequence.
This
can
be
inferred
from
two
considerations

force
generated
by
the movement
of
the
vehicle
along the curve acts
practically in opposition to the force of
gravity
i and
is,
therefore,
beneficial
in
so
far
as
it
relieves
the
pressure on the tyres and
springs of the vehicle; (2) Vertical
deviation
angles
on
roads
are
so
small
because
the summit
curves
prescribed by the sight dis-
tance are so long and easy that "shock"
is
automatically rendered
imperceptible to the travellers.
5.3.
It, therefore, follows that on summit curves
transitions
are not
essential and simple circular arcs are good enough.
Since
a circular arc has a
constant
radius
of
curvature
throughout
its
length,
it
gives
a
constant
sight
distance
all
along.
From this
viewpoint
the
alternative
of
a
curve
fully
transitional
and
symmetrical
about
the
intersection
is unsuitable, as the radius of
the curve decreases towards its apex and the
visibility on a
vertical
transition
curve varies from point to point and
is smallest across its
apex,
At a given intersection of gradients a
transition
curve
will
have to be much longer than a circular arc for equal visibility across
the apex.
Because of this disadvantage a
transition
curve
is
not
recommended.
5.4.
In
actual
practice
a
simple
parabolic
curve
is
used
instead of the circular arc.
The reasons are
:
(i)
A simple parabola
is nearly congruent with a
circular
arc
between
the
same
tangent
points,
because
on
road
work
the
vertical
deviation
, angles
are
very
small and lengths of curves are very great.
(ii)
A parabola
is very easy
of
arithmetical
manipulation
for computing ordinates.

Formulae for Length of Summit Curves
5 7.1.
The
length
of
a
summit
curve depends
on (i)
the
deviation angle,
(N),
and
(ii)
the
required
sight
distance
(5),
which may be either
the
overtaking sight
distance
or
the
inter-
mediate sight distance,
or
the
minimum
sight distance
whjch
is
equal to the safe stopping distance.
5.7.2.
The gradients on both
sides
of
the
intersection
are
setocred on
the
principles
already
discussed
in
para.
2.5.
The
deviation angle and the chainage
of
the
point
of
intersection
of
the gradients can then be measured and recorded.
5.7.3.
In calculating the length of the curve
two
cases have
to be considered:

nearly

Notes
:
1.
«A' in the above Table is the algebraic difference in grades expres-
sed as percentage.
2.
The length of curves should be subject to minimum
values
given
in Table
7.
5.8.
Minimum Length of Vertical Curve
From equations (6) to (9),
it is seen that
the
length L
of
a
vertical
curve
decreases
as N
and/or
S decreases.
Therefore,
in some cases the
length of the
curve
needed
for
providing
the
required sight distance would be very small.
Further in flat grades
no vertical curve may be
necessary
for visibility; but
for
comfort
in driving and
to avoid shock,
it is necessary to introduce a vertical
curve except perhaps in very flat grades.
The minimum
length of
the curve should be as indicated in Table 7.
This Table also shows
the maximum grade change not requiring a vertical curve.
5.9.
Calculating Ordinates of Summit Curves
For the purposes of plotting and laying out a curve,
its length
is
divided
into
a number of equal chords and the ordinates to the
curve calculated at the ends of these chords.

Highest Point on Summit Curve
It is sometimes important to know the position of the
highest
point
on
a
vertical
curve
for
the purpose of layout of drainage
appurtenances and for ascertaining vertical clearances in
restricted
locations as road under bridges, etc.
When thfc two
grades
are equal the curve would be symmet-
rical about the vertical bisector of the
intersecting
angle
and
the
highest point would also lie on this bisector.
When the two grades
are
unequal
the curve would be tilted and the highest point of the
curve would
lie on the side of the flatter gradient.

Length of Valley Curves
6.3.1.
Valley
curves
should
have
the
shape
of
square
parabola
similar
to summit
curves.
A
number
of criteria are
available for
establishing
the
lengths
of
valley
curves.
Most
commonly used among these arc
(i) headlight
sight
distance which
is recommended
in this publication and
(ii) rider comfort.
6.3.2.
When
a vehicle traverses a valley curve
at
night, the
portion of road lighted
ahead
depends
on the height of the head-
lights above the road surface and the direction
of the
light beam.
The valley curve should be long enough so that the distance
ahead
lighted by the headlights
is
at
least
equal to
the safe
stopping
sight distance.
For determining the length of valley
curves
based
on the above considerations the following criteria apply
:
(i) Height of headlight above road surface
is 0.75 m
(ii) The
useful
beam
of
headlight
is
upto
one
degree
•upwards from the grade of the road; and
(iii) The height of object
is
nil.
6.3.3.
The design
criteria
for
determining
the
length
of
valley
curves
are
depicted
in
Fig.
11.
From
the
geometry,
equations for calculating the length are as follows
:
Case
(i) When the length of the curve exceeds the required
sight distance,
i.e. L
is greater than S
NS'1
^
1.50 + 0.035 S
Case
(ii) When the
iength
of
the
curve
is less
than the
required sight distancv,
.c
L
is less than S
1.50 + 0.035 S



======================================================================
PAGE 32 of 62
======================================================================
22
i
ifi.
11.
In both cases
N — deviation angle, i.e. the algebraic difference between
the
two grades
L ~ length of parabolic vertical curve in metres
5 = stopping sight distance in metres
Length of valley curve for various grade differences
is
given
in Table
6,
and
in
graphical
form
in Plate 4.
These are only
minimum values, and longer lengths should
be provided
wherever
feasible.
6.3.4.
On valley curves,
the
gravitational
and
centrifugal
forces act combincdly resulting in extra pressure on the
tyres
and
springs of the vehicle
The effect of this on travel comfort depends
on several factors such as the vehicle body
suspension,
tyre
flexi-
bility, weight carried, etc.
The
broad
conclusions
from
limited
observations
show
that
for
riding comfort
on valley curves, the
radial acceleration should
not
exceed 0.3
metre per
second per
second.
The length
of
vertical
curve
required
to satisfy
this
comfort factor
is only about 75 per cent of that required to
satisfy
the headlight sight distance requirement.
It
is,
therefore,
recom-
mended that the length of valley curves for design should be based
on the
considerations
discussed
in
para
6.3.2.
The
values
as
derived
should,
however,
be
subject
to
the
minimum lengths
indicated in Table 7.



======================================================================
PAGE 33 of 62
======================================================================
23
6.3.5.
Drainage considerations become important, for valley
curves between a descending grade and
an
ascending
grade as in
Fig.
10(a).
For drainage
purposes,
it
is desirable that the
curve
has a minimum gradient of 0.5 percent
i( the side drains
are lined
-
and
1.0 per cent
if these are
unlined
6.4
Finding the Lowest point on a Valley Curve
When
a
valley
curve
is included
between
descending and
ascending grades,
it
is necessary
to know the lowest
point
on
the
curve for fixing the positions of culverts, drain
outlets,
etc.
When
the two grades are unequal, the lowest point occurs on
the
side
of
the flatter gradient
Fig.
J 2.
In Fig.
12, let the lowest point be distant
x,
from A.
From
derivations similar
to those
for summit curves given in para 5.10,
it can be shown that the lowest point
is at a
distance of——
L
from point A.
6.5.
Computing Ordinates of Valley Curves
Since valley curve
is also in the shape of
a
square
parabola,
the ordinates can be calculated similar to summit curves
described
in para 5.9.

PRACTICAL DESIGN OF VERTICAL CURV tS ON HIGHWAYS
7.1.
General
In
tne
application
to
actual
problems
of
the
principles
enunciated
in
the
previous
Sections,
the following points deserve
to be borne in mind.



======================================================================
PAGE 35 of 62
======================================================================
25
The vertical curvature of roads should 'bjt bold in
design
and
long easy curves should take in all minor changes in ground
levels.
As
far
as
possible, numerous changes in gradients joined together
with
short vertical
curves should be avoided, except in mountain-
ous
country
where
the
adoption
of
long and easy curves might
become very costly.
The economic aspect of
vehicle
operation
is
very
important
in
the choice of grades since the greater consump-
tion of fuel and the heavier wear and tear
of
tyres
and
brakes
of
vehicles in traversing a wide range of vertical rises and falls
would
add heavily to operation costs.
In the design of the grade line of a road and
its
co-ordination
with the horizontal alignment, the following points of guidance
will
be helpful
:
(i) The
vertical
alignment
should
provide for a smooth longitudinal
profile consistent with category of the the road and
lie of the terrain.
Grade changes
should
not
be
too
frequent as to cause kinks and
visual discontinuities in the profile.
Desirably, there
should
be no
change in grade within a distance of 150 m.
(it) A short valley curve within an otherwise continuous profile is
unde-
sirable
since
this
tends
to
distort the perspective view and can be
hazardous.
(iii) Broken-back grade lines, i.e. two vertical curves in
the
same
direc-
tion
separated
by
a
short tangent, should be avoided due to poor
appearance, and preferably replaced by a single long curve.
(iv) Decks of small cross-drainage structures,
(i.e.
culverts
and
minor
bridges) should follow the same profile as the flanking road
section,
without any break in the grade line.
(v) For
small
bridges
upto
30 m
span and
having horizontal deck,
it
would be preferable to combine the flanking sections
into
a
single
vertical curve.
(vi) The overall appearance of a highway can be enhanced
considerably
by judicious combination of the horizontal and
vertical
alignments.
Plan
and
profile of the road should not be designed independently
but in unison so as
to
produce
an
appropriate
three-dimensional
effect.
Proper
co-ordination
in
this
respect
will
ensure
safety,
improve utility of the highway and contribute to overall aesthetics.
(vii) The
degree
of
curvature
should
be
in
proper
balance with the
gradients.
Straight alignment or flat horizontal curves at the expense
of steep or long grades, or excessive
curvature
in
a
road
with
flat
grades, do not constitute balanced designs and should be avoided.



======================================================================

======================================================================
26
(viii) Vertical curvature superimposed upon horizontal
curvature
gives
a
pleasing
effect.
As
such
the vertical and horizontal curves should
coincide as far as possible and their length should
be more
or
less
equal.
If this is difficult for any reason, the horizontal curve should
be somewhat longer than the vertical curve.
(ix) Sharp horizontal curves should be avoided at or
near
the apex
of
pronounced summit/sag vertical curves from safety considerations.
7.2.
Design of Summit Carves
The
design
of
summit
curves follows the procedure given
below.
7.2.1.
On a longitudinal section of the road
drawn
to
scale
are
fixed
the
economical
gradients, selected by taking into consi-
deration the amount
of
earthwork
and
other
incidental
works
involved.
The
value
of
two
gradients
meeting at a point being
known, the deviation angle N is known (see para. 2.4).
7.2.2.
The
sight
distance
applicable
to the section of the
road
is selected, taking into account the classification of
the
road,
the
topography
of
the
country and whether the section lies in an
overtaking zone or non-overtaking zone (see IRC 66-1976).
7.2.3.
The value of N and S being thus
known,
the
appro-
priate length of the summit curve, L, corresponding to these
values
is read off from Plate
1, 2 or 3, as applicable.
7.2.4.
The value of L as read from the graph
is then
round-
ded off so that the modified value is
divisible
into
a
number
of
equal
chords
of a reasonable length not exceeding JR/200, where R
is the radius of the curve at the apex given by R = L/N.
7.2.5.
By
reading
the
value
of M for the length designed
from the graph, the depth of cutting required
for
constructing
the
curve
is obtained.
This depth may be checked to see
if the
cutting
would be excessive.
7.2.6.
The constant
<4a"
is calculated from equation [2]
and
the first ordinate y\ % obtained.
The other
ordinates
and
reduced
levels of the various station points on the curve are then
calculated
and tabulated for facility in setting out in the field.



======================================================================

7.3.
Design of Valley Curves
7.3.1.
The
gradient
lines
are
marked
on
the longitudinal
section of the road
and
the
deviation
angle,
N 9
calculated
as
explained in para 7.2.1.
7.3.2.
The design speed, V y appropriate to the class
of
road
and the topography of the country,
is noted down.
7.3.3.
By using the graphs in Plate 4
is
obtained
the
length
of the curve for the corresponding values of TV and V.
This length,
L,
is
rounded
off
so
as
to
be
divisible
into a number of equal
chords of a convenient length not exceeding 7?/200.
7.3.4.
From
equation
[2]
the
constant "a"
and
the first
ordinate y\ (para. 6.5) are obtained and
the
other
ordinates
and
reduced levels of the station points are calculated
from
these and
tabulated for setting out in the field.
7.4.
Shock-free Curves at Humps
7.4.1.
It
is
desirable
that
the deck or top level of culverts
should be fixed in line with the grade line
of
the
flanking
sections
of the
road
so
that no hump occurs.
This may not, however, be
possible on an existing road where culverts occur with
deck
levels
higher
than
the
general
road
levels, but the height of hump not
sufficient enough to obstruct the sight
line.
For
such
cases,
the
approaches
on either side should be provided with smooth vertical
curves
(summit
and
" valley
curves).
The
length of these curves
should not be less than the minimum lengths indicated in Table 7.
7.5.
Measurement of Vertical Sight Distance
7.5.1.
As
discussed
in
earlier
paras, one of the important
pourposes of providing a vertical curve
is
to
ensure
the
necessary
visibility
or
the
sight
distance along
the grade line.
Provision of
sight distance must therefore
receive
attention
right
from
early
stages
where
the
alignment
is
still flexible and subject to adjust-
ments.
Quick
appraisals
are
best
had
by graphical means.
By
determining graphically
the
available
sight
distances
from
the
longitudinal
sections
and
recording them at convenient intervals,
deficiencies in visibility become evident well before detailed
design
is
already
under
way.
Perusal
of
such
records will enable the



======================================================================
PAGE 38 of 62
======================================================================
28
designer to decide on what modifications to make in profile for
the
required
visibility,
and
to
otherwise
create a more balanced and
effective design.
For existing roads under improvements too,
such
a study will be highly useful in determining the visibility deficiencies
and making the necessary improvements to the grade line.
7.5.2.
As
recommended
in
IRC
: SP
: 19
"Manual
for
Survey, Investigation and Preparation of Road Projects*',
the longi-
tudinal sections are plotted to the following scales
:.
(i) Built-up areas and stretches in hilly terrain—!
: 1000
for
horizontal
scale and
1
: 100 for vertical scale.
(ii) Plain and rolling terrain— 1
: 2500 for
horizoni-.l
scale and
1
: 250
for vertical scale.
If L
is the length of the vertical curve
required
for
gradient
N, its radius R
is equal to~
.
The radius «r' for purposes of
plot-
V
ting
is then i?x uo where V
is the vertical scale of the drawing
and
H
the
horizontal.
Having
known
the
value
of *r\ the vertical
curve
is easily drawn on the profile with the aid of spline or railway
curves.
For
the
recommended scales of plotting having vertical
:
horizontal scale ratio of 1:10,
the
error
in
measurement
of
sight
distance will not be more than about 5
per cent.
7.5.3.
Measurement
of
vertical
sight
distance
at summit
curves may be done from plotted profiles of
the
highway
by
the
method
illustrated
in
Fig.
14.
A transparent straight edge with
parallel
edges
1.2 m
apart
and
a
dotted
line 0.15 m from the
upper edge, as per the vertical

employed
for
these
measurements.
The
transparent
strip
is
placed on the profile with the lower edge at the
station
for
which
the available sight distance
is desired and the strip revolved
about
this
point until the upper edge touches the profile.
Stopping sight
distance available
is then the distance between the
first station and
the point of intesection of the 0.15 m line with
the
profile.
Over-
taking/intermediate
sight
distance,
in
similar
manner,
is
the
distance between the
initial station and the point where lower edge
of the strip meets the profile.
Tf overhead obstructions to visibility
like underbridges, etc. have also been marked on
the profile,
then
the graphical method explained above will unveil visibility deficien-
cies caused by these.
7.5.4.
Availability of headlight sight
distance
along
valley
curves
can
also
be checked in a similar way except that the tem-
plate for checking will be differ
as explained in Fig.
15.
At the
Fig.

point
where
the sight distance
is to be checked, the lower edge of
the tamplate
is kept tangential to the road surface, and
the
head-
light distance
is the distance between starting station and the
point
of intetersection between the road profile and light ray line (marked
1° upward
frorii the headlight)

An urban
arterial
having
divided
carriageway
is to cross a
railway line over a bridge 25 m span.
The difference in deck level
of the bridge and the general road level
is 6.0 m.
Design suitable
profile for the approaches.
As the location is
in urban area where a lot
of slow moving
traffic
is expected,
it
is preferable
to
adopt
a
flat
gradient of
1
in
40 to
1
in 50.
For
the
present case, adopt a gradient of
1
in
50,
or 0.02.
Stopping sight distance will apply
for
divided
carriageways.
For the design speed of 80 km/h (vide IRC
: 86-1983),
S = 120 m
(i)
Design of summit curve
As the bridge span
is short, less than 30 m,
it will be
prefer-
able to provide
a
single
summit
curve
encompassing the bridge
deck as well.
N = 0.02+0.02 = 0.04
L(from Plate
1) =
131 m, or adopt 150 m
=S = 3750 m
The maximum difference in level between
the horizontal and
the curve at the centre of bridge
(see Fig.
19)
Tbis can be accommodated
in the wearing course.

Valley curve
For
the
gradient
of N = 0.Q2 and design speed of 80 km/h,
the
minimum lengths given Table 7 will apply.
That
is, the length
of valley curve on either side
will be 50 m.
The proposed profile
is shown in Fig.
19.
PROBLEM NO.

The deck of a slab culvert on a
National
Highway
is 0.6 m
above the general road level on the flanks.
Design suitable shock-
free curves for the culvert approaches.
As the hump
caused
by
the
culvert will
not obstruct
the
visibility, the minimum lengths from riding
comfort
considerations
(see Table 7) will govern the design.
Referring to Fig. 20, let slope of the grade line be N.
