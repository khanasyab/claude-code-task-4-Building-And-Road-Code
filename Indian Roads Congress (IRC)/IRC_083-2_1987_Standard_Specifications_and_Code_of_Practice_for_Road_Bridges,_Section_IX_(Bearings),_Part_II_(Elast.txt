The Bridges Committee considered
and
approved
the
said
draft in their meeting held at New Delhi on the
28th
April,
1987.
Later
the
Code
of
Practice
was
approved
by
the
Executive
Committee
and
the
Council
in
their
meetings
held on the 28th
April, and 22nd May, 1987 respectively.
This Specification and Code of Practice
is being
brought
out
in
four
parts,
Part
I
deals
with
Metallic Bearings, Part II with
Elastomeric Bearings, Part III with PTFE
Bearings,
and
Part
IV
with Expansion Joints.
The Part
I of the Code relating to Metallic Bearings has since
been published as IRC:83-1982.
The provisions of this Code Part
II, pertain -^ to Elastomeric
Bearings are meant to
serve
as
a guide to be':

construction
engineers,
but
mere compliance with the
provisions
stipulated herein will not relieve them in any way of their
respon-

SCOPE
912.1.
This Section of the Specifications (referred to as 'Code*
hereinafter)
shall
apply
to laminated rectangular free elastomeric
bearings, Fig. 8, for common
use
in
road
bridges
and
satisfying
the following:
(i) The internal layers of elastomer
shall be
of
equal
thickness,
having
elastomer cover
on
top,
bottom and
sides and the entire
bearing
vulcanised as a single homogenous block.
(ii) The top and bottom
elastomer
surfaces
shall
directly
bear on the
structure faces and any displacement of
the
bearing safe-guarded by
only interface friction, without the aid of adhesive or other external
anchoring devices.
(iii) No dowel holes in elastomer and laminate shall be provided indudiog
those filled in subsequently.
(vi) For
locations where
the minimum atmospheric temperature
drops
below zero °C for continuous periods of 24 hours or more, the
provi-
sion of this Code shall not apply.
912.2.
Relevant
provisions
of
this
Code,
suitably
supple-
mented
and
modified
may
be
applied
to some
other
types of
elastomeric bearings as given below, subject to
prior approval
of
the engineer
:
(1) Free bearing circular
(ii) Free bearing—rectangular or circular with dowel holes (for alignment
of laminates during fabrication), subsequently filled in
tiu} Free bearing, rectangular or
circular, secured
against displacement
with the aid of adhesive or other positive attachment.
(iv) Fixed bearing, anchored with dowels.
913.

previously
disordered polymer segments of repeating patterns into
geometric
symmetry) promoted by

conditions of manufacture to be supplied for a
particular project.
918.2.1.
The size and composition of acceptance
lot shall be
got approved by the engineer.
918.2.2.
For
the
purpose

(i) A tot size of 24 or
larger
number of
bearings shall be defined as a

(ii) A lot lize of lest than 24 bearings shall be defined as a small lot.
918.2.3.
When
the
number
of
bearings
of equal or near
equal size for a single bridge
project
is
large and

testing
level 2
shall
be applicable to
small lots only, unless otherwise specified and shall not involve any
destructive testing of finished bearings.

details
for
the bearings,
duly
certified
by
the
manufacturer
shall
also
be
appended:
Name of manufacturer
Date of manufacture
Elastomer grade used
Bearing dimensions
Production batch No.
Acceptance lot No.
Date of testing
Specific bridge location, if any
Explanation of markings used on the bearing
919.3.
All
bearings
shall
have
suitable
index
markings
identifying the information given in Clause
919.2.
The
markings
shall be made in indelible ink or flexible
paint and
if
practicable
should be visible after installation.
The top
of
the
bearing
and
direction of installation shall be indicated.
920
INSTALLATION
920.1.
Care
shall
be
taken
in
packing,
transportation,
storage and handling to avoid any mechanical damage, contamina-
tion with oil,
grease
and
dirt,
undue
exposure
to
sunlight
and
weather.
920.2.
Installation of multiple bearings one behind the other
on a single line of support
is not permitted.
920.3.
All
the
bearings
installed
along
a
single
line
of
support shall be of identical dimensions.
920.4.
Bearings
must
be
placed
between
true
horizontal
surfaces (maximum tolerance 0.2 per cent perpendicular
to
load)
and at true plan position of their control lines marked on
receiving
surfaces (maximum tolerance ± 3 mm).
Concrete surfaces
shall
be
free
from
local irregularities (maximum tolerance ± 1mm in
height).
920.4.1.
Design shall be checked for
the
actual
inclination
in seating if larger inaccuracies than those specified in Clause 920.4.
are permitted.
920.5.
For cast-in-place concrete construction of superstruc-
ture, where bearings arc installed prior to its concreting, the forms
around the bearings shall be soft enough for easy removal.

bearings
snugly
and
prevent
any
leakage of

Any
mortar .contaminating
the
bearings
during
concreting shall be completely removed before setting.
920.6.
For precast concrete or steel supci structure elements,
fixing
of
bearing
to
them
may
be
done
by
application
of
epoxy
resin
adhesive
to
interface,
after
specified
surface
preparation. The specifications for adhesive material, workmanship
and control shall be approved by the engineer. Care shall be taken
to guard against faulty
application
and consequent
behaviour
of
the adhesive layer as a
lubricant.
The
bonding
by
the
adhesive
shall be deemed effective
only
as
a
device
for
installation
and
shall not be deemed to
secure
bearing
against
displacement
for
purpose of design.
920.7.
As
a
measure
of ample
safety
against
accidental
displacement, the bearings shall be placed in a recess as shown
in
Fig. 9.
(This provision shall
not
be deemed
to secure
bearings
against displacement for the purpose of design).'
921.
MAINTENANCE
921.1.
The
bearings
shall
be
subjected
to planned main-
tenance care.
921.1.1.
The
exposed
bearing
surface
shall
be maintained
clean and free from contamination with grease or oil, etc.
921.1.2.
Annual routine maintenance
inspection
or
special
maintenance inspection of all bearings shall be made to
check
for
any surface cracking or signs of damage, deterioration or distress.
921.2.
Damaged bearings shall be replaced immediately. To
avoid differences in stiffness, all adjacent bearings on the same
line
of support shall also be replaced.
921.2.1.
Arrangements
for
insertion
of
jacks
to
lift
the
biidge deck shall be made in detailing of
the structure
(Fig.
9 for
a possible arrangement).
Note
:
The
lifting
of
a
cast-in-placc
post-tensioned
bridge deek for relieving
time dependent deformation shortly after installation of bearings
should
be avoided.
In case such lifting is unavoidable, the lifting arrangement,
proper seating of the girder on the bearing, etc. shall be
rigidly
control-
led to avoid any risk of misalignment.
