GUIDELINES FOR THE USE OF DRY LEAN CONCRETE AS
SUB-BASE FOR RIGID PAVEMENT
1 INTRODUCTION
IRC:SP:49 "Guidelines for the Use of Dry Lean Concrete as Sub-base for Rigid Pavement"
was published in
1 998. TheRigid Pavement (H-3) Committee decided to revise the IRC:SP:49
with lower 7-day compressive strength as per latest trend in other Countries e.g. Australia &
other countries. The revised draft was also to include mineral admixtures i.e. flyash & GBFS.
For this task, a sub-group under the convenor ship of Dr. S.C. Maiti including Dr. L.R. Kadiyali,
Shri P.L. Bongirwar, Shri M.C. Venkatesha, Shri Ashutosh Gautam & Shri J.B. Sengupta as
Members was formed in the meeting of H-3 Committee held on
16'*" April, 2012.
The draft was prepared based on tests carried out at CRRI on DLC using OPC, PPC and
PSC, for the desired 7-day compressive strength of concrete. The Rigid Pavement Committee
(H-3) discussed the draft which was prepared by the sub-group
in series of meetings. The
Rigid Pavement Committee (H-3) approved the final draft in its meeting held on
7''' December,
2013 for placing before the HSS Committee. The Highways Specifications and Standards
Committee (HSS) approved
this document
in
its meeting held on
7*'' January, 2014. The
Executive Committee
in
its meeting held on
9'^ January, 2014 approved this document for
placing before the IRC Council for approval. The IRC Council in its meeting held at Guwahati
(Assam) on 19*^ January, 2014 approved the draft revision of IRC:SP:49 "Guidelines for the
Use of Dry Lean Concrete as Sub-base for Rigid Pavement" for publishing.

2 WIDTH AND THICKNESS OF DLC SUB-BASE
The DLC Sub=base shall extend beyond the pavement edges by 500 mm to facilitate further
construction operations and provide an adequate support for the concrete slab. The extra
width
facilitates the movement of paver tracks on the extended DLC. The off-set
will be
200 mm in case of semi mechanized or manual construction.
Although the actual thickness will be governed by the design considerations, a thickness of
minimum 150 mm
is recommended for
all major projects of State Highways and National
Highways. When DLC
is adopted as sub base in case of roads other than the above roads
its thickness of 100 mm
is recommended. For further details, IRC:62 'Guidelines for Design
and Construction of Low Volume Roads', may be referred, where
in different combinations
of constructing other type of sub bases
involving cement treated bases have also been
provided.
3 MATERIALS

IRC:SP:49-2014
4 CONCRETE COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH AND
CONCRETE MIX PROPORTIONING
4.1
Concrete Compressive Strength
The average compressive strength of each consecutive group of 5 concrete cubes shall
not be less than 7 MPa at 7 days.
In addition, the compressive strength of any individual
concrete cube shall not be less than 5.5 MPa at 7 days. The design mix complying with these
requirements shall be worked out before start of work.
4.2
Concrete Mix Proportions
The concrete mix shall be proportioned with a maximum aggregate cement ratio of 14:1 where
ORG
is used and
12:1 where PPC or PSC
is used. The minimum cementltious materials
content shall not be less than 140 kg/cum of concrete.
If this minimum cementltious materials
content is not sufficient to produce the concrete of the specified strength,
it shall be increased
as necessary. The flyash or GBFS content shall be 15-30 percent or 25-50 percent by weight
of cementltious materials respectively, as given in Clause 3.4. The concrete mix proportions
are based on Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) test results (Annexure-B).
The optimum water content shall be decided so as to ensure full compaction under rolling. Too
much water will cause the concrete to be heaving up before the wheels and to be picked up on
the wheels of the roller. Too
little water will lead to inadequate compaction and segregation,
a low in-situ strength and an open textured surface. Trial mixes of dry lean concrete shall be
prepared with water content of 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5 and 7.0 percent of the total weight of material.
Optimum moisture and density shall be established by preparing cubes with varying moisture
contents, and moisture-density curve shall be drawn. Special vibratory hammer shall be used
for compacting the specimens. While laying sub-base
in main carriageway; the DLC may
have
1 percent higher moisture content, to compensate evaporation loss during transport.
5 DRAINAGE LAYER
To facilitate quick disposal of water that
is
likely to enter the subgrade, a drainage layer
(GSB) shall be provided below the sub-base throughout the road width. For further details on
the drainage layer, IRC:58 may be consulted.
6 SUBGRADE
The subgrade shall conform to the grades and cross-sections on the drawings and shall be
uniformly compacted to the modified Proctor density not less than 97 percent, that is normally
specified. Reference may be made to IS:2720 (Part 8) for this. The lean concrete sub-base
shall not be laid on a subgrade softened by rain after its final preparation, surface trenches
and soft spots,
if any, must be properly back-filled and compacted to avoid any weak spot.
As far as possible, the construction traffic shall be avoided on the prepared subgrade. A day
before placing of the sub-base, the subgrade surface shall be given a fine spray of water and
rolled with one or two passes of a smooth wheeled roller after a lapse of 2-3 hours in order
to stabilise loose surface.
If found necessary, another fine spray of water may be applied just
before placing the sub-base.

======================================================================
IRC:SP:49-2014
7 CONSTRUCTION
7.1
Trial Mixes
Trial mixes of dry lean concrete shall be prepared with moisture contents of 5.0,
5.5,
6.0,
6.5 and 7.0 percent using cement content requirement of aggregate-cement ratio specified
in para 4.2. Optimum moisture and density shall be established by preparing cubes with
varying moisture contents. Compaction of the mix shall be done in three layers with vibratory
hammer fitted with a square or rectangular foot. After establishing the optimum moisture, a
set of six cubes shall be cast at that moisture for the determination of compressive strength at
3 and 7 days. Trial mixes shall be repeated if the strength is not satisfactory either by increasing
cement content or using higher grade of cement. After the mix design
is approved, a
trial
section shall be constructed in accordance with para 7.9.
If during the construction of the
trial length, the optimum moisture content determined as
above
is unsatisfactory, suitable changes may be made
in the moisture content to achieve
a satisfactory mix. The cube specimens prepared with the changed moisture content should
satisfy the strength requirement. Before production of the mix, natural moisture content of the
aggregate should be determined on a day-to-day basis, so that the moisture content could
be adjusted. The mix finally designed should neither stick to the rollers nor become too dry
resulting in ravelling of surface.
7.2
General
The pace and programme of the lean concrete sub-base construction
shall be matching
suitably with the programme of construction of the cement concrete pavement over
it. The
sub-base shall be overlaid with Paving Quality Concrete (PQC) pavement not before 7 days
after the sub-base construction.
7.3
Batching and Mixing
The batching plant shall be capable of separately proportioning each type of material by
weight. The capacity of batching and mixing plant shall be at least 25 percent higher than the
proposed capacity for the laying arrangements. The batching and mixing shall be carried out
preferably in a forced action central batching and mixing plant having necessary automatic
controls to ensure accurate proportioning and mixing. Calibration of the batching and mixing
plant shall be carried out at regular intervals, normally every month. Other types of mixers
shall be permitted subject to demonstration of their satisfactory performance during the trial
length construction.
7.4
Transporting
Plant mixed lean concrete shall be discharged immediately from the mixer, transported directly
to the point where
it is to be laid and protected from the weather by covering with tarpaulin
during transit. The concrete shall be transported by tipping trucks, sufficient
in number to
ensure a continuous supply of material to feed the laying equipment to work at a uniform
speed and in an uninterrupted manner. The lead of the batching plant to the paving site shall
be such that the travel time available from mixing to paving as specified
in a para 7.6.2 will
be adhered to.

======================================================================
1RC:SP:49-2014
7.5
Placing
"
-
/
Lean concrete shall be laid by a hydrostatic paver. The equipment shall be capable of laying
the material
in one layer in an even manner without segregation, so that, after compaction
the total thickness achieved
is as specified. The paving machine shall have high amplitude
ramping bars to give good
initial compaction to the sub-base. For more details, IRC:SP:86
'Guidelines for Selection, Operation, and Maintenance of Paver Finishers' may be referred.
The laying of the two-lane road sub-base shall be done
in
full width. For a pavement more
than two-lanes, the operation may be carried out by two pavers
in echelon separated by
appropriate distance (15-20
m). Transverse and
longitudinal
construction joints
shall be
staggered by 500-1000 mm and 200-400 mm respectively from the corresponding joints
in
the overlaying joints in the overlaying concrete slabs.
7.6
Compaction
7.6.1
The compaction
shall be carried out immediately after the material
is
laid and
levelled.
In order to ensure thorough compaction, rolling shall be continued on the full width
till there
is no further visible movement under the roller and the surface
is closed. The dry
density obtained (from the average of density obtained from three density holes of 200 mm
dia.) shall not be less than 97 percent of that achieved during the trial length construction.
The densities achieved at the edges i.e. 0.5 m from the edge shall not be less than 95 percent
of that achieved during the trial construction as per para 7.9. Rolling shall commence on the
lower edge of camber/one side slope and proceed towards centre/outer edge.
7.6.2
The spreading, compacting and finishing of the lean concrete
shall be carried
out as rapidly as possible and the operation shall be arranged so as to ensure that the time
between mixing of the first batch of concrete
in any transverse section of the layer and the
compaction and final finishing of the same shall not exceed 90 minutes, when the concrete
temperature is between 25 and 30°C and 120 minutes,
if less than 25°C. This period may be
reviewed
in the light of the results of the trial length but,
in no case shall
it exceed 2 hours.
Work shall not proceed when the temperature of the concrete exceeds 30°C.
If necessary,
chilled water or addition of ice may be resorted to for bringing down the temperature.
It
is
desirable to stop concreting when the ambient temperature is above 35°C. After compaction
has been completed, roller shall not stand on the compacted surface for the duration of the
curing period except during commencement of next day's work near the location where work
was terminated the previous day.
7.6.3
Double Drum smooth-wheeled vibratory rollers of minimum 80 to 100 KN static
weight are considered to be suitable for rolling dry lean concrete.
In case, any other roller is
proposed, the same will be used after establishing
its performance. The number of passes
required
to obtain maximum compaction depends on the thickness of the lean concrete,
compactibility of the mix, and the weight and type of the roller etc. and the same as well as
the total requirement of rollers for the job shall be determined during trial run by measuring
the in-situ density and the scale of the work to be undertaken.
7.6.4
In addition
to the number of passes required
for compaction there
shall be a
preliminary pass without vibration
to bed the lean concrete down and again a
final pass
without vibration to remove roller marks and to smoothen the surface.
6



======================================================================
PAGE 15 of 20
======================================================================
IRC:SP:49-2014
Special care shall be exercised during compaction near joints, kerbs, channels, side forms
and around gullies and manholes.
In case adequate compaction is not achieved by the roller
at these points, use of plate vibrator will be permitted.
7.6.5
The
final lean concrete surface on completion of compaction and immediately
before overlaying, shall be well closed, free from movement under roller and free from ridges,
cracks, loose material, pot holes, ruts or other defects. The final surface shall be inspected
immediately on completion and all loose, segregated or defective areas shall be corrected by
using fresh lean concrete material laid and compacted. For repairing honeycombed surface,
fresh concrete of the grade of parent concrete, with aggregates of size 10 mm and below,
shall be spread and compacted.
It
is necessary to check the level of the rolled surface for
compliance. Any level deficiency should be corrected after applying concrete with aggregate
of size 10 mm and below,
after roughening the surface, when the concrete
is
still green.
Similarly, the surface regularity also should be checked with 3 m straight edge. The deficiency
should be made up with concrete with aggregates of size
1 0 mm and below. At the end of the
day's work/stoppage of work due to breakdown of any machinery, in the chain, the work shall
be finished straight by placing a channel at the end and placing concrete in slope beyond the
channel. On the next day the channel
is removed and minor cutting to obtain vertical face as
per para 7.7 may be needed.
7.6.6
Segregation of concrete in the dumpers shall be controlled by moving the dumper
back and forth while discharging the mix into
it and by other means. Even paving operation
shall be such that the mix does not segregate.
7.7
Joints
Day's work shall be stopped by vertical joints. The edge of the compacted material shall be
cut back to a vertical face, when work starts next day.
7.8
Curing
As soon as the lean concrete surface is completed, curing shall commence.
a)
Curing shall be done by covering the surface by hessian cloth
in two layers
which shall be kept continuously moist for 7 days by sprinkling water.
b)
If water-curing is not possible, the curing shall be done by spraying with liquid
curing compound. The curing compound shall be white pigmented type with
water retention index of minimum 90 percent, when tested in accordance with
the test method given
in Annexure-A. To check the efficiency of the curing
compound, the supplier shall be required to provide the test certificate from a
recognized laboratory. Curing compound shall be sprayed immediately after
rolling
is complete. As soon as the curing compound has lost
its tackiness,
the surface shall be covered with wet hessian for three days.
7.9
Trial Length Construction
7.9.1
The
trial length shall be constructed
(in two days), at least 14 days
in advance
of the proposed date of commencement of work. The length of trial construction shall be a
minimum of 60 m length and for full width of the pavement. The trial length shall contain the
7

IRC:SP:49-2014
construction of at least one transverse construction joint involving hardened concrete and
sub-base to be laid subsequently, so as to demonstrate the soundness of the procedure. In
one day trial length of not more than 30 m shall be laid.
7.9.2
In order to determine and demonstrate the optimum moisture content which results
in the maximum dry density of the mix compacted by the rolling equipment and the minimum
cement content that
is necessary to achieve the strength
stipulated,
trial mixes shall be
prepared as per para 7.1
.
7.9.3
After the construction
of the
trial
length, the
in-situ density of the freshly
laid
material
shall be determined by sand replacement method
(as per IS:2720
part-8) with
200 mm dia density hole. Three density holes shall be made at locations equally spaced along
a diagonal that bisect the trial length; average of these densities shall be determined. These
main density holes shall not be made in the strip 500 mm from the edge. The average density
obtained from the three samples collected shall be the reference density and
is considered
as 100 percent. The field density of regular work will be compared with this reference density
in accordance with para 7.6.1. A few cores may be cut so as to check segregation or any
other deficiency and also to ascertain strength.
7.9.4
The hardened concrete
shall be cut over 3 m width and reversed
to inspect
the bottom surface for any segregation taking place. The
trial length shall be constructed
after making necessary changes in the grading of aggregates and the mix to eliminate any
segregation of the mix. The lower surface shall not have honey-combing and the aggregates
shall not be held loosely at the edges.
7.9.5
The
trial length shall be outside the main works. After the approval of the
trial
length construction has been given, the materials, mix proportions, moisture content, mixing,
laying, compaction, plant, construction procedures shall not be changed.
7.10
Control of Thickness, Density and Strength
The tolerances for thickness shall be ± 10 mm. The dry density of the laid material shall be
determined from density holes at locations equally spaced along a diagonal that bisects each
2000 sq.m or part thereof, of material laid each day. The control of strength shall be exercised
by taking samples of dry lean concrete for making cubes at the rate of 3 samples for each
1000 sq.m or part thereof laid each day. The cube samples shall be compacted, cured and
tested in accordance with IS:51 6.
7.11
Opening to Traffic
No heavy commercial vehicles like trucks and buses shall be permitted on the lean concrete
sub-base after its construction. Light vehicles
if unavoidable may, however, be allowed after
7 days of its construction with prior approval of the Engineer.

Annexure-A
(Refer Clause 7.8)
Test on Curing Compound
The efficiency of the curing compounds
in terms of the extent, to which they reduce the
evaporation loss of water from the surface of a standard mortar slab, can be determined by
test. The test method provides the information on the escape of moisture from the surface of
the mortar specimen, which may lead to loss of strength, shrinkage or low abrasion resistance
of the hardened dry lean concrete.
Test Procedure
The metal rectangular mould shall be non-absorbent, watertight and rigidly constructed. The
size of the mould
is 150 x 300 mm at the top, 145 x 295 mm at the bottom, and 50 mm
deep measured on the inside. Ordinary portland cement and graded standard sand
in the
proportion
1 :3 and a water-cement ratio of 0.40 to 0.44 (by weight) shall be used, to produce
a flow of 35 ± 5 percent, in 10 drops of the flow table.
The mortar test slab specimen (3 No.) shall be made by placing mortar in two layers and
tamping 50 times with the tamper, on each layer. The top surface of the test slabs will be
finished with a float. On the dry surface of the specimens, within
1 hour of finishing, the curing
compound shall be sprayed. The curing compound shall be of such character that,
it hardens
within 30 minutes after application. The specimens along with the moulds shall be weighed
accurately to the nearest
1 gm, and shall be kept
in the humidity cabinet (with exposure
temperature of 38°C and a relative humidity of 35 percent) for 72 hours. After taking out
from the humidity cabinet, the specimens along with the moulds shall be weighed accurately
again to the nearest
1 gm. The average percentage retention of the mixing water shall be
calculated.
