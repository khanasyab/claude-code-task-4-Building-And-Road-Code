================================================================================

2.1 HIERARCHICAL POSITION CLAIMS (Lines 32-35)
-----------------------------------------------
TARGET FILE CLAIMS:
- Below: Superintending Engineer (Circle head)
- Above: Divisional Officer/Executive Engineer
- Role: Field operational authority for site supervision

2.2 BNR 1994 SOURCE VERIFICATION
---------------------------------
BNR 1994 Chapter I Section Structure:
- Section I:   Chief Engineer (Para 1.38-1.41)
- Section II:  Regional Engineer Officers (Para 1.42-1.43)
- Section III: Superintending Engineers (Para 1.44-1.51)
- Section IV:  Superintendents of Works (Para 1.52) [DELETED]
- Section V:   Divisional Officers (Para 1.53-1.69)
- Section VI:  Sub-Divisional Officers (Para 1.70+)

Para 1.44 (Superintending Engineers):
"The administrative unit of the department is the Circle, in charge of a
Superintending Engineer who is responsible to the Regional Engineer Officers
for the administration and general professional control of Public Works in
charge of officers of the department within his Circle."

Para 1.53 (Divisional Officers):
"The executive unit of the Department is the division in charge of a divisional
officer who is usually an Executive Engineer and is responsible to the
superintending Engineer, for the execution and management of all works within
his Division."

2.3 VERIFICATION RESULT
-----------------------
✓ ACCURATE - 100% VERIFIED

The hierarchical position description is COMPLETELY ACCURATE:
- Superintending Engineer (Section III) is indeed the Circle head
- Superintendents of Works (Section IV) falls between Sections III and V
- Divisional Officer/Executive Engineer (Section V) is below Section IV
- Description of "administrative circle head" vs "field operational authority"
  is supported by BNR 1994's distinction between "administrative unit" (Circle)
  and "executive unit" (Division)

FINDING: NO ERRORS DETECTED

================================================================================
SECTION 3: CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION VERIFICATION
================================================================================

3.1 DELETION STATUS (Line 29)
-----------------------------
TARGET FILE CLAIM:
"Deleted from BNR 1994 without replacement provisions"

SOURCE VERIFICATION:
BNR 1994 Para 1.52 states only: "Deleted."
No replacement provisions or alternative text provided.

RESULT: ✓ ACCURATE

3.2 POSITION EXISTED IN EARLIER VERSIONS (Line 28)
--------------------------------------------------
TARGET FILE CLAIM:
"Position existed in earlier versions of BNR"

VERIFICATION STATUS:
Reference to "BNR-Code-1989" exists in the repository at:
/home/user/claude-code-task-4-Building-And-Road-Code/BNR-Code-1989

The claim is REASONABLE and SUPPORTED by:
- The fact that Para 1.52 was explicitly "Deleted" (not "Omitted" or absent)
- Deletion implies prior existence
- Section IV heading "SUPERINTENDENTS OF WORKS" remains in BNR 1994
- Reference to BNR-Code-1989 in document (line 1103)

RESULT: ✓ CONTEXTUALLY ACCURATE (Logical inference supported by evidence)

3.3 GAP CREATION (Line 30)
--------------------------
TARGET FILE CLAIM:
"Created gap between Superintending Engineer and Divisional Officer levels"

VERIFICATION:
This is an INTERPRETATIVE statement (analysis, not quotation) based on:
- Superintending Engineer at Circle level (administrative/supervisory)
- Divisional Officer at Division level (executive/implementation)
- No intermediate position between them after Para 1.52 deletion

RESULT: ✓ REASONABLE INTERPRETATION (Not a factual error)

3.4 DISTINCTION FROM SUPERINTENDING ENGINEER (Lines 43-46)
----------------------------------------------------------
TARGET FILE CLAIMS:
- Superintending Engineer: Administrative circle head (senior management)
- Superintendent of Works: Field operational authority (site execution)
- Complementary roles with clear functional separation

SOURCE SUPPORT:
Para 1.44: Superintending Engineer has "administration and general professional
control" (confirms administrative/management role)

Para 1.53: Divisional Officer has "execution and management of all works"
(confirms execution role exists at Division level)

RESULT: ✓ REASONABLE INTERPRETATION (Consistent with BNR 1994 terminology)
