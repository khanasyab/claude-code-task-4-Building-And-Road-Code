SECTION 7: KEY DEFINITIONS AND STANDARDS
================================================================================

RECOGNIZED CERTIFICATION PROGRAM
==================================
Definition per context: A certification program recognized by the jurisdiction
that demonstrates competence in building code administration and enforcement.

Standards referenced for certification bodies:
- IBC-24 (International Building Code)
- IMC-24 (International Mechanical Code)
- IPC-24 (International Plumbing Code)
- IFGC-24 (International Fuel Gas Code)


APPROVED AGENCY
================
Definition per context: An organization or entity that:
1. Demonstrates competence and relevant experience or training
2. Provides written documentation to building official
3. Performs special inspections and tests during construction
4. Maintains records of inspections and tests
5. Submits reports to building official and design professional


RELEVANT EXPERIENCE OR TRAINING
=================================
Per Section 1704.2.1, experience or training is relevant where:
1. Related in complexity to the same type of special inspection or testing
   activities
2. Projects of similar complexity
3. Projects of similar material qualities


REGISTERED DESIGN PROFESSIONAL
================================
Definition per context: A professional with legal authorization to perform
design and responsible charge activities, including:
1. Preparation of construction documents
2. Responsible charge of project design
3. Performance of structural observations
4. Preparation of statements of special inspections
5. Coordination of submittal items


================================================================================
SECTION 8: CRITICAL NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS
================================================================================

OPTIONAL VS. MANDATORY
=======================
Appendix A qualifications are OPTIONAL for jurisdictions unless specifically
referenced in the adopting ordinance. However:
- Many jurisdictions adopt these standards
- They represent professional best practices
- They establish baseline competency requirements

SUPERVISORY EXPERIENCE EMPHASIS
=================================
Both Building Official and Chief Inspector positions require 50% of experience
in supervisory capacity (5 of 10 years). This indicates:
- Management and administrative competency importance
- Personnel management experience expected
- Policy and procedure development experience needed

APPROPRIATE TRADE CERTIFICATION
=================================
For Chief Inspectors and Inspectors/Plans Examiners, certification must be "for
the appropriate trade," indicating:
- Specialized knowledge by discipline required
- One certification may not satisfy all roles
- Electrical, plumbing, mechanical, structural, etc. may require separate
  certifications

COMPETENCY DEMONSTRATION
==========================
For Special Inspectors (Section 1704.2.1):
- No specific test or examination required by IBC
- Must demonstrate competence through:
  * Written documentation
  * Relevant experience/training
  * Building official acceptance
- Allows flexibility in competency verification methods


PROFESSIONAL AUTONOMY FOR DESIGN PROFESSIONALS
===============================================
IBC 2024 permits registered design professionals to:
1. Act as approved agencies (Section 1704.2.1)
2. Act as special inspectors for work they designed
3. Perform structural observations (Section 1704.6)
4. Prepare statements of special inspections (Section 1704.3)

This recognizes design professional responsibility and accountability.
